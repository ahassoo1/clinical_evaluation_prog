DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, it’s… well, it’s blood. Coming up, you know? Not a pleasant thing to deal with, I’ll tell ya. Happened a couple times now, and it’s gettin’ old real fast. I don’t need a lecture on…well, anything, really. Just wanna know what’s wrong with me.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood, you say. And how long has this been occurring, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: About a week, give or take. Started kinda small, thought it was somethin’ I ate. But it’s…more now. Darker. And frankly, a bit worryin’. I don't usually bother with doctors, but this ain't goin' away on its own, is it? Honestly, I'm surprised it took this long to come in. My wife would’ve had me here the second it started. She always worried about everything.
DOCTOR: A week, and darker… Hmm. And where is this blood coming from, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Well, Doc, where do you think it’s comin’ from? It ain’t comin’ outta my ears. It’s… down there. Let’s just say, that way. I ain't gonna get graphic with you. It’s… unpleasant enough as it is. I'm a grown man, you don't need me to draw you a picture.
DOCTOR: Right. From the… lower gastrointestinal tract. Is it with bowel movements, or separate from them?
PATIENT: Separate, mostly. Sometimes a bit mixed in, but usually it’s… afterward. Look, I’m not one for details, okay? I just know it’s blood, it’s makin’ me weak, and frankly, I’m tired of dealin’ with it. I used to be a strong man, could work all day without a problem. Now? I get winded walkin’ up the stairs. Is it somethin' serious? Because I gotta tell ya, I ain't got time for a long haul with this.
DOCTOR: Weakness… alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits besides the blood?
PATIENT: Changes? What kinda changes? You gotta be more specific, Doc. I mean, it’s… well, it's poop. It’s always been… pretty regular, if that makes any sense. Maybe a little thinner lately, now that you mention it. And… harder to pass, sometimes. I figured it was somethin' I ate. I’ve been eatin’ a lot of… well, never mind what I’ve been eatin’. Point is, it’s been mostly normal, except for the blood part, which is anything but normal.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. We’ll need to perform a physical examination. And I'll order some lab work, of course. It’s standard procedure. Please, if you’ll just lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: A physical examination? Look, I’m not one for bein’ poked and prodded, Doc. Is there really no other way? I mean, can’t you just… give me somethin’ for it? I've been through enough. But fine. If I have to. Just…try to be quick, alright? And I'd appreciate a little warning before you…start.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, a proper examination is necessary. I cannot diagnose you without one. And yes, I will explain what I am doing before I do it. Now, please, lie down. We'll start with abdominal palpation. It will involve me pressing on your abdomen to check for tenderness or masses. It won’t be pleasant, but it’s essential.
PATIENT: Palpation? Masses? Honestly, Doc, you’re makin’ this sound worse and worse. Fine, fine. But if it gets…uncomfortable, I’m tellin’ ya, I'm gettin’ up. And don't expect me to be happy about it. Just… be gentle, alright? And tell me what you’re doin’ before you do it. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to press gently on your abdomen. Please inform me immediately if you experience any pain or discomfort. I’ll start on your right side. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ugh. Yeah, a little. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like you’re pushin’ on somethin’ that shouldn’t be pushed on. A bit lower, on the left side… yeah, that’s worse. Look, Doc, I’m not a doctor, but that don't feel right. You're diggin' around in there pretty good. Is this normal? .
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I understand your discomfort. It appears there is some tenderness in your lower abdomen. Now, I’m going to listen to your bowel sounds. Normal. Present, though somewhat… diminished. We’ll need a complete blood count and a stool sample for occult blood. The nurse will provide you with the necessary containers. I'll also order a chemistry panel. Standard procedure, Mr. Gentz. And frankly, given your symptoms and the tenderness I detected, I’m referring you to a gastroenterologist. It’s best to rule out anything serious.
