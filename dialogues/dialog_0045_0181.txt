DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Billman. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I requested a general wellness check, a full lab panel, if you will. Just wanted to get a comprehensive look at how things are functioning, you understand. At my age, one likes to be… proactive.
DOCTOR: Proactive, right. Well, a “full lab panel” can mean a lot of things, and honestly, at your age, most of those tests are just going to turn up something that doesn’t really need addressing. But, alright. We can do it. Let's start with the basics. Do you have any specific concerns bringing you in today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not specifically. Truly. I feel quite well, all things considered. It’s more a matter of… peace of mind. My wife, bless her heart, encouraged me to schedule it. She worries, you see. And a happy wife… well, you understand. But I appreciate you asking, of course. Is there a particular test you recommend everyone get at a certain age, regardless of feeling well?
DOCTOR: A happy wife… yes, I understand perfectly. Look, most doctors these days just run a standard CBC, CMP, lipid panel, and maybe a PSA for men. It's mostly to cover themselves legally, if I’m being honest. But since you're requesting a “comprehensive” look, we’ll do more. Let’s get a little background first. Any past medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Nothing terribly exciting, thankfully. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was quite young, perhaps eight years old, but fully recovered. And I broke my wrist – a rather clumsy fall from a mango tree, I must confess – when I was working construction in Venezuela, many years ago. That healed cleanly as well. Otherwise, I've been remarkably fortunate, I believe. I’ve always been very active, physical work mostly. Do you need details on those incidents? Dates, specific treatments, anything like that?
DOCTOR: No, no details necessary. Pneumonia as a child and a broken wrist… that’s hardly relevant now, is it?
PATIENT: Very well. I simply wanted to be thorough. You said you’ve been active with physical work… are you still doing construction currently? And if so, what sort of work? It’s important to understand your daily exertion levels, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Mombrun, I appreciate your… enthusiasm, but we don’t need a detailed job description. Are you currently engaged in strenuous physical activity, yes or no?
PATIENT: Well, that’s a rather direct question, Doctor. But, to answer truthfully, yes. I still work with a small crew, mostly residential remodeling. It’s not the heavy lifting of my younger days, mind you, but it certainly keeps me moving. Carpentry, tiling, that sort of thing. I find it keeps the mind sharp as well, you understand. But if you prefer a list of specific tasks… I can certainly provide one.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We'll note "residential remodeling." Now, any family history of heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, there is some family history. My father, on his side, passed away from a heart attack when he was in his early seventies. And my aunt, my mother's sister, was diagnosed with breast cancer in her late fifties. She recovered, thankfully, and lived another twenty years, but it was a difficult time. I believe my mother had elevated blood sugar levels later in life, but I don’t recall a formal diagnosis of diabetes. Is that sufficient information, or would you like further details?
DOCTOR: Okay, heart disease in father, breast cancer in aunt, possible elevated blood sugar in mother. Sufficient. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor, I assure you, my vices are limited to strong coffee and the occasional pastelito with my wife. No smoking, no alcohol, and certainly no recreational drugs. I’ve always believed in moderation, you see. Although, I do confess to a fondness for a good espresso after a long day’s work. Is that a cause for concern?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Mombrun, your coffee habit is not a cause for concern. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a daily multivitamin, for general health, you understand. And occasionally, when my knees act up after a particularly demanding day, I’ll take ibuprofen. Perhaps two or three times a month, nothing more. Other than that, no regular medications. Do you need to know the dosage of the ibuprofen, Doctor? I believe it’s the standard 200 milligram tablet.
DOCTOR: Multivitamin, occasional ibuprofen. Fine. Alright, let’s move on to allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe I have any significant allergies. I've never experienced a reaction to any medication or food. I’ve been fortunate in that regard. I do get a bit of a stuffy nose during pollen season, but that's hardly an allergy, you understand. Just a mild inconvenience. I've always been quite robust, thankfully. Is there anything specific you’re concerned about?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam then. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes. It won’t take long. Please, have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I’m quite comfortable with a physical exam. Please, do let me know if there is anything I can do to assist. And do feel free to ask if you require any further information from me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72, regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Everything seems… normal. For your age, anyway.
PATIENT: That’s reassuring to hear, Doctor. I do try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, you understand. It’s good to know that my efforts are paying off. The elevated blood pressure is something to keep an eye on, perhaps? Is there anything specific I should be doing to address that? Less salt, more exercise, that sort of thing? I'm happy to make adjustments if necessary.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Mombrun, you're asking a lot of questions. The blood pressure is slightly elevated, yes. We'll need to monitor it. I'll order a full lipid panel, CBC, CMP, and a PSA just to be thorough. We'll also do a urinalysis. That'll give us a better picture. In the meantime, yes, less salt, more exercise, and try to manage stress. But honestly, at your age, a little elevated blood pressure is often just… normal. We'll check back in a month with the results.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. A comprehensive approach is always best, I suppose. I appreciate you ordering the additional tests. And I shall certainly endeavor to reduce my salt intake and increase my exercise levels. Do you have any recommendations for stress management techniques? Perhaps a good book or a relaxing hobby? I’m always open to suggestions. And could you please let me know the details on how to schedule the follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: Look, I'm a doctor, not a life coach. Stress management is… personal. Find something you enjoy. As for the follow-up, the receptionist will contact you in a week to schedule an appointment when the results are back. I've ordered the tests; they'll be done at the lab across the street. Here. You'll need this. Anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate you ordering the additional tests and providing me with the necessary information. I shall visit the lab across the street as soon as possible. Have a good day, Doctor Billman. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. You too. Next. .
