DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're a new patient with us. Welcome to the practice. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, new…right. Uh, well, it’s just… the paperwork said I needed some lab work done? That’s all. Just trying to get that taken care of. I don’t really… remember why, to be honest. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: "Alright" isn't quite the word I'd use, sir. It is a bit concerning that you don’t recall why you’re scheduled for laboratory testing. It suggests a lapse in follow-up, or perhaps incomplete communication. However, we can certainly proceed. To ensure I have a complete picture, even if you don't recall specifics, let’s start with a brief overview of your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, I apologize. Things… slip my mind these days, you know? I used to work at the power plant… a long time ago. Big responsibility, that job. But… conditions? Hmm. Let me think. I think the doctor a while back mentioned something about my… cholesterol? Being a little high? But honestly, I don’t recall much detail. I’ve always been pretty… thin, though. As you can see.
DOCTOR: "Thin" doesn’t necessarily equate to healthy, sir. Elevated cholesterol is a significant concern, regardless of body weight. And the fact that you recall a previous mention but not specifics is… problematic. We'll need to verify that. Do you happen to remember the name of the physician who mentioned your cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I really don’t. It was… a long time ago. Different doctors, you know? I moved around a bit. It was in the city, I think? Or maybe… a suburb? Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. I mostly just remember filling out a lot of forms. Is there a way you can just… look it up? I’m not very good with names or dates.
DOCTOR: While we can attempt to retrieve previous records, that process can be quite lengthy, and frankly, reliant on the cooperation of other practices. It’s far more efficient – and accurate – if the patient can provide some basic information. However, given your difficulty recalling details, let's proceed with a comprehensive review of systems. It will help me build a clearer picture of your current health status. Starting with your cardiovascular system – have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, all those words… I mostly just try to take things easy now. Let me see… chest pain? No, not really. Shortness of breath? Sometimes, maybe, but I live on the third floor, you know? And I’m not as young as I used to be. Palpitations… that sounds fancy. Does that mean… my heart racing? I don’t think so. Swelling? My feet… maybe a little, sometimes. It’s hard to tell with these shoes.
DOCTOR: "Taking things easy" isn't a medical history, sir. We need concrete information. It's important to differentiate between normal age-related changes and potential underlying medical conditions. The shortness of breath, even if attributed to stairs, needs further investigation. And swelling in the feet can be indicative of several issues. Let's move on. Regarding your respiratory system – do you have any cough, wheezing, or difficulty breathing even without exertion?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is… a lot. Cough? Sometimes, just a little tickle in my throat. Wheezing… I don’t think so. Difficulty breathing… well, like I said, the stairs. But not… all the time. I mostly just sit and watch television. It’s a good life, mostly. But I do wish I remembered what the doctor said last time.
DOCTOR: Sir, with all due respect, "a good life" isn't a substitute for a medical assessment. Your lack of recall is hindering my ability to provide you with appropriate care. We are going to perform a basic physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Then, we will proceed with those lab tests, regardless of your recollection. Please sit back and relax. Let’s start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Blood pressure… yes. That sounds… sensible. It’s just… I don’t like being poked and prodded, you know? But, yes, alright. Let’s get it over with. Hopefully it won't take too long.
DOCTOR: Please, sit here on the examination table. I’ll assist you. It’s important we ensure your safety. Now, just relax your arm for me. 150/90. Elevated. As I suspected. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply through your mouth. Auscultation reveals some mild crackles in the lower lobes bilaterally. Not acute, but warrants further investigation. Now, I will check your peripheral pulses. Pulses are… diminished in the lower extremities. Also noted some 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. Sir, based on this preliminary exam, and your elevated blood pressure, there are several concerns that need to be addressed. We absolutely need to get those lab tests done. Specifically, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a B-type natriuretic peptide. Also, an EKG would be prudent.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… terrible. All those words again. B-type… what? And EKG? Is that… dangerous? I just wanted some lab work done, Doctor. Is this going to cost a lot of money? I'm on Medicare, you know. And I really don't remember being told about any of this before. .
DOCTOR: Sir, the tests are not dangerous. They are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms—or lack thereof, given your difficulty recalling information—and to ensure your health and safety. A B-type natriuretic peptide helps rule out heart failure, and an EKG measures the electrical activity of your heart. Medicare will cover these tests, as they are medically indicated. Your concern about cost is noted, but secondary to your well-being at this point. I understand you may not recall a previous discussion, but we cannot proceed without a thorough workup. I will order these tests immediately. The lab is just down the hall. The technician will explain the procedure. Once we have the results, we can formulate a treatment plan. Is that acceptable?
