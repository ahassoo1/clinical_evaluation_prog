DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I just… well, my wife and I were talking, and she insisted I get checked. For… you know. The HIV thing. Honestly, I think it's a bit unnecessary, but here I am. Better safe than sorry, I suppose. Though I highly doubt it'll be anything.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s always good to be proactive about your health, even if you don’t think it’s necessary. Your wife sounds like a sensible woman. So, just to clarify, you’re coming in today because of concern about potential HIV exposure?
PATIENT: Exposure? No, no, nothing like that. It's just… a precaution. We both have been… together for a long time. It’s just she reads things online, and then suddenly I’m the one who needs a test. Honestly, the internet is full of nonsense. But she worries, so… here I am getting poked and prodded. It's a waste of time, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your wife is concerned, and it’s good she’s encouraging you to be mindful of your health. Even without a specific exposure, routine screening can be beneficial. It’s a simple blood test, really. But let’s get a clearer picture of your overall health first. Have you had any other medical concerns recently?
PATIENT: Other concerns? No, not really. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. A little tired sometimes, work is stressful, you know? Compliance officer life isn’t glamorous. But nothing a bit of rest doesn’t fix. I had a check-up last year, everything was normal then. Honestly, I think she’s overreacting. A blood test for this… it just seems… excessive. Are you sure it’s necessary?
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, while you may feel perfectly healthy, and I appreciate that you had a check-up last year, screening guidelines do change. And your wife’s concern is valid. It’s better to rule things out than to worry unnecessarily. Besides a general check-up, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? No. Never. I’ve always been a healthy guy. Good genes, I think. My father lived to be eighty-five, and he worked in the fields his whole life. Strong man. No, I haven’t been diagnosed with anything. I don’t even take medication, except for the occasional headache pill if I’ve had a really long day dealing with paperwork. Honestly, I think you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. Is this something everyone has to do now?
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Hospitalized? Once, when I was a kid. Broke my arm falling out of a mango tree. That’s it. A simple fracture. They put a cast on it, and that was that. Nothing serious. Look, I’m telling you, I’m a healthy man. I eat reasonably well, I get enough sleep when I can, and I don’t go around doing reckless things. This whole thing feels like a waste of my time, and frankly, your time too. Are you required to do this test, even if I don’t want it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I understand your frustration, and I assure you I’m not trying to waste your time. However, as a physician, I have a responsibility to ensure my patients are aware of potential health risks and have appropriate screening tests performed. Now, regarding your family history… has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Serious conditions? Well… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… something with her lungs. She smoked a lot, you see. Terrible habit. She passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t remember the specifics. And my uncle, he had high blood pressure, I think. But that’s about it. No one else that I can recall. A bit of arthritis here and there, but nothing major. Honestly, we don’t talk much about health things. It’s considered… unlucky to dwell on those matters. So, this lung thing and the blood pressure… is that enough to warrant all of this? I really think my wife is exaggerating.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever used recreational drugs, or had any significant risk behaviors that might put you at risk for infectious diseases?
PATIENT: Risk behaviors? Doctor, are you implying something? I am a married man, a responsible compliance officer! I don’t engage in… risky behavior. I have never touched a drug in my life. I occasionally have a beer with dinner, that’s it. This is becoming quite insulting, frankly. I came here to appease my wife, not to be interrogated about my personal life. I don’t understand why you need to know all of this. Is this standard procedure for every patient? It feels… invasive.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I apologize if my questions are making you uncomfortable. I assure you, I am not trying to be insulting or invasive. I am simply gathering information to assess your overall health risk and determine the appropriate course of action. It is standard procedure to ask about social history, as it can provide valuable insights into potential health concerns. Now, let's move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. I eat everything. Spicy food, peanuts, shellfish… doesn't bother me. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. See? Perfectly healthy. This is all just a waste of time. My wife is going to be thrilled when I tell her how unnecessary this whole thing was. Honestly, I think I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon sitting here answering pointless questions. Can we just get this over with? Is the blood test the only thing you're going to do?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. Since you report no allergies and appear generally healthy, we will proceed with the HIV test as your wife requested. I also recommend a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count just for a general overview. It's a standard procedure, and it will give us a more comprehensive picture of your health. Now, I'm going to need to draw a small sample of blood. Are you alright with that?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. The quicker this is done, the quicker I can get back to my life. And please, no more questions. I've answered enough for one day. Just the blood test, right? Nothing else?
DOCTOR: Yes, just the blood test and the basic panel. Please have a seat in the chair and extend your arm. The phlebotomist will be in shortly. I will review the results as soon as they are available and will contact you to discuss them.
PATIENT: Fine.
