DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It’s really bothering me, you know? Not all over, but mostly on my arms and back. It just...itches. It’s been going on for a couple of weeks now, I think. Maybe a little longer.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Itchy skin can be very disruptive. A couple of weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about that long. It comes and goes, but it's definitely more frequent now. It doesn't really seem to matter what I'm wearing, or what I've been doing. I just wake up with it sometimes, or it starts in the middle of the day. It’s not…painful, just really annoying. And I find myself scratching a lot, which I know I shouldn't do.
DOCTOR: Right, scratching can make it worse. And you said it’s mostly on your arms and back, but is it anywhere else as well?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. It might be a little bit on my legs, but it’s not nearly as bad as my arms and back. It's hard to say for sure. Sometimes I feel it all over, but then I realize it's just my mind playing tricks on me, you know? Old age, maybe! But yeah, mostly arms and back.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to pinpoint. And it's good you're aware of that possibility. Have you noticed any changes to your skin besides the itch?
PATIENT: Changes? Like...rashes or bumps? No, not really. It just looks…normal. Maybe a little dry, but I always use lotion. Nothing red or swollen, thankfully. I've been looking, trying to see if anything looks different, but it just seems…regular skin that’s really itchy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And you do use lotion regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Every day, after my shower. Usually just a basic one, nothing fancy. I’ve been using the same brand for years, actually. I didn't change anything recently, so that's not it, I don't think. I haven't started using a new soap or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, have you had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: Hmm…you know, I think so. Maybe when I was younger? It’s hard to remember exactly. It wasn’t this long though, and I think it went away on its own. I just used some cream, I think. Nothing serious. It’s been a long time, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s perfectly alright. And just to get a better picture, can you tell me about any other medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I have a little bit of high blood pressure, but it's usually pretty well controlled with medication. And I had my gallbladder removed years ago, but that hasn't bothered me since. Other than that…not much, really. I try to stay healthy! I had arthritis in my knees for a while, but it's not too bad these days. And…oh! I had pneumonia a few years back, but that was just one time. Nothing chronic, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. High blood pressure, gallbladder removal, some arthritis, and a past case of pneumonia. Are you currently taking any medications for your high blood pressure or arthritis?
PATIENT: Yes, I take a little pill for my blood pressure every morning. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees when they really bother me, but not very often. Mostly just when I've been walking a lot. I don't take anything regularly for the arthritis, just the ibuprofen when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything! I haven't had any bad reactions to anything in a long time, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong stomach, and I think she was right. I've never had to go to the hospital for an allergic reaction or anything like that.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, to get a better sense of what might be going on, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course! Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be…uncomfortable. I’m an old lady, so my skin is a little thin!
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll be very gentle. I'm just going to take a look at your arms and back, and maybe a few other areas. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, I'm not seeing any obvious rashes or lesions. Your skin is a little dry, as you mentioned, and it feels slightly warmer than expected. No significant swelling or tenderness.
PATIENT: Oh, good. That’s good to know it’s not anything obvious. A little dry is nothing, I suppose. I do live in Florida, so it's always humid, but the air conditioning can really dry you out, you know? So, what do you think it is, Doctor? Is it something serious? I'm always a little worried when things start itching…it just feels…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It's good we've ruled out some of the more obvious causes. Given your history and the physical exam, a few things could be going on. It could be simple dry skin exacerbated by the air conditioning, as you mentioned. Sometimes, itching can also be related to underlying medical conditions, or even be a side effect of medications. And occasionally, it can be related to your nerves. Because you're on Lisinopril, it's worth considering that as a potential cause, though it's not common. To be sure, and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order some basic blood work. This will help us check your liver and kidney function, as well as look for any signs of inflammation or other underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, blood work…well, I suppose if you think it's necessary. It's just…I don't really like needles. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. If it will help figure out what’s going on, then yes, let’s do it. Just…go easy on me, okay? And will it take long? I have a bingo game tonight, you see!
DOCTOR: Of course, we'll go as easy as possible. The blood draw shouldn't take more than a few minutes, and the phlebotomist is very experienced. I'll write the order now. It will likely take a day or two to get the results back. Here's the requisition form. You can take this to the lab, which is just down the hall. They’ll draw a few vials of blood. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and figure out the best course of action. In the meantime, I’d recommend continuing to use a good moisturizer several times a day, and try to avoid scratching as much as possible. Do you have any questions about the blood work or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That sounds…reasonable. Moisturizer and try not to scratch. Easy for you to say! And the lab is down the hall, you said? That’s good. I can probably manage that. Thank you, Doctor Andraca. You've been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I was starting to worry a little. I think that’s all I need for now. Unless you want to check my bingo card while you’re at it?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. And while I'm a doctor, not a bingo expert, I wish you the best of luck tonight! Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. Have a wonderful evening, and I hope you win big!
