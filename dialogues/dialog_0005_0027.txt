DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, let’s not waste time. It’s this… stuff coming back up. Burning, you know? Happens mostly after I eat. Not a pleasant feeling, I assure you. And it’s been going on for… well, a while now. I really don’t have time for this, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “A while now,” isn’t terribly helpful, sir. We need specifics if I’m going to… assist you. How long exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Fine. Maybe… six months? Seven? It all kinda blurs together. I eat, and then… it happens. It's not like it's every meal, but enough to be annoying. And frankly, a man my age shouldn’t be dealing with this. I eat sensible things, mostly. Not like those youngsters and their… fast food. Honestly.
DOCTOR: “Sensible things.” Right. And what exactly are these sensible things, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Well, meat. Fish. Potatoes. Vegetables. Normal food! Not that… spicy garbage everyone seems to love these days. I had a steak last night, a nice cut, and… well, you can guess what happened afterwards. It's just… it's not right. A good steak shouldn’t cause problems. You’d think. And don't tell me it's my diet, I’ve been eating like this my whole life!
DOCTOR: So, it's primarily after eating meat and fish?
PATIENT: Mostly. Though sometimes even… a simple tomato sauce will do it. It’s ridiculous. And it's not just after eating, sometimes it’s… during. A little bit, you know? It's embarrassing, really. A man shouldn't have to explain these things. Are you writing all this down? I hope so, because I'm not repeating myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, sir, I’m documenting everything. “Burning sensation, episodic, associated with meat, fish, and tomato-based products.” Anything else accompanying this… discomfort?
PATIENT: Well, sometimes a little bit of… well, a sour taste. Like something’s gone bad. And it makes my chest feel… tight. Not like a heart attack, mind you, but… uncomfortable. And sometimes, if I lie down too soon after eating, it’s worse. It just… comes up easier, you know? It’s all very unpleasant. I really don’t see what’s so hard to understand about it. A man eats his dinner and expects it to stay down. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Chest tightness… and the sour taste. Okay. Have you noticed any weight loss recently, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. Absolutely not. If anything, I’ve gained a little around the middle. Nothing to write home about, but certainly not losing weight. I eat a good breakfast, a good lunch, and a good dinner. I’m a practical man, Doc, I take care of myself. This isn't some… wasting disease. It's just… this indigestion. Honestly. What do you think it is? Some sort of… stomach bug? Or is it my age finally catching up to me? Though I refuse to believe that.
DOCTOR: Well, sir, with your… build, and the description you've given, it could be a number of things. We need to rule a few things out. Have you ever had an endoscopy?
PATIENT: An… what now? An endo-whatsit? Look, I’m a practical man, I don’t need fancy procedures. Is that going to involve sticking a camera down my throat? Because I’m not particularly keen on that. I just want a pill, something to settle my stomach. I don't want to be poked and prodded and have things shoved where they don’t belong. Is there not something simpler we can try? Honestly, doctors these days… always with the complicated solutions.
DOCTOR: An endoscopy allows us to visualize the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to identify any inflammation or structural abnormalities. It’s the most definitive way to determine the cause of your symptoms. However, we can try a trial of a proton pump inhibitor – a medication to reduce stomach acid – and see if that provides some relief. But, sir, if your symptoms persist, an endoscopy will be necessary. Are you currently taking any other medications?
PATIENT: A proton… what? Look, just give me the pill. I’ll try it. But I'm telling you now, if it doesn't work, I’m not sticking anything down my throat. As for other medications… just a little something for my blood pressure. Nothing fancy. A small dose. Doctor Kowalski prescribed it. He's a good doctor, sensible. Unlike… some. Now, what’s the name of this… proton pill? And how many do I take? I have things to do, you know. I can't be wasting all day with this.
DOCTOR: It’s called Omeprazole. 20 milligrams, once daily, before breakfast. Take it for two weeks. If your symptoms don’t improve significantly after that, we’ll need to discuss further investigation. And sir, it’s important to follow up. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any. Sensible diet, sensible life. Now, two weeks… I can remember that. Before breakfast. Fine. Look, Doc, I appreciate you… trying to help. But frankly, I'm not one for doctors. I only come when absolutely necessary. So, let's hope this pill works. Otherwise… well, I'm not sure I'll bother with all this again. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have a garden to tend to. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. If your symptoms worsen or do not improve within two weeks, please schedule a follow-up appointment. Have a good day. .
