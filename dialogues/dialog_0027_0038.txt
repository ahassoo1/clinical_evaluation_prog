DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Um… honestly, it’s a bit difficult to recall precisely. I believe… I was advised to inquire about some forms? Something to do with… future care, should I become unable to speak for myself. It was suggested I ask about an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form. I apologize for my vagueness; my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, that’s… perfectly alright. It’s very thoughtful of you to consider those things. Advance Directives and POLST forms… they're important documents. To clarify, are you experiencing any current health concerns that prompted this thought, or is this more of a proactive step?
PATIENT: No, no current concerns, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of, at least. It’s… preventative, I suppose. A friend – or someone, I can’t quite place who – mentioned it’s best to have these things settled before anything arises. I don’t want to be a burden, and I’d like my wishes to be known, even if… if I’m unable to express them myself. I hope that makes sense. It's rather unsettling to think about, truthfully.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Evann. It's very responsible of you, and honestly, a lot of people don't think about these things until it’s… well, until it’s more urgent. Let's talk about both of these forms, briefly. An Advance Directive outlines your overall wishes for care, while a POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is more specific, detailing what treatments you do or do not want if you were seriously ill. Before we get into the specifics, do you have a primary care physician I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, that clarifies things somewhat, thank you. The distinction is helpful. And… a primary care physician? Let me see… I believe I had one in the city, but… the name escapes me. I relocated here fairly recently, you see. It was a rather abrupt move. I haven’t fully established myself, if that makes sense. I’ve been… focusing on my work. Etching, mostly. I don't think I've seen a doctor regularly in quite some time. I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Evann. It’s perfectly alright. Starting fresh can be… disorienting. We can certainly proceed without that information for now. Let’s focus on your wishes, then. Do you have any strong feelings about things like CPR, mechanical ventilation, or artificial nutrition if you were facing a serious illness with a limited chance of recovery?
PATIENT: Oh… those sound… rather intense. I hadn’t considered specifics, truthfully. I… I suppose I would want everything done to preserve my life, if there was a reasonable chance of recovery. But… I’m also very wary of prolonged suffering. I wouldn't want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of regaining… quality of life. It’s a difficult line, isn’t it? I… I’m not sure I can articulate my wishes very clearly. Is there a way to… perhaps write it down? Or to discuss scenarios? I feel rather overwhelmed trying to imagine these things.
DOCTOR: You're not overwhelmed at all, Evann. These are difficult conversations, and it's perfectly normal to feel unsure. Writing things down is an excellent idea, and we can certainly walk through some scenarios. We have some forms here that can help guide you, with prompts for different situations. Before we get to those, let's quickly review your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… difficult. I truly don’t recall. I had a rather… tumultuous childhood, and medical records weren’t… prioritized. I remember a broken arm when I was quite young, and perhaps… perhaps tonsillitis. Nothing serious, I don't believe. I’ve always been relatively healthy, despite… everything. I’m afraid I can’t offer much in the way of specifics. I apologize again. My memory is truly fragmented. Is it… crucial to have this information? Perhaps we can focus on my current state, and my wishes for the future?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Evann. We can certainly focus on your current state and wishes. Knowing the past can be helpful, but it’s not always essential. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I… I don’t believe so. I’ve never experienced a severe reaction to anything. I enjoy a rather simple diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. I occasionally have herbal tea, but nothing unusual. No known allergies, Doctor. I’m fairly certain of that. Though… I did have a strange rash once, after handling a particular type of dye for my etching… but I don’t think that qualifies as a true allergy. It cleared up quickly.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in… natural remedies, mostly. And… I haven't really needed anything. I've been quite fortunate, health-wise. I do occasionally take vitamin D supplements during the winter months, as the light is… limited here, but that’s the extent of it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Evann. No current medications or allergies. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment. It’s fairly standard, and it will help me understand your overall health better. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. A baseline assessment is a good idea. Please, proceed. I apologize if I seem… hesitant. I’m simply not accustomed to discussing these things. I’ve always preferred to focus on my work, and… avoided medical attention when possible. But I understand the importance of being thorough. Please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. No need to apologize at all. Just relax, and I’ll explain everything as we go. First, I'll check your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please, proceed. I trust your expertise. I’m… ready when you are. Although, I must confess, I always feel a little… anxious during medical examinations. It’s a rather irrational fear, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Evann. It’s very common to feel anxious during examinations. Just try to relax, and take a few deep breaths. Your blood pressure is 118 over 72. That’s a good reading. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes… very well. Proceed as you see fit, Doctor. I am… cooperating as much as possible. It’s just… a little unnerving, being examined so thoroughly. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a very long time. Perhaps that’s why. But I appreciate your… gentle approach. It’s… reassuring.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Now, I’m going to briefly examine your throat and ears. Just open your mouth and say "ah." Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Ears appear normal. Alright, Evann. Everything appears to be within normal limits. Given your history of no major medical issues and a normal examination, we can proceed with discussing the Advance Directive and POLST form. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… excellent. I’m relieved to hear everything appears normal. And yes, let’s proceed with the forms. I’m eager to… get this settled, if possible. Perhaps we could start with the Advance Directive? It seems… less urgent than the POLST form, given my current state. Though, I confess, I’m still a little confused about the specifics. Could you perhaps explain it in… simpler terms? I don't want to make any hasty decisions without fully understanding what I'm signing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s a very sensible approach. The Advance Directive, sometimes called a living will, is essentially a document where you outline your wishes for medical care if you were unable to speak for yourself. It covers things like whether or not you want life-sustaining treatments, such as a ventilator or feeding tube. It also allows you to name a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to do so. Think of it as… a roadmap for your care, ensuring your wishes are respected, no matter what. We'll go through it section by section, and I’ll explain everything in plain language. There's no pressure to answer anything you’re not comfortable with. Shall we start with the section on naming your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… manageable. Naming a healthcare proxy… that seems like a logical first step. This is… a little daunting, truthfully. I don't have many close relatives, and… my friends are scattered. I'm not sure who I would trust with such a… weighty responsibility. Is it possible to… leave it blank for now? Perhaps I could consider it later, after I’ve had more time to think? I don’t want to name someone impulsively, and then regret it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's perfectly alright to leave it blank for now. There's no rush at all. Choosing a healthcare proxy is a very important decision, and it's best to take your time and choose someone you truly trust and who understands your values. You can always add it later, once you’ve had more time to think. We can move on to the next section, which outlines your general wishes for medical care. It asks questions about things like pain management, resuscitation, and artificial nutrition. We can discuss each question individually, and you can tell me what’s important to you. Shall we start with this one?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… preferable. Starting with the questions… that feels less overwhelming. "Would you want to receive aggressive medical treatment to prolong your life, even if it meant experiencing significant pain or discomfort?"… That’s… a difficult question. I suppose… I would want to be made comfortable, above all else. I wouldn’t want to be kept alive in a state of constant suffering. But… is there a middle ground? Is it possible to specify what kind of aggressive treatment I would or wouldn't want? For instance, I wouldn’t object to pain medication, but… I’m wary of prolonged intubation. I hope that makes sense. I'm trying to be as precise as possible, but… it's all rather abstract.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Evann. You're absolutely right to think about specifics. There is a space to add clarifying notes on this form, and we can certainly do that. You can specify which treatments you would or wouldn't want, and under what circumstances. It's your document, and it should reflect your wishes as accurately as possible. So, you would want to receive treatment to prolong your life, but with a strong emphasis on pain management and comfort. You're wary of prolonged intubation. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is… remarkably accurate. "With a strong emphasis on pain management and comfort" is… precisely what I want to convey. And yes, the intubation… I’ve seen it happen, and… it doesn’t look dignified. I suppose… I would want to avoid it if possible. Unless… unless there was a reasonable chance of recovery. But even then, I would want to be fully informed, and… consulted every step of the way. It’s difficult to articulate, isn’t it? I’m trying to balance my desire to live with my… fear of suffering. I apologize for rambling. This is… a lot to process.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Evann. You're expressing your wishes very clearly, and it's perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed. Balancing the desire to live with the fear of suffering is a very common concern, and it's good that you're thinking about these things. Let’s write that down. “Patient desires treatment to prolong life, with strong emphasis on pain management and comfort. Avoid prolonged intubation unless there is a reasonable chance of full recovery, and patient is fully informed and consulted.” Is that a fair representation of your wishes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is… perfect. “Perfectly” captures it. Thank you for… translating my rambling into something coherent. It’s… a relief to see it written down. Perhaps… perhaps we could move on to the next question now? The one about… artificial nutrition? I confess, I haven't given much thought to that. I enjoy food, but… I don’t have strong feelings either way, I suppose. Though… I wouldn't want to be kept alive indefinitely in a vegetative state. I hope that clarifies things. It's just… a difficult concept to contemplate.
DOCTOR: You're doing very well, Evann. It’s perfectly alright to not have strong feelings about everything. And you’ve clarified things beautifully. Okay, let's look at the question about artificial nutrition. It asks if you would want to receive nutrition and hydration through a feeding tube or IV if you were unable to eat or drink on your own. Given your wish to not be kept alive indefinitely in a vegetative state, would you prefer to decline artificial nutrition if there was no reasonable hope of recovery?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that feels right. If there was no reasonable hope of recovery… I would prefer to decline artificial nutrition. I wouldn't want to be kept alive artificially, without any quality of life. It seems… undignified, to prolong suffering unnecessarily. Please, write that down. And… thank you for being so patient with me. This is… a difficult conversation, but you've made it… manageable. I feel… less anxious now.
DOCTOR: “Patient declines artificial nutrition if there is no reasonable hope of recovery.” You’re very welcome, Evann. I’m glad I could help. You're handling this very well, and you're expressing your wishes clearly and thoughtfully. We've covered the essential sections of the Advance Directive. Would you like me to review everything with you before you sign it, or would you prefer to take some time to consider it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a review would be… helpful. I appreciate you offering. It’s always good to… double-check, to ensure I haven’t overlooked anything. And to… confirm that everything accurately reflects my wishes. Please, proceed with the review. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, let’s start with the first section: your healthcare proxy. You’ve left this blank for now, which is perfectly fine. You can add someone later if you choose. Next, we have your wishes regarding aggressive medical treatment. You’ve indicated that you want treatment to prolong your life, with a strong emphasis on pain management and comfort. You’re wary of prolonged intubation unless there’s a reasonable chance of full recovery, and you want to be fully informed and consulted. Then, we have your wishes regarding artificial nutrition. You’ve indicated that you would decline artificial nutrition if there was no reasonable hope of recovery. Does that accurately summarize your wishes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… a remarkably accurate summary. You’ve captured everything perfectly. It’s… a relief to hear it articulated so clearly. It confirms that I haven’t overlooked anything, and that my wishes are… properly documented. It feels… empowering, to have this settled. Thank you. Perhaps… perhaps we could move on to the POLST form now? If you think I’m up to it, that is. I don’t want to… overwhelm you.
DOCTOR: You’re not overwhelming me at all, Evann. You’re doing wonderfully. And yes, let’s move on to the POLST form. It’s a bit more specific than the Advance Directive, so it might feel a little more daunting, but we’ll take it one step at a time. The POLST form focuses on your immediate medical wishes, in case you’re unable to speak for yourself in a crisis. It asks questions about things like CPR, intubation, and artificial nutrition. Essentially, it translates your overall wishes from the Advance Directive into actionable orders for medical professionals. The first question is about CPR. Would you want to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation if your heart stopped beating?
PATIENT: CPR… that’s… a difficult one. I suppose… I’ve always assumed I would want it, if possible. But… I’ve also seen it happen, and… it doesn’t always work. And it looks… traumatic. Is there a middle ground? Is it possible to specify under what circumstances I would want CPR? For instance, if my prognosis was… poor, I wouldn’t want it prolonged unnecessarily. I don’t want to be kept alive artificially if there’s no reasonable chance of recovery. But… if there was a chance, even a small one, I suppose I would want it attempted. It's just… so complicated.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is complicated. And it’s perfectly reasonable to want to specify the circumstances under which you would want CPR. On this form, we can check a box that says “Attempt CPR if appropriate,” which means medical professionals will assess your situation and attempt CPR if it’s likely to be successful. We can also check a box that says “Do Not Attempt CPR,” or “Discuss.” Given your wishes, perhaps “Discuss” is the best option for now. That would allow medical professionals to assess your situation and have a conversation with your healthcare proxy if you’re unable to speak for yourself. Does that sound like a reasonable approach?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. “Discuss” sounds… sensible. It allows for flexibility, and ensures that my wishes are taken into account. It’s better than a blanket “yes” or “no,” I think. Perhaps… perhaps we could move on to the next question now? The one about intubation? I confess, that’s… something I’m particularly wary of. I wouldn’t want to be kept alive on a ventilator indefinitely, without any quality of life.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The next question is about intubation. Would you want to receive mechanical ventilation if you were unable to breathe on your own?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I do not want to receive mechanical ventilation, unless it’s… a temporary measure. If my prognosis is… poor, and there’s no reasonable chance of recovery, I would not want to be kept alive on a ventilator. It wouldn’t be a life worth living, I think. I wouldn't want to prolong suffering unnecessarily. Please, write that down. And… thank you for being so patient with me. This is… a difficult conversation, but you've made it… manageable. It’s… a relief to finally put my wishes into words.
DOCTOR: “Patient declines mechanical ventilation if prognosis is poor and there is no reasonable chance of recovery.” You’re very welcome, Evann. You are handling this incredibly well, and you’ve expressed your wishes very clearly. We’ve covered the essential sections of the POLST form. Would you like me to review everything with you before you sign it, or would you prefer to take some time to consider it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a review would be… helpful. It’s always good to… double-check, to ensure I haven’t overlooked anything. And to… confirm that everything accurately reflects my wishes. Please, proceed with the review.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, let’s start with the first question: CPR. You’ve checked the “Discuss” box, which means medical professionals will assess your situation and have a conversation with your healthcare proxy if you’re unable to speak for yourself. Next, we have your wishes regarding mechanical ventilation. You’ve indicated that you do not want to receive mechanical ventilation if your prognosis is poor and there is no reasonable chance of recovery. Does that accurately summarize your wishes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… a remarkably accurate summary. You’ve captured everything perfectly. It’s… a relief to hear it articulated so clearly. It confirms that I haven’t overlooked anything, and that my wishes are… properly documented. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you. Truly, thank you. You’ve been… incredibly patient and understanding. I feel… a great deal more at ease now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. I’m glad I could help. It takes courage to think about these things, and you’ve done a wonderful job. Please, take your time. And if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask. Once you've signed them, I’ll make copies for your records and ensure they’re placed in your chart. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything. You’ve been incredibly thorough and helpful. I… I don’t think I need anything else at the moment. Thank you again. Truly. I feel… a weight has been lifted. It’s… a relief to have this settled. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I think… I think I’ll go home now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. I’m glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the future. Have a good day, and take care of yourself. .
