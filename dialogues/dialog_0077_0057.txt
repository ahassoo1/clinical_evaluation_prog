DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Chellsea. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you too. Well… it’s about the cancer. I was told to come speak with someone.
DOCTOR: I see. Cancer… alright. And could you tell me a little more about that, Chellsea?
PATIENT: Um… it’s in my… well, the tests said it was in my chest. I don’t really know much more than that, to be honest. My husband… he handled most of the talking with the other doctors. And… he’s gone now.
DOCTOR: I understand. That must be incredibly difficult, dealing with this news and everything else at the same time. It’s perfectly alright if you’re unsure of the details. We can go through everything together. Just to be clear – you were informed of a diagnosis of cancer in your chest… and this was relatively recent?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Recent… maybe two months ago? It all feels a bit blurry, if I’m being honest. They did… scans, and a biopsy, I think. And then they said… cancer. I mostly just remember a lot of people talking at me.
DOCTOR: I see. That is… understandably overwhelming. It sounds like a lot to process. Would you mind if I quickly check your electronic health record to see the specifics of the scans and biopsy results?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please do. That would be very helpful. I… I don't remember all the medical words they used. Anything you can explain to me simply would be wonderful.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s see… Chellsea Luft, date of birth… yes. Okay, it appears you had a chest X-ray and CT scan on June 2nd, 2025, followed by a biopsy of a lesion in your left lung on June 15th. The pathology report indicates… non-small cell lung cancer. Stage 1B. Now, I realize that’s probably a lot of terminology. Essentially, it means a tumor was found in your lung. Stage 1B indicates it’s relatively small and hasn’t spread to other parts of your body. Do you… follow me so far?
PATIENT: Lung cancer… yes, I think I remember something about that. And… Stage 1B… is that… good? I don't understand all those numbers and words. Hasn't spread… that sounds good, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Chellsea, Stage 1B is generally considered a more favorable stage. It means the cancer is localized, and there’s a good chance we can treat it effectively. It doesn't mean it’s not serious, but it’s certainly better than if it had spread. Now, the report also indicates you are a non-smoker. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he tried it once or twice, a long time ago, but he quit. It was… surprising when they said it was lung cancer. I always thought… it was something smokers got.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to be surprised, Chellsea. While smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, it can happen to anyone. Other factors, like exposure to radon gas, air pollution, and, in some cases, genetic predisposition, can also contribute. It’s unfortunately not always linked to smoking. Now, the report also mentions a PET scan was ordered, but not yet completed. Have you scheduled that scan yet?
PATIENT: A PET scan…? No, I don’t think so. I haven’t scheduled anything else. After… after my husband passed, everything got very… confusing. I just kept going to appointments when they told me to.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Chellsea. Losing your husband would be incredibly difficult, and it's perfectly alright if things feel overwhelming right now. The PET scan is important, as it helps us determine if the cancer has spread to any other parts of your body. It's a full-body scan. Let's schedule that scan first thing. And then, we can discuss treatment options. The standard treatment for Stage 1B non-small cell lung cancer is usually surgery to remove the affected portion of the lung. But, we need to confirm the staging with the PET scan before we can make any firm plans. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Surgery… Yes, that sounds… okay. If that’s what’s best. But… will it be a big surgery? And… how long will I be in the hospital? I don’t have… I don’t have family nearby to help. My husband… he always took care of everything.
DOCTOR: It is a significant surgery, Chellsea, but it's often very successful, especially at Stage 1B. Typically, it involves removing the lobe of the lung where the tumor is located, and the length of your hospital stay is usually around five to seven days, depending on your recovery. Now, regarding support after surgery, that's something we can definitely address. Do you have any friends nearby who might be able to help, even with small tasks?
PATIENT: No… not really. I mostly kept to myself, and my husband… he had his work friends, but… they wouldn’t know what to do. I’m not sure I know what I’d need. Could… could the hospital help? With someone to… check on me, maybe? After I go home?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chellsea. We have a wonderful social work department here at the clinic. They can help you arrange for home healthcare services, assistance with meals, transportation, and even emotional support. They can also connect you with community resources and support groups. Let’s get them involved right away. They can schedule a consultation with you before your surgery to discuss your needs and create a plan. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… a great help. I… I don’t know what I’d do without someone to help. And… the PET scan… when can we schedule that?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let me see… we have an opening on August 7th. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: August 7th… yes, that should be fine. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very kind. I feel a little less scared now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. It’s my job to help you through this. We’ll take things one step at a time. Now, I’m going to have my nurse schedule the PET scan for August 7th and have the social worker reach out to you. They'll discuss your needs and answer any questions you have. Before we finish, do you have any allergies or medications you’re currently taking that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. And… no medications. I haven’t needed anything, until now, I suppose. I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Pirl.
DOCTOR: Very well, Chellsea. I will see you on August 7th. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. It was lovely meeting you.
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you as well, Doctor. Thank you. Goodbye.
