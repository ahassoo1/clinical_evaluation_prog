DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Look, I don't usually bother with doctors unless it’s… necessary. It’s just, well, my sister, she’s always sending cards. “Get Well Soon!” when I’m perfectly fine. I just want a note from you saying I’m… healthy. For her. You understand? It’s a… formality.
DOCTOR: A note, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! A note. Saying I am… in good condition. Perfectly capable. No need for sympathy cards. She means well, but… it’s a bit much, you know? She treats me like I’m made of glass. A little piece of paper from a professional might help. You have paper, yes?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, I am a physician. I do not simply write notes to appease family members. A proper medical evaluation is required to determine your health status. Now, let's begin. Do you have any current complaints?
PATIENT: Complaints? No! That's what I'm telling you! I don’t have complaints. I came here for a… confirmation. A letter. Are you saying you won't write a simple note? I have Medicare. I thought that covered… things like this.
DOCTOR: Medicare, sir, covers medically necessary procedures and evaluations, not the fulfillment of familial anxieties. I will perform a brief examination, and if I find no abnormalities, I will document my findings. That is the extent of what I am willing to provide. Now, have you experienced any recent weight loss, fever, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. I always eat well. Maybe… a little less rice lately, but that's just because… well, I was trying to watch my figure. Night sweats? Sometimes. It gets warm, you know? August. But everyone sweats in August! Are you going to ask about everything now? This is ridiculous. Just write the note. It’s a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration. However, I cannot ethically provide a medical opinion without gathering some basic information. A slight change in appetite, even attributed to watching one’s “figure,” and reports of night sweats, however minor, warrant a few questions. Please, have a seat. We will start with a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions—diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, anything at all?
PATIENT: Look, I used to work with boilers, okay? Big boilers. Powerful machines. I had to be strong, healthy. No room for… weakness. Doctors never found anything wrong. I haven’t been to one in… years. And I don’t have any conditions! Just… normal aches and pains. Old age, you know? Is this going to take long? I have things to do. And frankly, I’m not comfortable sitting on that table. It looks… cold.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, dismissing potential health concerns as simply “old age” is…unproductive. And yes, the table is standard examination equipment. It’s hardly a comfort station. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Once. When I was a boy. Chickenpox. A long time ago! That's it! Nothing else. This is getting… insulting, you know? Are you suggesting I'm… sick? I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly fine. I came here for a letter, not an interrogation. I feel like I'm being treated like a… child. Honestly. Just write down, “Early Kammer is in good health,” and we can be done with this. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, a blanket statement of “good health” without even a basic assessment is irresponsible. I will not compromise my professional integrity simply to satisfy your sister’s concerns. Now, let's move on. Do you take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? No! Absolutely not! I don't need medications! I take care of myself. A little bit of fish oil sometimes, for the… joints. But that’s it! Nothing serious. This is… unbelievable. Are you a real doctor? You seem more interested in… arguing than helping. I’m starting to regret coming here. A simple note, that’s all I asked for! Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, your insistence on dismissing a proper medical evaluation is frankly, concerning. Before I proceed further, I need to understand your height and weight. I see it listed here, but I need to verify. Please step on the scale. It’s a standard procedure. And then we can at least proceed with a basic physical assessment, and then I can determine if a note is appropriate. Now, please, the scale is right over there. It won't bite.
PATIENT: You want to weigh me? After all this? You think I've gained weight? I told you, I watch my figure! This is… a personal question! I don't need you judging my weight! It’s… rude. And frankly, it’s none of your business. I am a grown man! I know how much I weigh. I am perfectly… adequate. Just write the note! This is getting ridiculous. I'm leaving. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I am terminating this consultation. As a medical professional, I cannot ethically provide an opinion—or a note—without gathering basic medical information. Your refusal to cooperate and your dismissive attitude towards your health are… unacceptable. I strongly advise you to reconsider seeking proper medical evaluation. Good day. .
