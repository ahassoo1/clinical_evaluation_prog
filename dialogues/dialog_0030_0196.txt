DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s nice to meet you as well. Let me see… what brings me in? Chronic… fatigue, they said. That’s what the scheduler said I was here for. Honestly, things are just… blurry these days. I forget a lot.
DOCTOR: Chronic fatigue… I understand. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. “Blurry” is a helpful way to describe it. Can you tell me more about this fatigue?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like being tired after a long day, you know? It’s… always there. Like a weight. Even when I sleep, I don't feel rested. And I just… don't have the energy to do things. Simple things, like… grocery shopping. Or even making dinner. My husband used to… oh. Never mind. It’s just… everything feels harder now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds very debilitating to have that constant feeling of exhaustion, even after rest. And it's certainly concerning that it's impacting your daily activities. You mentioned it’s been harder to do things… How long has this been going on, Ms. Licano?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a hard question. It feels like a long time. Maybe… six months? Or was it longer? It started gradually, you see. I thought it was just getting older, you know? Then it just… kept getting worse. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly. I really can’t say for sure.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It's common for these things to creep up on us gradually. Six months is a good starting point. And you're right to get it checked out. Now, aside from the fatigue and difficulty with daily activities, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. I get… headaches sometimes. Not terrible, but… persistent. And I feel… cold a lot. Even when it’s warm. Oh, and… my memory is awful. Worse than usual, anyway. I forget things constantly. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Headaches, feeling cold, and memory problems… thank you for sharing that. Those symptoms can certainly be associated with fatigue and are important to investigate. To get a better picture of what might be going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you experienced any weight loss or gain recently, even unintentional?
PATIENT: Weight… I don’t really know. I haven't been weighing myself. Probably a little weight loss, I suppose. I haven’t been eating much, to be honest. Not because I want to lose weight, just… no appetite. Everything feels like too much effort. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… everything is a struggle.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. A loss of appetite with unintentional weight loss is important information. Now, have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Sleep… well, I try to sleep. But I don’t always sleep well. I wake up a lot during the night. And even when I do sleep, I don't feel rested like I used to. It’s like… my body just won’t cooperate. Does that make sense? It’s probably just old age, honestly.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Licano. It’s good you’re describing these things to me. Disrupted sleep is very common with fatigue, but we need to explore all possibilities. Before we move on, could you tell me a little about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just… this. For my blood pressure. And… a vitamin D supplement. The doctor used to say I wasn’t getting enough sun. That was… a while ago now. I can’t really remember who prescribed them, though. My memory… you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Licano. This is helpful. Lisinopril for blood pressure and Vitamin D… alright. And you mentioned not remembering who prescribed them. That's alright, we can look that up. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Unless… I think I was a little itchy once after taking something for a cold, years ago. But it wasn't terrible. I don’t really remember what it was, though. It was a long time ago. I’m really not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Ms. Licano. It’s perfectly alright that you don't remember every detail. A slight itch years ago isn't concerning. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… oh dear. Not that I remember. I had… the usual things, I suppose. Colds, the flu… nothing serious. My husband always handled the doctor’s appointments. I really wish I could remember more. It’s just… all a blur. I'm sorry. Can we just… get this over with? I have a bit of an appointment later.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Licano. We will get through this as efficiently as possible. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember every detail; we can also access records from your previous providers, if you’d like. Since your husband usually handled these appointments, do you know if you’ve ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No… no surgeries. I don’t think so. And no hospitalizations. Definitely not. My husband… he took care of everything. I just… It doesn’t matter. Let’s just… skip that part. I really need to get going soon. I don’t want to be late. This is taking a long time. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Licano. We can move on. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
