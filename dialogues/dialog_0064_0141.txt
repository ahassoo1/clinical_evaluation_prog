DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching, you see. Just… all over. It started a few weeks back, I think. Maybe a month? Hard to say exactly, to be honest. It’s just… annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. Itching all over, you say?
PATIENT: Yep. Everywhere. Arms, legs, back… even my stomach. Not like a rash, though. Just… itchy skin. No bumps or anything like that. It’s… constant, but it comes and goes in intensity. Some days it's barely noticeable, other days it drives me a bit crazy.
DOCTOR: I see. No rash, just the sensation of itchiness. And it varies in intensity. Okay. And has anything changed recently, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Changed? Let me think… Not really, no. Same routine as always, I suppose. I eat pretty much the same things. I haven't started using any new soaps or detergents, nothing like that. Oh! Well, my wife… she passed away about six months ago. That was a big change, I guess. But I don’t know if that would… cause itching?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ferneding. That is… a very significant change, and it absolutely can affect your body in many ways. It’s important we consider everything. But let's also rule out some more physical causes. Now, when you say “itching all over,” is it worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think… it's worse in the evening, maybe? When I'm trying to relax and watch TV. That's when I really notice it. During the day, when I’m busy, I don’t think about it as much. Not sure if that makes sense. It’s like… my mind wanders and I forget about it, then as soon as I sit down, it starts up again.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Ferneding. It sounds like it’s possibly related to stress or… perhaps just having more time to focus on the sensation. But we still need to investigate further. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the itching?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. No fever, definitely. No weight loss. I haven't noticed any changes in my bathroom habits, if you know what I mean. No fatigue, really. Just… the itching. And a bit of… well, I’ve been a little more tired lately, maybe? But I figured that was just… everything. Being on my own and all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. A little more fatigue, but you attribute that to the recent changes in your life, which is understandable. And no other skin changes – no redness, bumps, blisters, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. Just… dry skin, I guess. Now that you mention it, it is a bit dry. Especially on my arms and legs. I put some lotion on it sometimes, but it doesn't really help much. It feels… just generally uncomfortable, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Dry, itchy skin, more noticeable in the evening, and not really relieved by lotion. Alright. Now, do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I mean, I sneeze a bit in the spring, with the pollen and all, but nothing serious. Never had any bad reactions to food or anything like that. My wife always did the cooking, so I wasn't really paying attention to ingredients, to be honest. She always asked if I had any allergies before making something new, and I always said no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Just… a little something for my blood pressure. My doctor prescribed it a few years back. It’s called… Lisinopril, I think. Small pill, once a day. That’s it. Oh, and sometimes I take a Tylenol for aches and pains, but not very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, and occasional Tylenol. Thank you. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to take a look at your skin, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. Your heart and lungs sound good. Your lymph nodes feel normal. As I suspected, your skin is dry. I don't see any signs of a rash or anything concerning. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 145 over 90. It could be from anxiety or just needing some adjustment to your medication. Now, I'm going to order some blood work, just to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing the itching. We’ll check your liver function, kidney function, thyroid levels, and a complete blood count. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it can find out what’s causing this, I’m all for it. Blood work is fine. It’s just… frustrating, you know? It’s not like it's a pain, exactly, but it’s… annoying. And makes it hard to relax.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ferneding. It’s the constant irritation that’s the problem. We'll get to the bottom of it. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a stronger moisturizer, one with ceramides and hyaluronic acid. It’ll help restore your skin’s barrier and hopefully provide some relief. While we wait for the blood work results, I recommend trying some gentle, fragrance-free soaps and avoiding hot showers, as those can dry out your skin even more. And, if possible, try to manage your stress levels. Perhaps some light exercise, meditation, or spending time with loved ones could help. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. Ceramides and hyaluronic acid… sounds fancy. I'll try the moisturizer and the other things you mentioned. I don't really do meditation, but maybe… maybe I’ll try a walk in the park. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. It’s okay if meditation isn't for you – just find something that helps you relax and de-stress. The walk in the park is a great idea. Okay, I'll have the lab order sent to the front desk, and they'll schedule you for the blood draw. We should have the results back in about a week. I’ll call you as soon as they’re in to discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, if the itching gets significantly worse, or you develop any other symptoms, like fever, fatigue, or changes in your skin, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions about any of that, or would you like a copy of the lab order and instructions?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and for listening. I appreciate it. A week… alright. I'll try not to scratch too much in the meantime.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I’m glad I could help. And try not to worry too much – we'll figure this out together. Take care, and have a good week. .
