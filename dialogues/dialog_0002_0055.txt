DOCTOR: Hi Ellan, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Ranjan, is it? Yes. I understand you’re the one who handles these… requests. My daughter suggested I come. She thinks this marijuana… for medical purposes, naturally… might help with my… discomfort. I’m not entirely convinced, but one tries to be reasonable, doesn’t one?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re considering medical marijuana to help with some discomfort, and your daughter encouraged you to explore that option. That's perfectly reasonable. To start, can you tell me a little more about what kind of discomfort you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, where do I begin? It’s… everything, really. The joints, naturally. One gets older, you know. But it’s not just that. It’s a general… weariness. A lack of… pep. And honestly, the nerves. My husband passed last year, and while I should be over it, there are… moments. It’s simply not elegant to be in such a state. It interferes with my… responsibilities. I’m a bailiff, you see. One must maintain a certain… presence.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like you’re dealing with joint pain, fatigue, and some anxiety, especially after the loss of your husband. It's completely understandable that you’re still feeling the effects of such a significant loss, and it's admirable that you're still working and trying to maintain your responsibilities. Being a bailiff certainly requires a lot of strength and composure. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me more about the joint pain?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not as if I’m crippled, Doctor. It’s simply… bothersome. It’s mostly in the knees and hips, really. Makes getting up and down… less graceful than one would like. And standing for long periods? Quite unpleasant. I've always been a very active woman, you see. I used to dance, before… well, before things changed. I don’t want to be… helpless, you understand. It’s undignified. My daughter says this marijuana might help with the inflammation. Honestly, I'm skeptical. It just seems… uncouth.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and it's good you're thinking critically about this. It’s perfectly reasonable to be skeptical. You're right, it's important to weigh the pros and cons. So, the pain is mainly in your knees and hips, and it's worse with standing and movement. It sounds like it’s impacting your ability to do things you enjoy and maintain your active lifestyle. When did you first start noticing this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… gradual, really. Perhaps five or six years ago, a little twinge here and there. I dismissed it, of course. One doesn’t dwell on such things. But it’s steadily worsened. Now, it's a constant companion. Not excruciating, mind you. Just… present. And increasingly annoying. I’ve tried some over-the-counter remedies, you know, the creams and the pills. They offer minimal relief, if any at all. Honestly, I’m rather losing patience with the whole thing. My daughter insists this is a better route than… stronger medications. I worry about side effects, you understand. I need to be… sharp. My job requires a clear head.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns about needing to stay sharp for your job. It sounds like you've been dealing with this pain for quite a while now and have already tried some basic treatments without much success. Okay, so five or six years of gradually worsening knee and hip pain, with over-the-counter remedies offering little relief. Have you ever seen a doctor specifically for this pain before, or had any imaging done, like X-rays?
PATIENT: A doctor? For aches and pains? Really, Doctor. One doesn’t bother the medical profession for every little discomfort. No, I haven't. I assumed it was simply… age. One gets older, things wear out. My husband always said I was too proud to ask for help. Perhaps he was right. No, no X-rays. No specialists. Just… tolerance. Although, my daughter… she’s quite insistent. She says I should have seen someone years ago. Honestly, the girl worries too much. It’s a modern affliction, I think. This constant need to… medicalize everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've been managing on your own for quite some time, and you're hesitant to seek medical attention unless absolutely necessary. That's perfectly valid. Okay, so no prior medical evaluation or imaging for the pain. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. I’ve always been remarkably healthy. I eat a sensible diet—mostly. I avoid sugary things, of course. And I've never smoked a day in my life. My husband, bless his soul, used to say I was too… particular about my constitution. No, no diabetes, no high blood pressure. Nothing of the sort. I take a multivitamin, naturally. And a little calcium for the bones. But otherwise, I am, thankfully, quite robust. It's just… this discomfort. And the general… weariness. It’s simply not befitting.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've taken good care of your health. So, no significant medical conditions, a healthy lifestyle, and just the discomfort and fatigue as your main concerns. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, or anything else?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. I just told you. A multivitamin. And occasionally, a little ibuprofen for a headache. But that's it. Honestly, I find all this questioning rather… intrusive. I came here about this marijuana, not a complete medical history. I assure you, I am not a complicated case. A sensible woman with a little discomfort and a daughter who worries excessively. Is this a necessary step, or can we proceed? I have a schedule, you know. Bailiffs don't simply… idle.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to question me, and I apologize if I’m being overly thorough. It’s just important to have a complete picture, especially when considering any new treatment, even something like medical marijuana. I assure you, I’m not trying to be intrusive, just cautious. So, just to confirm, you take a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen as needed. No other medications or supplements. Okay. To help me assess whether medical marijuana might be a good option for you, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just checking your joints, reflexes, and overall mobility. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really, Doctor? For a little discomfort? Is this standard procedure? I suppose… if it's absolutely necessary. But I assure you, I am perfectly capable of assessing my own physical state. I've been moving for seventy-four years, you know. But very well. Proceed. But please be gentle. I don't want to be… jostled. And do hurry. I have duties to attend to.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible, and I’ll definitely hurry. It’ll just be a quick assessment. If you could just sit here for me, please. Okay, just tell me if anything feels particularly sore when I touch here. …Alright, a little tenderness on the inner side of both knees. And how about bending them?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. There. That’s… rather unpleasant. It’s not excruciating, mind you. Just… uncomfortable. And bending… It’s not as smooth as it used to be, naturally. A little… creaky. Like an old door, my husband used to say. And that other one… …the same. It’s a general stiffness, really. Not a sudden pain, just… resistance. And do stop poking, Doctor. It’s rather undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. So, tenderness and stiffness in both knees, especially when bending. Now, let’s just check your hips… Can you move your leg outwards, like this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No. That’s… quite limited. And rather uncomfortable, I must say. It's not a sharp pain, Doctor, but a… tightening. Like a rusty hinge. Honestly, I'm beginning to feel rather… scrutinized. Is this truly necessary? I assure you, I am not a complicated case. Just a sensible woman with a little discomfort and a daughter who… well, never mind. Perhaps we can simply discuss the marijuana now? I'm growing rather impatient. And I have a schedule to keep, you know. Bailiffs don’t simply… wait.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question me, and I apologize again for the thoroughness. I understand your frustration, and I don’t want to make you uncomfortable. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you have some osteoarthritis in both your knees and hips, causing stiffness, tenderness, and limited range of motion. This is quite common as we get older. Now, regarding the marijuana. In your state, medical marijuana is an option for chronic pain. It's important to understand that it doesn't work for everyone, and it has potential side effects, such as dizziness, drowsiness, and changes in cognitive function. Do you have any concerns about those side effects?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Drowsiness? Changes in cognitive function? Goodness, no! Absolutely not! I need to be sharp, Doctor! I am a bailiff, you understand? I cannot be… foggy-headed. I need to be alert, decisive. That’s the entire point of my profession. I evict people, Doctor. One must maintain a certain… presence. No, those side effects are unacceptable. Utterly unacceptable. I came here hoping for a sensible solution, not a… degradation of my faculties. Honestly, I’m beginning to think my daughter has led me astray. Is there… anything else? A cream, perhaps? Something simple? I simply cannot risk… impairment. The entire notion is rather… alarming.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, and you are right to prioritize maintaining your cognitive function. Medical marijuana might not be the best option for you, given your concerns about potential side effects. Let's explore some other options. For osteoarthritis, we often recommend a combination of approaches. Physical therapy can help strengthen the muscles around your joints and improve flexibility. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help manage pain and inflammation. And there are also some prescription creams and gels that can provide localized relief. We could also consider a cortisone injection into your knees and hips, which can provide temporary relief of pain and inflammation. Do any of those options sound appealing to you?
PATIENT: Cortisone injections? That sounds… invasive. And temporary, you say? I prefer solutions that are… lasting, if possible. Physical therapy… well, I suppose that’s… sensible. Although, my schedule, you understand. It’s rather demanding. And I’m not particularly fond of… exertion. Ibuprofen, I've tried. Minimal relief, as I mentioned. Honestly, Doctor, I’m beginning to suspect there is no solution. Perhaps this discomfort is simply… inevitable. A sign of age. And one must accept one’s limitations, I suppose. Although, it is most… inconvenient. Is there… absolutely nothing else? Some sort of miracle cream, perhaps? Or a simple tonic? I am not keen on… needles, or exertion, or anything that might impair my faculties. Honestly, this is rather disappointing. I had hoped for a more… straightforward answer. And a quicker resolution. I have duties to attend to, you know. Bailiffs don't simply…idle.
DOCTOR: You're right to be cautious, and it's understandable that you're looking for a straightforward solution. Unfortunately, osteoarthritis is a chronic condition, and there isn't a single cure. It often requires a combination of approaches to manage the symptoms. There are some newer topical creams that contain capsaicin or CBD, which some people find helpful for pain relief. However, the evidence is still limited. Given your concerns about side effects and your demanding schedule, I would recommend starting with a trial of physical therapy. We could start with a gentle program that focuses on strengthening and flexibility exercises that you can do at home. I can write you a referral to a physical therapist. If that doesn't provide enough relief, we can discuss other options, such as cortisone injections or prescription medications. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… Very well. A gentle program, you say? At home? As long as it doesn't… interfere with my schedule. And doesn't require excessive exertion. And doesn't impair my faculties. Yes, a referral. That will… suffice. For now. But I remain skeptical. And I hold you personally responsible if this discomfort worsens. Honestly, this is a most… inconvenient affliction. And a most disappointing consultation. But very well. A referral. And please, make sure it’s a gentle program. I have duties to attend to, you know. Bailiffs don’t simply… lie about. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ve noted your preference for a gentle program, and I’ll make sure the physical therapist is aware of your concerns. Here’s the referral slip. The office will contact you to schedule an appointment. I understand your frustration, and I apologize that I couldn’t offer a more straightforward solution. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take care of yourself. It was nice meeting you, Ellan.
