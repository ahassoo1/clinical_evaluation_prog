DOCTOR: Hi Erle, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, Doctor… Hernandez, is it? Well, frankly, I haven’t much time for this. It’s… the job. The university. It’s simply… draining. All these… students. Honestly, the lack of respect for knowledge these days… it’s appalling. I suppose that’s what you’re here to hear about. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: I understand you’re feeling overwhelmed with your work at the university, and the difficulties you’re experiencing with students. We can definitely talk about that. Just to clarify, is this feeling new, or has it been building up over time?
PATIENT: Building up? Goodness, Doctor, it’s been decades. Decades of… mediocrity. Though, I suppose lately it’s been… sharper. More insistent. It’s… difficult to explain to someone who hasn’t spent their life surrounded by… well, never mind. It's just… tiring. Terribly tiring. And frankly, a waste of my time. Do we have to dissect every little feeling? I’m a busy man, you know.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your directness, Erle. It sounds like this has been a long-term issue, and it’s recently become more pronounced. When you say "tiring," can you describe how you're feeling tired?
PATIENT: How am I feeling tired? Doctor, really. It's... exhaustion. A complete lack of... enthusiasm. I used to be passionate about the preservation of knowledge, about guiding young minds. Now? It feels like shouting into the void. It’s… a draining of the spirit, if you must have it put so dramatically. I simply don't have the energy to… to care anymore. And frankly, it’s affecting my sleep. Though I suspect that is from worrying about the state of… well, everything. Do we need to go into detail about my sleep schedule? I assure you it's not fascinating.
DOCTOR: No, we don't need to go into exhaustive detail about your sleep. Just knowing it's been affected is helpful. Aside from the exhaustion and trouble sleeping, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me see… I… I suppose my appetite hasn’t been what it once was. Everything tastes… bland. And… I’ve been rather irritable, I admit. Snapping at colleagues, even the library staff. Not my usual self, certainly. My daughter pointed it out, actually. Said I was “difficult.” Honestly, the nerve… But, yes. Irritable. And… I’ve been less inclined to socialize. My chess club… haven't attended in weeks. It's… rather pointless these days, if I’m being honest. Is that what you're looking for? A list of my failings? Because I can go on.
DOCTOR: No, not failings at all, Erle. Just trying to get a complete understanding of what's going on. Have you experienced any physical symptoms alongside these changes?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Oh, a little stiffness in the mornings. Old age, you know. Nothing to write home about. Perhaps a slight… ache in my back. But that's from bending over dusty tomes all day, not some grand malady. No fevers, no coughs, no… dramatic collapses. I assure you, Doctor, I’m not on my deathbed. I'm simply… worn down. Is that sufficient? I have a faculty meeting this afternoon, and I’m already dreading it.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. Now, in terms of your medical history, do you have any chronic conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… Hmm. My blood pressure has been… elevated at times. The doctor put me on something for it, years ago. A little pill. I can’t recall the name, frankly. And… I had a bout of bronchitis a few years back, but that cleared up. Nothing serious. I've always been a relatively healthy man. Strong constitution, you see. My mother always said so. And… well, my divorce. That was… rather draining, in retrospect. Though I don’t know if you consider that a medical condition. It certainly felt like one at the time. Is that what you're looking for? A litany of past misfortunes? Because I assure you, I have a considerable list.
DOCTOR: No, not a litany of misfortunes. Just trying to get a complete picture. You mentioned a medication for your blood pressure. Do you currently take that medication?
PATIENT: Do I…? Honestly, Doctor, I have no idea. My daughter handles most of that now. She insists I take something, and I suppose I do. Little white pills, mostly. I don't bother checking. It’s… all rather tedious. I assume she keeps me adequately medicated. She’s a very organized woman, my daughter. Perhaps you should ask her. It would save us both a considerable amount of time. Is that permissible? Or must I attempt to recall the specifics of my daily pill regimen? It’s… quite bothersome, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. We can certainly check with your daughter. Let's switch gears then. Does anyone in your family have a history of depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Mental health conditions? In my family? Goodness, no. We were a practical people. Sturdy Bulgarians. We dealt with things. We didn’t… dwell. My mother was a very strong woman. Never a hint of… fragility. My father, a stoic farmer. No, no history of such… weaknesses. Though, my uncle… he was a bit of a… eccentric. Collected stamps, I believe. Hardly the same thing, though. Is this… relevant, Doctor? Or are you simply cataloging my family’s perceived failings? Because I assure you, there are more pressing matters. I have a very important faculty meeting this afternoon, and I’m already dreading the… discussions.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let's talk about your daily life then. Are you currently living alone?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am. Divorced, as I mentioned. Haven’t remarried. Frankly, the thought… doesn’t appeal. Live in the old family home. It’s… large. Too large, perhaps. But it’s full of books, and that’s what matters. I have a housekeeper who comes twice a week. Keeps the place from descending into utter chaos. And… well, that’s about it. Quiet life. Solitary life. Exactly as I prefer it. Is there a point to this interrogation, Doctor? Or are you simply attempting to ascertain whether I’m a functioning human being? Because I assure you, I am. Despite everything.
DOCTOR: No interrogation, Erle, just trying to get a complete picture. Do you have any hobbies or activities you enjoy, aside from reading?
PATIENT: Hobbies? Activities? Goodness, no. I read, Doctor. That is my hobby. That is my life. I used to play chess, as I mentioned. But the club… it’s not what it once was. Too much… chatter. Not enough serious thought. I occasionally attend a lecture at the university, but frankly, the standards have declined. I suppose that’s all. A quiet life, dedicated to the preservation of knowledge. That's how I spend my time. Is that sufficient? I have a faculty meeting this afternoon, and frankly, I'm dreading the… pointless discussions. Is there anything else you require? Or can we finally conclude this… examination?
DOCTOR: Alright, Erle. Just a few quick questions, then a brief physical exam, if you're agreeable. Have you experienced any recent weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Weight loss… or gain? Goodness, Doctor, I haven’t stepped on a scale in years. My daughter handles all that sort of thing. I suppose… perhaps a little weight loss. Everything tastes… bland, as I mentioned. Not much appetite. But it's hardly a crisis. I assure you, I'm not wasting away. Is this necessary? Or are you simply attempting to ascertain whether I'm physically deteriorating? Because frankly, I haven’t got time for… measurements. I have a faculty meeting this afternoon, and the thought of it… is exhausting. Let's get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just do a quick check of your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we can discuss some potential options. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. Get it over with. But please, be quick. I haven't got all day. And try not to poke and prod too much. I assure you, I’m a delicate flower. Despite everything. Now, hurry up. The faculty meeting awaits. And frankly, the mere thought of it… is draining.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just a few quick checks. Please take a deep breath for me… Blood pressure is a little elevated, 158 over 88. Heart sounds are regular, but I’m hearing a slight murmur. Lungs sound clear. No obvious signs of distress. Overall, physically you seem stable. However, the elevated blood pressure is something we should address. Considering your symptoms – fatigue, loss of enthusiasm, irritability, decreased appetite, difficulty sleeping – and the elevated blood pressure, it's possible you’re experiencing burnout, and potentially some underlying anxiety or depression contributing to this. It’s also important to rule out any other medical conditions that could be causing these symptoms.
PATIENT: Burnout? Anxiety? Depression? Goodness, Doctor, I’m a scholar. A man of intellect. These are… emotional terms. Not applicable to my situation. I simply find the current state of academia… disheartening. The lack of respect for knowledge… it’s appalling. And frankly, the students… well, never mind. As for the blood pressure, I’m sure it’s just temporary. A little stress, perhaps. I assure you, I don't need to be… analyzed. Or medicated. I’m perfectly capable of managing my own affairs. Now, what are my options? How quickly can I leave? I have a faculty meeting this afternoon, and frankly, the thought of it… is exhausting.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Erle. And I respect that. However, burnout, anxiety, and depression can affect anyone, regardless of their profession or intellect. It’s not a sign of weakness, but a response to prolonged stress. My recommendation would be to start with some lifestyle modifications – ensuring adequate sleep, regular exercise, and a healthy diet. We can also explore some strategies for stress management, like mindfulness or relaxation techniques. As for your blood pressure, while it may be temporary, it’s important to monitor it and address it if it remains elevated. I can prescribe a medication to help lower it, but we can also discuss non-pharmacological options first. I’d also like to recommend a brief screening questionnaire for depression and anxiety, just to get a better understanding of your current mental state. It’s quick and easy, and can help us determine if further evaluation is needed. Finally, I can offer a referral to a therapist or counselor, if you’re interested. They can provide support and guidance as you navigate these challenges. Would you be open to discussing any of these options?
PATIENT: Mindfulness? Relaxation techniques? Goodness, Doctor, I haven’t got time for… exercises. I’m a scholar, not a… yogi. And a questionnaire? Honestly, the thought of filling out forms… it’s appalling. As for medication… I suppose I could consider it, if absolutely necessary. But I’d prefer to avoid it, if possible. The side effects… I’ve heard dreadful things. Perhaps… perhaps just a referral to… someone who understands the plight of academics. Someone who appreciates the importance of… knowledge. And quickly, please. I have a faculty meeting this afternoon, and frankly, the very thought of it… is draining. Is there such a person? And how soon can I see them?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. We can certainly explore a referral to a therapist who specializes in working with professionals, and who understands the stressors of academic life. I have a colleague, Dr. Anya Sharma, who has a good reputation for working with faculty members. She’s available for a consultation next week, on Tuesday afternoon. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday afternoon… Very well. That will have to do. But please, tell Dr. Sharma that I haven't got time for… philosophical discussions. I need practical solutions. Strategies for dealing with… incompetence. And a quick appointment, if possible. I have a faculty meeting this afternoon, and frankly, the thought of it… is exhausting. Now, is there anything else? Or can I finally leave?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll send Dr. Sharma a message with your preferences. I’ll also give you her contact information and appointment details. I'll also send a summary of our consultation to your primary care physician. Here’s her information. And just a quick reminder to prioritize getting adequate sleep, even with your busy schedule. If you don’t see any improvement in your symptoms, or if they worsen, please don’t hesitate to contact me or your primary care physician. It was a pleasure meeting you, Erle. I wish you all the best with your faculty meeting.
