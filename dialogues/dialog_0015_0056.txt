DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… a long story, Doctor. Frankly, a rather silly story. But the paperwork insisted. It’s this… job. The students. They simply don’t appreciate knowledge anymore. It’s… exhausting, constantly trying to instill a love of Dewey Decimal. Is that what you need to know? Can we get this over with quickly? I have a rather important cataloging project awaiting me.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re feeling frustrated with your work, Mr. Schlatterer. However, “exhaustion” can have many causes, and it’s my job to determine if there’s a medical reason for how you're feeling. It's not about the students, specifically; it's about you. Let's start with a little more detail about this exhaustion. When did you first start noticing it?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't the faintest idea. Years, I suppose. Decades, even. It’s always been… like this. A constant weight. Though, perhaps it's worse now. These days, they don’t even read books! They just… stare at those glowing screens. When did it start? Goodness. That’s a rather pointless question, isn't it? I’m an academic. I’m always tired. Now, are we quite finished? I really must get back to the library.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your… candor, Mr. Schlatterer. But "always" isn't a helpful answer when trying to understand a change in your health. A constant weight, you say. Is that weight physical – like muscle fatigue or weakness – or more… mental?
PATIENT: Mental, of course. Physical exertion is hardly the issue. I stroll, I don’t labor. It’s the… intellectual drain. The sheer lack of intellectual curiosity in the youth of today! It’s… draining. Honestly, it’s a miracle I haven't simply given up and locked myself in the archives. Though, who would maintain order then? It’s a burden, truly. Are we approaching a conclusion? This is… rather uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on. Aside from this… intellectual burden, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Oh, perfectly normal. I eat… appropriately. Though, I confess, I’ve lost a little weight. It’s the stress, I presume. All this… modernity. It’s quite unsettling. The young people… they don't appreciate a well-bound volume. And honestly, it’s not as though I’ve been focusing on my meals, Doctor. I have a collection to curate! Is that relevant? Because truly, I find this line of questioning rather… trivial.
DOCTOR: Weight loss is relevant, Mr. Schlatterer. Can you estimate how much weight you've lost, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I haven't the slightest idea. Perhaps… five kilograms? Over the last year? It’s difficult to say. I don't weigh myself regularly. I have more important things to do. Honestly, it's probably just muscle atrophy from… well, from thinking so much. Yes, that must be it. Now, if you don’t mind, Doctor, I really must…
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, with all due respect, attributing unexplained weight loss to “thinking too much” is not a sufficient medical explanation. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. I… sleep poorly. Though, that’s hardly new. And I suppose I’ve been… a bit more irritable than usual. But frankly, who wouldn't be irritable in this day and age? The state of… everything! The disrespect! The ignorance! Now, are you quite finished? I assure you, my time is valuable. I have a backlog of first editions to assess. It's a crucial task, you understand. Absolutely crucial. Now... .
DOCTOR: Poor sleep and increased irritability… Alright. Have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or any unexplained aches and pains?
