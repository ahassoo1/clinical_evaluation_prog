DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sladen. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's my blood pressure. It's been a little high lately, and my regular doctor suggested I come get it checked out properly. He thought it would be good to get a second opinion, just to be sure.
DOCTOR: I see. A second opinion is always wise. “A little high” is rather vague, though. Can you give me some numbers, if you happen to know them?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. I do have a little notebook at home with some readings, but I don't have it with me. I think the highest one I wrote down was… around 140 over 90? Maybe a little higher, but I'm not totally sure. It was taken when I was a bit stressed, actually. My aunt was visiting and... well, she can be a lot. But usually it's closer to 130 over 80, I'd say.
DOCTOR: 140/90 is certainly elevated. And consistent readings in the 130s are… not ideal, even if they aren't significantly higher. We'll need to get a more accurate reading here, of course. Do you have any symptoms accompanying these higher readings?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little bit of a headache sometimes, but I get those anyway, you know? Stress headaches mostly. And sometimes my neck feels a little stiff. But I just figured that was from sleeping wrong or something. Nothing that made me think it was because of my blood pressure, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long have you been noticing these higher readings, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I’d say maybe… three or four months now? It started around the time my cousin got sick, actually. I was doing a lot of visiting at the hospital, trying to help out, and just generally worried, I guess. It’s been a bit better since then, but it still seems to creep up sometimes.
DOCTOR: Three to four months. So, potentially stress-related. Do you have any family history of hypertension – high blood pressure – or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! My grandfather, on my mother’s side, definitely had high blood pressure. He was always getting told by the doctor to watch his salt intake and stuff. And my aunt – not the one who visits, the other one – she has it too, I think. She’s on medication for it, definitely. I don’t think anyone else, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. Oh, and I take something for allergies when the pollen count is really high, but that’s seasonal. Nothing regular or anything.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'm going to need to take your blood pressure myself, of course. And I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your pulse. Just routine. Please loosen your shirt a bit.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. No problem at all. I'm used to doctor visits, even if I don't always like them.
DOCTOR: Okay, first reading is 142 over 88. A bit elevated, as expected. Let's take another one in a moment. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I'm going to feel around your abdomen. Just to get a baseline. Let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. No tenderness, I don’t think. I’ve always had a pretty sensitive tummy, though, so it might feel a little weird just from being touched. But nothing painful, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I see. Everything feels normal, no masses or abnormalities detected. Given your family history and recent readings, I'm leaning toward a diagnosis of Stage 1 Hypertension. However, we need to rule out any secondary causes. I'm going to order a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel. These will give us a better picture of your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and cholesterol. Also, a urinalysis. We need to check for protein in your urine.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That sounds… thorough. A lipid panel? Is that like… checking my cholesterol? And a urinalysis… that just means I pee in a cup, right? It all sounds a bit scary, honestly. Is it something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Sladen. You are overthinking it. A lipid panel is checking your cholesterol; it’s important to assess your overall cardiovascular risk. And yes, a urinalysis is simply a urine sample. We're not looking for anything alarming, just establishing a baseline. Stage 1 Hypertension is often manageable with lifestyle changes – diet, exercise, stress reduction. Medication is not necessarily the immediate answer. However, we must first identify the cause and assess the extent of the problem. The tests will help me determine that. I'll also have the lab check your thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH. It's a simple blood test, but thyroid issues can sometimes affect blood pressure. I’ll give you a requisition form for the lab. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That makes me feel a little better, knowing it's not necessarily something terrible. And it’s good to hear that lifestyle changes can help. I do try to eat fairly healthy, but I could definitely use more exercise. And… well, stress is definitely a problem. So, just a blood test and a pee sample? Is there a specific lab I should go to? And do I need to fast before the blood test?
DOCTOR: Yes, just a blood test and a urine sample. You can go to any certified lab, but I recommend Lakeside Diagnostics, it’s just down the street. The requisition form has the address. And yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood test. No food or sugary drinks, but water is fine. Once you have the results, they will be sent directly to me. I’ll review them and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and create a management plan. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Fast for 12 hours, water only, go to Lakeside Diagnostics, and they'll send the results to you. Then you’ll call me. Okay, that sounds manageable. Thank you, Doctor Versace. You've explained everything really clearly. I feel a lot less worried now. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime, like… cutting back on salt or anything?
DOCTOR: While you wait for the results, a modest reduction in sodium intake would be… prudent. Avoid processed foods, fast food, and excessive table salt. Also, monitor your blood pressure at home if you have a device. It's not essential, but it provides useful data. However, do not self-treat or adjust your diet drastically without my guidance. We need a comprehensive assessment before making any significant changes. Are there any other questions or concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It makes a big difference. And I'll try to be good and not go overboard with the salt! I guess I'll just… see you when the lab results come back?
DOCTOR: Yes. I will be in touch. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Sladen. .
