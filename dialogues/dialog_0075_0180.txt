DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have a lot of time. I'm just… tired. Really tired. And I've been… eating dirt. Not like on purpose, but… I just crave it, you know? It’s weird. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: I understand you're feeling tired and experiencing unusual cravings. We’ll get through this as efficiently as possible, Hedy. Craving dirt – that’s something we need to explore. Just to clarify, when you say "eating dirt," can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Explore? What's there to explore? It tastes like… dirt. Look, I don't know why I'm doing it, okay? It just… happens. Sometimes it’s the clay from my garden, sometimes it’s just… ground. I don’t even think about it, really. It just feels… good for a minute. But then I feel worse, which is why I'm here, I guess. Honestly, I haven’t told anyone before. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Hedy. It is unusual, and it's perfectly understandable why you’d be embarrassed. There’s no judgment here; we're just trying to understand what's going on. This craving for dirt—what we call geophagy—can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency, although it can have other causes as well. To help me figure out what might be happening, let’s go through some questions, if that’s alright. First, how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, questions. Look, I don't keep track of things like that. Maybe… a few months? It started after… well, after my husband passed. Everything just feels… off since then. It’s not like I'm eating a bucket of dirt, okay? Just little bits here and there when I'm gardening, mostly. It’s not like it's affecting my life or anything... but the tiredness is getting worse. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it started a few months ago, around the time of your husband's passing. I’m very sorry for your loss, Hedy. Grief can manifest in many unexpected ways. And you're right, the tiredness is the most concerning part at the moment. To get a clearer picture, could you describe what your diet typically looks like?
PATIENT: Oh, don't go getting all sympathetic on me. It doesn't help. My diet? What do you eat? I eat… food. Regular food. I cook, when I have the energy. Mostly beans, rice, chicken sometimes. I don't eat a lot of… fancy stuff. It’s just me now, you know? I used to cook bigger meals… for my husband. Now… whatever’s easy. I don’t go out to eat much. Honestly, I haven’t had a proper appetite since… well, you know. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: No, we’re making progress, Hedy. Just trying to gather information. Beans and rice are good staples. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements recently?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? Seriously? You're asking me about my poop now? Look, I don't discuss these things with strangers. I'm not… I don't know… I haven't noticed anything different, okay? They're… normal. Can we just skip this part? It's ridiculous. I came here because I'm tired and I eat dirt, not to talk about… that. I just want something to make me feel better. Is there a pill for this?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Hedy, and I apologize if I’ve made you feel embarrassed. These questions are important, however, to rule out potential underlying causes for your tiredness and the unusual cravings. It’s not about being intrusive, but about ensuring I have all the necessary information to help you. However, we can move on, if that’s what you prefer. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tiredness?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. What other symptoms? Let me think... I get headaches. A lot of headaches. And my hands… they feel weak sometimes. Like I can't grip things properly. And I've been… short of breath, I guess. Especially when I'm walking up the stairs. It's not bad bad, but it's there. Honestly, I just thought I was getting old. But the tiredness is… different. It's like I'm dragging myself through mud all the time. Is that enough? Can we please be done soon? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Hedy. Headaches, weakness in your hands, and shortness of breath are all important pieces of the puzzle. Given your symptoms, including the tiredness and the unusual craving, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and then order some bloodwork to check for a few things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, more poking and prodding? Look, I don't do well with doctors. But… fine. If it gets me out of here faster, do whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, okay? And tell me what you're looking for. I don't like surprises. Honestly, I'm probably just anemic. My mother always said I was prone to anemia. Is that what this is? Anemia? Can you just give me some iron pills?
DOCTOR: Anemia is definitely something we'll check for, Hedy. Your mother may be right, it's a common possibility given your symptoms. But we need to rule out other things as well. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll check your blood pressure and take a look at your hands to see if I can spot any paleness or changes in your nails. I'll also feel your abdomen to see if there's any tenderness. It’s a standard exam, and it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Take a deep breath for me, please... and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds a little fast, but that could be related to your anxiety. Lungs sound clear so far.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I never liked being touched. It just feels… wrong. Honestly, I don't know why I even came here. It's probably just stress. My whole life is stressful now. My husband… well, never mind. Just tell me if I need iron pills. And make it quick. I have a garden to tend to, you know? And dirt to… eat. Ugh, I can't believe I just said that. Stop poking me.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Hedy. I'll proceed as quickly as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which could be due to stress as well. Your palms are a bit pale, and your fingernails are… slightly brittle. Now, let’s just feel your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No! Stop touching me there! That's… personal! Honestly, this is ridiculous. I feel like I'm being… interrogated. And what's the point of all this poking and prodding anyway? You're not going to find anything. It's just stress! I told you that already! Honestly, I think I'm having a panic attack. Can I just go home now? I'll just rest. Maybe it will go away. I just want to be left alone. And give me the iron pills! Please! Just give me the iron pills and let me go!
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. You're right. We can stop the exam. I apologize if I made you uncomfortable. It's clear you're very distressed. I understand you're feeling overwhelmed and anxious, and I respect your wishes. Given your strong preference, I will order a complete blood count to check for anemia and other potential deficiencies. However, I also strongly recommend we discuss a referral to a therapist or counselor to help you cope with your grief and anxiety. It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden, and it's okay to ask for help. The CBC will give us a baseline, and we can discuss the results next week. I will also write you a prescription for a low-dose iron supplement, although I strongly advise against self-treating without understanding the underlying cause of your symptoms. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Iron pills and leave me alone. Just… get it over with. I don’t want to talk about therapy. I don’t need therapy. I just need to feel better. And honestly, if the iron pills don’t work, I’m not coming back. I have better things to do than sit around poking and prodding with strangers. Just… write the prescription. And let me go. Is there a charge for this? I don’t have a lot of money, you know. My husband… never mind. Just tell me the cost. And let me go.
DOCTOR: Here is the prescription for the iron supplement. There is a small consultation fee of $75. We do have a financial assistance program available, if you are unable to cover the cost. I’ll have the receptionist provide you with information about that. I understand you’re feeling overwhelmed, Hedy. Please remember that you're not alone, and help is available if you need it. I strongly encourage you to consider talking to someone about your grief and anxiety. I wish you all the best, Hedy. Please schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the bloodwork. .
