DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. Doctor Gorga, is it? Look, I haven't got all day. I need a… a permission slip. For somethin’. A… a fixin’ thing. A cosmetic fixin’. Is that what you do here? I just need you to say I’m… alright for it. Don't need a whole lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright… a permission slip. Cosmetic… right. And what exactly is this “fixin’ thing” you’re referrin’ to?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's… well, it's somethin’ for my face. Makes me look… presentable. Younger. Don’t rightly remember all the fancy words the fella used. Some kinda… lift, I think? It ain’t a big deal. Just need the paper. I paid good money for it, you understand. Don't need you tellin' me it's unwise or somethin'. Just… the permission.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, you had a consultation with someone about a facial… procedure. And they need my sign-off saying you're medically cleared for it. Do you remember who you saw?
PATIENT: Hmm… a young man. Real smooth talker. Had an office… over by the mall, I think? Lots of shiny things. Name… now that’s the part. Something with a ‘J’… or maybe a ‘K’? Honestly, Doctor, these young fellas all run together. I just needed to get it done. Don't worry about who did it. Just need you to say it's alright. My health is… fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, you’re not sure of the doctor’s name or the specifics of the procedure. And you say your health is mostly fine… Can you tell me a little bit about what “mostly fine” means?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I'm a grown man. I don't need to list my ailments to you. I get a little tired, maybe. Old age, you know? And my knees ache when it rains. It’s… normal. I’ve been workin’ with towers my whole life. Dangerous work. But I’m still standin’, aren’t I? Don't need a medical history lesson for a little… touch-up. Are you gonna sign the paper or not? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just a few quick questions, Mr. Honcoop. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, sir. Never had allergies. I used to eat dirt as a boy, built up my immune system. Tough as nails, I am. Don't bother with those questions, Doctor. It's a waste of time. Just get to the signin’.
DOCTOR: Okay… And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Now… let me see. I think… maybe somethin’ for my waterworks. Gets a little… troublesome, you know? Old age again. Small blue pill. Can't recall the name, truthfully. But it’s nothin’ serious. Just helps me… sleep through the night. That's all. And it’s not a regular thing, mind you. Only when needed.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be clear, this procedure is on your face, correct?
PATIENT: Of course it’s on my face! What, you think they’re fixin’ my feet? I told you, it’s a cosmetic fixin’. Makes me look younger. Presentable. Is that not clear enough? Honestly, Doctor, you askin’ silly questions. Just sign the paper so I can get on with my day. I haven’t got all afternoon for this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you’re in a hurry, but I need to make sure this is safe for you. You mentioned intermittent use of medication for urinary symptoms, and we don't know what that medication is. Some medications can interfere with healing or cause complications during surgery, even a cosmetic procedure. I’m not comfortable signing off on this without knowing more about your medical history. It’s my responsibility to ensure your safety. We could start with a basic blood pressure check, at least?
PATIENT: Now listen here! I came to you for a permission slip, not a lecture! I've been perfectly healthy all my life, and I don't need you questioning my… my well-being. I paid good money for this procedure, and I expect you to do what I ask. I'm not stickin' around for blood pressure checks and medical history lessons. You want my business, you sign the paper. You don't? Fine! I'll find another doctor. Don’t waste my time. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I’m sorry, but I cannot in good conscience sign off on a procedure without a basic understanding of your medical history. It would be unethical and potentially harmful. I understand you're frustrated, but my priority is your well-being. I recommend you consult with a primary care physician who can properly assess your health and determine if you are a suitable candidate for this procedure. I wish you the best of luck. .
