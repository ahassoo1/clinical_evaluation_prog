DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you too. My name is Lennie Tkac, as you know. I am here today because I am looking to move into a senior living facility, and they requested I have a check-up first. Just to make sure I am fit enough, you see. A formality, mostly.
DOCTOR: A formality, you say. Yes, quite sensible. While it is often just that, a thorough assessment is still prudent. Seventeen years in Internal Medicine has taught me to trust, but verify, as they say. Now, Mr. Tkac, let’s begin with a bit of your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems – that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well now, that’s a good question, Doctor. Let me see… I haven’t been formally told about diabetes or heart problems. My blood pressure, the nurses at the community hall check it sometimes when we have events. It’s usually…normal, I believe they said. Nothing alarming. I do have some aches and pains, mostly in my joints. Old age, you see. And a bit of trouble with my eyesight, which is why I wear these glasses. But no serious illnesses, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: "Normal" can be…subjective, Mr. Tkac. And persistent aches and pains, while often attributed to age, can sometimes indicate underlying issues. We’ll need to explore that further. Let’s move onto any past surgeries or hospitalizations you've had. Anything at all, even if it was many years ago. Do you recall?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… That was a long time ago. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. They set it, of course. And…I had my appendix out when I was quite young, I believe. That was a bit of a scare, but I recovered well. Aside from that, and a few minor scrapes and bruises over the years, I don't recall any significant hospital stays or surgeries. Nothing that required much attention, anyway. It was all a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family history, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: That's a tricky one, Doctor. My family…we didn't talk much about illnesses, you see. We were more focused on…survival, mostly. Out on the reservation, things were different. I know my mother lived to be quite old, though. She had a strong constitution. My father…he passed when I was young, from a fever, I believe. And I had…several siblings. I think one of my sisters had trouble with her heart, but I wasn't very close to her, and I don’t remember the details. We didn't have much access to doctors back then, so we mostly just…dealt with things ourselves. It wasn’t a particularly healthy lot, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I see. A challenging past, certainly. Let’s move on to your current medications. Are you taking any prescription drugs, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I don’t take anything regularly. I tried some vitamins a few years back, a friend recommended them, but I didn't notice any difference, so I stopped. I prefer to eat well, you see. Simple food, mostly. And get plenty of rest. I believe in letting nature take its course, mostly. I haven't been to a doctor in…well, it's been a long time. I generally avoid them if I can. It’s not that I dislike doctors, you understand, it's just…I prefer to stay healthy on my own.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Well, Mr. Tkac, while I respect your self-sufficiency, a comprehensive assessment is necessary to ensure you are indeed fit for senior living. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. I’ve been stung by a bee or two, naturally, living as I do, but that just smarted for a bit. Nothing serious. I don't recall ever being allergic to anything, truly. Although, I once had a bit of trouble with a certain type of berry…made me quite sick, but that was many years ago, and I don't think it was an allergy exactly. Just a bad berry, I expect.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Tkac, let's proceed with a physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and a basic neurological assessment. It shouldn't be unpleasant. If you would please……have a seat.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. I suppose that's to be expected. A thorough examination is sensible, as you said. I'm ready when you are. Please, proceed. I will do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. Just breathe normally. I'm listening to your heart now. I detect a…slight murmur. Nothing alarming, but we’ll need to document it. Blood pressure is 150/90. A bit elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, let’s check your lung sounds. Take a deep breath for me…and exhale slowly. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but there’s some diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. I’m doing my best to breathe deeply. A bit difficult these days, as you can imagine. Diminished breath sounds…that doesn't sound good, does it? I haven’t noticed any trouble breathing, myself, but my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, so I wouldn’t necessarily know. Please, continue. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are somewhat diminished, bilaterally. Not a cause for immediate concern, but something to monitor. Now, I'm going to check your range of motion in your joints. Can you please raise your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I’ll try my best. There you go. A bit creaky, you see. Old age, I suppose. It’s not as easy as it used to be. Please, let me know if you notice anything concerning.
DOCTOR: Yes, limited range of motion in both shoulders, with some discomfort noted upon movement. Now, can you please squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is that alright? Not as strong as they used to be, you see. Years of work, mostly. And the cold weather doesn't help.
DOCTOR: Grip strength is diminished bilaterally. Alright, Mr. Tkac. That completes the physical examination. I’m going to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests. We’ll also need a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs further, given the diminished breath sounds. Do you have any objections to these tests?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no objections at all. If it will help determine what’s going on, then I’m happy to have the tests done. Blood work and a chest X-ray… perfectly sensible. I trust your judgment. Just let me know when and where I need to go. I suppose it's all part of the process.
DOCTOR: Very good. The lab is just down the hall, and the radiology department is on the second floor. They will schedule the chest X-ray for you when you arrive. Once the results are back – typically within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend you maintain a healthy diet, stay hydrated, and avoid strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. A healthy diet, stay hydrated…I already try to do those things. A follow-up appointment… I’ll be sure to schedule that when I have the results. Thank you, Doctor. For your time and attention. It’s good to know what’s going on, even if it’s not all good news.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Tkac. My nurse will escort you to the lab and radiology departments. We’ll be in touch to schedule your follow-up appointment. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you again. Have a good day to you as well.
