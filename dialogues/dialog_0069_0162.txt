DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Bloating. That’s… that’s why I’m here. Look, I don’t have time for a long chat, alright? Just… my stomach’s puffed up. Feels like a balloon. It's been happening on and off, and frankly, it’s annoying. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand you’re short on time, Mr. Kristofik, and I appreciate you being direct. “Annoying” is a perfectly valid way to describe it! But to help me figure out what's causing the bloating, I do need a little more information. "On and off" is helpful, but can you tell me when it started happening?
PATIENT: When it started… honestly? I don’t really remember. A few months, maybe? Look, things… things haven’t been easy. My wife… she passed last year. My memory's not what it used to be, okay? It’s just… everything’s a blur. Is it really important when it started? It’s happening now that's the point.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Kristofik. That must be incredibly difficult, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed and that your memory isn't what it used to be. It is helpful to get a timeline, but we can work around that. So, if not months, can you tell me if it’s been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Definitely comes and goes. Some days I'm fine, normal. Other days… like today… I look pregnant. It's embarrassing, alright? And uncomfortable. It happens after I eat, usually. But not everything I eat. It's… random. Look, is there a pill you can just give me to make it stop? I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it comes and goes, and it’s often after eating, but not always after eating. That’s helpful information. Before we talk about medications, I want to rule out anything serious, and medications often treat symptoms, not the cause. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… … Sometimes gas. A lot of gas. And… cramps, I guess. Not terrible cramps, just… uncomfortable twisting. And… I’ve been a little tired lately, but honestly, who isn’t? I work hard. Pile driving isn’t exactly a relaxing job, you know? Is that useful, or are we just going in circles here?
DOCTOR: Gas and cramps along with the bloating – that's good to know. And yes, pile driving definitely sounds physically demanding, so fatigue isn't surprising. I see here you have private insurance, and the clinic is in an urban area. Okay. To get a better sense of things, could you tell me a little about your diet?
PATIENT: Diet? Look, I eat. I work a lot, I eat when I can. It's not fancy, alright? Burgers, sandwiches, sometimes pasta. I try to get some vegetables in when I can, but it’s hard. I don’t spend a lot of time cooking, okay? I don't have the energy for all that. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a fairly typical diet – burgers, sandwiches, pasta, some vegetables when you can. That's helpful. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. It won’t take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Get it over with. But don’t poke around too much, alright? I haven't got all day. And try to be quick about it. Seriously.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. If you could lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I'm just going to listen to your belly with this stethoscope, and then I’ll gently press on it to feel for any tenderness. Okay. I'm hearing some normal bowel sounds. I do feel a little bit of tenderness in your lower abdomen, but no large masses or anything concerning. Your abdomen is slightly distended, which is consistent with the bloating you described. I’m going to make some notes here.
PATIENT: Fine. Just hurry up with whatever you're doing. I’ve got work to get back to. Look, I’m not trying to be difficult, but I really don’t have time for a long medical investigation, alright? Is there anything seriously wrong? Just tell me straight. Don’t beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik. I understand your concern and that your time is valuable. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, I don't feel like there's anything immediately life-threatening going on. However, bloating, gas, and cramps can have several causes. It could be something as simple as diet, stress, or a mild digestive issue. But it could also be related to something like irritable bowel syndrome or even a mild food intolerance. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a couple of blood tests – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel – just to rule out any underlying issues. I also suggest a stool test to check for any infections or inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Stool tests? Look, I really didn’t want to do all this. Can’t you just give me something for the gas? Something to calm my stomach down? I don’t need a full investigation. I’m a working man, alright? I don’t have time to be running around getting tests done. Frankly, this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I’m sorry this is taking longer than you’d like. I want to assure you I’m not trying to be difficult. The tests are to make sure we don't miss anything serious. If everything comes back normal, then we can focus on managing your symptoms, likely with dietary changes and potentially some medication to help with the gas and bloating. Regarding medication, I can prescribe an anti-gas medication like simethicone, which might provide some relief. However, it won't address the underlying cause. I also want to be upfront: If the tests reveal something concerning, we'll need to discuss further steps, which may include seeing a gastroenterologist. Would you be willing to try the simethicone and consider the blood tests?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Just… fine. Give me the pill. I’ll take the stupid pill. And I guess I can get the blood tests done if you insist. But if it takes all day, I’m going to be really unhappy. And don't tell me about seeing a specialist. I’m a pile driver, not a… a stomach specialist. Just get me through this. What do I need to do for the tests? I want this over with as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik. I understand. I’m prescribing simethicone 200mg as needed for gas. Take it with water after meals if you’re experiencing discomfort. And for the blood tests, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand – no food or sugary drinks, just water. I’ll give you a lab order – it’s good at any LabCorp location. It shouldn't take too long, maybe 30-45 minutes. The stool test kit is also included in this packet – just follow the instructions, and bring the sample to the lab once you’ve collected it. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks. Fine. As long as it’s not first thing in the morning. I need to be at work. Look, just tell me when and where, and I’ll be there. I’ve got things to do. This whole thing is a waste of time, but if I have to do it, I’ll do it. Just… get me out of here. Can I go now? .
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kristofik, you’re all set. The follow-up appointment is scheduled for August 16th at 2:00 PM here at the clinic. Here is a summary of the instructions and the prescription, for your reference. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. And I hope the simethicone provides some relief. Thank you for coming in today. Get back to work safely. .
