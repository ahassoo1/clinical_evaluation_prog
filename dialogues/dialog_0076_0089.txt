DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s my tummy, really. It's been… troublesome. Not constantly, you understand, but these pains… they come on quite strong, low down. It’s difficult to explain… it’s just… painful. I do apologize, I’m not very good at remembering specifics these days. I believe that's why I'm here, isn't it? For the pain?
DOCTOR: Yes, the pain. Right. "Troublesome" is… vague, unfortunately. Can you tell me when these pains started?
PATIENT: Oh dear. When… that is a difficult one. Let me see… it feels like… a while now. Not recently, certainly. Months, perhaps? It comes and goes, you see. Not a constant ache, thankfully. I… I wish I could be more precise. Is it important to know exactly when? I do have trouble with dates. Perhaps if you told me a month, I could… maybe… recall something?
DOCTOR: It is helpful. Months is… not particularly useful for diagnosis, Ms. Glymph. We need to understand the pattern. Is it after eating?
PATIENT: Eating… hmm. I don’t believe so. No, it doesn't seem to be related to food, at least not that I’ve noticed. Though… I do enjoy a good bit of fruit now and then. Could that be it? I’m terribly sorry, I feel like I’m being quite unhelpful. It just… happens. A sudden pain, low in my stomach. And then it fades. Is there anything else that might trigger it, do you think? Perhaps activity? I don't do much strenuous activity, mind you.
DOCTOR: Right. So, not related to eating. Not related to activity. And you say "low" in your stomach… Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… yes. Well, it's… down there. Like… where one might expect. Not higher up, certainly. And not on the sides, really. Just… the center, low down. It’s a deep ache, sometimes. Other times it feels… sharper? It's difficult to describe. I apologize again. I believe the doctor mentioned something about… SLE? Is this pain related to that, perhaps?
DOCTOR: SLE… Yes, you have a history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Right. So, this pain... has it changed at all since your diagnosis?
PATIENT: Oh, that's right, the lupus. Has it changed… hmm. That's a good question. It feels… worse, perhaps? Or maybe I’m just noticing it more now. It used to be… a dull ache, I think. But now… it's more intense, sometimes. And it lingers longer. I remember the doctor saying lupus can affect… well, everything, really. Is this pain common with it? I worry sometimes that it's something else entirely, you see. Something… new.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, other symptoms… let me think. Not that I’ve noticed, specifically. I feel… a bit tired, always. But I assumed that was just… getting older, you see. And sometimes my joints ache, but that’s been happening for years. Is that related? I do take medication for the lupus, of course. Perhaps it's not working as well as it used to? I don’t know. It’s all rather confusing, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick examination, then. Just to get a better idea of what's going on. If you could lie down on the examination table, please.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. An examination. That sounds… sensible. I hope I'm not being a bother. It's just… I don't like feeling unwell, you see. Is there anything specific I should be doing? Or just… lie there?
DOCTOR: Just lie on your back, Ms. Glymph. I'll listen to your abdomen first. Relax your stomach muscles as much as possible.
PATIENT: Alright. Relax… yes, I can do that. Though, it’s sometimes difficult. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. And… please, don’t hesitate to ask if I’m not explaining something clearly. I do apologize for being so… vague. It's just the way my mind works these days.
DOCTOR: I’m hearing some… decreased bowel sounds. Not absent, but definitely quieter than normal. And there’s a little tenderness to palpation here… On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain you’ve ever felt, how would you rate the pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh… tenderness? Ooh, yes. That’s… uncomfortable. A scale of one to ten… hmm. Well, it’s not excruciating, certainly. Not like… a broken bone, or anything. Perhaps a… four? Or a five? It’s a dull ache, really, but it’s definitely noticeable now. More than usual, I think. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: A four or five… alright. And is there any pain radiating anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiating… hmm. Not… up my back, certainly. Or down my legs. It feels… contained. Mostly right here, where you’re pressing. Although… Sometimes, I feel a little… discomfort in my lower back. Not pain, exactly. Just a sort of… ache. Is that related, do you think? Perhaps it's just from lying down? I do worry about my back, you see. It’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. Based on what you've told me, and the exam, it's difficult to say definitively. The decreased bowel sounds and tenderness could indicate a few things. Given your history of lupus, we need to consider a flare-up, or potentially something else. I want to order some blood work—a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and inflammatory markers—to get a clearer picture. And a urine analysis, just to rule out a urinary tract infection.
PATIENT: Oh, blood work… yes, that sounds… thorough. A flare-up… that's what I feared, perhaps. I do try to stay on top of my medication, you see. And a urine analysis… yes, that makes sense. I haven’t noticed any… discomfort, specifically, but it’s always best to be cautious. Will the blood work tell us what's causing the pain? And… how long will it take to get the results? I do worry about waiting, you see. It's just… unpleasant, feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: The blood work will give us a better idea if there's inflammation, and rule out other causes. The results usually take about 24 to 48 hours. I'll have the lab draw them today. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever—naproxen—to help manage the discomfort. And I want you to drink plenty of fluids. If the pain worsens significantly, you develop a fever, or experience any nausea or vomiting, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, naproxen… yes, I’ve taken that before, I think. Plenty of fluids… yes, that’s sensible. And go to the emergency room if it gets worse… yes, I understand. Hmm… I suppose… no, I don't have any questions right now. Though… Is it possible this is… something serious? Not lupus, specifically, but something else entirely? I do worry about… unexpected things, you see. And… Will the blood work rule those things out?
DOCTOR: Ms. Glymph, it’s impossible to say definitively without the blood work results. That’s why we’re doing them. It could be a lupus flare, but we need to rule out other possibilities—like an infection, or something else affecting your digestive system. I understand your worry, and I want to reassure you that we're taking this seriously. The blood work will give us a lot more information, and we'll go from there. I'm not going to speculate on worst-case scenarios right now. Let’s get the tests done and see what they show. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. No, I… I think that’s all. Thank you, doctor. For explaining everything so… clearly. And for not… speculating. I suppose… I’ll just wait for the results, then. And drink plenty of fluids. And take the naproxen. It’s kind of you to take the time to listen to me. I do apologize for being so… vague. I think… I think that’s all.
