DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Panjoj. It’s… very nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… this pain. Down there. It’s… difficult to explain, truthfully. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s… in my… testicles, I believe? Is that the right word? It’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Yes, “testicles” is perfectly fine. Thank you for being so open. It’s alright if it’s difficult to explain; we'll get to the bottom of it together. Just tell me as much as you can remember. When did this pain start?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? That is the question, isn’t it? Let me think… It feels like… a few weeks, maybe? Or was it longer? It’s all a bit… fuzzy. I honestly couldn't say with any certainty. It wasn’t sudden, that much I remember. It just… gradually became noticeable. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Noelani. “Gradually” is helpful. And it’s good you remember it wasn’t sudden. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it… It’s… not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache, I suppose. And sometimes it feels… heavy? Like a weight. It’s not constant, thankfully. It comes and goes. Some days it’s barely there, and other days… well, other days it’s more bothersome. And… it sometimes radiates, I think that’s the word, up into my lower abdomen. But only a little. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dull ache with a heavy feeling that sometimes radiates to your lower abdomen. We're building a good picture here. Now, would you say anything specifically makes the pain worse?
PATIENT: Anything make it worse… Let me see… I don’t think so, not really. Walking doesn’t seem to affect it. Sitting… no. I haven’t noticed anything specific. I do a lot of woodworking, you see. It keeps me busy. Perhaps… perhaps being on my feet for too long makes it a little worse, but it’s hard to say for sure. It’s not a dramatic difference, if that makes sense. Just a slight increase in discomfort sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the woodworking. So, prolonged standing might aggravate it slightly. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Makes it better… Lying down, I think. Yes, definitely lying down. It takes the pressure off, you see. And… a warm bath sometimes helps. Just a little. It’s not a miracle cure, but it's… soothing, I suppose. It distracts me from it, if nothing else. I haven’t done anything specific to make it better, just… things that provide some relief.
DOCTOR: Alright, lying down and a warm bath provide some relief. Good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Other medical conditions… Well, I have Medicare, so… I must have something, I suppose. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is quite unreliable. I see a specialist for my hands, sometimes, because of the woodworking. Arthritis, I think it is. But nothing major. And… I had a gallbladder removed many years ago. But that was… a long time ago. I haven't had any other serious illnesses, as far as I can remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis and a past gallbladder removal. That's helpful. And don’t worry about your memory; we’ll take our time. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… for the arthritis, sometimes. Just over-the-counter things, really. Ibuprofen, when it flares up. And… a multivitamin, every morning. Just to be on the safe side, you know? That’s it, I think. Nothing else regularly. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis and a daily multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I eat most things without any trouble. And… I’m not particularly sensitive to anything in the environment, either. No hay fever, no rashes… nothing like that. I’m quite lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any issues with prostate problems, testicular cancer, or other similar conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That’s a difficult one. My family… we weren’t very good at talking about these things, truthfully. My father… he passed away when I was young. I don't recall any specific illnesses he had. My mother… she lived a long life, but I don’t remember her having any major health problems. I have a brother, but we haven’t spoken in many years. I honestly couldn't tell you anything about his health. I wish I could be more helpful, Doctor. It’s just… this information isn’t something we shared.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Noelani. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all! I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And… Recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I’m a woodworker, Doctor. I need a steady hand! I’m a very healthy person, all things considered. I try to eat well and stay active.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Noelani. Alright, let’s move on to a physical examination. I’m going to need to examine you to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I suppose… I should have brought different trousers, shouldn’t I? Is that going to be… difficult? I apologize in advance if it is.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. We can certainly work around this. It might be a little less comfortable, but we can manage. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then we’ll move on to examining your abdomen and, finally, the area you’ve been concerned about. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Please lie on your back, and I'll darken the lights slightly.
PATIENT: Very well. I do hope this isn’t too much trouble, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: No trouble at all, Noelani. Just relax. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No abnormal sounds detected. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any masses or tenderness. Now, I’m going to need to examine the area you’re concerned about. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. There's a slight… fullness on the left side. And there’s a small amount of tenderness when I press here. No obvious signs of inflammation or infection. I’m also going to check for a hydrocele, just to be thorough. No fluid buildup detected.
PATIENT: Ouch. Yes, that’s… that’s where it hurts. Not terribly painful, but… noticeable. It feels… firm, I suppose. Not squishy. And… It feels… different than the other one. Not necessarily worse, just… different. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. "Firm" and "different" are helpful observations. It's not uncommon for testicles to be slightly different in size and texture. However, the tenderness you’re experiencing is something we need to investigate further. Based on my examination, I suspect a few possibilities. It could be epididymitis – inflammation of the tube that stores and carries sperm – or a small varicocele – an enlargement of the veins within the scrotum. Less likely, but still possible, is a small hydrocele or even a very early stage tumor. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a scrotal ultrasound. It’s a painless imaging test that will allow us to see what’s going on inside your scrotum. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A tumor? Oh dear. An ultrasound… yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then please do. I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s… not good news. When… when would I be able to have this ultrasound? And… is it very expensive? I'm on Medicare, you see.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Noelani. I want to emphasize that a tumor is just one possibility, and it's not necessarily the most likely. We need the ultrasound to get a definitive answer. I'll write an order for the ultrasound right now. The clinic has a radiology department, so we can schedule it for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. It usually takes about 20-30 minutes. As for the cost, Medicare typically covers most of the expense. You may have a co-pay or deductible, but our billing department will be able to give you a precise estimate. I'll have them contact you after the ultrasound to discuss the financial details. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend wearing supportive underwear and avoiding strenuous activity. If you experience any sudden, severe pain, or if you notice any redness or swelling, please contact me immediately. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning sounds… perfectly fine. Thank you, Doctor. And yes, supportive underwear and avoiding strenuous activity… I can certainly do that. I do have a rather nice pair of… compression shorts, actually. They’re very comfortable. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. And your… patience. It’s just… this is all a bit overwhelming. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any specific symptoms I should be watching out for? Or… anything at all?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Noelani. And it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease, even a little. Besides supportive underwear and avoiding strenuous activity, there isn't much else you need to do right now. Just keep an eye out for any sudden, severe pain, redness, swelling, or any changes in the size or texture of your testicle. If you experience a fever, that's also something to report. We'll get the results of the ultrasound tomorrow and discuss the next steps at that point. For now, try not to worry too much. We're taking all the necessary precautions to ensure you receive the best possible care. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up for today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. And you’ve answered all my questions, even the silly ones. Thank you again, Doctor Panjoj. I feel… much better now. Knowing what’s going on, and having a plan… that’s a great comfort. I suppose I’ll see you tomorrow morning then? .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Noelani. I'm glad I could help. And you're right, we'll see you tomorrow morning. Please come to the radiology department at 8:30 AM. They'll just need a copy of the order, which I've already sent electronically. It was nice meeting you, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. .
