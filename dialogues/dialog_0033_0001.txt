DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Jnoch, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Johney Knoch. And please, call me Johney if you prefer. It feels… less formal, you understand? Though I am accustomed to formality, naturally.
DOCTOR: Very well, Johney. Though I must admit, I find sticking to surnames keeps things… efficient. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… DeCHENE, is it? Yes, DeCHENE. My daughter, she insisted. She worries about my smoking. I’ve been… a smoker for a very long time. Sixty years, at least. And I suppose it’s time I considered… stopping. Though it won't be easy, you understand. It never is.
DOCTOR: Sixty years is… a considerable length of time. And you're here specifically to discuss cessation, then?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. Cessation. My daughter used that word. She said I should come speak with a professional, that it would… improve my chances. I’ve tried to quit a few times on my own, mostly after a particularly bad cough, but… it never sticks. It’s a habit, you see. A very deeply ingrained habit. And frankly, I’m a bit worried about what stopping will feel like. I’ve heard it’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Well, unpleasant is… a subjective term. But let's not dwell on feelings. Have you experienced any specific symptoms related to your smoking recently?
PATIENT: Symptoms… yes, now that you mention it. A persistent cough, naturally. It’s worse in the mornings. And I find myself… breathless more easily. Climbing stairs, things like that. It wasn’t this bad even five years ago, I don’t believe. Also, a bit of… discomfort in my chest sometimes. Not pain, exactly. More like a… tightness. Is that important? I haven’t mentioned it to my daughter, truthfully. I didn't want to worry her.
DOCTOR: A cough, breathlessness, and “tightness” – all fairly common in long-term smokers. How many cigarettes do you smoke per day, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly… that’s a good question. It varies, naturally. When I was working, perhaps twenty. Now that I’m retired, it’s… harder to say. Perhaps fifteen, on a good day? Sometimes more if I’m… agitated. I don't smoke during meals, never have. But afterwards… and certainly with my coffee. It’s a routine, you see. A very long-established routine. Do you need a precise number, Doctor? I could try to be more… methodical about it.
DOCTOR: An estimate is sufficient. Have you ever used any aids to help you quit – patches, gum, medication?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve read a little about patches, in magazines mostly. Seemed… messy. And my friend, Stefan, he tried the gum. He said it made his jaw ache terribly. I prefer a more… natural approach, if possible. Though I am open to suggestions, naturally. I’m not entirely opposed to modern medicine, you understand. Just… cautious. Is there anything… unpleasant about these aids? Side effects, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Side effects are… possible, as with any medication. Patches can cause skin irritation. Gum can cause jaw soreness, as you mentioned. There are also oral medications, but those come with their own set of… considerations. Before we discuss those, let’s get a basic physical exam done. Just to get a baseline. Sit up straight, please.
PATIENT: Very well. A physical exam. Naturally. I haven't had one in… a very long time. Though I do try to keep active, walking in the park mostly. But a proper examination… yes, that’s sensible. Sit up straight… yes. Do you need me to remove my coat, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, that won’t be necessary. I’m going to listen to your lungs first. Take a deep breath in… and out. Alright. A few wheezes, as expected. Now, I’m going to check your heart rate and blood pressure. Blood pressure is elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is a bit fast, but again, not unexpected given your smoking history. Chest feels… normal to palpation. Any pain with that?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… a slight discomfort, as always. It’s not sharp, you understand. More like… a pressure. I’ve gotten used to it over the years. It doesn’t really bother me, unless I exert myself. Is that… concerning, Doctor? I’m not trying to be difficult, you understand. I just want to be… informed. And my daughter… she tends to worry.
DOCTOR: The “discomfort” warrants further investigation. Given your history, we need to rule out any… underlying issues. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and a basic blood panel. That will give us a clearer picture. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t believe so. Not to pollen, certainly. I used to help my mother in the garden, and I never had any trouble. And food allergies… no. I eat… most things. Stefan, my friend, he was allergic to shellfish, but I never inherited that. Though I did have a… reaction once, years ago, to a bee sting. It wasn’t severe, just a bit of swelling. Do you need to know specifically what kind of swelling, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Bee sting allergy noted. It’s important. We'll need to be careful about that. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I pride myself on not being reliant on medication. A bit of aspirin occasionally, for a headache, perhaps. But nothing… regular. I find fresh air and a good walk are usually sufficient. I used to take something for my… digestion, years ago, but I stopped. It didn’t seem to do much good, truthfully. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. Though I am willing to consider… whatever you recommend, Doctor. Provided it doesn't involve too much… discomfort.
DOCTOR: Very well. So, no regular medications. Alright. The X-ray and blood work will give us a clearer picture. I’ll have the receptionist schedule those for you. In the meantime, I suggest you start thinking about… setting a quit date. It’s important to have a plan. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: A quit date… yes. That sounds… daunting. It’s been sixty years, Doctor. Sixty years. To simply… stop. I suppose I could consider it, but it feels… overwhelming. And what about… cravings? I’ve heard they can be quite severe. And what if I fail? Will I simply be… worse off? Perhaps… a more gradual approach would be better? I understand you’re busy, Doctor, but I’d appreciate any… guidance you can offer. About the cravings, specifically. And the… failure.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Knoch. I have other patients waiting. The X-ray and blood work will provide valuable information. We can discuss options after we have those results. There are resources available online, and I can provide you with a pamphlet. But frankly, the success of cessation depends on your willpower. I’ve given you the medical information. The rest is up to you. The receptionist will schedule your tests. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. A pamphlet… yes. And the receptionist… I see. Thank you, Doctor. Though… I must admit, I feel rather… discouraged. But my daughter… she’ll be pleased I came. Yes. .
