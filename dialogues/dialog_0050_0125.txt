DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're with Medicare, which is excellent. Now, please, tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, Dr. Paraskevopoulos. Well, to be frank, I’m here because my wife insisted. She worries too much, honestly. I just… wanted to get checked for, you know, the thing. HIV. Just to put her mind at ease, really. I don’t feel sick, or anything.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s commendable that you’re willing to address your wife’s concerns, Mr. Belan, even if you yourself aren’t experiencing any symptoms. Though, it’s always prudent to be proactive about one’s health. “The thing,” as you put it, is a serious matter and a routine check is perfectly reasonable. Before we proceed, could you elaborate a little on why your wife is concerned?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? She watches too many daytime dramas. They always have some plot line about… well, you get the idea. And she’s a bit… sensitive about these things. There's no reason to be worried, I assure you. I haven’t… done anything risky. I’m a married man, Dr. Paraskevopoulos. A responsible married man. It’s just better to rule it out, I suppose. She’ll be happier.
DOCTOR: I understand your wife’s anxieties are influencing this visit, Mr. Belan. However, it's important to approach this medically soundly, irrespective of external pressures. Dismissing concerns based solely on perceived risk factors is not appropriate medical practice. Let’s proceed systematically. To clarify for my records, when you say “risky,” could you define that for me?
PATIENT: Oh, now we’re getting into it, are we? Look, I haven’t been… fraternizing. I mean, with other women. Is that clear enough? I work, I come home to my wife, I occasionally have a beer with the lads. That's it. I'm not living a double life, if that's what you're implying. Honestly, the questions are a bit… much. I just want the test, get it over with, and go home. Is that so difficult?
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I assure you, I have no intention of making judgments or implying anything. However, a thorough medical evaluation requires a detailed history. The specifics of your activities are relevant to accurately assessing your risk and ordering the appropriate testing. It's also critical to understand that I have a professional obligation to ask these questions, and your honesty is paramount to ensuring your well-being. Now, let's reframe this. Have you ever shared needles with anyone, even for non-medical purposes?
PATIENT: Are you serious? Needles? What kind of doctor even asks that? I’m a compliance officer, not a… a drug addict! This is ridiculous. Look, I’ve answered your questions. I’m married, I’m faithful, and I certainly don't share needles. Can we just get this over with? I’ve got things to do, you know. A perfectly respectable life to get back to. I am starting to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if my line of questioning seems intrusive. However, it is standard protocol for any HIV risk assessment to include a wide range of potential exposures, even those that may seem unlikely. My objective is to ensure the most accurate and comprehensive evaluation possible, not to pass judgment. Before we proceed with ordering the test, I need to establish a complete medical history. Have you ever received a blood transfusion or had any surgical procedures?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Alright, fine. Yes, when I was a teenager – a long time ago, mind you – I broke my arm playing football. Had a surgery to fix it. And… let me think… when I first came to this country, I needed some vaccinations. That’s it! Honestly, that’s the extent of my medical adventures. A broken arm and a few jabs. Now, can we please get to the test? I’m wasting my time here. And probably yours.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s discuss your current health status. Aside from the broken arm as a teenager, do you have any ongoing medical conditions—high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: No! I am perfectly healthy. I eat reasonably well, I walk a bit, I don’t smoke. I told you, I’m a compliance officer. We’re required to have regular health checks for work. Everything is always… optimal. Look, I’m starting to feel like you don’t believe me. Are you suggesting I’m not being truthful? This is frankly insulting. Just do the test. I need a referral so I can get this over with.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I am not questioning your truthfulness. I am simply gathering information to provide the best possible care. Your insistence on minimizing any potential risk factors, while understandable, prevents me from conducting a thorough assessment. However, given your assertions of excellent health and the history you’ve provided—a broken arm, vaccinations, and regular work health checks—I will proceed with ordering an HIV antibody test. Before I do that, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Penicillin, nothing. I’m a very… robust individual. Honestly, you're making this far more complicated than it needs to be. And please, stop looking at me like that. It’s quite unsettling. Just get the referral sorted, will you? I’ve wasted enough of my afternoon here already. My wife will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is a referral to a local laboratory. They will schedule your appointment and collect the sample. The results typically take 5-7 business days. I also want to emphasize the importance of safe practices, regardless of your current beliefs about your risk. I can provide informational pamphlets on HIV prevention if you're interested. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I have no further questions. And no, I do not want a pamphlet. I think I’ve suffered enough. Thank you for your time. Though frankly, it was a rather… unpleasant experience. .
