DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Tosca, you say? Ukrainian, eh? Good. Well, it’s… it’s this darn bladder of mine. Been goin’ to the bathroom a lot lately. More than I used to, that’s for sure. It’s a nuisance, really. Wakes me up at night, too. It’s just… frequent. That’s the word, I guess. Frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent urination. I understand. And you said it’s been happening more recently?
PATIENT: Recently… well, it’s hard to say exactly when it started. Things… they all blend together after a while, you know? Probably a few months, maybe? It's not like it was a sudden thing. Just… gradually more and more trips. My wife, bless her heart, keeps track of these things. I don’t bother with details. It's just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I see. A gradual onset over a few months. That's helpful to know. And it's waking you up at night as well?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. A couple of times. Sometimes just once, sometimes… well, more than I’d like. Used to sleep right through, like a log. Now? Not so much. It's… disruptive. Honestly, it's wearin' me out. I need my rest, you know? Got a farm to look after, even if I don’t do as much as I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nighttime urination is a significant part of this, disrupting your sleep. And you mentioned a farm...do you find this impacts your ability to do your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Well, I mostly let my son handle the heavy lifting now, to be honest. But even just… puttering around the yard, checking on things… I gotta plan my trips. Can't be too far from the house, you understand? And I don't drink as much water as I should, worryin' about it. It's a bit of a… bother. Not like it used to be, when I could go all day without a thought.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s impacting your fluid intake and how comfortably you can manage your daily routines on the farm. Let's talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm. Not exactly pain. It's not sharp or anything. Sometimes… a little discomfort, maybe? A sort of… weak feeling, when I start. But it doesn't last long. Just a momentary thing. More annoying than painful, if you get what I mean. And no burnin', no. Definitely no burnin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no burning, just a momentary discomfort or a feeling of weakness when you start urinating. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color? I dunno, it looks like… urine. What color is urine supposed to be? I haven't been lookin' at it, if you want the truth. Smell? Not that I've noticed, no. My nose isn't what it used to be, you see. My wife might notice somethin', but she hasn't said nothin'. She'd tell me if it smelled bad, believe me!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright, let’s move on to some other questions then. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not a fever. I feel… normal temperature, I suppose. Chills, no. And lower abdominal pain… well, my back aches a bit sometimes, but that's just old age, I reckon. I don’t think that’s related. It's just… a general achiness. Not specifically in my lower abdomen. No sharp pains or anything like that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or specific abdominal pain. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, the doctor told me years ago my blood pressure was a little high, but they put me on a pill for it. I take it every day, I think. Can’t quite remember the name of it... And I had a touch of the flu a few years back, but that’s about it. Nothing serious, really. No diabetes, no heart problems. Just… gettin' old, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll look into that blood pressure medication in your records. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Took all sorts of things over the years. My wife always says I'm too stubborn to even feel sick, let alone be allergic to somethin’. She’s probably right. No, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Let me think... There’s a little something for my knees, sometimes. When they’re botherin’ me. A cream, mostly. And I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, ‘cause the doctor said I wasn’t gettin’ enough sun. That's about it, I think. Just the blood pressure pill, the cream for my knees, and the vitamin D. My wife handles most of it, though. She's good at keepin' track of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication, a cream for your knees as needed, and vitamin D. Let me just take a look at your records to confirm those medications. Okay, it looks like you’re on Lisinopril for blood pressure, and you have a prescription for Diclofenac gel for your knees. The vitamin D isn’t listed here, but that’s not uncommon. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me see… Years ago, I had my appendix out. That was a long time ago, when I was just a young man. And I had a hernia operation, maybe twenty years ago. That was a bit unpleasant, I remember. Other than that, no. Nothing major. Just those two.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a hernia repair. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My father had… well, he had a weak heart, I think. Died young, actually. My mother lived a long life, but she had… arthritis, I believe. Badly crippled in her later years. And my wife's mother had… something with her kidneys, I think. But I don't remember the details. We didn’t talk about these things much. It's all a bit hazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can make a note of those family history items. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and it didn’t do him any good. And alcohol… I used to have a beer now and then, with dinner, but not anymore. My wife says it doesn't agree with my blood pressure. So, I stick to water, mostly. Or juice, sometimes. Nothing strong, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking and minimal alcohol. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam if that’s alright. Just to check your abdomen and listen to your heart and lungs. We’ll also check your prostate, as frequent urination can be related to prostate issues. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Prostate… well, now. That sounds… a bit personal, doesn’t it? Is it really necessary? I mean, I'm just havin' trouble sleepin' and goin' to the bathroom. Is it really somethin' to do with… that? I suppose if you think it’s necessary… but it doesn't sound very pleasant. I trust your judgment, Doctor. But I'm warnin’ you, I'm a bit of a delicate flower these days.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Segretto. You’re right, it can be a bit uncomfortable, but it's a very important part of evaluating frequent urination in men your age. It will help us rule out some common causes and make sure we’re on the right track. It won’t take long, and I’ll explain everything as I go. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your abdomen. If you’re comfortable, we'll proceed with the prostate exam after that. We can always stop if you're uncomfortable. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Alright… I suppose you're right. Best to be thorough, eh? Heart and lungs first, you say? That sounds alright. And you promise to explain everything? And we can stop if it gets too… uncomfortable? Alright. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, will ya? And don't be surprised if I flinch a bit. I'm not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible and explain each step. Okay, just take some nice, deep breaths for me. In through the nose… and out through the mouth. And again, nice and deep. Heart sounds are regular, a bit of expected age-related changes, but nothing concerning. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your abdomen. I’m going to gently press on different areas to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Just let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Alright… Deep breaths, you said? Hmm. Doesn’t feel too bad so far. A little pressure, but nothin’ awful. My stomach's always a bit tender, to be honest. Old age, I reckon. Ooh, there. That's a bit… sensitive. Not sharp pain, just… discomfort. Right there, on the left side. That’s where I sometimes feel a bit of a ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, I noticed that as well. Some mild tenderness on the left side. It could be related to a number of things, and we’ll need to investigate further. Now, as we discussed, to complete the exam, I’d like to check your prostate. You’ll be lying on your side, and I’ll gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. This allows me to feel the size and texture of your prostate. It's a quick exam, and it can provide valuable information. Are you ready to proceed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… now. You make it sound so… clinical. A gloved finger, you say? Into there? Look, Doctor, with all due respect… I’m an old man. I’ve lived a long life. Is this really necessary? Couldn't we just… try some pills first? Or maybe a different doctor? I just don't think I can… I just don't think I can handle that right now. It feels… invasive.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, I completely understand your hesitation. It’s perfectly natural to feel uncomfortable with this part of the exam. You're right to express your concerns. My intention is absolutely not to cause you any distress. And you are right to ask if there are other options. We can discuss starting some initial tests, like a urine analysis to look for infection or other abnormalities, and potentially a blood test to check your kidney function. However, a prostate exam is the most reliable way to assess the size and condition of your prostate, which is often the cause of frequent urination in men your age. We can also discuss referring you to a urologist, a specialist in urinary health, if you'd prefer. They would be able to perform a more thorough evaluation and discuss all of your options. Ultimately, the decision is yours. I want you to feel comfortable and respected. If you truly prefer to skip the prostate exam at this time, we can proceed with the other tests and consider a referral to a urologist. What feels most comfortable for you right now?
PATIENT: Well… that’s… that’s a relief to hear. You’re not pushin’ me into somethin’ I don’t want to do? I appreciate that, Doctor. Honestly, the thought of that… it just makes me uneasy. If we could just start with the tests, the urine and the blood… and maybe see a specialist if it doesn't clear things up? That would be… much better. I trust your judgment, Doctor. But I really don’t think I can handle that exam right now. No offense meant, of course.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. No offense taken at all. Your comfort is my priority. We will definitely start with the urine analysis and blood tests. I’ll write the orders for those now. We'll check for infection, kidney function, and some other basic indicators. Okay, the orders are sent to the lab. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment for blood draw and urine collection. It should be within the next couple of days. I’ll also prepare a referral to Dr. Anya Petrova, a highly respected urologist in the area. She's very good at explaining things and working with patients to find the best solution. I'll send that electronically to her office, and they’ll call you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, try to drink a moderate amount of fluids – not too much, not too little. And if you notice any fever, chills, or significant pain, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… I appreciate you listenin' to me and not pushin’ me into somethin' I wasn’t comfortable with. It means a lot. A referral to Dr. Petrova, you say? That sounds good. I'll wait for her to call. Thank you, Doctor. I think that's all for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Segretto. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’re here for you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You too. A good day to you as well.
