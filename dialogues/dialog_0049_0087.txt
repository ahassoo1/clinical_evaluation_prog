DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… lab work, I think? That’s what the lady on the phone said, anyway. Honestly, it all feels a bit… fuzzy. Just the usual check-up stuff, I suppose? I don’t really keep track of these things anymore.
DOCTOR: “Usual check-up stuff,” you say. Right. Well, let's try to clarify. You mentioned lab work... do you know which lab work?
PATIENT: Which lab work… hmm. No, not offhand. Something about… blood? And maybe… pee? Honestly, Doctor, I wish I could be more helpful. It was a while ago when I made the appointment. Just tell me what needs doing and I’ll do it. I’m a pretty easy patient, I think.
DOCTOR: "Easy" isn't quite the word we strive for in medicine, Mr. Croonquist. It's helpful to know why these tests were ordered. Let me pull up your records here… Ah, yes. It appears you had some blood work done on July 12th, and a urine analysis. The results flagged a slightly elevated creatinine level and some protein in your urine. That's what prompted a follow-up. Do you have any history of kidney problems, or have you been told about any issues with your kidneys before?
PATIENT: Kidney problems… protein in my… Now you're really asking! I don’t think so. Never been told anything about my kidneys. I used to work at the power plant, you know. Lots of… machinery. Maybe something from that? I really don't remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: A power plant, you say?
PATIENT: That's right. Big place, always humming and whirring. Kept the lights on for half the state, they said. Did a lot of monitoring, checking gauges… things like that. Not that it matters now. Old news.
DOCTOR: It could be relevant, Mr. Croonquist. Some industrial exposures can affect kidney function. But let's not jump to conclusions. Are you currently experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Not that I’ve noticed. I get tired sometimes, but I'm 73, Doctor. I figure that comes with the territory. Maybe a little thirsty now and then, but I always have been. No… no, I don’t think so. Nothing really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your urine?
PATIENT: My urine? What do you want to know about my urine? Is it supposed to look a certain way? I just… go when I need to go. No pain, no burning… it's just… urine. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll need to perform a brief physical examination, Mr. Croonquist. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your abdomen. Then, I’d like to collect a urine sample to repeat the analysis. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, alright? I’ve got… things to do. And I’m not very good with needles, if that matters.
DOCTOR: No needles today, Mr. Croonquist. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs… Breathing seems clear. Heart rate is regular, though slightly fast. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little bit there, on the… right side? But it’s probably just gas. I had a sandwich for lunch. I get a lot of gas these days.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. That’s… interesting. Now, if you could please step over to the restroom, I'll have a sample cup ready for you. It's important to collect a "mid-stream" sample—that means you start urinating, and then collect a sample mid-way through the process. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Mid-stream? You mean… don’t pee in the middle of the stream? Is that what you want? I don’t… I don’t understand. I just go when I need to go, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Croonquist. Let me rephrase. Start urinating into the cup, and then collect the sample. Do not include the very first portion of your urine, and do not stop until you’ve filled the cup adequately. I have a diagram here… It's a little old, but it illustrates the process. Or, I can have a nurse explain it to you. It's quite important for accurate results.
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. A nurse? Really? Look, just… forget the whole thing. I’m too old for this. Just tell me if I’m sick or not. I haven't got time for complicated peeing instructions.
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, accurate testing is crucial. I'm attempting to gather the necessary information to provide you with the best possible care. However, if you refuse to cooperate with a simple urine sample, it will be difficult to determine the cause of your elevated creatinine and protein levels. Frankly, your approach is… unhelpful. Perhaps we should schedule another appointment when you're more willing to participate. I’ll have the nurse escort you out.
PATIENT: Fine! Fine! Just… get it over with. A nurse, then. I suppose I haven’t got much choice. Honestly, doctors these days… all about the paperwork and the peeing instructions.
