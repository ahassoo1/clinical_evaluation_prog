DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Doctor Piet, eh? Well, look here. It's this… this shape. I don't like it. Been lookin' in the mirror, and it just ain't right. Always been a strong man, pile drivin' and all, but now… well, now it's lookin' soft. Want somethin' done about it. Quickly, if you please. I ain't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I understand your concern about a change in your body shape. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more specifically where you’re noticing this change?
PATIENT: Change? Change everywhere, woman! Look at my belly, it's hangin' like a sack of potatoes. And my arms… used to be solid muscle, now they wobble. Even my legs ain't what they used to be. It's all… loose. Everywhere! You got eyes, don't you? Don't need me to draw you a picture.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do, Mr. Trendler. And I appreciate you pointing that out. It sounds like you've noticed a decrease in muscle mass and an increase in what feels like fat, all over. Has this change been gradual, or did you notice it happening suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual? Woman, I been workin' since I was a boy! It ain't like somethin' happened suddenly. It's been slippin' away for… well, for a good while now. Years, probably. Just didn't bother me 'til now. Now it's… embarrassin'. You understand embarrassin', right? A man's gotta have some pride.
DOCTOR: I certainly do, Mr. Trendler. It's very common to notice changes in body composition as we get older, and it’s perfectly understandable to want to address it. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about your usual diet?
PATIENT: Diet? Humph. What is a diet? I eat. Food keeps a man goin'. I eat what my wife used to cook - rice and beans, fish when I can get it, some chicken. Not fancy, nothin' special. And I drink a little rum sometimes, to relax after a hard day. That's it. Don't bother me with fancy food questions, I ain't one of them city folk.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And how about your activity level?
PATIENT: Activity level? I work, woman! Pile drivin' is activity! Been doin' it fifty years. It's hard labor, all day in the sun. That's enough activity for ten men. I ain't runnin' marathons or liftin' weights, if that's what you're askin'. Just… work.
DOCTOR: Right, so physically demanding work, but not necessarily other forms of exercise. Do you ever feel particularly tired or weak, even after a good night's sleep?
PATIENT: Tired? Weak? Of course I'm tired! Fifty years of pile drivin' will wear a man down. But I push through it. Always have. It's just… lately, it takes a little longer to get goin' in the mornin'. And sometimes, my bones ache a bit. But a little rum usually helps with that. Look, are we gettin' anywhere with this or are we just talkin' in circles? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Mr. Trendler. I just want to rule out a few things. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to check your muscle strength, reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Examine? Look at me? I know my own body, thank you very much! Been workin’ it for decades. But… if you insist. Get it over with quickly, then. Don’t poke and prod too much. I ain’t no baby.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the table for me, please. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. And finally, I’m going to check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Grumbling sounds Fine, fine. Squeezin', squeezin’… always somethin’ with doctors. Squeezes Dr. Piet’s hands with moderate force. There. Happy now? Now get on with it. I ain’t got all day to be prodded and poked.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Trendler. Your strength is… diminished, as you’ve described, but there's no obvious weakness or pain with movement. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing age-related loss of muscle mass, which is normal, but can be improved. It’s also good to rule out other potential causes. I'd like to order some blood tests just to check your vitamin D levels, thyroid function, and basic kidney and liver function. That will help us get a clearer picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? More pokin’ and proddin’? Humph. I don’t like needles. But… if it gets me outta here quicker, alright. Just don’t take too much blood. A man needs his blood to keep workin’. And tell me straight, what’s it gonna cost? I ain’t payin’ for fancy tests I don’t need.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the blood tests, Mr. Trendler. It's just a small sample, and we'll be as quick as possible. The cost will be covered by your insurance, but I can have the billing department give you an estimate beforehand if you'd like. Okay, I’m sending the order to the lab now. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment. While we wait for those results, I recommend focusing on incorporating more protein into your diet - things like fish, beans, and chicken, as you already eat. And, if possible, adding some light strength training exercises, even just lifting small weights or doing bodyweight exercises a few times a week. Would you be open to a referral to a physical therapist who could help you with a safe and effective exercise program?
PATIENT: Physical therapist? Look here, I been liftin' piles for fifty years! I don't need a therapist to tell me how to lift things! That's ridiculous. Protein, alright. I can eat more fish. But no therapists. Just get me the results of them blood tests, and let me get back to work. I'm wastin' daylight here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. No therapist. We'll focus on the blood tests and increasing your protein intake. I'll have the lab results sent to me as soon as they're available, and we can discuss them at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. None at all. Just get me outta here. I got things to do, and a life to live. And don't expect me to be comin' back for no fancy follow-up if them tests don't show somethin' serious. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Trendler. Thank you for coming in today. We'll be in touch with the results. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
