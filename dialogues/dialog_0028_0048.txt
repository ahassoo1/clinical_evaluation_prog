DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Lason, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Colt Lason. And my wife, Srey, is with me. She’s the one who insisted I come. Says I’ve been…forgetful lately. Though I don’t see it.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s good of you both to come in. Forgetfulness can be…multifactorial. Now, let’s try to be efficient, shall we?
PATIENT: Efficient is good. I don’t have all day to sit around explaining things. What exactly do you need to know? I’m a tile and stone setter, you know. I do things with my hands, not…talk about my feelings.
DOCTOR: Right. Very well. Let's start with why your wife brought you in today. Specifically, what has she observed that concerns her?
PATIENT: She says I’ve been… confused. Asking the same questions over and over. Getting lost driving to jobs I’ve done a hundred times. Little things. She makes it sound like I'm losing my mind. Honestly, I think she worries too much. It’s hot out, you know. Makes a man a little…slow. But I’m still perfectly capable. I just finished a beautiful mosaic for Mrs. Henderson last week. Perfect grout lines, every single one.
DOCTOR: “Subject reports wife’s concern regarding recent confusion, repetitive questioning, and navigational difficulties. Attributes symptoms to heat.” Alright. And have you noticed anything different yourself, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Different? No. Not really. I mean, things take a little longer sometimes. I might have to ask Srey where I put my tape measure, but all old men misplace things. It's not a sign of…whatever she thinks it is. I’m sharp as a tack. Always have been. I remember every single tile I’ve ever laid. Every single customer. I have a good memory. A very good memory.
DOCTOR: Very good. Let’s try to be specific. Can you recall what you had for breakfast this morning?
PATIENT: Breakfast? What a strange question. Srey made something. Rice porridge, I think. With…fish sauce. And a little bit of pickled vegetables. She always puts pickled vegetables in my porridge. Though, now that you mention it, it tasted a little…off. Not bad, exactly, but different. I told her it didn’t have enough chili flakes. Does that count as remembering? I remember the chili flakes were missing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And before that?
PATIENT: Before that? Yesterday? We went to the market. Srey bought a whole fish, a big one. And some mangoes. She always buys too many mangoes. And old man Vong tried to sell us some bad durian again. I told him to take his durian somewhere else. I also fixed the leaky faucet in the kitchen. Took me a while to find the right wrench, but I got it done. A good, tight seal. No drips. What are you getting at? Are you accusing me of something?
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I’m simply trying to get a clear picture of your recent memory. It seems you recall events, but the details are…sparse. Now, have you experienced any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches? Sometimes. A little dull ache behind the eyes. Nothing major. Probably just from the sun. I work outside all day, you know. And sometimes Srey makes me help her in the garden. Bending over, pulling weeds…that can give a man a headache. But it’s nothing a little rest and a cup of strong tea can’t fix. Why are you asking about headaches? Is this about something serious? My wife is a terrible worrier, she'll have a fit if you say anything is wrong.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I need you to be direct with me. Have you experienced any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision? Well… now that you mention it, things haven’t been quite as…sharp. Not blurry, exactly. More like…distant. Like looking through a dirty window. I thought it was just my glasses needed cleaning. Srey keeps telling me to get them checked. But I don't like going to the eye doctor. They always poke and prod. Besides, I can still see well enough to lay tile. Perfect diagonals, every single time. I wouldn’t be able to do that if my vision was really bad. But…yes. A little blurry around the edges, maybe. I haven’t told Srey because I didn’t want her to worry. She’ll fuss something awful. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. It's good you're telling me this. We’ll need to do a brief neurological exam, and I’d like to check your vital signs. Then, I think a referral to both an ophthalmologist and a neurologist is warranted. It’s best to rule things out, Mr. Lason. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but we need more information. Please, have a seat. Srey, if you could tell me about any changes you’ve noticed in his personality or behavior recently, that would be helpful. While I examine your husband.
PATIENT: Personality? He’s always been… stubborn. Independent. Doesn’t like asking for help. But… lately, he’s been more easily agitated. Forgetful, of course, but also… quicker to anger. Small things that never bothered him before now seem to upset him. And he's… quieter. Doesn't talk as much. He used to tell me stories about his day, about the tiles he laid, the customers he met. Now he just… sits. He’s still my Colt, but… different. Less like himself. And he doesn't like me asking questions. Says I worry too much. Which I do, I admit. But it’s because I love him. After all these years… you notice things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Srey. That’s very helpful. Alright, Mr. Lason. Let's start with a simple memory test. I’m going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. And then, I’ll ask you to recall them again in about five minutes. The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them for me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Easy enough. Though what does this have to do with anything? I can remember a thousand tile patterns, but you want me to repeat three simple words? It’s… insulting, frankly. Still, I'll play your game. Apple, table, penny. Are we finished yet?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140 over 90. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is normal. Reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits. Balance is… a little unsteady. And I noticed some mild rigidity in his extremities. Has he experienced any falls recently?
PATIENT: Falls? Not exactly falls. He stumbled a little last week, getting out of the truck. But he caught himself. He's always been a bit clumsy. Stubborn, too. Didn’t want me to help him. Said he was fine. He doesn’t like admitting weakness, ever. He’s a proud man, my Colt. Always has been. But he has been bumping into things more often lately. Forgetting where he puts his tools… little things. But it’s getting worse. I’m glad we came. I knew something wasn’t right.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings of the exam, I’m concerned about possible cognitive impairment. It could be a number of things – early dementia, vascular issues, even a vitamin deficiency. It’s too early to say definitively. I'm ordering a full blood panel, including a Vitamin B12 level and a thyroid function test. I'm also scheduling an MRI of his brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. And, as I said before, referrals to both an ophthalmologist and a neurologist are essential. Mr. Lason, I understand you're reluctant, but these tests are important. They will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Srey, it’s important that you continue to monitor his symptoms closely and report any changes to me immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Treatment plan? You mean… there’s something wrong with me? I’ve lived a good life, worked hard my whole life. I built things with my hands. I don't need a 'treatment plan'. I just… forget things sometimes. It’s the heat, I tell you! And Srey worries too much. Is this what you wanted? To drag me to doctors and poke and prod and tell me I’m…broken? What kind of neurologist are you talking about? What will they do? I don’t want any fancy tests. I just want to go home. Is that too much to ask? And what about the MRI? Is that… painful? I don't like small spaces. I don’t understand any of this. It's all… frightening. Stop. I want to think about it. I need Srey to explain everything. I can't do this alone.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your concerns, and I assure you, we’ll proceed at your pace. The neurologist will evaluate your cognitive function and determine if further testing is necessary. The MRI is a non-invasive imaging procedure; it doesn’t involve any pain, though it can be a little claustrophobic. We can discuss options for managing that if necessary. I'm providing you with a detailed referral letter and the necessary paperwork for the blood tests. Srey can certainly assist you in understanding the process. It’s important to remember that early detection is crucial. Addressing potential issues now can significantly improve your quality of life. Srey, I’ll be happy to discuss this further with you at your convenience. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review the test results. Do you have any immediate questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Just… tell me one thing. Will this… change me? Will I still be me? I don't want to lose myself. I want to remember my wife, my work, the life I've built. That's all I care about. And… can I still lay tile? Is that still possible? That's what I do. That's who I am. I need to know. Stop. I think… I need to sit down. I'm getting… overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, that’s a perfectly valid question, and one I wish I could answer with absolute certainty. It's true that cognitive impairment can sometimes lead to changes in personality and memory, but that’s not always the case. And even when changes do occur, it doesn’t mean you lose your essence, your core self. We'll do everything we can to help you maintain your independence and quality of life. As for laying tile… that depends on the cause of your symptoms and the extent of any impairment. It's impossible to say definitively at this point. But we’ll work with you to determine what you're still capable of and find ways to adapt if necessary. Right now, let’s focus on getting those tests done. That will give us the answers we need to move forward. Srey, let's get you both settled. I'll see you in two weeks. Stop.
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Tests. Let's get it over with. But… Srey, you're coming with me. Every step of the way. And… no poking. No prodding. And… I want a second opinion. Just in case. Stop.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will provide you with information on obtaining a second opinion. Srey, my assistant will help schedule the necessary appointments and answer any questions you may have. I hope the tests provide some clarity. Stop.
PATIENT: Stop.
