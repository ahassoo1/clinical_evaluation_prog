DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Nice to meet ya too. Uh… well, somethin’ about insurance. My daughter, she set this up. Long-term care, I think? It’s all kinda blurry, to be honest. She said I needed to get checked out for it. I just… move stuff around for work, mostly. Hand laborin’, ya know? Not much to it.
DOCTOR: Right, long-term care planning. That’s a good idea to get things sorted. And you're doing some physical work… moving things around. Okay. Just to be clear, is there anything specific bothering you?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Not really. My back gets a little stiff sometimes, after a long day. Old work injury, years back. But it ain't nothin' a little rest don't fix. And my knees… they creak a bit when the weather changes. My wife, bless her heart, used to say I was gettin' old. She knew best.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little back stiffness from an old injury and some creaky knees… that’s common as well, especially with physical work. When did you notice the back stiffness starting, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly… gosh. A long time ago. Maybe… twenty years ago? I was liftin’ somethin’ heavy, real awkward shape. Felt a pop, then it just… hurt. Went to a doc then, got some pills, some rest. Seemed to help at the time. It flares up now and then, but… I just push through it. Old habit, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, twenty years ago. And when you say it “flares up,” can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a sharp pain, ya know? More like a dull ache. Real deep in my lower back. And it gets worse if I bend over or twist. Sometimes it shoots down my leg a little, but not always. It usually gets better after I sit down and rest for a bit. It don't keep me up at night or nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in the lower back, worse with bending and twisting, and sometimes radiating down the leg… That’s helpful. And you said it doesn’t interfere with your sleep. Now, about your knees… you mentioned creaking. Is that all it is – creaking?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly just creakin’. Sounds like old wood, kinda. It's worse in the mornin', or when it's cold out. Sometimes they feel a little stiff, hard to bend all the way. I don't get much pain, just a little achy if I walk a long ways. My daughter keeps tellin’ me to take it easy, but… I gotta work, ya know? Bills don't pay themselves.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Rover. Let’s just do a quick check of your back and knees, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. I ain't afraid of a little lookin’ over. Just tell me if it’s gonna hurt, alright? My bones ain't as young as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be gentle, and I’ll let you know before I do anything that might be uncomfortable. If anything does hurt, please tell me immediately. Alright, if you could just lie down on your back for me, please. And we'll start with your back. Okay, just relaxing... does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Ooh, there… yeah, right there kinda hurts. Not a sharp pain, just… achy. Like a bruise, almost. It's been feelin' like that for a few days now, actually. I thought it was just from overdoin’ it at work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And does bending forward or twisting make that pain worse?
PATIENT: Yeah… definitely worse when I bend. And twistin’… ooh, don’t even ask. Feels like somethin’s pullin’ in there. Not terrible, but definitely uncomfortable. I try to avoid doin’ too much bendin’ and twistin’ at work, but… sometimes ya gotta.
DOCTOR: Alright, and your knees… can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: They bend… but not as far as they used to. Feels a little stiff, kinda grindy. No real pain, just… not smooth, ya know? And there's a little pop sometimes when I bend 'em real far. It don't bother me much, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m not feeling any significant warmth or swelling in either knee. And I can feel a little bit of crepitus – that's the grinding sound you mentioned – which is common with some wear and tear. Now, can you tell me a little more about the kind of work you do?
PATIENT: Well, I mostly load and unload trucks. Heavy boxes, pallets, sometimes furniture. Lots of liftin', carryin', and movin' stuff around. I work about… five days a week, eight hours a day. It's hard work, but… it's honest work. I try to take breaks when I can, but sometimes it gets pretty fast-paced.
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a good idea of what you're dealing with. Just let me quickly check your chart for any previous medical history or medications… Okay, I see here you had a back injury about twenty years ago. And you’re not currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Yeah, that was the one. Got it looked at, got some pills, took it easy for a bit. Seemed to fix it up enough to get back to work. And no, I don't take nothin' regularly. Don't like takin' pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some chronic lower back pain, likely aggravated by your work. The creaky knees are probably related to some wear and tear, also common with physical labor. Now, I wouldn’t say this is anything immediately alarming, but it’s definitely something we should address. Would you be open to trying some physical therapy to help strengthen your back and improve your range of motion?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… hmm. I ain’t never done that before. Sounds kinda fancy. But… if it helps, I guess I’m willing to try. I just don't wanna be out of work for too long, ya know? Bills…
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Physical therapy doesn't usually require a long time off work. They'll work with you to create a plan that fits your schedule. It’s mostly exercises and stretches to strengthen your core and back muscles, and improve your flexibility. It can really help manage the pain and prevent future flare-ups. I'm going to write you a referral to a good physical therapist here in town. They'll do a full assessment and create a personalized plan for you. I'll also recommend some over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help manage the pain in the meantime. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter stuff… yeah, I’ve taken ibuprofen before. Works okay sometimes. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… when do I go see this therapist? And will my insurance cover it? That’s important, ya know. Bills…
DOCTOR: Here’s the referral. The therapist's office will contact you to schedule an appointment. As for insurance, yes, your private insurance should cover physical therapy, but it’s always a good idea to check with your insurance provider beforehand to confirm your coverage and any potential out-of-pocket costs. The therapist's office can also help you with that. I'll also put some notes in your chart about managing your back pain, including proper lifting techniques and posture. And remember, if the pain gets significantly worse or you develop any new symptoms, like numbness or weakness in your legs, please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Rover?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You been a big help, Doc. Thank ya for listenin’ to an old man complain. I’ll give this therapist a call and see what they say. And I’ll try to be more careful liftin' stuff, I guess. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rover. It was my pleasure. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care of yourself, and I hope the physical therapy helps. Have a good day.
