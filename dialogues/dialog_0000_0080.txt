DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. I'm Dr. Batara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need to get some forms filled out, really. Medicare sent 'em, said I needed to update some things. Nothing major, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Forms, huh?
PATIENT: Yep. They didn't say which forms exactly, just that I needed to get it done. Seemed kinda vague, honestly. Is there a list somewhere I should be looking at?
DOCTOR: Well, Medicare is often vague. Let's see… it looks like you’re due for your annual Wellness visit. That includes a few questionnaires and a physical. It’s not just about updating information, it's to make sure everything is as it should be. Are you having any specific health concerns right now, or is this purely for the paperwork?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. A wellness visit. I didn't realize. No, no real concerns, thankfully. Just been…busy, you know? Work keeps me moving. But a check-up is probably a good idea. I just wasn't expecting a whole visit when I thought it was just forms.
DOCTOR: "Busy" doesn't preclude health problems, Ms. Fabing. It often causes them. We'll keep it efficient. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history. I see you've been seen here before. Do you have any major illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Nothing major, no. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that healed up fine. And I had my tonsils out when I was little, too. Other than that…just the usual colds and flu, I guess. Nothing serious enough to be hospitalized or anything. I'm pretty healthy, for the most part.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, childhood fracture… noted. Family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… my grandma on my mom’s side had diabetes, I think. And my dad… he had high blood pressure, but he managed it with diet and stuff. That's about all I know, honestly. We weren't a big family for talking about health stuff, you know? It was kinda…private.
DOCTOR: "Private" can be detrimental, Ms. Fabing. Important information. Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My mom always said I had an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. Keeps me going, I guess. Nothing else, no. I try to eat pretty healthy, so I don't really need much. Just the basic stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched it. I have a glass of wine maybe once or twice a month with dinner, that’s it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I don't hold with any of that.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, let's do a brief physical exam. I'll check your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, temperature—and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we'll do a quick neurological assessment. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I haven’t been on one of these in a while. Hope I don’t fall off!
DOCTOR: Try to relax, Ms. Fabing. I’ll be right here. Blood pressure first… 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is 98.6. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… normal. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your arms relaxed. Reflexes are normal, bilaterally.
PATIENT: Okay, everything sounds good so far, I guess. It's funny, I always feel so… exposed up here on the table! But I appreciate you checking everything. Is that elevated blood pressure something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: It's a single reading, Ms. Fabing. Stress can elevate blood pressure. We'll monitor it. Now, let's check your weight and height. 70 kilograms, 171 centimeters. That puts your BMI at 24.1. Within the normal range. Now, are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, no pain right now. Sometimes my back gets a little stiff after a long day at work, but it usually works itself out with a hot shower. Nothing I can't handle. Honestly, work's pretty physical, so I'm used to being a little sore.
DOCTOR: “Occasional back stiffness related to occupation.” Alright. Now, just a few questions to complete the Wellness visit… Have you had a flu shot this year?
PATIENT: Nope, haven't gotten around to it yet. It's still pretty early, right? I usually get it in October or November. I always forget to think about it sooner.
DOCTOR: “Patient reports no flu vaccination this season.” It’s never too early, Ms. Fabing. And have you had a tetanus booster in the last ten years?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I honestly can’t remember. I think… maybe? When I was working on that construction site last year, I think they made everyone get a shot, but I don’t remember what it was for. It was a whole group thing, you know?
DOCTOR: “Patient uncertain regarding tetanus vaccination status.” Alright. Now, finally, have you had a colonoscopy or any other screening for colorectal cancer?
PATIENT: Oh boy… now that I definitely haven’t had. I’ve… avoided that one. Always sounded kinda unpleasant, to be honest. Is that something I need to be thinking about now? I'm only 35.
DOCTOR: You are at the age where screening should be discussed, Ms. Fabing. It is preventative. We will review your risk factors and determine the appropriate course of action. Alright. Based on the information we've gathered, I recommend scheduling a colonoscopy within the next year. And I suggest getting your flu shot as soon as possible. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your blood pressure and monitor it over time. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Wow, okay. That's…a lot. A colonoscopy already? I didn't realize. Okay, well, I guess I need to think about that. And I'll schedule the flu shot. Um… what exactly is involved with a colonoscopy? Like, what do I need to do to prepare? That's probably the biggest thing I'm worried about right now. It just sounds…intense.
DOCTOR: It involves bowel preparation, Ms. Fabing. You will need to follow a special diet for several days prior to the procedure and then take a strong laxative to completely empty your bowels. The procedure itself is performed under sedation, so you will be asleep. A thin, flexible tube with a camera is inserted into your rectum to visualize your colon. It is a crucial screening for detecting and preventing colorectal cancer. We have detailed instructions available, and the nursing staff can walk you through the process. There are resources there, and you can also find information online. Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… a special diet and a strong laxative. That doesn't sound fun at all. I think I'll definitely need to take those pamphlets. And maybe talk to the nurse before I schedule anything. I just… I’ve always avoided thinking about all that stuff. It’s kinda scary. Is it really necessary at my age? I mean, are a lot of people my age getting these colonoscopies? I just… feel like I’m jumping the gun a little bit.
DOCTOR: “Necessary” is a strong word, Ms. Fabing. It is recommended. Guidelines have shifted. Early detection is key. While it’s true that the incidence of colorectal cancer is lower in younger adults, it is increasing. And when it is detected early, it’s far more treatable. You have a family history of diabetes, which increases your risk. It’s a preventative measure, and frankly, it’s irresponsible to ignore it. I understand your apprehension, but I strongly urge you to consider it. We'll schedule a consultation with the gastroenterologist to discuss your concerns and answer any questions you may have. Do you want me to have the nursing staff schedule that for you now?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. You're right. I just… it’s a lot to process. I guess I should at least talk to the gastroenterologist. Yes, please. If you could schedule that for me, that would be great. And… maybe give me a few days to read those pamphlets before I have to make any decisions? I'm just… not looking forward to this. But I trust you, I guess. And I should probably be responsible. So, yeah. Schedule the consultation. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Very well. I've scheduled a consultation with Dr. Chen for two weeks from today. The nursing staff will contact you to confirm the appointment. They will also provide you with the necessary information regarding bowel preparation. We’ve covered a great deal today, Ms. Fabing. Remember to prioritize your flu shot and schedule your colonoscopy consultation. I expect you to follow through with these recommendations. Are there any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. And… thank you for pushing me to think about all this, even though I’m not thrilled about it. I appreciate you looking out for me. I’ll schedule the flu shot as soon as I get home. And I’ll… try not to panic about the colonoscopy. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: See that you do, Ms. Fabing. And remember, preventative care is paramount.
