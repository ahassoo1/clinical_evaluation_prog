DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Though I must say, I have very little time for…pleasantries. It’s about my work, naturally. It’s…difficult to explain to people who haven’t dedicated their lives to the proper organization of knowledge, but…it’s rather stressful, you see. Frankly, it’s beneath me to even have to explain it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like this is important to you, and I appreciate you coming in to discuss it. While I may not be familiar with the specifics of your work, I'm happy to listen and do my best to help. Perhaps you could start by telling me what's been making it stressful lately?
PATIENT: It's not a matter of what has been stressful, Doctor. It is the entire…atmosphere. The students, for one. They have no respect for the Dewey Decimal System, none at all. And the administration…well, let's just say they prefer “innovation” to…order. It’s a complete and utter mess. Honestly, it's quite demoralizing for someone of my…calibre. I've been doing this for…a very long time.
DOCTOR: I see. So it sounds like the changes at work are causing you a lot of frustration and impacting your morale. It's understandable to feel discouraged when your values and methods aren't respected, especially after dedicating so much time to your profession. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms alongside this stress – things like headaches, trouble sleeping, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Doctor, I am eighty-seven years old! Of course, I have physical symptoms. Aches and pains are simply…part of the package. What does that have to do with…improper cataloging? Honestly, you’re asking me to associate the natural decline of age with…students who cannot alphabetize. It’s…absurd. Though, I suppose my sleep has been…interrupted. By thoughts of the chaos, naturally. Not some ailment.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer, and I apologize if my question seemed insensitive. You're right to point out the difference between general age-related discomfort and symptoms directly related to stress. It’s good you’ve identified that the interrupted sleep is linked to your worries about work. Let’s focus on that then. How frequently would you say your sleep is interrupted?
PATIENT: Frequently? Doctor, it’s almost nightly. I lie awake, contemplating the misfiling of journals and the improper use of cross-references. It’s…a constant torment. I used to have a perfectly organized mind, you understand. Now it's cluttered with…academic negligence. Honestly, it’s a tragedy. A perfectly good intellect wasted on…this. Is there a pill for…administrative incompetence?
DOCTOR: I understand. Almost nightly disruption is significant, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like this is really impacting your quality of life. And while there isn't a pill for administrative incompetence, we can certainly address the sleep disturbance. Before we talk about possible solutions for your sleep, I'd like to get a slightly broader picture. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Doctor, I eat when I am hungry. It’s a simple concept, really. Perhaps I’ve had less of an appetite for…foolishness, but that is hardly a medical condition. The blandness of the cafeteria food doesn't help, of course. It lacks…substance, much like the curriculum these days. But no, I haven't been losing my appetite. I simply have less desire for…mediocrity.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. And thank you for your patience with my questions, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like the stress related to work is the primary driver of your sleep issues, and you're still maintaining a reasonable appetite. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history? Doctor, I’ve lived a long life. There have been…various ailments, naturally. A touch of arthritis, a minor operation decades ago…Honestly, it’s all rather unimportant. What relevance does a past bout of influenza have to the systemic failings of modern education? I assure you, my health is perfectly adequate for…observing the decline of civilization. I fail to see the point of dredging up ancient history. Is this…standard procedure?
DOCTOR: It’s true, many details may not be directly relevant, Mr. Schlatterer, but understanding your overall health history helps me rule out other possible causes for your sleep disturbance and ensure any recommendations I make are safe for you. Even seemingly minor details can be important. Would you mind if I quickly reviewed your EHR to see what's already documented?
PATIENT: My…EHR? Is that some sort of…digital repository of my personal ailments? Doctor, I prefer the tangible. Paper files, meticulously organized…that’s how knowledge should be preserved. Very well, if you must. But I trust it is all…correctly cataloged? I shudder to think of the inaccuracies. Be that as it may, proceed…quickly. I have a library to mentally reorganize, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Let me just pull up your record here… Alright, I see you have a history of osteoarthritis, as you mentioned, and a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – in 1988. It looks like you also had a bout of pneumonia in 2015, but have otherwise been relatively healthy. Your allergies are listed as…pollen. And you're currently taking…lisinopril for high blood pressure and a daily multivitamin. Is that all accurate?
PATIENT: Lisinopril…yes, that infernal pill. It makes my mouth feel…strange. And pollen, of course. A seasonal nuisance. The multivitamin…my daughter insisted. Honestly, it’s all rather…pedestrian. Yes, that list is…adequate. Though I suspect my record fails to accurately reflect the sheer intellectual burden I carry. But proceed, Doctor. I haven’t got all day. The Dewey Decimal System won’t maintain itself.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, just to clarify a little further, you mentioned the lisinopril causes a strange sensation in your mouth. Could you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Oh, it's…difficult to articulate. A sort of…numbness. A dull…lack of sensation. It's quite unpleasant, really. And it interferes with my ability to…properly pronounce catalog numbers. It’s a minor inconvenience, of course. But it is indicative of the declining quality of modern pharmaceuticals. Honestly, the entire system is…unsatisfactory. But proceed, Doctor. I am losing patience.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that detail. That numbness is worth noting. Now, regarding your sleep, you mentioned it's almost nightly disrupted by worries about work. Are you able to fall asleep initially, or is it difficult to even get started?
PATIENT: Initially, I can usually…drift off. It’s the maintaining of sleep that’s the issue. My mind…races. Catalog numbers, misfiled journals, the improper use of subject headings…it’s a constant barrage of academic errors. It's quite…exhausting, frankly. I toss and turn, contemplating the chaos. It's hardly a restful experience. Honestly, it's a tragedy. A perfectly good intellect deprived of…peaceful contemplation.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, you're able to fall asleep, but then wake up later with racing thoughts. That points towards a common pattern with stress and anxiety. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you have any family members who have experienced sleep problems, anxiety, or depression?
PATIENT: My…family history? Doctor, my ancestors were…scholars. Dedicated librarians, meticulous archivists, keepers of knowledge. They did not…suffer from frivolous ailments. They were too busy…preserving civilization. There may have been…eccentricities, of course. A fondness for rare books, a tendency to hoard manuscripts…but nothing as…pedestrian as anxiety or depression. Honestly, the very notion is…absurd. But proceed, if you must. I am losing my will to live.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that information. While a history of scholarly dedication doesn't necessarily rule out a predisposition to certain conditions, it’s still valuable to know. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you have any hobbies or activities you enjoy outside of work?
PATIENT: Hobbies? Doctor, my work is my hobby. The proper organization of knowledge is a fulfilling activity. I used to…collect first editions, but frankly, the decline in print quality renders the pursuit rather…pointless. I occasionally…read scholarly journals, but even those are riddled with inaccuracies these days. Honestly, the world offers little of intellectual stimulation. I mostly…contemplate the decline of civilization. Is that an acceptable answer?
DOCTOR: It is, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like your work is very central to your identity, and that you find a great deal of meaning in it. That's admirable. Now, one final question about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you implying I engage in…debauchery? I assure you, my lifestyle is…impeccably ordered. I do not partake in such…frivolous activities. A glass of sherry on occasion, perhaps, to aid digestion. But nothing more. I consider such habits…undignified. Honestly, the very suggestion is…insulting. I dedicate my life to the preservation of knowledge, not…self-destruction. May we proceed to a solution, Doctor? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schlatterer. I apologize if my questions seemed intrusive. It sounds like you lead a very disciplined life, and that your work is incredibly important to you. Based on what you’ve told me – the sleep disturbance related to stress at work, your dedication to your profession, your disciplined lifestyle, and your minor discomfort with the lisinopril – I believe we’re dealing with a situation primarily driven by anxiety and stress. While the numbness from the lisinopril is worth monitoring, it doesn’t appear to be the central issue here. I wouldn’t want to immediately prescribe medication, if possible. I think we can start with some lifestyle adjustments and relaxation techniques. Would you be open to exploring those options?
PATIENT: Relaxation techniques? Doctor, I am a librarian. Order is my relaxation. Honestly, the notion of deliberately…relaxing seems rather…pointless. However, I suppose I am willing to…humor you. But I make no promises. My mind is accustomed to…precision, not…meditation. Proceed, Doctor. But be swift. I haven't got all day. And I expect a meticulously documented plan.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. A meticulously documented plan it is. I was thinking we could start with two things: regular sleep hygiene practices and a technique called progressive muscle relaxation. First, sleep hygiene. This involves creating a regular sleep schedule - going to bed and waking up around the same time each day, even on weekends. Avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed, and creating a dark, quiet, and cool sleep environment. We also want to avoid screen time – phones, computers, television – for at least an hour before bed. Progressive muscle relaxation is a technique where you systematically tense and relax different muscle groups in your body. It can help reduce physical tension and calm your mind. There are many guided recordings available online or through apps. I can provide you with some resources. I also recommend limiting your exposure to stressful situations at work as much as possible, although I understand that may be difficult. And finally, if these techniques don’t provide sufficient relief, we can discuss other options, such as short-term medication or a referral to a therapist. Here’s a handout outlining these recommendations in detail. Try these for two weeks, and then schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can assess your progress. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Two weeks? Doctor, my mind is not a laboratory experiment. But very well. I shall…attempt these…exercises. Though I harbor little optimism. Honestly, the very notion of deliberately…tensing and relaxing my muscles seems rather…absurd. And a referral to a therapist? Preposterous. I assure you, my intellect requires no…coddling. However, I shall comply…reluctantly. Schedule a follow-up appointment, you say? Very well. Two weeks from today. But I expect a precisely timed appointment. I have a library to mentally reorganize, you understand. And I trust you will have adequately cataloged my progress by then. May we conclude this…ordeal?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schlatterer. I've scheduled your follow-up appointment for two weeks from today. And rest assured, I will have your progress meticulously documented. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Questions? Doctor, I am the one who should be asking the questions. But no. I believe I have endured sufficient…inquiry for one day. Honestly, the entire experience has been…taxing. I trust this…ordeal is concluded? I have a library to mentally reorganize, you understand. And I do not appreciate having my time…wasted. May we conclude this…interview?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schlatterer, it is. Thank you for coming in today, despite your…reservations. I wish you all the best in implementing these strategies, and I look forward to hearing from you in two weeks. If anything urgent arises before then, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day, Mr. Schlatterer.
