DOCTOR: Good morning, Tierney. I’m Dr. Auelua, pleased to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I… I requested an HIV test. I wanted to get checked, just to be sure, you understand. It’s been on my mind.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Tierney. It’s always a good idea to be proactive about your health, and getting tested when you’re concerned is very responsible. I see here you’re 64 years old. Before we proceed with the test, could you tell me a little bit more about why you’re requesting it now?
PATIENT: Yes, 64 is correct. And… well, it's a bit embarrassing to say. My husband and I… we haven’t always been the most careful, if you understand what I mean. It’s been a long marriage, and old habits… I just thought it was time to finally be certain, for both our sakes. It’s been weighing on me, and I’d rather know one way or another.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so open with me, Tierney. It takes courage to talk about these things, and you absolutely did the right thing by bringing it up. It’s good to be thorough, and it’s never too late to prioritize your health. To get a better understanding, have either you or your husband ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: To be honest, no. We… it wasn't something people talked about much when we were younger, and then life just… happened. It wasn’t a priority, I suppose. We've been together a very long time, and we just… assumed. But now… now I feel I need to know, regardless of how long it's been. It’s probably foolish to have waited this long, but here we are.
DOCTOR: It's not foolish at all, Tierney. Things change, and it's perfectly valid to reassess your health needs at any point. It sounds like you're concerned about potential past exposures. To help me understand things a little better, can you tell me about any specific instances or activities that make you feel it’s important to get tested now?
PATIENT: Well, it wasn't any one thing, Doctor. It’s just… looking back, we… had some periods where we were less cautious than we should have been. And we've both had… other relationships in the past, before we met. I don't know much about their histories, and it’s been bothering me. It’s a long time ago, I know, but it’s better safe than sorry, isn't it? I’m just a practical woman, and I want to have peace of mind.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right – better safe than sorry is always a good approach, and peace of mind is incredibly valuable. So, to clarify, you’ve had previous partners before your current husband, and you’re unsure of their history. And you and your husband had periods of less cautious sexual activity. Now, I’m going to ask a few general health questions, just to get a complete picture. Have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections diagnosed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve always been quite careful, generally, even if… even if we’ve had some lapses. I’ve never had any symptoms, and I’ve never been tested before today, as we discussed. I suppose that’s why I’m here now – to finally be sure. Is that… is that enough information? I’m not very good at this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Tierney. Don't worry about being "good at it"—you’re sharing what’s important, and that’s what matters. No symptoms and no prior testing - that’s good to know. Alright. Before we proceed with the HIV test itself, I'd like to ask a few questions about your overall health. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well… I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, it’s mostly just aches and pains, nothing serious. And my blood pressure sometimes runs a little high, but I try to watch my salt intake. Otherwise, I’m fairly healthy for my age, I think. I walk regularly and I eat a balanced diet. Nothing major, if that makes sense. I don't take any regular medication for anything, apart from the occasional pain reliever for my knees.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Tierney. Arthritis and occasional high blood pressure, managed with lifestyle adjustments, that sounds reasonable. No regular medications other than occasional pain relievers. And just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. I don't have any allergies that I'm aware of. I can take most things without any trouble. It's one of the few blessings I have, I suppose! Though I do get a bit of a sniffle with dust, but that's not a true allergy, just a bit of sensitivity, you understand.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Tierney. No known allergies – that simplifies things nicely. Alright, so to move forward, we'll proceed with the HIV test. We can do a simple blood draw right here in the office. It's a standard test, and the results usually take a few days to come back. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. A blood draw is no trouble at all. A few days is perfectly acceptable. I just want to get it over with and know one way or another, you understand. Please, go ahead when you're ready. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Tierney. Just so you're aware, we'll be sending the sample to the lab for testing. We'll give you a call as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. I just… thank you for being so understanding and kind. It’s been weighing on me for a long time, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not make me feel foolish. It's a relief to finally be doing something about it. Just… proceed when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tierney. It takes courage to address these concerns, and you shouldn’t feel foolish for wanting to prioritize your health. I’m happy to help in any way I can. This won't take long at all. Just a little pinch… and we’re almost done. Alright, all finished. Here, apply a little pressure to this gauze pad for a few minutes. The lab will contact us with the results, and we’ll be in touch as soon as we hear back. In the meantime, if you experience any excessive bleeding or discomfort, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other concerns before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That's everything. Thank you again for everything. You've been very kind and helpful. I feel much better now that it's done, even though I haven't got the results yet. I'll be sure to call if I have any problems. I suppose I’ll just… wait for the phone. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tierney. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. Have a good day, and we’ll be in touch soon. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
