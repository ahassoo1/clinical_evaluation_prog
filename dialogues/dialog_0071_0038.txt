DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It's… rather difficult to explain precisely. I believe I need to put some things in order, just in case. Something about… future medical decisions? I was advised to inquire about an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form… though honestly, the details escape me. I apologize for my vagueness.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Future planning… Advance Directives, POLST forms… perfectly reasonable to get those in order. It is good to be prepared. Hmm. It sounds like you’ve already done some thinking about this. Let’s try to unpack it a bit. When you say “just in case,” is there anything specific that's prompting this now?
PATIENT: Specific… no, not exactly. It’s… a feeling, I suppose. A sense of… things being unsettled. It’s hard to articulate. My divorce was finalized last year, and… well, it prompted a lot of re-evaluation, naturally. I realized I haven't really considered what I would want if I were unable to speak for myself. It’s not a fear, precisely, but… a responsibility, I think. Does that make any sense? I feel rather foolish trying to explain.
DOCTOR: No, not at all foolish. That makes perfect sense, Evann. Big life changes often do prompt that sort of reflection – wanting to be prepared, to have your wishes known. It’s very responsible of you to be thinking about this. So, let's start with the basics. Have you ever discussed these kinds of wishes with family or friends?
PATIENT: Not… in detail, no. My ex-husband and I… our discussions rarely extended beyond practical matters. And I don’t have any particularly close family nearby. A few distant cousins, but… no one I would confide in regarding something like this. It’s rather lonely, thinking about it alone.
DOCTOR: I understand. That does make it harder. Well, we can certainly go through everything here today, and I can help you document your wishes. Perhaps we can also identify someone you trust to act as your healthcare proxy. Before we dive into the specifics of those forms, let me just ask a quick medical history question, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please, proceed. Though I must warn you, my recollections are… fragmented. I apologize in advance if I struggle to recall details. It’s not intentional, Doctor. It simply… happens.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Evann. We’ll take it slow. First, do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… I was diagnosed with mild hypertension about five years ago, and I take a low dose of medication for that. Nothing… dramatic, the doctor said. Just something to keep an eye on. And… I had a rather nasty bout of bronchitis last winter. Other than that… I believe I’m generally healthy. Should I be mentioning anything else? It’s difficult to know what’s pertinent.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, good to know. And the bronchitis last winter. We’ll want to get a list of your current medications. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: The name… it’s on the tip of my tongue. It began with an ‘A’, I think. Amlodipine? No, that doesn't sound right. Perhaps… Atenolol? No, that’s not it either. I apologize, Doctor. I really should have brought a list. I’m terribly sorry. It's frustrating… even I find it odd that I can’t recall something so simple.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry about it at all, Evann. These things happen. We can easily look it up in our system. Do you have your insurance card with you?
PATIENT: Yes, here you are. Private insurance, as you can see. Though I rarely need to use it. I prefer to avoid doctors if possible, honestly. A somewhat ironic situation, considering my current predicament.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s see… Evann Buoniconti… yes, here we are. Okay, it confirms you are taking Amlodipine 5mg daily for hypertension. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Amlodipine. Finally! Thank you, Doctor. It’s such a weight off my mind to have that sorted. I truly appreciate your patience. Now… about these Advance Directives and POLST forms? Perhaps you could explain the difference between them? I'm rather confused.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let's talk through it. An Advance Directive is a broad term encompassing your overall wishes for medical care should you become unable to make decisions yourself. It often includes a Living Will, which details specific treatments you would want or refuse - things like life support, feeding tubes, etc. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is more specific. It’s a medical order based on your wishes, that tells healthcare providers what to do in a medical emergency, like CPR, intubation, or artificial nutrition. It's generally for people with serious illnesses. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: So, the Advance Directive is more… comprehensive, a general statement of intent? And the POLST form is… a concrete order for specific situations? I believe I’m leaning towards the Advance Directive, then. The POLST form feels… rather final. I’m not seriously ill, as you say. Just… wanting to be prepared. Would it be wise to start with the Advance Directive, then, and perhaps revisit the POLST form later if my circumstances change?
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Evann. Yes, starting with the Advance Directive is a good idea. It allows us to document your wishes in detail without being tied to specific emergencies. We can always revisit the POLST form later if needed. To start, are there any specific treatments you definitely would or wouldn’t want in the event you were unable to communicate?
PATIENT: That's… a difficult question. I've never really considered it in such detail. I suppose… I would want everything possible done to preserve my life, if there’s a reasonable chance of recovery. But I wouldn’t want to be kept alive indefinitely in a vegetative state, with no hope of regaining consciousness. My mother… she suffered a stroke several years ago. It was… a very distressing experience. I wouldn’t want that for myself.
DOCTOR: That’s a very understandable wish, Evann. And a difficult thing to think about, I know. So, you would want life-sustaining treatment if there's a reasonable chance of recovery, but would not want it prolonged if there’s no hope of regaining consciousness. We’ll definitely document that. We can also discuss things like a Do Not Resuscitate order, which would specify whether or not you want CPR performed if your heart stops. Would you like to discuss that now?
PATIENT: No, I think… not yet. Perhaps I need time to consider that. The thought of… actively refusing life-sustaining treatment feels… overwhelming. Let’s focus on the more general aspects of the Advance Directive for now. Perhaps the question of a healthcare proxy? Someone to make decisions on my behalf if I am unable to do so? I don't have any close family, as I mentioned... I’m not even certain who I would choose.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Evann. We can definitely leave the Do Not Resuscitate order for later. And you're right, choosing a healthcare proxy is very important. It needs to be someone you trust implicitly to understand and respect your wishes, even if they disagree with them. It doesn't have to be a family member, it can be a close friend, a religious leader, or even an attorney. Do you have any friends you feel particularly close to?
PATIENT: Friends… I have acquaintances, certainly. Former colleagues, people I see occasionally. But… truly close friends? No, not anymore. I've moved around a lot, and… life just gets in the way. There’s Eleanor. She used to be my neighbor, years ago. We were quite close then, but we haven't spoken in… at least five years. I don’t even know if she still lives in the same city. Would it be appropriate to… attempt to reconnect with her, simply for this purpose? It feels rather… manipulative.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Evann. It’s understandable to feel hesitant about reaching out to someone after a long time, especially for something like this. However, if Eleanor is someone you trust and respect, and you believe she would honor your wishes, it's worth considering. It’s not necessarily manipulative, as long as you're upfront about your reasons for reaching out and respect her decision if she’s not comfortable taking on that role. It's about finding someone who truly understands your values. Would you like me to give you some information on the legal requirements for designating a healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Information about the legal requirements would be… immensely helpful. And perhaps some guidance on how to approach Eleanor? It feels rather daunting, to be honest. I’m not accustomed to asking for such a large favor. I suppose… I've always been rather independent. Thank you, Doctor. I truly appreciate your patience and understanding. This is… far more complex than I anticipated.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Evann. It is complex, and it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Let me pull up some information on our state's requirements for healthcare proxies. It outlines the legal forms you'll need, and what qualifications a proxy must meet. I'll also print out some resources on how to have a conversation with someone about becoming your proxy - tips on what to discuss, and how to approach a potentially difficult conversation. It looks like the form requires two witnesses, and the proxy must be over 18 and not your immediate family member. As for approaching Eleanor, perhaps starting with a simple phone call to reconnect, explaining you've been thinking about her, and then explaining your situation if she’s receptive?
PATIENT: That’s… incredibly helpful, Doctor. Truly. The information about the requirements is invaluable. And the suggestion about starting with a simple phone call… that feels far less daunting than launching directly into a request. I suppose… it's a small step, but a step nonetheless. If you're finished with the information, I’m prepared to review it now. I brought my reading glasses, fortunately. .
DOCTOR: Here you are. This includes the healthcare proxy form, a checklist of things to consider when choosing a proxy, and some resources on having that difficult conversation. Take your time reviewing it, and feel free to call the office if you have any questions. We also have a social worker available who can help you with these types of conversations, if you'd like. It sounds like you’re taking all the right steps, Evann. And remember, it’s okay to take things slow. Is there anything else I can help you with today, or shall we stop here?
