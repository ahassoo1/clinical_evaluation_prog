DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I’m Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t quite understand why I’m here. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s the one who made the appointment. Said I needed to… talk about things. My feet are fine, as far as I can tell. I’m a podiatrist, you know. I look at feet all day. I should know if something was wrong with my feet.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your daughter scheduled this appointment for you, and you're not entirely sure what it's regarding?
PATIENT: Something about… not wanting certain “procedures.” Honestly, the young people and their fancy words these days! She was carrying on about tests and… well, it was a lot. I told her I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself. I’ve lived a long life, haven’t I? And I haven’t needed anyone poking and prodding at me until now. It's just… unnecessary fuss. Do you need to do all those tests?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Gunasekara. It sounds like your daughter is just being proactive about your health, which is good. We don't need to do any tests you don’t want, but sometimes tests can help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on, even if you’re feeling well. Before we decide anything, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: My overall health? Oh, goodness. Well, I’m… old. Eighty-three years old! I used to be very active, always on my feet, naturally. But things slow down, you know? A little arthritis here and there, but nothing a good lotion can’t handle. I haven’t been to a proper doctor in… oh, it must be years. Decades, even. I mostly just keep myself busy. And I eat… well, I eat what I like. I’m not one for restrictions. Is that what you want to know? I'm on Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Gunasekara. That's helpful to know. Medicare is important. And yes, knowing about your lifestyle and habits is very helpful. It sounds like you've been independent for a long time, which is wonderful. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Energy levels… hmm. Changes… Well, I get tired easier, I suppose. Everything takes a little more effort now than it used to. But who doesn't get tired when they get old? I used to be able to garden all day, and now I maybe do a little weeding for half an hour. It's just… normal aging, isn't it? I don't go around running marathons or anything. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. You doctors always want to make a mountain out of a molehill. Are you going to ask me about my diet now? Because I’m not telling you I eat cake sometimes!
DOCTOR: No, I won't pry about the cake, Ms. Gunasekara. And you're right to be skeptical. We don't want to jump to conclusions. Just trying to get a complete picture. You mentioned being tired more easily. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, my ankles do swell up a bit sometimes. Especially if I’ve been sitting for a long time. I always thought it was just from the heat. It’s been awfully warm lately. I put my feet up, and it usually goes down. My daughter, she keeps saying it's "fluid retention" or something like that. Fancy words again! Honestly, I just want to know if I need to worry about anything. Is this swelling dangerous? Is it something I should be concerned about? Because if it's not bothering me, I don’t want a lot of poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Okay, ankle swelling, especially with prolonged sitting. That’s good information, thank you. And it's understandable you want to avoid unnecessary tests. We will take things slowly. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your ankles and feet. It will give me a better idea of what might be going on, and help us decide if any further testing is needed. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod. Honestly, I knew this was coming. Fine, go ahead. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And don’t be surprised if I tell you what I think is going on. I’m a podiatrist, remember? I know feet. Just… be gentle, alright? I’m an old woman, not a… a science experiment.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Gunasekara. I will be very gentle. And I value your expertise; I will definitely take your observations into consideration. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Alright, I’m listening now. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit fast. Lungs are clear. Now, looking at your ankles, I do notice some swelling, as you mentioned, particularly on both sides. Feels soft and pitting, meaning it leaves an indentation when I press on it. And your skin feels a little bit cool to the touch. Your pulses feel strong, which is good. Do you experience any pain in your ankles or feet when I touch them?
PATIENT: No, no pain when you touch them. Just… a little discomfort, maybe. From the swelling, I suppose. It doesn't hurt to walk, really. But it's… bothersome. It feels tight, you know? Like my shoes are squeezing my feet too much. And it's worse at the end of the day. Honestly, I just thought it was my age. Everything aches a little when you get old. You doctors always make such a fuss over everything! Is it bad? Tell me straight. Is this something serious? Because if it's just old age, I'd rather just put my feet up and ignore it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s good to know there's no pain, and that it’s worse at the end of the day. The swelling, the lack of pain, and the fact that it’s worse at the end of the day suggests it could be related to fluid retention, as your daughter mentioned. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. While it could be simple age-related changes, it's important to investigate, especially given your age. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will check your kidney function, your liver function, and look for any signs of inflammation. It will also help us check your electrolytes. And I would recommend an EKG, just to check your heart rhythm. It’s a quick and painless test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and an EKG… Now you are making a fuss. Honestly, it's just my feet! I’ve lived a long life, haven’t I? And I’ve never needed all these tests before. My daughter will be thrilled, I’m sure. She loves all these fancy medical things. But I don’t. Is there really no other way? Can’t you just tell me if my feet are okay or not? I’m a podiatrist, remember? I can probably tell you more about feet than you can! Fine. Go ahead. Do your tests. But if they come back normal, I want you to promise me you won’t bother me anymore. And tell me what these “electrolytes” are. Honestly, all these words! It's just too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Gunasekara. And I assure you, I value your expertise. We're not trying to bother you, but it’s important to be thorough. We’re just ruling things out to ensure your health and well-being. Electrolytes are minerals in your body, like sodium, potassium, and calcium, that help your body function properly. They can be affected by kidney problems, and can cause swelling. I’ll order the blood tests and the EKG. The lab is just down the hall, and the EKG can be done in the office right after. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and decide on the next steps. It should be back in a couple of days. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your feet whenever possible, and limiting your salt intake. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Elevate my feet and limit my salt… Honestly, my daughter will be thrilled. She’s always telling me what to do. Fine. I’ll try. But don’t expect miracles. I like my salt! And I’m not promising to spend all day with my feet up. I have things to do, you know. I’m not a… a shut-in. Alright. Get the tests done. And let me know if they come back normal. Because if they do, I’m not coming back. You hear me? Not coming back. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to find my daughter. She’s probably hovering around somewhere, waiting to hear what you’ve said. Honestly, the young people…
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Gunasekara. I understand. I will let your daughter know we’re getting the tests done. And we will discuss the results as soon as they are available. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms in the meantime. I'll have a nurse come in to draw the blood and get you set up for the EKG. Thank you for your patience. .
PATIENT: Hmmph. Very well. Just don’t make a fuss. And tell the nurse to be gentle! My veins aren’t what they used to be. Fancy tests… all this fuss over nothing… honestly… .
