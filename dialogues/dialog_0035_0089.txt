DOCTOR: Good morning, Alese. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Alzoubi. It’s… pleasant to meet you. Oh dear, what does bring me in… It's this pain, you see. Lower down, in my abdomen. It comes and goes, but when it’s here, it’s… quite something. I believe my regular physician mentioned something about… well, a condition I have. SLE, I think it was called. It feels connected, somehow. Though, honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, SLE… Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Yes, I see that in your records. And you’re experiencing abdominal pain, coming and going. Can you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Lupus. That’s it. It’s… difficult to describe. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… a deep ache. And sometimes it feels like cramping, quite severe cramping. It makes it hard to… well, to do anything, really. It comes on suddenly, usually, and then… fades after a while. Though, “a while” can be quite a long while, if you understand what I mean. I don't know if that's helpful. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it happens, or why.
DOCTOR: A deep ache with cramping, comes on suddenly and can last a while… okay. And is this pain constant, or does it come and go frequently?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. It's not… thankfully, it's not always there. But when it does come… it's disruptive. I'd say… maybe a few times a month, it flares up? It’s hard to say for certain, Doctor. I try to keep track, but… things slip my mind, you see. Perhaps it’s more often than that. I really couldn’t be precise. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few times a month, difficult to pinpoint exactly. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these flare-ups?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that's a good question. I wish I knew! I’ve tried to… observe, you see. But nothing seems to consistently bring it on. I've noticed it sometimes happens after… strenuous activity, perhaps? But then other times it comes when I've barely left the house. I haven’t changed my diet recently, and I haven’t been particularly stressed, not any more than usual, anyway. It’s rather frustrating, I must admit. Like a puzzle with missing pieces.
DOCTOR: Okay, no clear triggers. Alright. And aside from the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms when these flare-ups happen?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Sometimes, when the pain is particularly bad, I feel quite… fatigued. More so than usual, and I do get tired easily. And… oh! Yes, occasionally I’ve felt a bit… nauseous, I believe is the word. Not sick, exactly, but a bit queasy. And… I’ve been a little constipated, if you don't mind my saying. It's all rather unpleasant, really. Do you need me to be more… specific?
DOCTOR: No, that’s helpful, thank you. Fatigue, nausea, and constipation during flare-ups. Okay. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you experienced any fever, weight loss, or any changes in your skin or joints?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that's a lot of questions! Let me see… Fever… not that I’ve noticed. I haven’t felt warm, or bothered to take my temperature, to be honest. Weight loss… I haven't been weighing myself regularly, but my clothes feel… about the same, I suppose. And my joints… sometimes a little achy, yes. But I assumed that was just… getting old! It's hard to say if it’s related, isn't it? I do have some… arthritis, I believe. It’s all rather muddled, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, weight loss seems stable, and some joint aches which you attribute to arthritis. Now, let's talk about your medical history a bit. Aside from the lupus and arthritis, do you have any other health conditions?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, where to begin? Let me think... I had my gallbladder removed, oh, many years ago now. And I've had high blood pressure for some time, managed with medication, thankfully. And… oh, I suppose I’ve always been a bit prone to… indigestion, if you don’t mind. Nothing serious, just… a bit uncomfortable sometimes. I'm sure I'm forgetting something... my memory isn't what it used to be, you know. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, high blood pressure, and some indigestion. We'll get to everything. Are you currently taking any medications for your high blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me see... I take Lisinopril, for the blood pressure. And… oh, a small dose of Hydroxychloroquine, the doctor prescribed it for the Lupus. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take Ibuprofen, just over the counter. And… oh, a little something for my indigestion, but it’s just an antacid, really. I believe that's all. I'm usually quite good about remembering my pills, but… sometimes I miss a dose, I confess.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, Hydroxychloroquine, Ibuprofen as needed, and antacids. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear, allergies... let me think carefully. No, I don't believe so. I've never had a serious reaction to any medication, thankfully. I might be a little sensitive to shellfish, but that’s just… a tummy ache, really. Nothing life-threatening. I can’t recall any other allergies, no. I do have a bit of a… sensitivity to bright light, but I don't think that's an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That's perfectly alright. I understand. Please, do whatever you need to do. I'm quite happy to cooperate. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. Though I suspect it might anyway, given the pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just listening to your abdomen now. Hmm… do you feel any particular tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh yes, that's… a bit tender, actually. Right there, on the lower left side. It's not excruciating, but definitely… noticeable. It's a dull ache, really. And… now that you press there, I feel it a little bit further over to the right as well. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, you see. It’s a rather diffuse pain, not one specific spot.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling for any masses or guarding. There’s some tenderness throughout, as you mentioned, particularly in the lower quadrants. No rebound tenderness or guarding that I’m noting at this time. Your bowel sounds are present, though a little quiet. Alright. Given your history of Lupus and the symptoms you’re describing, and the findings on the exam, it sounds like this could be a flare of your Lupus involving your gastrointestinal system – Lupus enteritis. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and inflammatory markers like ESR and CRP. I also want to check a stool sample to rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh my. Lupus enteritis… that sounds… serious. But I suppose I suspected it might be something like that. Yes, please, do whatever tests you think are necessary. Blood work and a stool sample… alright, that sounds… thorough. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever will help figure out what’s going on. I just want to feel better, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll get to the bottom of this. The blood work will help us assess inflammation and organ function, and the stool sample will rule out any infection. I’ll also have my nurse schedule you for a follow-up appointment in about a week to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh my, that sounds… sensible. A week to follow up… alright. And yes, I will certainly go to the emergency room if anything… worsens. That's… reassuring to know. Let me think… No, I don't think so. Not at the moment. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Though… Will the tests tell me what caused this flare-up? Is there something I should be avoiding?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. The tests won’t necessarily pinpoint the exact cause of the flare-up. Lupus flares are often triggered by a combination of factors, and sometimes, there isn’t a clear identifiable trigger. However, we can look at the results to help guide our management. We’ll discuss lifestyle modifications, such as stress management and avoiding potential triggers, but it's often a process of trial and error. For now, I recommend continuing your current medications as prescribed, staying well-hydrated, and eating a bland diet. We will discuss this more thoroughly when we have the results. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… trial and error. That sounds… frustrating, but I suppose it’s better than nothing. Yes, I understand. Continuing my medications, staying hydrated, and a bland diet… alright, I can do that. It’s just… difficult knowing what to avoid if you don't know what's causing it, isn't it? But I appreciate you being honest with me, Doctor. It’s reassuring to know you're not simply guessing.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. It’s important to me that you feel informed and involved in your care. We'll work through this together. My nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and give you the instructions for the stool sample. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and patience. You've been very kind and… understanding. I feel a little better knowing there’s a plan, even if it’s a little uncertain. I suppose I'll let your nurse come in then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alese. We'll get to the bottom of this. Please, take care. .
