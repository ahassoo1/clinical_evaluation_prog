DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, my husband suggested I come. He says I need to have one of those… forms prepared. An advance directive, I believe he called it? Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… something happen. Frankly, I find the whole discussion rather morbid, but he is quite insistent. I suppose it’s better to be prepared, though I don’t see me needing such a thing anytime soon.
DOCTOR: Yes, an advance directive. A sensible precaution, I suppose. Though, frankly, at your age… well. Let’s just get through this. It’s primarily about outlining your healthcare preferences. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Pre-existing conditions? No, nothing of note. I’ve always been very careful with my health. A little arthritis in my knees, perhaps, but that’s just… age. And a touch of indigestion now and then, but that’s easily remedied with a proper diet. Honestly, Doctor, I’m quite healthy for my age, thank you very much. My husband worries excessively, that’s all. He reads too many things online, I suspect.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications for this arthritis or indigestion?
PATIENT: No, I do not take any medication. I prefer natural remedies, when necessary. A bit of ginger for the indigestion, and I try to stay active, despite the knees. I do not believe in filling my body with unnecessary chemicals. My mother always said, “A healthy lifestyle is the best medicine,” and she lived to be ninety-two! Though… she did enjoy a good cigarette with her coffee, so perhaps her advice isn't entirely sound. Still, I maintain a healthy lifestyle. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely none. I’ve always been able to eat anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine. My constitution is remarkably strong, Doctor. I rarely even catch a cold. Really, I’m quite a robust person. Are you certain you need to ask about such… common ailments? It seems a rather basic line of questioning for someone of my… stature.
DOCTOR: Standard procedure, Ms. Chilla. Now, let’s briefly discuss your family history. Any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. Well, my mother, as I mentioned, lived a long life, but she did have… heart trouble, towards the end. Nothing major, just a bit of weakness. My father, he passed away rather young, from… I believe it was pneumonia. And my brother… he has high blood pressure, I think. Honestly, Doctor, they weren’t the healthiest of people. That’s why I strive to maintain such a… disciplined lifestyle. Are we getting somewhere with this form, or are we simply cataloging the failings of my relatives?
DOCTOR: Right. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Doctor, do I look like the sort? I find the very idea… distasteful. I am a woman of refinement, and I maintain a very… respectable image. My husband would be appalled if I indulged in such… vices. I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, a very small glass, and only on special occasions. But that is hardly a vice, is it? It’s practically medicinal, the way I drink it – very slowly, savoring each sip. But I assure you, no smoking, no… drugs, and very moderate alcohol consumption.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Chilla, perhaps we should do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. It will be quick. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really, Doctor? I told you, I am perfectly healthy. Is this truly necessary? I have a luncheon scheduled this afternoon, and I would hate to be late. However… if it will expedite this… process, I suppose I can spare a moment. But please be quick, and do be gentle. I bruise easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not concerning. Heart rate is 82, regular. Let's listen to your lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Chest sounds are normal. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Reflexes are normal, but slightly diminished. Overall, everything appears… within normal limits. Though, given your blood pressure and breath sounds, I recommend monitoring it at home.
PATIENT: Diminished breath sounds? Doctor, are you implying I have something wrong with my lungs? I assure you, I breathe perfectly fine. I take regular walks, I practice deep breathing exercises… I maintain a very active lifestyle! Perhaps your equipment is faulty? Or perhaps you simply didn’t position the… thing… correctly? I don’t appreciate you suggesting I have a medical issue when I’ve clearly stated I am in excellent health. And monitoring my blood pressure at home? That sounds… unnecessary and quite frankly, a waste of my time. I have a luncheon to attend, Doctor. This is becoming quite tedious.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, I am simply being thorough. Slightly diminished breath sounds can be common with age, but it's prudent to monitor it. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem. As for your blood pressure, it’s a little high, and monitoring it at home will help us establish a baseline. Now, regarding your advance directive… we can simply fill in the basic information if you’re not comfortable making specific healthcare decisions at this time. We can indicate "full code" and leave the rest blank. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: “Full code”? What exactly does that mean? Doctor, I don’t like the sound of that at all. Is that… will they try everything, even if it’s… unpleasant? My husband mentioned something about tubes and machines… I absolutely do not want to be kept alive by machines! That’s barbaric. And leaving it blank… isn’t that just… irresponsible? I need to be certain my wishes are clearly stated, not left to chance. Perhaps I should just postpone this whole thing. This is far too stressful, and I have a luncheon appointment. Can’t we simply discuss this another day, when I’ve had time to… consider all the implications? I’m beginning to feel quite faint. This is most unsettling.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, I understand your concerns. Perhaps we should postpone this for another day. It's clear you're not comfortable making these decisions at this time. However, it's important to remember that without an advance directive, your husband will be making these decisions for you. I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment next week. In the meantime, I will provide you with some information about advance directives and encourage you to discuss it with your husband. And perhaps consider monitoring your blood pressure at home, just as a precaution. It was… a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Chilla. Though, perhaps not entirely productive.
PATIENT: A pleasure… I suppose. Though I must say, Doctor, this has been a rather… unsettling experience. I truly believe my husband is exaggerating the necessity of all this. Still, I will… consider your suggestions. And I will try to… discuss it with him, though he is quite insistent. Thank you for your time, Doctor. And… perhaps next week will be more… conducive to a productive conversation. Though, I make no promises. Goodbye.
