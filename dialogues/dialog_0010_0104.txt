DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I’m Dr. Annesley. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly? I don’t have much time for this. My throat hurts. Been hurting for… a bit. I need to know what it is and then I need to leave. It's probably nothing, really. Just… a sore throat.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re short on time. We'll try to be efficient. A sore throat, you said. And how long has it been hurting, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… I never was good with dates. A week? Maybe more. It comes and goes, you know? It’s not constant. Mostly when I swallow. And it feels… rough. Like sandpaper. It's very inconvenient. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Right, intermittent, rough throat pain, mostly with swallowing, for approximately a week or more. And is there anything else accompanying the sore throat?
PATIENT: Accompanying? What do you mean? Like… a parade? No, nothing accompanies it. It just is. I don't get fevers, I don’t cough much, and I certainly don't have the time for a cold. I just want it gone. Are you going to give me something for it, or are we going to sit here and discuss my life?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ottaviani. I need to ask a few more questions to get a better idea of what’s going on so I can best help you. No parade, thankfully. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I told you. Nothing. I'm a very practical woman. If something was wrong, I’d know. I don’t do ‘vague feelings’ or ‘mild discomforts’. It's a sore throat. It hurts when I swallow. That’s it. Are you sure you need to ask me about… everything? This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being direct. Just to be thorough—and it's good you’re feeling well otherwise—have you noticed any difficulty breathing, any ear pain, or a rash anywhere?
PATIENT: Breathing? Doctor, are you suggesting I can’t breathe? I walked here, didn’t I? And ear pain? No! I wear earrings, I’d notice. As for a rash… absolutely not. I take care of myself. Honestly, I think I'm wasting my time here. You're asking me about things that clearly aren't happening. Just give me something for the throat. A lozenge, a pill, something. I don’t need a full examination.
DOCTOR: Alright. Since you're certain there are no other symptoms, let's do a quick look in your throat. It will only take a moment, and it may help me determine the best course of action. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I have a schedule. And don’t poke around too much. Just… look. And tell me what you're going to give me afterward. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Ottaviani. Just open wide and say "Ah." Alright. Your throat is a little red, but I don't see any white spots or significant swelling. It appears to be a mild pharyngitis, likely viral. Given your lack of other symptoms and the mild appearance, I don't believe antibiotics are necessary at this time. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’ve never had allergies. And ‘mild pharyngitis’? Is that what you call a sore throat these days? Sounds fancy. Look, can you just give me something for the pain? I don't want to sit here and learn medical terms. And I certainly don't want to hear about how it’s ‘likely viral’. Just fix it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your preference, I can recommend a couple of options for symptomatic relief. Over-the-counter lozenges containing benzocaine or phenol can help numb the throat. Warm salt water gargles—about a teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water—several times a day can also be soothing. And over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with any discomfort. Do you have those readily available at home, or would you like me to write you a note for something stronger?
PATIENT: Lozenges, gargles… Honestly. I suppose I have lozenges somewhere. And I can manage with… whatever those other things are. Just… I don’t need a prescription, Doctor. I really don't. I just want to be done with this. I have things to do, you know? People relying on me. Are we finished now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Ottaviani, we are. I would advise you to rest your voice as much as possible, stay hydrated, and monitor for any worsening symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or a high fever. If those occur, please seek medical attention immediately. Here is a note summarizing our conversation and these recommendations, just in case. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Thank you, Doctor. Now, if you'll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon, Ms. Ottaviani. .
