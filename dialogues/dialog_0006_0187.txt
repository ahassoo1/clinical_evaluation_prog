DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good to meet you too. Look, I don't have all day. My chest… feels funny. Like it’s beating too fast, sometimes. And my wife, she says my face is very red. She makes me check my blood pressure machine, and it’s… high. Very high. I don’t like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and a fast-feeling heart… and your wife noticed some redness. Right. How long has this been going on, this “funny” feeling in your chest?
PATIENT: A few weeks, maybe? I don’t keep good track. Old man problems. It comes and goes. Not every day, thankfully. I try to ignore it. It's probably nothing. My wife worries too much. She always does.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, comes and goes… Alright. And besides the fast heartbeat and redness, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I get tired easier. Walking up the stairs… not so good anymore. And sometimes, just a little… dizzy. But that could be from standing up too fast. I’m old, remember? Everything hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, trouble with stairs, and occasional dizziness. Those are all things we want to look into. Have you been having any shortness of breath, or pain in your chest, besides just the funny feeling?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. Just… uncomfortable. Like someone is sitting on my chest. And breath… maybe a little short sometimes. When I try to do too much. But I don't push myself, you know? I’m careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, discomfort, not pain, and some shortness of breath with exertion. And how about your legs?
PATIENT: Legs? What about them? They hurt, of course! I told you, everything hurts. Old age, you understand? But… no, no swelling. They just ache. Like they're very heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, aching, heavy legs, no swelling. Good to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history for a minute. Do you know what medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me see. My wife handles all that. I think… something for my blood pressure, she says. A little white pill. And maybe something for my cholesterol, a yellow one? I don't pay attention to the colors, honestly. She gives me the pills, I take them. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's helpful that you're on something for blood pressure and cholesterol. Do you happen to know which medications those are?
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, no. I told you, my wife handles all of that. I don’t bother her with it. It’s too much to remember. She writes it down, I’m sure. Why is this so important? Are you accusing me of something?
DOCTOR: No, no accusations at all, Mr. Sobkowicz. I just need to know exactly what you’re taking to make sure everything is safe. It's important for avoiding interactions and getting the right treatment. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had a problem. I eat everything. I like food! My wife sometimes complains I eat too much, but that’s another story. Look, are we going to get to the point? My chest feels a little funny right now, just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs, and then we can figure out what's going on. This will just take a few minutes. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, both front and back. Try to breathe normally. Heart sounds… slightly rapid. Lungs are clear, but a little diminished on both sides. Blood pressure is indeed elevated, 160 over 90. Pulse is 92. Okay. Your heart is beating a little faster than it should, and your lungs sound a little quiet. The blood pressure is definitely high. We'll need to look into this further. Have you ever had an EKG before?
PATIENT: EKG? What is that? Some kind of electrical thing? I don’t like needles. My wife always makes me get a flu shot, and I hate it. Is that what you’re going to do? Because I’m not sure I want that.
DOCTOR: No needles right now, Mr. Sobkowicz. An EKG is a simple test, it doesn't involve needles. It just puts stickers on your chest to check your heart’s electrical activity. It helps us see if there's anything irregular going on. It’s a quick, painless test. I think it would be a good idea to get one just to be safe. Would you be willing to let me do that?
PATIENT: Hmph. Stickers, you say? Not needles. Fine. But make it quick. I have things to do. My wife will be expecting me. And no poking! Just… stickers. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, stickers it is. It will only take a few minutes. Just relax and breathe normally. This one goes here… and here… okay, good. Now I'll just connect it to the machine. Just a moment… Okay, the results are printing now. Hmm… The EKG shows some signs of left ventricular hypertrophy, meaning the muscle of the heart is thickened. It also shows some evidence of an old heart attack. Mr. Sobkowicz, have you ever been told you had a heart attack before?
PATIENT: A heart… what? No! Never. My wife would have told me. She tells me everything. She never said anything about a heart attack. Are you sure? This machine… it’s probably broken. They make cheap things these days. I bet it’s wrong.
DOCTOR: It’s possible there was an old, silent heart attack that wasn't diagnosed at the time, Mr. Sobkowicz. Sometimes they don’t cause obvious symptoms. The EKG is a good indicator, but it's not definitive. Given your history of high blood pressure, the EKG findings, your symptoms of chest discomfort and shortness of breath, and the thickened heart muscle, I think it’s important to get a more detailed look at your heart. I'm going to recommend a consultation with a cardiologist. They can perform an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart, and further assess what's going on. I’m also going to adjust your blood pressure medication slightly and recommend that you start taking a low-dose aspirin, unless you have any allergies or contraindications. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Aspirin? For my heart? I don't like taking pills! And a… cardiologist? Another doctor? This is too much! My wife is going to be furious. She picks all my doctors. Hmph. Look, can’t you just give me something for the chest pain? Something quick? I don’t want to go to another doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your concerns. It’s frustrating to deal with multiple doctors and more medication, especially when you're not feeling well. However, your heart is very important, and it’s crucial that we take these findings seriously. I cannot simply prescribe something for the chest pain without knowing the underlying cause. That would be irresponsible. I strongly recommend seeing the cardiologist. They are the specialists who can best assess your condition and determine the best course of treatment. I can provide you with a referral and help you schedule an appointment. For now, I can prescribe a low dose of nitroglycerin to be used only if you experience chest pain. But this is only a temporary solution, and it does not address the underlying problem. Do you agree to see the cardiologist?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But tell me, doctor, how long will this take? My wife makes a very nice dinner at six o’clock. And can I still eat my kimchi? That’s important. Tell the cardiologist to be quick. I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. I understand. The cardiologist appointment will likely take a few weeks to schedule, but I will do my best to get you in as quickly as possible. As for your kimchi… yes, you can still eat your kimchi, in moderation. It's a healthy and delicious food, but it can be high in sodium, so be mindful of your salt intake. I'm printing out a referral to Dr. Lee, a very good cardiologist nearby. I’m also including a prescription for the nitroglycerin and a list of instructions. Here you go. Please make an appointment with Dr. Lee as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any severe chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Just… get me out of here. I need to go home. And tell your staff to stop giving me stickers. It's undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. I've noted your preferences about the stickers. Get home safely, and please, do call Dr. Lee's office as soon as you can. And please follow up with me if you have any concerns.
