DOCTOR: Hi Brando, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just…a check-up, I think? Something about needing to be cleared for…something with a performance. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s all a bit fuzzy. They sent me here, you see. From…well, I don’t quite recall the name of the place. Something with tickets, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, a check-up for performance clearance. That's perfectly alright, we can definitely do that. And don't worry about the name of the place, those things slip our minds sometimes. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit more about the performance?
PATIENT: Performance… um… it involves…standing. A lot of standing, I think. And…helping people find their seats. Yes, that’s right. Ushering, I believe they called it. It’s not…strenuous, exactly. But it's been a while since I've done anything like it regularly. I used to do it for…a long time. Before…things. It's mostly just being on my feet, I suppose. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. So, standing for extended periods, mostly ushering. And you used to do this regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, for many years. Decades, even. Though it's been… some time now. After my divorce, things changed. I did a bit of this and a bit of that. Lobby work, mostly. Taking tickets, showing people where to go. Not much physical exertion, though. It's just… I worry about my stamina, I suppose. I’m not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re concerned about your stamina with returning to something that involves standing for long periods, after a break and some less physically demanding work. That’s completely understandable. Let's talk a little bit more about your overall health. Have you been seeing a primary care doctor regularly?
PATIENT: A primary doctor… um… not…recently. It’s been a while. Honestly, with everything… I haven’t really prioritized it. I used to, back when… well. It’s just slipped my mind, I suppose. I feel alright, generally. A few aches and pains, what you’d expect at my age. But nothing…serious. No major illnesses, as far as I know. I haven’t been insured for a long time either. It’s… complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No recent primary care, and you're currently uninsured. That's good to know. We can definitely work with that. Just to get a better picture, have you had any major surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Nothing recent, that I recall. There was something… when I was younger. Appendicitis, I think. A long time ago. And… maybe a broken wrist, once. But that was decades ago as well. Nothing significant in the last… twenty years, at least. Everything was… minor. Little things. Nothing that would affect me now, I wouldn't think. It’s really hard to remember all the details, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a broken wrist in the past, both a long time ago. That's helpful. Now, thinking about your family… is there any history of heart disease, diabetes, or any other major medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history. That's… complicated. My parents… they were both… they lived long lives, I think. But they didn't really talk about health much. Lots of… traditional remedies, that's all. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had something with his stomach, but I don’t recall what. It was a long time ago. We weren't very close, to be honest. I don't know much about their medical history, and I don't have any siblings to ask. It’s… fuzzy. Very fuzzy. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Brando. Family history can be difficult to recall, and it's not always easy to access that information. No need to apologize. Let's move on to some current things. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not regularly. Nothing at all. I used to take something for… my knees, a few years back. But I stopped. It didn’t seem to help much, and I didn't want to rely on pills. Just a little ibuprofen now and then, if I have a headache. But that's it. No prescriptions. Nothing at all, really. I prefer to… tough it out, if I can. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Brando. Just occasional ibuprofen for headaches. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had a serious reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything. I used to be a bit sensitive to… pollen, maybe. But it was just a little sneezing, nothing major. Nothing that required a doctor or anything. No hives, no trouble breathing. Just a little sniffle. So, no, I don’t think I have any allergies. But it’s been a while since anyone’s asked.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Alright, Brando. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see how things are looking. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds…fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have… commitments, you see. But yes, go ahead. The quicker the better, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll keep it as efficient as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? I haven't been doing much exercise lately, you see. It's probably just…old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a little bit of wheezing in your lungs, and the breath sounds are a little diminished. Nothing alarming at this point, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 148 over 92. And your pulse is 88, and a little irregular. We'll want to monitor that as well. Now, let’s take a look at your throat and ears. Please open your mouth and say “Ahhh.”
PATIENT: Ahhh… Is everything alright? I haven't been feeling particularly unwell, you see. Just a little…tired, perhaps. And my knees ache, as always. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Your ears look clear, and your throat is a little red, but nothing significant. It could just be a minor irritation. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back and relax. Your abdomen is a little tender in the lower quadrants, but there are no masses or other concerning findings. Finally, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not necessarily a cause for concern. Alright, that concludes the physical exam. Now, based on what you've told me and the exam findings, I have a few thoughts. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, your pulse is irregular, and your lungs have some wheezing. You also mentioned some knee pain and fatigue. All of this points to a few things that we should investigate further. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that doesn’t sound good, does it? Wheezing… irregular pulse… It’s probably just old age, isn't it? I haven’t been taking care of myself, I suppose. But what does it mean? What do we need to investigate? And…will it stop me from doing this ushering job? That's what I'm really worried about. Is it serious? Do I need…tests? Expensive tests?
DOCTOR: It's okay, Brando. Let's not jump to conclusions. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it's good we're looking into it. Your age does play a role, but it's important to rule out other possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. Specifically, I’d like to do a complete blood count to check your overall health, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes, an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. These are relatively standard tests, and they'll help us understand what’s going on. As for the cost, I understand your concerns. Since you’re uninsured, we can discuss options for affordable testing, including potentially contacting some local charities or hospitals that offer financial assistance programs. We’ll work with you to find something that fits your budget. Regarding the ushering job, it's hard to say definitively right now whether it will be affected. It depends on the results of the tests. However, I would advise against starting any strenuous activity until we have a better understanding of your condition. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Tests… right. CBC, BMP, EKG, chest X-ray… It sounds… complicated. And expensive. Financial assistance… that sounds good, if you can help with that. I really do need this job, you see. It’s just… something to keep me busy. So, no ushering until we know more. That’s… disappointing. But I understand. Safety first, I suppose. How long will it take to get the results? And… will you explain everything to me? I get confused easily, you see. And I don't have anyone else to help me understand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Brando. That’s perfectly alright. We’ll take it one step at a time. I understand this can be overwhelming, and I’m here to help you through it. The tests should take about 2-3 business days to come back. Once we have the results, I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with you to discuss them in detail. I will explain everything in plain language, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have, no matter how small. We’ll go over each result together, and I’ll help you understand what it means for your health. As for financial assistance, I’ll have my nurse, Maria, reach out to you after this appointment to discuss options and help you with the paperwork. She’s very knowledgeable about local resources and can guide you through the process. In the meantime, I’m going to write a note recommending you avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results. I'll also prescribe you an inhaler to help with the wheezing. It’s a preventative measure, and it might help you breathe a little easier. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An inhaler… that sounds good. And Maria… yes, that’s very kind of you. I appreciate your help. So, no ushering, avoid strenuous activity, take the inhaler, and wait for the results. And then we'll talk. Thank you, Doctor Yoshino. You've been very… reassuring. It's a relief to have someone explain things so clearly. I think… I think that's everything. Unless… is there anything else you need to know? Or anything I should be doing in the meantime?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brando. I'm glad I could help. For now, just focus on resting and avoiding any activities that make you feel short of breath or tired. It's also important to stay hydrated and eat a healthy diet. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Other than that, just wait for Maria to contact you regarding the testing, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are back. I don't think there's anything else I need to know at this time. I’ll have Maria print out some information about managing shortness of breath for you to review. It was a pleasure meeting you, Brando. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Yoshino. And thank you to Maria, too. I appreciate your kindness. I will… try to rest. And I'll call if anything changes. Goodbye, Doctor Yoshino. And… have a good day.
