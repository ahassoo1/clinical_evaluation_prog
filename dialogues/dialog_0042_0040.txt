DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side… my flank, I think it’s called? And I seem to be getting water infections quite often now. It’s been troubling me for a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, flank pain and frequent urinary tract infections. I understand. Let's start with the flank pain. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, thankfully. It comes and goes, but it’s been happening more regularly lately. It’s usually on my right side, but sometimes I feel it on the left too. It doesn’t usually keep me up at night, but it’s uncomfortable enough that I notice it throughout the day. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Dull ache, more frequent lately, right side mostly, but sometimes left. And it doesn’t disrupt your sleep. Is there anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think anything specifically makes it better, to be honest. Resting sometimes helps a little, but not always. As for worse… maybe if I’m lifting something heavy? Or if I’ve been walking a long distance. But it’s hard to say for sure. It just… comes and goes on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be aggravated by physical activity, but it’s not a consistent trigger. Now, let’s talk about these frequent urinary tract infections. How often would you say you're getting them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It used to be maybe once or twice a year. But in the last six months, I’d say… four or five times, at least. It’s a real nuisance, Doctor. I’ve been to see my regular doctor about them a few times, and they keep giving me antibiotics, but they just seem to keep coming back.
DOCTOR: Four or five times in the last six months is definitely frequent. And the antibiotics aren’t providing long-term relief. Do you notice any other symptoms with the infections – like burning when you urinate, a strong urge to go, cloudy urine, or fever?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, all of those, actually. The burning is the worst, of course. And the urge to go is constant, even when there’s not much to go! And the urine… well, it's often cloudy, and sometimes a bit darker than usual. I haven’t had a proper fever, thankfully, just feeling a bit warm and achy sometimes when it's bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so burning with urination, frequent urge, cloudy urine, and occasional warmth and achy feelings accompanying the infections. I'm going to ask a few more general questions, then I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. First, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Go ahead. As for my appetite… well, it hasn't been great, to be honest. I haven't been eating as much as usual. And I think I have lost a little weight, but I haven’t weighed myself properly in a while. It's just not been… appealing, eating, lately. It's hard to explain. I just don’t feel as hungry.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some weight loss. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no nausea or vomiting. Just the lack of appetite, really. I'm quite relieved I haven't been sick, to be honest. It’s been enough dealing with the pain and the infections.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain in your back, or any blood in your urine or stool?
PATIENT: Yes, that's a good question. I do get a bit of ache in my back sometimes, lower back mostly. It's not constant, and I just put it down to getting older, to be honest. But yes, there is some discomfort there. As for blood… I haven’t noticed any blood in my stool, thankfully. But… now that you mention it, I think I might have seen a little bit of blood in my urine once or twice. It was very faint, and I wasn’t sure if it was just my imagination. It hasn’t happened recently though.
DOCTOR: Okay, some lower back pain and possible, but infrequent, blood in the urine. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Well, I was told a few years ago, maybe ten years ago now, that my kidneys weren't working as well as they should. My regular doctor said something about cysts on them. Polycystic… something? Kidney disease, I think it was called. He told me to keep an eye on things, but it didn't seem too serious at the time. Other than that, no, not really. I used to have a bit of high blood pressure, but it's been under control with medication for years now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of polycystic kidney disease and currently managed hypertension. Do you know what medications you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Let me think… it’s Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And I take a Vitamin D supplement, just because my doctor said my levels were a bit low. Nothing else, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril 20mg daily and Vitamin D. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, I don't have any allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven't had any problems with medications either. I'm quite fortunate, in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, I'd just like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members with kidney problems, urinary tract infections, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see… my mother, she had problems with her kidneys when she got older. She didn't have a specific diagnosis, but she was always complaining about her back and needing to go to the bathroom a lot. And my brother, he had diabetes, but I don't think it affected his kidneys. Other than that, no, not really. Nothing that I can think of anyway. My family wasn't really one for talking about their health, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of kidney problems in your mother and diabetes in your brother. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I'm retired now, so I don't do much physical work. I enjoy gardening, when the weather is nice, and I like to read. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a little bit of alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner a couple of times a week. I try to eat a healthy diet, but it's not always easy. I live alone, so I mostly cook for myself. And I try to get out for a walk most days, but sometimes it's just too hot or too rainy. I'm not very active, to be honest, but I try to stay as healthy as I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good overview. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Mr. Espinueva. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness. We’ll also do a quick check of your reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Go ahead. I understand it’s all part of figuring things out. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not significantly. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. I'll be pressing on different areas to check for tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels painful. There is some mild tenderness in the right flank region. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Now I'll check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, and symmetric. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I found during the exam, I suspect you might have a kidney infection, potentially related to the polycystic kidney disease. The flank pain and frequent UTIs are concerning, and the mild tenderness in your right flank supports this. However, we need to run some tests to confirm this and rule out other possibilities. We’ll start with a urine analysis and a blood test to check your kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. A urine analysis and a blood test… yes, absolutely. Anything to get to the bottom of this. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s reassuring to know what’s happening and what we’re trying to find out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have my nurse draw the blood and collect a urine sample. She'll provide you with a sterile container and instructions for collecting the sample. It’s important to try and collect a mid-stream sample – that means you start urinating, then collect a small amount in the container, and finish urinating. While we wait for the results, I want to discuss some preliminary measures you can take. Drink plenty of fluids, at least eight glasses of water a day, to help flush out your system. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. And if you experience any fever, chills, nausea, or worsening pain, please contact the clinic immediately. We’ll also need to discuss a possible referral to a nephrologist – a kidney specialist – for further evaluation and management of your polycystic kidney disease. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Plenty of fluids, avoid caffeine and alcohol, and contact you if anything gets worse. And a referral to a kidney specialist… yes, absolutely. If that’s what you recommend, then I trust your judgment. I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to look after my kidneys. It’s just… a bit worrying, to be honest, hearing all of this.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Espinueva. It’s natural to feel anxious when you're facing a potential health concern. But we’re going to work through this together, step by step. The sooner we have the test results, the sooner we can develop a plan to manage your condition and improve your quality of life. I’ll let my nurse know to come in and draw the blood and collect the urine sample. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I suppose I’ll just wait for the test results then. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and for your kind words. It’s a relief to know someone is taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could help. My nurse will be in shortly. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
