DOCTOR: Hi Lacreasha, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. It’s… my nails. They just look… funny. Not good funny. I don’t remember how they got like this, exactly. Just… changed. They’re not… pretty anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're concerned about changes to your nails. That's a good reason to come in. Can you tell me a little more about what "changed" means?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, they’re kinda… thick? And the color… not the nice pink they used to be. More… yellowish. I don’t paint them or anything. Never have. It’s just… old people nails, I guess. Is that a thing?
DOCTOR: It absolutely is a thing to notice changes in your nails, and it’s good you brought it to my attention. “Old people nails” isn’t a medical term, but it sounds like you’re describing some changes in color and thickness. That can happen for a lot of different reasons. To get a better idea of what’s going on, can you tell me if you've noticed any pain or discomfort with your nails?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. They don’t hurt. Just… annoying, you know? Like when I try to… open things. Little things. They get in the way. It’s probably nothing, honestly. I just thought I should get it checked. Medicare pays for stuff, right?
DOCTOR: It’s good you came in to get it checked, even if it feels like “nothing.” It’s always better to be sure. And yes, Medicare should cover a visit like this. Okay, so no pain, just some difficulty with fine movements. Have you noticed this happening with all of your nails, or just some of them?
PATIENT: Oh… all of them, I think. Maybe not all at the same time, but… yeah. Pretty much all of them. I don’t really look at my nails, if you know what I mean. They’re just… there. I just noticed it was getting worse, so I figured… why not? It's not like I got anything better to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's easy to overlook things like that. So, all of your nails are affected, and the changes have been gradual. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Hmm. Not that I know of. The doctor always asks, and I always say no. I get my checkups, I guess. Old age, maybe? Is that a condition? I haven’t been sick sick in a long time. Just… tired, sometimes. Everyone gets tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. "Old age" isn't a medical condition, but it does make some things more common! And tiredness is something we can definitely talk about. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! I had my tonsils out when I was little. A long, long time ago. And… maybe a wisdom tooth? I don't really remember. It was blurry. Hospital? Not unless it was for the tonsils. It was all so long ago, I barely recall. Does it matter? It was before… everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils and possibly a wisdom tooth, a long time ago. That doesn't sound like it's relevant right now, but I always like to get a full picture. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Not really. Just… sometimes I take something for my knees. When they act up. But it's just… whatever's on sale at the store. I forget the name. It's a little white pill, I think. And sometimes, a little bit of something for sleep. But not every night. Only when I can't… switch off.
DOCTOR: Okay, so something for your knees as needed, and something for sleep occasionally. Do you know the names of either of those medications, even roughly?
PATIENT: Ugh. Names… no. I throw the bottles away when I'm done. Who needs to keep those? They just clutter things up. The knee one… it comes in a little orange bottle, I think. And the sleep one… blue? Maybe. Honestly, doctor, I'm not good with remembering things like that. It's all a blur. Do you really need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand it can be hard to remember. It’s helpful to know what you’re taking, even if it’s just occasionally, as it can sometimes affect other things going on. But we can skip it for now if you really can’t recall. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you have any family history of nail problems, skin conditions, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother had… something. Her hands weren't very good. But I don't know what it was. Just… old age, probably. And my sister… she always painted her nails fancy. I never asked if she had problems. We weren't very close. It's not like they told me anything, anyway. Old family secrets, you know? Not much help, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some hand issues with your mother, but nothing specific known. And no nail problems that you're aware of in your family. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Smoking? Never! Alcohol… maybe a little wine with dinner sometimes. Very little. And drugs? Heavens, no. I'm a respectable woman! Just a little bit of wine, maybe once a week. That's all. Nothing fancy. Just… to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, very occasional wine. That’s good to know. Alright, Lacreasha, I think I have a pretty good idea of your overall health picture. Now, would you mind if I took a look at your nails?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, of course. Go ahead. They're probably just old people nails, like I said. But you go ahead and look. Be gentle, though. They're a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean about the thickness and yellowing. The nails are definitely thicker than I’d expect, and there’s a yellowish discoloration. I don’t see any signs of infection or injury. The nail beds look normal, but they are a bit difficult to see clearly due to the thickness. I'm also noting some dryness around the cuticles. Based on what I’m seeing, this looks like onychomycosis, also known as a fungal nail infection. It's quite common, especially as we get older. It doesn’t usually cause pain, but it can make the nails thick and discolored. However, to be certain, I’d like to take a small sample of nail clippings to send to the lab for testing. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fungus? Oh dear. That sounds… unpleasant. Like something you get in a damp basement. Is it… contagious? Will I have to throw everything away? A lab test… will it hurt? I don't like needles. And will Medicare cover that?
DOCTOR: It can be caused by a fungus, yes, but it's not from a damp basement! It's a very common type of fungus that thrives in warm, moist environments, like under your nails. It's not a sign of anything being unclean, and it’s not a reflection of your hygiene. It’s not highly contagious, but it can spread to other nails if left untreated. You don’t need to throw anything away, but avoiding sharing nail clippers and keeping your feet clean and dry will help prevent it from spreading. The nail clipping test doesn't involve any needles, thankfully! It’s just a small piece of the nail that I’ll file off, and it might feel a little bit like getting a manicure. And yes, Medicare should cover the lab test. We’ll double-check with them just to be sure, but it’s a standard test for a common condition. If the test confirms it’s a fungal infection, we have a few treatment options. Would you like me to explain those to you now?
PATIENT: Oh, good, no needles! That’s a relief. A little filing… that’s okay. Like a manicure, you say? Treatment options… yes, please. Tell me about them. But nothing too complicated, alright? I’m not very good with… pills and creams and things. Something simple, if possible. And how long will it take? I don’t want to be dealing with this forever.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. There are a couple of main options. The first is topical treatment – that’s a medicated nail polish or cream that you apply to the affected nails regularly. It takes a long time – often 6 to 12 months, sometimes longer – because nails grow slowly, and it has to grow out the infected part. It’s not always very effective, especially for thicker nails. The other option is oral medication – a pill you take once a day. This is more effective, but it does have potential side effects, like liver problems, so we’d need to monitor your liver function with blood tests regularly. It also takes several months to see results. There’s also a newer laser treatment, but it’s expensive and not always covered by Medicare. Given your preference for something simple, we could start with the topical treatment. If that doesn’t work after a few months, we can discuss the oral medication. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Months? Even with the cream? That sounds… exhausting. And pills… with side effects? No, thank you. I don’t know… maybe I’ll just leave it, then. It’s not hurting me, is it? Just… ugly. I don’t think I want to go through all that fuss. What if I just… keep them short and file them down? Is that okay?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. It’s completely reasonable to feel that the potential hassle and time commitment aren’t worth it, especially if it’s not causing you pain. Keeping them short and filed down is a perfectly reasonable option. It won’t cure the infection, but it can help manage the appearance and prevent it from spreading to other nails or to others. It also reduces the risk of injury. We can also talk about ways to keep your nails healthy and strong, which might help slow the progression of the infection. I wouldn’t recommend ignoring it completely, as it could potentially spread, but we can definitely focus on management rather than aggressive treatment if that’s what you prefer. Would you like me to write down some instructions for nail care and hygiene?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, thank you. Nail care instructions… yes, that sounds… manageable. Just something simple, alright? Not too much fuss. And maybe a little something about keeping them short? I don’t want to have to worry about this all the time. You’ve been very kind, doctor.
DOCTOR: Here you go. It’s just a basic guide to keeping your nails clean, dry, and trimmed. It also has some tips for preventing the infection from spreading. Keep them trimmed straight across, and avoid sharing nail clippers. If you get a manicure, make sure they sterilize their tools properly. And let me know if you notice any changes – like redness, swelling, or pain. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate you not pushing me to do anything I didn’t want to do. I’ll try my best to keep them short and clean. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lacreasha. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if you have any concerns at all, don’t hesitate to call the office. You have a good day too, and please take care.
