DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, let’s not waste time. I’m 51, perfectly healthy – or was, before I decided I want a baby. I want to make sure this… venture doesn’t have problems. I don’t want complications. Is that clear enough? I read online you were good with these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly clear, Ms. Shteynberg. You’re seeking pre-conception counseling to ensure a healthy pregnancy. That’s excellent foresight. We'll certainly do our best to help. To begin, could you tell me a bit more about your current health status?
PATIENT: “Current health status”? I just told you, perfectly healthy! I exercise – walk, mostly. Eat reasonably. No smoking, obviously. Divorced, so no… risky behaviors. What more do you need to know? I have Medicare, if that's relevant. And I haven’t been sick in… well, years. Do you need my shoe size? This feels like a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg, and I assure you I am not trying to waste your time. Even individuals who consider themselves very healthy benefit from a thorough assessment before attempting pregnancy. It allows us to identify and address any potential risks proactively. Let's start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Fine. No, no high blood pressure. No diabetes. My ex-husband had everything, believe me, but I did not inherit his problems. Thyroid? No. I had my gallbladder removed when I was thirty – does that count? It was a nuisance, but it's gone now. Look, is this standard procedure, or are you just fishing? Because frankly, I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. The gallbladder removal is good to know. We want to have a complete picture. It is standard procedure, Ms. Shteynberg, to review medical and surgical history as part of pre-conception counseling. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, genetic disorders, or birth defects?
PATIENT: Oh, now we’re getting to the really interesting stuff. My mother’s side… a lot of heart problems, unfortunately. My uncle died young of a stroke. Cancer, yes, my aunt had breast cancer, but she smoked like a chimney, so hardly relevant. Genetic disorders? Look, my family is… Hungarian. Things happen, okay? Plenty of… complications over the years. I don't have a detailed family tree memorized. Is this going to take all day? Honestly, I just want to know if I can have a healthy baby, and if there's anything I need to do to make that happen. Not compile a historical novel.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. We don’t need a detailed family tree. Knowing about the heart problems and the history of cancer is useful information, thank you. It does help us assess potential risks. To clarify, do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. Standard stuff. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I take ibuprofen. That’s it. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a remarkably low-maintenance patient. I eat my vegetables, I walk, and I don't cause trouble. Is this getting us anywhere? Because at my age, time isn’t exactly on my side. I need to know if this is even feasible, or if I'm wasting my time and your time.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Shteynberg. You’re very straightforward, which I appreciate. To get a better understanding of your current health status, I'd like to ask a few quick questions about your overall health. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight, appetite, sleep patterns, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Really? You're asking me if I've gained weight? Look at me! Do I look like I've been indulging in a secret pastry habit? No, nothing has changed. I’ve always been… solid. I sleep fine, mostly. And my energy levels are perfectly acceptable for a woman who is actively considering a pregnancy at 51. Are you implying something? This is rather insulting, frankly. I expected a more… scientific approach, not a personal evaluation.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions came across as insensitive, Ms. Shteynberg. That was not my intention at all. I am simply trying to gather a complete picture of your health. It’s standard to ask about changes that may impact fertility or pregnancy. Perhaps we can move on. To proceed, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. This will include checking your blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. But quickly. I don't want you poking around unnecessarily. And please, no judgments. I’ve already had enough of those today. Just… get on with it. I have a life, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I assure you, this will be a quick and routine examination. “Everything appears normal on initial examination. However, given your age and desire for pregnancy, I'd like to order some blood work to assess your overall health, hormone levels, and rule out any potential underlying issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Of course. Blood work. Naturally. More poking and prodding. Fine. Do whatever you need to do. Just… tell me what it entails. I don't want a surprise bill for some esoteric test I haven’t authorized. And can I get the results quickly? I don’t have time for drawn-out delays. Honestly, the whole thing is rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Shteynberg. The blood work will be a standard panel, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and hormone levels to assess ovarian reserve. It will also include tests for any sexually transmitted infections. The tests are standard to ensure a healthy pregnancy. I’ll write the order for you now, and the lab will take care of the rest. It typically takes 2-3 business days to receive the results. Once we have them, we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. Would you like me to go over the details of the tests with you now, or would you prefer to receive a printed information sheet from the lab?
PATIENT: Just… the information sheet. Honestly, I’ve had enough details for one day. And please, make it concise. I don’t need a medical textbook. Just tell me where to go, when to go, and how much it costs. That’s all. And if it’s going to cost a fortune, tell me now. I don't believe in surprises. Let's just get this over with. I have things to do. And a life to plan, potentially with a baby. If that’s even possible. Stop talking and just give me the paper.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. Here is the information sheet. The lab is located at [Lab Address and Phone Number]. The estimated cost for the tests is approximately $350, but Medicare should cover a significant portion of that. Once you’ve completed the blood work, please call the clinic to schedule a follow-up appointment, and we’ll discuss the results. Do you have any questions about the instructions or the lab location?
PATIENT: No. I’ll manage. Just… don't call me with endless questions. I'll contact you when I have the results. And Doctor… try not to be too pessimistic. I’m a determined woman. That's all. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to discussing the results with you. If you do have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call. Goodbye, and take care.
