DOCTOR: Hi Tierney, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I requested to be tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a little while now, and I finally decided to take the step.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright, Tierney. It's very responsible of you to want to get tested, and I commend you for taking this step. It’s much better to know, and we can discuss everything openly. Before we proceed with the test, I'd like to ask a few questions, if that's okay?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please, ask away. I’ll do my best to answer truthfully.
DOCTOR: Thank you. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you decided to get tested now?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a recent worry, not exactly. My husband and I… we both have had relationships before we met, naturally. It’s been a number of years, and we’re both quite settled, but I suppose it’s always been at the back of my mind. Just wanting to be sure, you know? For peace of mind, and for him, of course. We haven’t been… overly cautious, if you understand what I mean.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Tierney. It’s very thoughtful of you to consider both your health and your husband’s, and wanting peace of mind is a perfectly valid reason to get tested. It’s good that you’re being proactive. Now, just to be thorough, have you ever had a previous HIV test?
PATIENT: To the best of my recollection, no, I haven’t. Not that I remember, at least. It wasn’t something that was commonly discussed, or offered, back when I was younger. And as I said, it wasn’t a huge concern of mine until more recently. It’s possible, perhaps, but I truly don’t recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you ever shared needles with anyone, or received any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: No, never shared needles. Absolutely not. And as for blood transfusions… let me think. I had a rather difficult childbirth with my son, many years ago. I believe I received a transfusion then, but it was a long time ago, and I wasn’t really in a state to remember details. The doctors handled everything, of course. Would that have been documented somewhere, do you think?
DOCTOR: That's a good question, Tierney. It very likely would have been documented in your medical records from that time. We can certainly look into that if you’d like. For now, let's continue with some general health questions. Do you have any current medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’m generally quite healthy, thankfully. I have a bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but I try to watch my salt intake and it's usually manageable. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose. I walk regularly, and I try to eat a balanced diet. Nothing major to report, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Tierney. Managing your blood pressure with diet is excellent. We'll definitely want to keep an eye on that during your checkups. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of lisinopril for the blood pressure, as I mentioned. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I’ll take paracetamol. Other than that, no. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, thankfully. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach! No allergies to speak of, doctor.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Tierney. Now, just a few questions about your social history, if you don't mind. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not to the recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I stopped a few years back for health reasons, mostly. And I've never been a smoker. My husband smoked for a time, but he quit years ago as well. We're both trying to live as healthy a life as possible, you see.
DOCTOR: That's fantastic, Tierney. It sounds like you and your husband are very health-conscious. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be a good age, thankfully, into her eighties. She had some heart trouble towards the end, but nothing major. My father passed away relatively young, from a stroke. And my siblings are all relatively healthy, though my brother does have diabetes. There's no history of HIV or any other major infectious diseases that I'm aware of in the family. It's a fairly unremarkable family history, really. No major concerns, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, just to confirm, you and your husband are currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes, we are. We’ve been married for a long time, and… well, yes, we are. It’s a normal part of life, you understand. And that’s part of the reason I wanted to get tested, to have peace of mind for both of us.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Tierney. It’s responsible of you to prioritize both your health and your husband’s. Okay, we've covered a lot of important information. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve checking your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, temperature—and listening to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, proceed. I’m ready when you are. I trust your professional judgement entirely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please relax your arm, and I’ll wrap this around it?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please, take your time. I’m quite relaxed, as you can see.
DOCTOR: Okay… your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated, but not significantly concerning given you mentioned you have a history of high blood pressure. Your pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds are normal—no murmurs or irregularities. Your lungs are clear to auscultation—no wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds good so far, Tierney. Do you have any pain or discomfort anywhere?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. No pain or discomfort to report. Everything feels quite normal, actually. I appreciate you being so thorough. Now, what are the next steps regarding the HIV test itself? I'm rather eager to get this done, if you don't mind me saying.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tierney. I'm glad everything sounds good. And yes, let’s get to the test. We can do a quick blood draw right here in the office. The test we'll use is a fourth-generation antibody/antigen test, which is very accurate. It can detect HIV infection a little sooner than some older tests. It typically takes about a week to get the results back. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. A week is perfectly acceptable. A blood draw is no trouble at all. Please, proceed whenever you're ready. I'm quite comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I’m going to swab your arm with alcohol to disinfect it, then I'll apply a tourniquet to make your veins more prominent. You might feel a slight prick when the needle goes in, but it should be quick. Okay, all done. Just a little pressure here for a moment to stop the bleeding. There you go. All finished. The lab will notify us when the results are available, which should be in about a week. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That was remarkably quick and painless, as you promised. No, I believe that's everything. I appreciate your thoroughness and patience with all my questions. A week sounds good. I’ll await your call. And thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tierney. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before the results come back. Have a wonderful day, and I'll be in touch soon.
