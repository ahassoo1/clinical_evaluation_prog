DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin, good to see you, I suppose. Let’s get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Pehrson, is it? Honestly, I don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s this surgery, you see. They require a check-up before they’ll touch me. A little ridiculous, if you ask me, but there you have it. It’s just a little… tightening, that’s all. Not like I’m expecting a full overhaul.
DOCTOR: Right, a “tightening.” And this surgery… what exactly are they tightening?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s my neck. Skin gets… floppy, you know? Like a turkey wattle. It’s not dignified. They say a little snip here, a little pull there, and I’ll look ten years younger. Though, at my age, what’s the point? Still, my daughter insisted. She says I look “sad.” Women.
DOCTOR: So, a cosmetic procedure. And you need a medical clearance because… they want to make sure nothing else is going on that would complicate a face lift?
PATIENT: Precisely! Though “face lift” sounds so… dramatic. It's just a bit of work on the neck. And I’ve always been healthy, you know. Good Norwegian stock. Never smoked, hardly drank. It’s just… well, the doctor wants to know if I have any… conditions. Which I don't. But I suppose they have to ask. Get on with it, shall we? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just run through a quick history then. Any problems with blood clotting?
PATIENT: Blood clotting? Goodness, no. Never had a problem with bleeding more than a paper cut. Though, I did have a rather nasty splinter once, when I was building a shed… but that was sixty years ago! Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Orwin. Just humor me. Any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… Well, there’s the little blue pill for… you know. Keeps things… regular. And I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, the sun isn’t what it used to be. Other than that, nothing. I prefer to let my body do its own work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I’m aware of. I’ve eaten everything, Doctor. Everything! Lingonberries, lutefisk, even that dreadful Swedish pickled herring my wife used to make. Nothing ever bothered me. Though, dust makes me sneeze sometimes. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, now we get to the poking and prodding. Honestly. Fine. Just be gentle, Doctor. I’m not as spry as I used to be. Don't go wrenching anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is… 130 over 80. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs are clear. Neck… some expected laxity, as you mentioned. No obvious masses or tenderness. Reflexes are a little slow, but within normal limits for your age. Now, can you turn your head side to side?
PATIENT: There. And there. Feels a bit stiff, to be honest. Always has. Probably from years of looking at blueprints. Terrazzo work, you know. It’s not a job for the faint of heart. Though, I doubt that’s what you’re interested in. Is this taking much longer?
DOCTOR: A little stiffness, as you said. No pain with palpation. Alright. I’m going to listen to your heart now. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. And finally, let's just check your thyroid. Thyroid feels normal, no enlargement.
PATIENT: Good. Everything's normal. As I said. Terrazzo workers are a sturdy bunch. Can we get this over with? I really must be going. My daughter will be furious if I’m late for lunch. She made reservations at that fancy new seafood place. Though, I doubt it'll be as good as a proper lutefisk supper.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Everything seems within normal limits for your age. I don’t see any medical contraindications to proceeding with your… tightening. I’ll note that you’ve had a quick physical exam and are cleared for the procedure. Just remember to follow your surgeon's post-operative instructions carefully. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just get it over with, Doctor. Honestly, the whole thing seems rather unnecessary. My daughter insisted on all this fuss. Just… print something out so she'll stop nagging me. And hurry, if you would. I'm wasting valuable lunchtime. .
DOCTOR: Here. This confirms you had a physical exam on August 2, 2025, and are cleared for elective surgery. It doesn't detail all the specifics, frankly, because nothing was specifically wrong. Have a… pleasant lunch. .
