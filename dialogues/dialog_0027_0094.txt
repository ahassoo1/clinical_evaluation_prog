DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Airam. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um... hello. My husband, he say I need come. Something about... learning? I forget. I work with the metal, you know. All day. Very hard work. Not much time for... this.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your husband was concerned about something and suggested you come in for a check-up. That’s good of him. “Learning” could mean a lot of things. Let's try to figure it out. Can you tell me anything about why he thought you should come see a doctor?
PATIENT: Ugh. He say... I no remember things. Like, where I put my tools. Or what he tell me five minute ago. Small things! He make big deal. I always find them. Eventually. It not important. He worry too much. Is just... old age, maybe? I'm not young anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, he’s noticed some memory lapses… forgetting where things are, difficulty remembering recent conversations. And you feel it might just be part of getting older. It's good you're both paying attention to this. It could be normal age-related changes, but it’s always best to check. Just to be sure. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm... hard to say. Maybe... a few months? I don't really keep track. Things always busy. Metal work, cooking, cleaning... always something. He start complain more lately, I think. Before, I just... deal with it. Now he make a fuss. Is annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: A few months, and he’s noticed it getting more frequent recently. I see. And are these memory issues affecting your work at all?
PATIENT: Work? Sometimes. I... forget which screw to use, maybe. Or I start one thing, then forget what I was doing halfway through. I have to ask my coworkers. They laugh. Say I'm getting slow. It not funny! I always fix it, though. I'm good at my job. I been doing it long time.
DOCTOR: Okay. So it's impacting your work a little bit, causing some frustration, and your coworkers have noticed. Have you noticed any changes besides the memory issues?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? I... I don't know. I feel tired, maybe? But I always tired. From the work. And my hands hurt, always. Old work injuries, you know. Not new. Everything ache. Is normal. I don't think anything else is… different.
DOCTOR: Okay. Fatigue and hand pain, which you attribute to your work. That's helpful to know. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any difficulty with things like speaking, or understanding what people say?
PATIENT: Speaking? No. I can talk just fine. Can you hear me okay? I speak English, not very good, but I speak. Understanding... sometimes people mumble. Or they use big words I don't know. But that's them, not me. Not my problem if they can't be clear.
DOCTOR: Okay, no difficulty with speaking, and sometimes trouble understanding when people aren't clear. Alright. Now, this is a bit more sensitive, but have you noticed any changes in your mood or personality?
PATIENT: Mood? I’m always… okay. Sometimes I get angry when my husband nag. But that’s normal, right? He always telling me what to do. Personality? I’m always me! I'm practical. I work hard. I don’t like trouble. What kind of changes are you talking about? I don't like this questions. It make me feel…old.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's okay. I'm just trying to get a complete picture. It doesn't mean anything is wrong. We just want to rule things out. Now, before we move on, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Diagnosed...? Hmm. I don't go to doctor much. I don't like it. My hands, I told you. Old injuries. And my blood pressure, sometimes it high. Husband make me check it. He worry too much. But no… no big problems. I never been sick. Just tired. Always. Is the metal work. It hard on the body.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've had some issues with your hands and high blood pressure, but generally consider yourself healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I don't need surgeries. I work with my hands! I can fix anything myself. I don't trust doctors to touch me. They make things worse. I heard stories. No, thank you. Never had surgery. Never will.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family...? Hmm. My mother... she get sick, very old. Something with her brain, I think. She forget things. Husband say it maybe… the same thing. But I don't know. She live far away. We don’t talk much. And my father... he just… die. Old age. Not much to say about my family. They not here. Is just me and husband.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had some memory problems and your father passed away from old age. And, if you don't mind me asking, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications…? Sometimes I take something for my hands. When the pain is really bad. Husband buy it at the store. Little white pills. But I don't take it every day. Just when I need it. And… sometimes something for my blood pressure. But I forget to take it. Husband yell at me. It's all a mess, honestly. I don't like taking pills. They make me feel funny.
DOCTOR: Okay. So you take some medication for hand pain and blood pressure occasionally. Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No. I never had allergies. I eat everything. I work with metal, you know. Dust, chemicals… I'm used to everything. No allergies. Never. I'm a strong woman. I don't get sick easily. No allergies. Now, can we be done? This take long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies. Okay, Airam, thank you for answering all my questions. It's helpful to get a good understanding of your health history. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your general health and neurological function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Neurological... function? What is that? Is that going to hurt? I don't like being poked and prodded. Husband always say I need checkup, but I don't trust those things. If it's quick, maybe. But no needles! And no big machines. And tell me what you're doing, every step. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course. No surprises, I promise. “Neurological function” just means checking things like your reflexes, balance, and coordination. It won’t hurt at all – it’s just a simple series of tests. No needles, no big machines, I promise. We’ll start with your reflexes – I’ll gently tap on your knees and ankles. Then I'll check your balance and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay... if it just tapping. And no machines. Fine. But be gentle. My knees are old. And don’t yell at me if I fall. Get it over with, then. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to have you sit on the edge of the examination table, feet dangling. I'm just going to gently tap on your knees with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't hurt. Relax your legs, okay?
PATIENT: Okay... just be quick. And don't hit me too hard! This is already uncomfortable. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your reflexes are present and equal bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your ankle reflexes… just the same thing. Please relax your legs. And again, good. Your ankle reflexes are also present and equal. Now, let’s check your coordination. Can you touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Hmm… like this? Is this right? It’s hard to do with my eyes closed. And I’m dizzy now. Can I open my eyes? This is silly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Just a little shaky, but that’s okay. It’s normal to be a little off balance. You can open your eyes. Now, let's try the other side. Just reach out with your other hand and touch your nose with your eyes closed. Take your time.
PATIENT: Oh! I almost fell! This is ridiculous. I told you I’m dizzy. I need to sit down. I don’t like this. I want to go home.
DOCTOR: Whoa, easy there. Yes, let’s sit down. You’re perfectly safe. It sounds like you are a little unsteady on your feet. That’s okay. We’ll take it slow. I wasn’t expecting a lot of shakiness, and that’s important information. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to check your memory and thinking. Just answer to the best of your ability. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today's… date? I… I don't know. Is it… August? I think. But what day? I forget. Everything is blurry. I don't understand why you're asking me all these questions. This is making me anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s alright if you don’t know the exact date. That’s perfectly fine. Now, can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where… where are we? Is… is this a doctor's office? I think. But… what town? I don't remember how I got here. Husband always drives. I just… sit. Is something wrong? I'm scared now.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s alright. You’re at the clinic. It’s okay to be confused. Now, I'm just going to shine this light in your eyes briefly. Just follow my penlight with your eyes. Just look at the light... good. Now, look to the left. Good. And now to the right.
PATIENT: Is bright. Hurts my eyes. I don't like bright lights. Can you stop? I want to go home. I feel sick now.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. We're done with the lights. I apologize for that. You're right, let's stop. Airam, based on what I've observed during the exam, and the information you’ve provided, I'm concerned that you may be experiencing more than just normal age-related memory changes. Your shakiness, difficulty recalling information, and sluggish pupillary response are concerning. I want to order some blood tests and a CT scan of your brain to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests…? CT scan…? What are you saying? Is something seriously wrong? I don't want any tests! I don't like hospitals. I just want to go home to my husband. Please, doctor. No tests. I just want to be left alone. I feel so scared now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam, it’s alright. You’re safe here. I understand you’re scared, and I’m not going to force you to do anything you don’t want to do. However, these tests are important to help us figure out what’s going on. It could be something easily treatable. I'm concerned about a possible neurological issue, and the tests will help us rule out serious causes. If it's something serious, the sooner we find it, the better the chance of treatment. I will explain everything to your husband, and we can make a decision together. Right now, I'm going to call him and let him know you’re here. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes… please call my husband. He… he knows what to do. I don’t understand any of this. Just… please tell him everything. And… please be quick. I feel so scared and dizzy. Please help me.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will call your husband right now. Just try to relax, Airam. You’re in good hands. I will explain everything to him, and we’ll figure this out together. Yes, hello?
