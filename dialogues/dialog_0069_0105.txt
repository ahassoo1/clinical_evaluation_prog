DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, I’m here about getting surgery, the weight loss kind. I think my wife set this up. Honestly, I don’t remember all the details… it was a while ago she mentioned it, and things just… blur together sometimes, you know? I just know she said I needed to get checked out before anything could happen.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed with appointments and information. No worries at all – we'll take things at your pace. So, you're interested in exploring weight loss surgery. That’s a good first step. To get a better understanding of your situation and see if it might be a good option for you, I’m going to ask you some questions. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Questions are good. I… I don’t really know where to start explaining everything, so questions will help. Just… go easy on me, okay? My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll go slowly, and I’ll repeat anything if needed. There’s no rush. Let’s start with the basics. How long have you been interested in weight loss, and what have you tried in the past to lose weight?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. I’ve… always been a little bigger, I guess. But really trying to lose weight… probably the last ten years or so? On and off, you know? Diets mostly. My wife tries to get me to eat healthier, and I do for a bit, then… I just go back to what I like. I tried one of those meal replacement shakes for a while, but I didn’t really like them. And I walked a bit with my wife last year, but it got hot and… well, I stopped. Honestly, nothing’s really stuck for long. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be incredibly frustrating when you put in effort and don't see lasting results. It sounds like you've tried a few different approaches. Can you tell me a little more about the diets you’ve tried?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. There was one where you couldn’t have any carbs, that was really hard. I love bread too much. And another one where it was all about portion control, but I just… I don’t have much control, I guess. My wife did a really strict one once, like everything measured and weighed, but I couldn’t get into it. It felt like too much work. They all just… felt restrictive, you know? And I ended up giving in eventually. I think I also tried something called Keto, but that was a disaster. I felt sick all the time. Really, nothing’s felt sustainable.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good idea. It sounds like you’ve explored quite a few options and that restrictive diets haven’t been a good fit for you. That’s valuable information. Now, let's talk a bit about your current health. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife is always telling me my blood pressure is a little high when we go to the doctor, but they never said anything serious. I don’t think I have diabetes, but… I’m really not sure. I haven't been feeling well enough to go to the doctor regularly, honestly. I think I had high cholesterol once, but it’s been a while. Again, my wife would know better. She keeps track of all that stuff. I mostly just try to ignore it, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, it sounds like there’s a possibility of some elevated blood pressure and cholesterol. It’s good that your wife keeps track of these things – we can definitely review her records if she’s provided them. Do you currently take any medications for any health conditions?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I've never really been a medication person. I try to avoid them if I can. That's another reason I haven't been to the doctor much. I don't like feeling like something is wrong, and I definitely don't want to start taking pills every day. My wife keeps offering me something for my blood pressure, but I always say no. It just feels… scary, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's perfectly reasonable to be cautious about starting medication. Now, let's talk about your surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I broke my arm when I was a kid, so I had surgery for that, I think. But that was a long time ago. And… I think I had my tonsils out when I was little, but I don't really remember it. Honestly, that's all I can think of. Nothing major in recent years, definitely. I've been pretty lucky, I guess. Mostly just bumps and bruises.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mom… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my dad… he had heart problems later in life. He wasn’t very healthy. My wife says there's a history of diabetes on her side of the family, but I don’t really know the details. It’s not something we talk about much. Everyone on both sides likes to eat, that’s for sure! That’s probably more relevant, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information. And yes, family history of health conditions is relevant. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. I don’t like anything like that. I'm a pretty simple guy, really. I like to watch TV and spend time with my wife. That’s about it. I’m not much of a partier.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Finally, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. I've never had any serious allergic reactions. I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm outside, but I think that's just pollen. Nothing I need to carry an EpiPen for, definitely. My wife says I’m allergic to housework, but I don’t think that counts! Seriously though, no major allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Mr. Kochubey. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. It’s just… been a while since I’ve been properly checked out, so it’ll be good to know what's going on. Just try not to poke too much!
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 92. That is a bit elevated, as your wife mentioned. Your heart sounds regular, but I can hear a slight murmur. We'll want to investigate that further. Your lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I notice a bit of fullness. Do you experience any bloating or discomfort?
PATIENT: Bloating… yeah, sometimes. Especially after I eat. It feels… uncomfortable. Like I’m really full, even if I haven’t eaten much. It usually goes away after a while, but it’s not pleasant. I just figured it was because I ate too much, you know? It happens. I usually just try to ignore it. It’s not a constant thing, thankfully. Just… sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful information. Your reflexes are normal, and your overall physical condition suggests some excess weight, as expected. Based on this brief exam, it seems like a more thorough workup is definitely warranted. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. I also recommend an EKG to evaluate your heart and an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your liver and gallbladder. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? And if this surgery is even an option for me. So, yeah, blood tests, EKG, ultrasound… whatever you need. It’s a lot, but I guess it's necessary. Just… tell me when and where I need to go. And if it’s going to be expensive, please let me know. My wife handles all the money stuff.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll get everything scheduled for you. I’ll have the lab draw blood today, and we can schedule the EKG and ultrasound for next week. As for cost, I understand your concern. We’ll work with you to explore options for affordable testing, and my office can help you navigate any potential financial assistance programs. We'll also discuss the potential costs of the surgery itself if you're a suitable candidate. Let me get a few orders printed for you, and I'll give you the lab requisition form and information about scheduling the other tests. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in about a week. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds perfect. A week from now is fine. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. And for not making me feel… stupid about not knowing things. It's nice to finally get some answers, even if I don't understand them yet. I'll let my wife know about the appointments. She'll handle all the scheduling and the money stuff, like always.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. It's my job to help you understand everything and feel comfortable throughout the process. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions at all, even if it's just to clarify something. I'm glad your wife is supportive – having a good support system is incredibly important. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. I’ll see you next week. In the meantime, try to focus on your overall well-being – eat healthy meals when you can, and get some gentle exercise if you're up to it.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I will. And I will let my wife know. Have a good day!
