DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to the point. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I don’t really have time for a whole lot of this. Just...bloating, okay? My stomach gets all puffed up. It’s annoying. Happened a few times now. Not sure what’s causing it. Is that enough detail, or do you need a life story?
DOCTOR: "Annoying," is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, "annoying." Like, I’ve got things to do. I operate heavy machinery for a living, you know? Can't be walking around looking like I swallowed a beach ball. It feels…tight. And uncomfortable. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, I just want something to make it stop.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's attempt to be efficient. When did this “annoying” bloating begin?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don’t really keep track of that kind of thing. Sometime…last few months, I guess. It comes and goes. Not constantly, thankfully. After I eat mostly, I think. But not everything I eat, which is why it’s so confusing. Look, is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: “Confusing” is rarely a useful descriptor, Mr. Kristofik. To assist in making a determination, could you be more specific about what you’ve been eating?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean, "specific"? I eat…food. Normal guy food. Burgers, sometimes. Rice, pasta. Steak when I can afford it. I don’t really pay attention to ingredients, I just…eat. I'm not one of those people who reads every label, if that's what you're getting at. It's probably just something I ate, right? Something that doesn’t agree with me? Can we just try a pill or something?
DOCTOR: A "pill", you say. We don't simply administer pharmaceuticals based on vague complaints, Mr. Kristofik. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside this bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Look, I told you, it's just bloating. Maybe a little gas sometimes. I mean, who doesn’t have gas? It's not like I'm doubled over in pain or anything. It’s just…uncomfortable pressure. And makes my clothes fit tighter. Honestly, it's embarrassing. Is that helpful? I’m trying to cooperate here, doc, but you're asking me to recall things I don't pay attention to. My wife…she used to handle all this stuff.
DOCTOR: Your wife. Very good. Any change in bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Seriously? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to go, okay? Is that what we’re doing now? I’m not a doctor, I operate a pile driver! I don’t analyze my…output. It seems…private. Is this really necessary to figure out why my stomach puffs up? Can we maybe just skip this part?
DOCTOR: Private or not, Mr. Kristofik, a thorough history is crucial. Has there been any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood?! Look, are you trying to scare me? No! No blood. I would notice blood, wouldn't I? That's…that's a bit much, doc. Really. I’m starting to think this wasn’t a good idea. I’ve got work to do. This is a waste of my time, and frankly, a little insulting. You’re asking me questions like I’m…I don’t know. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kristofik. Since you are clearly uninterested in a proper medical evaluation, I will document your self-reported "bloating". I suggest you consider consulting with a gastroenterologist, who may be more accommodating to your…preferences. .
