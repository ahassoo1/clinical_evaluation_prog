DOCTOR: Good morning, Carla. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It’s really bothering me, especially at night. It’s just… driving me crazy, you know? I don’t know what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Itchy skin can be very disruptive, especially when it interferes with your sleep. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s all over, really – my arms, my legs, my back… not so much on my face, thank goodness. It doesn’t really look different, no rash or anything. Just… really, really itchy. And it comes and goes, but it seems worse when I get warm, like after a shower or if I’m a little stressed. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Itchy skin without a visible rash can be tricky to pinpoint. And you mentioned it's worse with warmth and stress. Has anything new changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… new? Let me think. Well, my grandson, little Miguel, came to stay with me for a couple of weeks, which was wonderful, but he has a little dog, a chihuahua, very small. I haven’t had a pet in years. Could that be it? I don’t think I’m allergic, but… I don't know. Other than that, nothing really. Same old, same old.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Carla. A new pet could certainly be a factor. Do you recall if the itching started while Miguel was visiting, or after he left?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. I think it started while he was here, actually. It was just a little bit at first, and I figured it was just dry skin, you know? But then it got worse as the week went on. And it’s definitely continued even after he left. It's just… persistent now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Have you tried anything to relieve the itching so far?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I've been putting lotion on, lots of lotion! The regular kind, not anything fancy. And I took a couple of Benadryl at night, but it makes me so sleepy, I can barely function the next day. That's why I stopped taking it, really. It didn't completely stop the itch, anyway. It just knocked me out.
DOCTOR: I see. Lotion and Benadryl… alright. Now, just to get a better picture, can you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it’s under control now. I take a little pill for it, every morning. And my knees bother me sometimes, arthritis, you know, getting old. But that’s about it, really. Nothing major. I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And you said you take a pill for your blood pressure. Do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It's a little white pill… I get it refilled at the pharmacy every month. Ugh, I should probably write these things down. I think it starts with an “A”? Amlodipine, maybe? Is that right? I’m terrible with names. It’s been years since the doctor told me.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes, that sounds right. Alright, and have you had any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, maybe 30 years ago. And I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist, but that was a long time ago too. Nothing recent, definitely. I try to stay out of hospitals if I can!
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a broken wrist, both in the past. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My mother had diabetes, I think. And my father, he had heart problems. My sister has high blood pressure too, like me. But other than that, not really. We weren't a big family for talking about health problems, you know? Everyone kept to themselves. I don't know a lot of the details, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for families not to discuss these things openly. And just to finish up with the basics, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, tried everything, you know? No reactions, no problems. I’m not allergic to anything, as far as I’m aware. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. Although, maybe that little dog… I’ll have to watch out for that! I’m just trying to think of everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. So, to summarize, you’ve been experiencing generalized itching for a few weeks, which started while your grandson was visiting with his chihuahua. It’s worse with warmth and stress, doesn’t have a visible rash, and lotion and Benadryl provide only temporary relief. You have well-controlled high blood pressure, a history of gallbladder removal and a broken wrist, and a family history of diabetes and heart problems. Is that all correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds exactly right. You remembered everything! Yes, that’s it. It’s just… frustrating, you know? It's such a nuisance. I just want it to stop. It keeps me up at night, and I can't concentrate during the day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carla. Itchy skin can be incredibly disruptive. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what's causing it, you know? Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m not seeing any obvious rash or signs of skin infection. Your skin is a little dry, but not remarkably so for your age. There’s no significant swelling or redness. I'm not noticing anything alarming on the surface. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs as well, just to get a complete picture.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. My heart's been fine, as far as I know, but you're right, it's always good to check. I used to be a nurse's aide, so I know you have to check everything! Go ahead, Doctor. I'll just sit here quietly.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular and strong, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it seems the most likely cause of your itching is a mild allergic reaction, possibly to the dog. It's also possible it could be dry skin exacerbated by stress. However, we want to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some basic blood work to check your liver function, thyroid levels, and white blood cell count. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing the itching. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work is fine. I don't mind that at all. If it helps figure it out, that's what matters. I just want to stop itching! And maybe… maybe I should keep Miguel and his little dog away for a while, just in case.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable idea, Carla. I’ll write the lab order now. I also want you to try a hypoallergenic moisturizer twice a day, and avoid any harsh soaps or detergents. We can also discuss an antihistamine that’s less sedating than Benadryl, if you’d like. I think those measures, along with the blood work, should give us a better understanding of what’s going on. The lab should be able to draw the blood today. They'll send the results to me, and I'll call you with the findings as soon as I have them – usually within a few days. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds good, Doctor. Hypoallergenic moisturizer, less sleepy antihistamine… I can do that. And keep the little dog away for a bit. You've been very helpful, thank you. A few days is fine, I can wait. I just… I appreciate you listening to me. Sometimes it just feels like I'm complaining about nothing.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Carla. It's never "nothing" if it's bothering you. I’ll get the lab order printed for you now. If the itching gets significantly worse or you develop any other symptoms – fever, rash, swelling – please call the office immediately. Otherwise, I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Do you need a work note or anything like that today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, thank you, Doctor. No work note needed. I'm retired, thankfully. Just want to feel better. Thank you so much for everything. I really appreciate your time and your patience. I think that's everything. I'll see you when you have the results, then. Stop itching, please!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Carla. I’m glad I could help. And I certainly hope it stops! Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
