DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, doctor. Stoffregen, yes, that’s me. Um… well, it’s my… going to the bathroom. It's been… hard. Not painful, exactly. Just… takes a long time, and doesn’t always… come out all the way, you know? It’s a bit of a bother, really. I forget when it started, though. A while now.
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty with bowel movements. And you say it's been ongoing for some time… a while now, as you put it. Can you elaborate on “a while”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. “A while”… Hmm. Let me think. Before… before my grandson, Kai, went off to college, I think. Or maybe right after. He left last… September? No, wait. Was it August? My memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s been… several months, definitely. Longer than just a few weeks, anyway. It's hard to say for sure. I get so mixed up these days.
DOCTOR: Very well. Several months, then. And to clarify, is this difficulty present with every bowel movement, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question, doctor. It’s not every time. Some days it’s alright, you know? Not easy, but… manageable. Other days… other days it’s just awful. Like trying to push a… a rock, almost. And I have to… go back a couple of times. It’s embarrassing, really. I don’t like talking about this. It just… happens. Sometimes it’s okay, sometimes it’s not. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Stoffregen. It does. And I understand this isn’t a comfortable topic. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any changes in the color or consistency?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear. Let me think… I… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve seen, anyway. I don't look too closely, if you understand. It's… well, it's not something I enjoy checking for. The color… hmm. It looks… normal, I guess. Maybe a little… darker sometimes? But I drink a lot of prune juice, you know. For… things. So, it could be that. It's probably the prune juice. I'm not sure. Everything feels a little… mushy, if that makes sense. Everything's just a bit… off.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the difficulty with bowel movements and the change in consistency, have you experienced any abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. Pain… sometimes a little tummy ache, but nothing awful. Just… old lady tummy aches, you know? Bloating… yes, sometimes I feel a bit… puffy. Especially after I eat. Nausea… not really. I haven’t been sick. And weight loss… I don't know. I don't weigh myself anymore. My scales broke a long time ago, and my husband does the cooking now, so I eat whatever he puts in front of me! I wouldn’t say I’ve lost weight, no. Maybe a little, but probably just… getting older. Everything goes a bit… south, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Stoffregen, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. This will involve listening to your abdomen, and a rectal exam. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Oh. A… a rectal exam? Goodness. Well, I… I don't really like the sound of that, doctor. Is it… necessary? I mean, I've already told you everything I can think of. Couldn't we just… try something else? Perhaps some… some pills? I’m not a fan of being poked and prodded, if you don’t mind. It's just… embarrassing. And not very comfortable, I imagine. Is there really no other way?
DOCTOR: Ms. Stoffregen, I understand your discomfort. However, a rectal exam is a standard part of evaluating bowel issues. It allows me to assess for any abnormalities that cannot be determined through questioning alone. It is important for ruling out more serious causes of your symptoms. We can, of course, proceed at your pace, and I will explain everything as we go. But it is a necessary step in providing you with the best possible care. I assure you I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… when you put it like that… I suppose so. If it’s really necessary. But please, doctor, be gentle. And explain everything, like you said. I just… I don’t like surprises. What exactly will you be… doing? And how long will it take? I have a luncheon with my friends after this, you know. I don't want to be late! It’s Mildred’s birthday. A very important birthday.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. I will explain everything. The exam will involve you lying on your side, and I will gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. This allows me to feel for any lumps, tenderness, or other abnormalities. It should take only a few minutes. I understand your concern about the luncheon, and I will be as quick and efficient as possible. I will also explain each step before I do it, so there are no surprises. Do you have any further questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Oh… well, will it hurt? I’m a bit worried about that. And… will I need to… empty my bladder first? I didn't even think to do that before coming here! Oh dear, this is all so awkward. I suppose… no, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… please be quick and gentle, like you promised. And tell me what you’re doing every step of the way.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. It may cause some mild discomfort, but I will be as gentle as possible. We can stop at any time if you are uncomfortable. Yes, it’s best if you empty your bladder first. Please excuse me for one moment while I arrange everything. I'll then guide you through the process, and explain each step before I perform it.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, doctor. I’ll… I’ll try to relax. It’s just… it’s not every day an old lady has to do this, you know. I suppose I’ll just… wait here then. Let me know when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. If you could lie on your side, with your knees drawn up towards your chest, that would be perfect. I’ll explain everything as I go. I'm going to apply a small amount of lubricant to the gloved finger. This will make it more comfortable. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, alright. Lubricant… yes, that sounds… better. Please just… tell me everything. I don’t want any surprises. And… is there a fan I could have? It's a bit warm in here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Now, I'm going to gently insert this finger into your rectum, about an inch or two. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort at all. I will be feeling for any abnormalities, such as lumps or tenderness. This will only take a minute or two. I’m just gently inserting my finger now… Can you feel any pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, I can feel it. A bit… strange. It’s not painful, exactly, but… uncomfortable. Like… like needing to go to the bathroom, almost. Please… just be quick. And tell me what you’re feeling. Are you feeling anything? Is everything alright?
DOCTOR: I’m just gently feeling around now, Ms. Stoffregen. Everything feels… normal so far. I’m not feeling any lumps or masses. There’s some mild tenderness on the left side, but it’s not significant. The muscle tone appears normal as well. It's good that I'm not finding anything immediately concerning. Just a little tenderness, as I mentioned. Is the pressure uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Oh… the pressure is alright, I think. It’s just… awkward, you know? Like… like I’m not in control. Is tenderness… bad? Should I be worried? Is it something serious? My grandson, Kai, he’s a doctor too, you know. But he’s a brain doctor. He wouldn’t know anything about this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. The examination is complete. The tenderness is likely not serious, but it warrants further investigation. It could be due to a variety of factors, such as minor irritation or muscle strain. We don’t want to dismiss it completely, however. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a stool sample to check for any signs of inflammation or infection. And I'd also like to order a flexible sigmoidoscopy. This is a quick, non-invasive procedure that allows us to visualize the lower part of your colon. It will help us rule out any more serious underlying causes of your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a stool sample… I can do that, I suppose. I’ve given those before. But a… a sigmoidoscopy? What is that? Does it hurt? Will it be uncomfortable? And will it take long? I have my luncheon with Mildred, you know. It's her 80th birthday! I just want to get this over with. And I don’t want anything to ruin Mildred’s birthday. It's very important.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Stoffregen. A flexible sigmoidoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your rectum to visualize the lower part of your colon. It’s a relatively quick procedure – usually takes about 10-15 minutes. You'll need to cleanse your bowel beforehand, which can be a little uncomfortable, but we'll provide detailed instructions to make it as easy as possible. There may be some mild cramping or bloating during the procedure, but it’s generally not painful. We can also administer a mild sedative to help you relax if you’d like. It will allow us to look for any abnormalities that could be causing your symptoms, such as polyps or inflammation. I wouldn't recommend this procedure if it wasn't important. This will rule out anything serious, and get us closer to a solution. We can schedule it for next week, giving you plenty of time to prepare. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Oh… next week… Yes, I suppose so. As long as it doesn't interfere with Mildred’s birthday. I promised her I'd be there. And the… the cleansing? Is that… messy? I don't have a very strong stomach, you know. And the sedative… will I be sleepy? Will I be able to drive home? This all sounds… complicated. I just want to feel better. And I don't want to make a fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Stoffregen. The bowel preparation can be a little messy, but we’ll provide you with clear instructions and everything you need to make it as comfortable as possible. There are different options available, and we can discuss which one might be best for you. As for the sedative, it will make you feel relaxed and drowsy, but it's not a deep sleep. You will need someone to drive you home after the procedure, as you shouldn’t operate machinery or make important decisions for several hours. I'll have my nurse schedule the sigmoidoscopy for next week, ensuring it doesn’t conflict with Mildred’s birthday. She will also provide you with detailed instructions regarding the bowel preparation and answer any further questions you may have. We can discuss the best options, and make sure this is as seamless as possible. For now, let’s focus on getting you scheduled. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, alright. If you're sure it won't interfere with Mildred’s birthday. And if my nurse can explain everything properly. I just… I get so confused these days. So many instructions, so many things to remember. Yes, let's get it scheduled then. As long as someone can drive me home. My husband is working that day, you see. Perhaps… perhaps Kai could do it? If he's not too busy with his… brain patients.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, contact you shortly to schedule the sigmoidoscopy and discuss the preparation process in detail. She's very thorough and will answer all your questions. And yes, arranging transportation is essential. Kai would be perfect if he's available. I'll make a note of that in your chart. In the meantime, I’ll order the stool sample. You can pick up a collection kit from the lab on your way out. Just be sure to follow the instructions carefully. We'll also arrange a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of both tests. For now, is there anything else I can address today, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, doctor. For being patient with me. And for not making me feel… foolish. It’s just… getting old isn't easy, you know. I suppose I’ll go get that stool sample then. Hopefully, it won't be too messy. And I’ll wait for Sarah to call. Yes, thank you again. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And remember, we’re here to help. Have a pleasant day, and please give Mildred my best wishes for her birthday. Sarah will be in touch shortly. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have another patient waiting. .
