DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Osumi. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to put it plainly, I'd like to talk about losing some weight, if that’s alright. It’s… been a struggle lately.
DOCTOR: Losing weight. Alright. It is alright. Though, frankly, many people simply lack the discipline. But we can discuss it. How long have you been noticing this… struggle, and what, specifically, has been difficult?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, it’s not a lack of discipline, not exactly. It's just… harder now than it used to be. My wife, she passed away about two years ago, and things… changed. My appetite’s gone all over the place, and I find myself wanting comfort food all the time. It's been getting worse the last six months or so, I’d say. I’ve put on maybe fifteen, twenty pounds? It’s affecting my knees, you know. Makes my work difficult. I make models out of wood, and I need to be able to move around my shop.
DOCTOR: Two years… loss of a spouse. Yes, that can… disrupt routines. Fifteen to twenty pounds. Hmm. And this comfort food… what specifically are you finding yourself reaching for?
PATIENT: Mostly… rice. And pastries. My wife, she used to bake. I… I keep doing it, even though I know I shouldn’t. It reminds me of her, you see? It’s… silly, I guess. But it's hard to resist. And then I feel guilty, and it just… keeps going.
DOCTOR: Guilt… a common symptom of emotional eating. While sentimentality is understandable, it’s clearly impacting your health and, you say, your livelihood. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Well, I sleep alright, but I get tired easier. Just… generally sluggish, you know? Not like I used to be. And my knees, they ache when I stand for too long, or go up the stairs. It wasn't this bad before. I try to walk, you know, for exercise, but it’s… it’s becoming harder to even do that. I used to be quite active.
DOCTOR: Sluggishness, knee pain… Alright. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No… not that I can think of. Oh, sometimes I feel a little… breathless. Especially if I’m doing something around the shop. Lifting things, bending down… It doesn’t last long, just a little winded, you know? I haven’t really paid it much mind. It's probably just my age.
DOCTOR: "Probably just my age," is a rather dismissive approach to new symptoms, Mr. Osumi. And breathlessness with exertion is something we need to investigate. Now, let's go over some past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything before?
PATIENT: Oh, you're right, Doctor. I shouldn't dismiss things. It's just… I don't want to make a fuss. Let me see… I had high blood pressure, years ago. They put me on medication, but I was able to get it under control with diet and exercise. I haven't needed medication in… oh, maybe ten years? And I had a bad knee injury when I was younger, playing baseball, but it never bothered me much until recently.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, history of a knee injury… Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never needed any. Just the usual bumps and bruises over the years, from working with wood. And baseball, when I was younger. Mostly just sprains and strains, nothing serious. I try to take care of myself, Doctor. It's just… things are harder now.
DOCTOR: Alright. What about your family?
PATIENT: My mother, she had… diabetes, I think. Type 2, I believe. She needed medication for it. And my father… he had heart trouble. He didn’t take care of himself, smoked a lot. I try to be better than that. My wife… she was always very healthy. Never had any problems.
DOCTOR: And social history?
PATIENT: Social… oh, you mean… do I drink or smoke? No, Doctor. Never been a smoker. I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes, but I stopped after my wife passed away. Didn’t seem right, somehow. I mostly just keep to myself these days. Work in my shop, visit my daughter when I can. It's a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Osumi. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I suppose that’s a good idea. I'm ready when you are. I just… hope it’s not anything too serious. I need to be able to work, you see. It's… it's all I have left these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could just lie down on the table, please. I'll start with your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds a bit… irregular. Not alarming, but something we'll need to investigate further. Lungs sound clear, thankfully. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. 140/90. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, about these knees… Any pain with this?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It hurts a little when I bend them. Mostly on the inside. Not a sharp pain, just… achy. It's worse when I've been standing for a while. It's been getting worse, like I said. Makes it difficult to get around the shop. And when I get up from a chair, it takes a moment to get going. I'm afraid I'm getting old, Doctor. Is there anything we can do?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me, and the brief physical exam, it seems we have a few things going on. Your weight gain, fatigue, and breathlessness, combined with your wife’s passing, could indicate some underlying emotional factors contributing to your symptoms. However, we need to rule out any physical causes first. Your elevated blood pressure and irregular heartbeat warrant further investigation. The knee pain is likely osteoarthritis, common with age and activity level, but we'll confirm with an x-ray. I’m going to order some blood work: a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. I also want to get an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. And, as I mentioned, x-rays of both knees. I'm also going to recommend a referral to a therapist, specializing in grief counseling. Losing your wife is a significant loss, and it's important to address the emotional toll it's taking on you. For now, I’d like you to try to maintain a light diet. Focus on vegetables and lean protein. Avoid processed foods and sugary drinks. And I recommend taking it easy on your knees. Avoid any strenuous activity that causes pain. We can discuss pain management options once we have the x-ray results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: That's… a lot, Doctor. Blood work, EKG, x-rays… a therapist… It's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. I just wanted something to help me lose weight. I suppose the tests are necessary, though. I understand that. And… a therapist… maybe that wouldn’t be a bad idea. It’s just… difficult to talk about, you know? Will the weight loss medication be out of the question until we get these results? And how long will it take to get them back? I just want to be able to get back to my work. It's the only thing that keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Weight loss medication is absolutely out of the question until we have a complete picture of your health. It would be irresponsible of me to prescribe anything without knowing the underlying cause of your weight gain and fatigue. As for the tests, the lab results should be back within a week, and the x-rays typically take a few days. I’ll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are available. Regarding the therapist, I understand it’s difficult to talk about. It's not about "fixing" anything, but rather about processing your grief and finding healthy coping mechanisms. I can provide you with a list of therapists in the area, specializing in grief counseling. You're not obligated to see anyone, but I strongly recommend it. For now, focus on your diet and taking it easy on your knees. And remember, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so, Doctor. That’s… a lot to process, as you said. I understand the need for the tests, and… I’ll think about the therapist. Thank you for your time, Doctor Nestingen. And thank you for listening. I appreciate your help. I just hope we can figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Osumi. My assistant will be in shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment and provide you with the necessary paperwork for the tests. Remember to follow the dietary recommendations. Have a good day.
