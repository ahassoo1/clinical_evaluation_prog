DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, good to see you… or, well, to meet you. I’m Dr. Osga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, hello. It’s… well, my wife, she said I need to get some papers. Something about… time off? For work. I’m not quite sure, to be honest. Something with the church, you see. She handles most of that sort of thing. FMLA, was it? Or maybe disability? I get a bit mixed up these days.
DOCTOR: Right. Papers. Yes. Well, before we get to papers, let's figure out why you might need them. Is there something bothering you physically?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… now that you mention it, my joints ache a lot. Especially in the mornings. And I get tired, very tired. It's been… a while now, I suppose. Not suddenly, just… gradually worse. It makes it hard to, you know, do things. Hard to lead the services sometimes. I don't remember exactly when it started, though. Everything feels a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy, yes. Alright. And where exactly are these aches?
PATIENT: Hmm. Everywhere, really. My knees, mostly. And my hands, they get stiff. Sometimes my back, too. It's not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like I’ve been doing too much gardening, but I haven't done that much gardening lately. My wife says I’m always complaining, but… it’s just harder to get around, you know? Especially in the damp weather. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Damp weather. Yes, well, many things can cause joint pain. Do you have any swelling in these joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… I don't think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. My wife would probably tell me if I did. She’s very good at noticing things. I mostly just feel… stiff. And achy. Like an old boat that hasn't been used in a while. Is that… helpful? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: An old boat. Alright. And aside from the aches and stiffness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Well, I’ve been feeling a little… off. Not sick, exactly. Just… not my usual self. A bit more tired than usual, like I said. And sometimes I have trouble… remembering things. Names, mostly. Or what I was just talking about. It’s frustrating, to be honest. It's been happening more lately. My wife gets worried, you see. She thinks I should slow down.
DOCTOR: Right, memory issues. And how long have you been noticing these memory problems?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. That’s a hard one. It comes and goes, you see. But I’d say… maybe the last six months or so? It's definitely gotten worse recently. It's not all the time, just… moments. I’ll be in the middle of a sentence and… poof. Gone. Or I'll forget where I put my glasses. Which is… inconvenient. My wife keeps reminding me, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, just to be thorough, have you noticed any fever, chills, weight loss, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my appetite is fine, I think. I still enjoy my meals. My wife makes a wonderful poisson cru, you know. A little weight loss, maybe? But nothing drastic. She keeps saying I need to eat more vegetables. So it might just be that. Honestly, Doctor, I mostly just feel… old. And tired. And forgetful. Is that enough information? I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Careful now, old bones, you hear? It takes a bit to get going sometimes. Is this alright? I don’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's see… Your gait appears slightly unsteady, and you have a bit of a forward lean. And there's some mild tenderness in both knees and at the base of your thumbs. No significant swelling, though. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Heart and lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 140/90. Alright. We'll need to do some blood work to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Blood work, you say? I don’t like needles, Doctor. But… if you think it’s necessary. Is it… bad news, you think? My wife will be worried, you know. She always worries. What are we looking for, exactly? I appreciate you checking me out, but I’m a bit frightened now.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Limtiaco. We're just ruling things out. We'll check your inflammation levels, your thyroid, and some basic blood counts. It’s likely just age-related wear and tear, but we need to be thorough. I'll order the blood work now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw it. It shouldn't take long. And honestly, worrying won’t help. We'll have results back in a few days. We can discuss them then.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A few days. I suppose I can wait. My wife will be relieved to hear that it's probably just… wear and tear. I really appreciate you taking the time, Doctor. And… about those papers? The FMLA or disability? Do you think I’ll be able to get those? I don’t want to cause any trouble at the church.
DOCTOR: We can discuss those papers after we have the blood work results. It's premature to fill them out without knowing the cause of your symptoms. Right now, we need to focus on figuring out why you’re feeling this way. The nurse will be in shortly. Let's just get through the blood work first.
PATIENT: Oh… yes, of course. The blood work. Right. Wear and tear… that's what she always says. I just want to be able to lead the services again. That's all. .
