DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for a little while now, and it just don't seem to go away, no matter what I do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. A headache… and you say it's been present for “a little while.” Could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, oh, maybe three weeks ago? Could be four. Time kinda slips my mind these days. It wasn’t bad at first, just a dull ache. But the last week or so, it’s gotten… sharper, I guess. Like a tight band around the back of my head. It’s usually there all day, but gets worse in the afternoon, if I’ve been doin’ somethin’.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's been building over the past three to four weeks, starting as a dull ache and now a sharper, band-like pain, worse in the afternoons with activity. Do you notice anything specifically makes it worse, besides activity?
PATIENT: Well now, that's a good question. Let me think… bright lights don't seem to bother it much. And I haven’t noticed it gettin’ worse with loud noises either. I think… yeah, I think when I'm stressed, it feels a bit tighter. Work's been a little hectic lately, trying to keep up with all the changes in the market, you know? Folks are worried about their money. Makes me worried, too, sometimes. And… oh! When I bend over, it kinda throbs. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Percell. So, stress seems to exacerbate it, and bending over causes a throbbing sensation. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. No dizziness, thankfully. And my vision's been alright, I think. I still read my paper every morning, though I need my glasses, of course. No nausea, and haven't been vomitin’ or anything like that. Sometimes, my neck feels a little stiff in the mornings, but I just figured that's from sleepin' funny. I've been a little tired lately, but that could just be my age, you know? Eighty-four years takes it outta ya.
DOCTOR: Alright, no dizziness, no vision changes, no nausea or vomiting. Neck stiffness occasionally, and some fatigue. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or any unexplained weight loss recently, Percell?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And no, I haven’t lost any weight. If anything, I’m probably holdin' onto a few extra pounds. My daughter keeps tellin' me to watch my diet, but… well, a little comfort food never hurt nobody, right? Now, about this headache… is there anything you think might be causin' it? Anything different happenin’ in your life lately, besides work bein’ busy?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Percell. No fever, no chills, stable weight. Now, you mentioned work being busy... besides that, has anything changed in your routine, your diet, or your sleep patterns recently?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… my routine’s pretty much the same. Up early, read the paper, work with my clients. Lunch with my daughter most Wednesdays. Diet… same as always, I guess. Not much different. Sleep… that's probably the thing that’s changed the most. I used to sleep like a log, but lately… I wake up a lot in the night. Gotta get up and use the bathroom, mostly. And sometimes, I just lay there thinkin’. Old memories comin’ back, you know? It’s not restless sleep, exactly, just… not as deep as it used to be. And... oh! I did fall in the garden a couple of weeks ago. Didn't hurt myself too bad, just a little bruised on the hip. But I did bump my head pretty good. Maybe that has somethin’ to do with it?
DOCTOR: You fell in the garden and bumped your head a couple of weeks ago?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Didn't think much of it at the time. Just a little bump, you know? My daughter fussed over me, made sure I didn't have a concussion. Seemed alright after that. No dizziness or nothin'. But… now that you mention it, maybe that is when this headache started, thinkin' about it. It’s hard to remember exactly, time kinda blurs together, you know? Is that important, Doctor? Could that be causin' this?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Percell. A recent head injury, even a minor one, could certainly be contributing to your headache. Given your age and the new onset of symptoms following the fall, it's important we rule out any serious issues. I'd like to do a brief neurological exam, just to assess your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. If you think it's best, Doctor. Yes, that's fine. I trust your judgment. Neurological exam, you say? What will that involve, exactly? I hope it doesn't involve too much bendin' over. My hip ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Percell. It’s quite straightforward, and we can adjust it to accommodate your hip. I'll check your reflexes with a small hammer, assess your strength in your arms and legs, test your balance, and check your coordination. We'll also do a brief check of your vision and some simple cognitive questions. It shouldn’t involve much bending at all. If you could just sit here for me, we'll begin.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. Just let me know if I need to do somethin’ special. Old bones don't move as easily as they used to. And, please, don’t hesitate to ask if I'm not understandin' somethin'. I want to be sure we get this figured out. Lead the way, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arm, and I’ll gently tap your knee with this. It’s a normal response for your leg to kick out a little. A little weaker than I’d expect, but not overly concerning at this point. Now, could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright. There. Is that enough? I used to be pretty strong, workin’ with my hands all these years, but things gettin' a little weaker now. I'm tryin' to do what I can to stay active, you know?
DOCTOR: Good, good. That was helpful. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Could you stand up slowly for me, please?
PATIENT: Alright… there. A little wobbly, but I’m standin’. My daughter always tells me I need to be careful. I try to listen to her. Is there somethin' I need to do while I'm standin'? Just let me know, Doctor. I'm a little nervous, to be honest. Old age ain't for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Percell, it's good to be cautious. Just stand as you normally would. Now, could you please close your eyes for a moment?
PATIENT: Alright… eyes closed. Oh dear, this ain't so good. I feel a little dizzy. Maybe I should sit back down. I don't wanna fall and cause any trouble. I’m not as steady as I used to be, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Whoa, easy there, Percell. That's perfectly alright. It's much better to sit down. Now, I just have a few simple questions. Do you remember what day it is today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Today is… August… August 2nd, is that right? Yes, August 2nd. 2025, I believe. My daughter tells me the date every week, to keep me oriented. I try to remember, but… it slips my mind sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good. And can you tell me your address?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… that’s a tough one. It’s been so long since I had to remember the actual address. It's… 12 Oak Street, I think? Yes, 12 Oak Street. In the suburbs, you know? Near the park. But the number… I’m not entirely sure anymore. It might be 14. Or 10. I get confused sometimes. My daughter handles all the bills and mail these days. I apologize. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Percell. Don’t worry about it at all. Given your fall, the new headache, and some of the findings in this brief exam, I do want to order a CT scan of your head. It will help us rule out any serious issues, like a bleed or swelling in the brain. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: A CT scan… alright. If you think it's necessary, Doctor, then I trust your judgment. Contrast dye… hmm, let me think. No, I don't think I have any allergies. I've had a few tests done over the years, and never had a reaction. But my memory… well, you know. Could I call my daughter and double-check? She keeps track of all my medical history. She's very organized. It’s better to be safe than sorry, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Percell. That's a very good idea. Please, do call your daughter. It’s always best to be thorough. While you're doing that, I'll write the order for the scan and explain the process to you. It’s a quick, painless procedure. I’ll also have the nurse check your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. That sounds good. Quick and painless, you say? That's a relief. I appreciate you takin' the time to figure this out. This headache's been worryin’ me, and it's good to know we're gettin' it checked out. Hello, Mai? It’s your father. I’m at the doctor’s office, and we’re gonna get a CT scan done… yes, a CT scan. I’ll explain everything when I see you… it’s a bit complicated. Yes, I’m fine, just a little worried. Could you look up my medical history and see if I have any allergies to contrast dye? Thank you, dear. You're a lifesaver.
DOCTOR: So, what did Mai say?
PATIENT: She said I don’t have any known allergies to the dye. Thank goodness for her! She's always on top of things. She also reminded me I've been on blood pressure medication for years, so I definitely need to tell the nurse. She got a little worried when I said I was getting a CT scan, but I assured her I was in good hands. So, what happens next, Doctor? Do I need to schedule an appointment for the scan? And where will it be done? I hope it’s not too far away… my hip ain’t what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent news about the allergies. And don't worry, Percell, we can definitely arrange the scan close by. I’ll have the nurse schedule it for you at Suburban Imaging, just a few blocks from here. She’ll also coordinate the transportation if needed. Given your age and the headache following the fall, I also want to recommend a follow-up appointment with a neurologist after the scan, just to be extra cautious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A neurologist… hmm. That sounds… serious. Is it really necessary, Doctor? I mean, if the scan comes back clear, is that really needed? I don’t like going to lots of specialists. My heart isn’t as strong as it used to be, and all the worry… it doesn’t help. Maybe we could wait and see what the scan shows first? And if it’s clear, then we don’t need to bother with another appointment? I trust your judgment, Doctor, but… I just don’t like being poked and prodded unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Percell. It’s true that many headaches are benign, and the scan may come back clear. However, given your age, the recent fall, and the cognitive changes noted during our brief exam, a consultation with a neurologist would simply allow us to ensure that everything is thoroughly investigated. It's a precautionary measure, to rule out any potential underlying issues. How about this: let's proceed with the CT scan, and then we can discuss the results together. If everything looks normal, we can certainly forego the neurology appointment. Would that be more comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Alright. That sounds… reasonable. Yes, let's do the scan first, and then we’ll talk about the results. If it’s clear, then no neurology appointment. I can live with that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listenin' to my concerns. It's good to know you're takin' my worries seriously. Now, what do I need to do to prepare for the scan? Do I need to fast? Or stop takin' my medication? And how long will it take? I have lunch with my daughter on Wednesday, and I don't want to miss that.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. Absolutely, I understand your concerns. For the CT scan, you do not need to fast. Please continue taking your medications as prescribed, unless otherwise instructed. The scan itself is very quick, usually just a few minutes. It may be a little noisy, but it’s painless. The nurse will give you detailed instructions before the scan, but generally, you'll lie on a table, and a machine will rotate around you to take the images. I'll also have her schedule the scan for tomorrow morning, giving you plenty of time before your lunch with your daughter. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Tomorrow morning is fine. And you’re sure I don’t need to do anything special? Just show up and lie down? That sounds easy enough, even for an old man like me. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate your patience and kindness. Now, is there anything else I need to know? Or can I go now? I should probably call my daughter and let her know about the scan. She always worries about me.
DOCTOR: That’s right, Percell. Just show up, lie down, and relax. The technician will handle everything else. You’ve truly got nothing to worry about. And yes, please call your daughter and let her know. She sounds like a wonderful support system. I think that covers everything for now. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule the scan and answer any remaining questions. I’ll review the results with you once they’re available. Please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms before then. It was a pleasure meeting you, Percell. Now, you go ahead and call your daughter. I wish you all the best.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. You’ve been a great help. Bye bye.
