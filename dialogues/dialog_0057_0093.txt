DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hello. Dr. Sieh, right? Look, honestly, it's a bit of a…well, my wife used to handle all this sort of thing. She had a system. Now…things are just a bit off. Something about sleep, and getting…fitter, I think? She wrote it down somewhere, but I haven't the foggiest where. It's all a bit vague, to be frank.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Redfern. It’s very common to feel a little overwhelmed when adjusting to new routines, or managing things on your own. No need to worry about specifics right now. Let's try to piece it together. You mentioned something about sleep and getting fitter. Can you tell me a little more about what’s been going on with your sleep?
PATIENT: Well, I sleep. That much I know. But…it doesn’t feel right, does it? Not restorative, you know? I wake up tired. A lot. And I'm not as…springy as I used to be. Used to be able to get up and just do things. Now…I need a bit of a lie-in. And then another cup of coffee. It’s probably just getting old, honestly. Though I’m not that old, am I? 29… well, close to it. What year is it again? Is it still 2025?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is still 2025, Mr. Redfern. And 29 is certainly not old! It’s good you’re acknowledging these changes, though. Feeling tired even after sleeping isn’t typical. It's a really good idea to look into it. So, how many hours of sleep are you getting on a typical night?
PATIENT: Hours…hmm. I wouldn’t know, to be honest. I just…lie down until I feel like getting up. Probably… six? Maybe seven? It varies. I don’t really keep track of these things. I used to have a lovely clock, a grandfather clock, but it stopped working a while back. I haven't gotten around to fixing it. I am rather good with clocks, you know. Musical instruments mostly, but clocks are similar, aren’t they? Gears and all that.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Redfern. We can work with that. Variable sleep hours can definitely contribute to feeling tired. And yes, clocks and musical instruments do share some similar mechanics. Besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… Let me think. I get a bit…winded, easily. Climbing stairs, for example. Used to practically bounce up them. Now I have to…pace myself. And my back aches a bit, sometimes. But then again, I spend a lot of time bent over instruments, so that's probably not surprising, is it? It’s a bit of a trade-off, really. Beautiful sounds, aching back. Still worth it, though, I suppose. Though it’s getting harder, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, so shortness of breath with exertion, and some back pain. It's good you recognize the connection between the back pain and your work. We should explore the shortness of breath more, though. When you say shortness of breath, does it come on suddenly, or gradually when you’re active?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It’s not like I’m gasping for air or anything. It just… gets harder to breathe the higher I go. Or the faster I walk. It’s subtle. My wife, God rest her soul, used to say I didn’t pay enough attention to these things. Said I’d push myself too hard and then complain when I was tired. She was probably right, as usual. I'm not much one for noticing…details, I suppose. Is it normal to be this vague about these things?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to not always notice subtle changes, Mr. Redfern, and it's very common to downplay things. It's also very understandable that you're still adjusting after your loss. It's alright to be vague – we can sort through it together. Now, has this shortness of breath been getting worse over time, or has it been fairly constant?
PATIENT: Constant, I'd say. Or…it's always been there, hasn't it? Just… a bit more noticeable lately. Perhaps I'm just getting older. It’s hard to tell, really. My wife used to keep track of everything. Dates, symptoms, appointments… she had a whole system. Now it’s all a bit…hazy. I really should get a calendar. And maybe someone to remind me of these things. It’s just…a lot to keep track of, isn’t it? Does it matter if it’s been constant? Is that a bad sign?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Redfern. We'll take things one step at a time. The fact that it's been constant is helpful information – it suggests this isn't something that came on suddenly, which is good. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like asthma, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. High blood pressure… I think the doctor mentioned something about that, years ago. But it wasn’t anything serious, I don’t think. Just…watch your salt intake, he said. I haven’t really paid much attention to it. And asthma… no, never. I’m fairly robust, always have been. I used to spend hours in dusty workshops, repairing instruments. Never bothered me. My wife worried about the dust, naturally. But I was fine. I'm not sure if any other doctors have seen me recently… Honestly, I haven’t been to a doctor in ages. It all feels…a blur. Is it important to know all these details?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to have as much information as possible, Mr. Redfern, and it's completely understandable that things are hazy. We can try to get records if you’re comfortable with that. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… That's a good question. My father… he had a bad heart, I think. Died young, suddenly. My mother… she lived a long life, thankfully. But she had… arthritis, I believe. In her hands, mostly. It made it difficult for her to play the oud, which was a great shame. She was a wonderful musician. I don’t think anyone else in the family had any… serious illnesses, not that I recall. It’s all a bit distant, you understand. We weren’t a very… communicative family, shall we say. She mostly kept to herself. I kept to myself. Do you need a list of names? I could try to remember. But I suspect it wouldn’t be very helpful. It’s all rather…vague, as usual.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Redfern. Knowing about the heart issues in your father and arthritis in your mother is helpful. We don't need a full list of names. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Absolutely not. Disgusting habit. My wife hated it, of course. Said it ruins the lungs, and the taste buds. I used to smell it on the instruments I repaired, sometimes. Terrible. No, I don't smoke. Never have, never will. Is it important?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's important to know. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol…I have a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. A small glass. Mostly red wine. It helps me relax, you know? After a long day of bending over instruments, it's rather…pleasant. My wife would occasionally join me. It wasn't a habit, not really. Just…a social thing, occasionally. Nothing excessive. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, that's not necessarily a problem, Mr. Redfern. Now, do you take any medications regularly, or any over-the-counter supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? No, nothing like that. I don't believe in all that fancy stuff, frankly. My wife, now she was a fan of vitamins and herbal remedies. Had a whole cabinet full of them. But me? No. Just a bit of aspirin occasionally, for a headache. Nothing regular. And, of course, the occasional cough syrup when I have a cold. But that's it. Just the basics. Honestly, I prefer to just rest when I'm feeling unwell. That usually does the trick. Is it important to know what my wife took? She kept a list, probably. But it's probably buried somewhere now. It's all rather…disorganized, you understand.
DOCTOR: No, we don't need a list of your wife's medications. Just knowing you take aspirin occasionally is helpful. Okay, Mr. Redfern. I think I have a good starting point now. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a few other basic checks. Just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds…fine. A physical exam. Good. I suppose that’s a sensible thing to do. I haven’t had one in…well, I can’t remember when. Don’t be too rough, though. I’m a bit delicate, you know. Spend a lot of time bent over instruments. My back isn’t what it used to be. But yes, go ahead. I’ll… try to be a good patient. Though I make no promises. It's all a bit… disconcerting, you understand. But yes, proceed.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Redfern. I’ll be very gentle. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142/90. That doesn't necessarily mean anything on its own – it can fluctuate depending on stress and other factors. But we'll keep an eye on it. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but I do notice slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. There's some tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine, particularly on the left side. No signs of acute injury. Your pulse is good and regular. Okay, Mr. Redfern. Everything seems… relatively normal, but the slightly diminished breath sounds and elevated blood pressure are things we need to investigate further. The back pain is likely related to your work, but we should rule out any other causes. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work, including a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… and blood work. Yes, yes, that sounds…thorough. I suppose it’s a sensible thing to do. I don’t like hospitals much, you know. All the…sterile smells. But if it’s necessary, then I suppose I’ll have to endure it. A complete blood count… what does that even mean? And a basic metabolic panel… sounds rather ominous. Is everything alright? Is it serious? You’re not telling me something, are you? My wife always said doctors have a way of…downplaying things. She was very good at reading people. Are you saying something is wrong? I just want to be straight with me. I’ve had enough vague recollections for one day. Is it my heart? Is it my lungs? Or is it just… old age creeping up on me? Please, just be honest. I can handle it. Probably.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when you’re facing uncertainty about your health. I want to assure you, I’m not downplaying anything, and I will be completely honest with you. The tests I’m ordering are not because I think something is gravely wrong. They’re simply to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The diminished breath sounds I heard could be due to a number of things – it could be something as simple as a slight inflammation, or it could be something else. The chest X-ray will help us rule out any lung issues. The blood work will give us information about your overall health – things like your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. It will also help us get a baseline for your blood pressure. It's possible these tests could reveal something that requires further attention, but it's just as likely they'll come back normal. The elevated blood pressure is something we need to monitor, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you have a serious condition. We can discuss lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication to help manage it. Right now, I’m not able to give you a definitive diagnosis. We need the results of these tests first. But I want you to know I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I’ll explain everything clearly once we have more information. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes…yes, that makes a bit more sense. A bit. You’re not saying it’s serious, not yet. Just…investigating. A baseline. And lifestyle changes. That sounds…reasonable. I suppose I should probably eat less salt, and perhaps walk a bit more. Though I prefer my workshop, you understand. It’s peaceful. So, what do I need to do? Where do I go for the X-ray? And the blood work? Do I need to fast beforehand? My wife always had a very detailed list of instructions. I seem to be rather helpless without her. And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t like waiting, you know. It makes me anxious. Perhaps you could call me with the results? Or… email them? Though I’m not very good with computers. Just…tell me what I need to do, step by step. Please. And try not to use too many medical terms. It all goes over my head. Just simple, clear instructions. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Redfern. I completely understand. Here’s a form with everything you need to know. First, the chest X-ray. You’ll go to City Imaging, it's located at 123 Main Street. No appointment is necessary, you can just walk in. The form has their phone number in case you have questions. For the blood work, you’ll go to the lab at Suburban Hospital. You do need to fast for 12 hours beforehand – that means no food or drinks except water. You can schedule an appointment online or by phone – the number is on the form. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. Once I have them, I will call you directly to discuss them – I’ve written my number on the form as well. I will explain everything in plain language, I promise. I’ve highlighted the important details on the form – the addresses, phone numbers, and fasting instructions. And I've written down a brief summary of what we discussed today. Do you have any questions about the instructions?
PATIENT: Yes… that seems… manageable. City Imaging, Suburban Hospital. Fasting for 12 hours. I can do that. Though I might get a bit… irritable. I need my breakfast, you know. And you'll call me with the results? In plain language? That’s… reassuring. I always appreciate clear communication. My wife said I have a very… literal mind. The phone numbers… are they local? I don’t like long-distance calls. And is there a website? Perhaps I could look up the location online? Though I’m not very good with computers, as I said. And… what if the results are bad? What happens then? Will I need more tests? Or… medication? I don’t like taking medication. It always makes me feel… sluggish. I’m sorry. I’m probably being a bit… difficult. It’s just… I’m not used to this. My wife always handled all these things. I feel rather lost without her. Just… try to be patient with me. And please, just tell me the truth. Even if it’s not what I want to hear. I can handle it. Probably.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, it's perfectly alright to feel anxious and overwhelmed. You are not being difficult at all. It's completely normal to have questions and concerns, especially when you're dealing with uncertainty. Yes, the phone numbers are local. And yes, there are websites for both City Imaging and Suburban Hospital – I've written them down on the form as well. You can look them up online if you feel comfortable, but it’s not necessary. As for what happens if the results aren’t what we hoped for… well, that depends on what the results show. If we find something concerning, we’ll discuss all your options – that could include more tests, medication, lifestyle changes, or a referral to a specialist. I want to assure you that I will explain everything clearly, and I will work with you to develop a plan that you’re comfortable with. We will take things one step at a time. And I promise, I will never push you to do anything that you’re not comfortable with. And yes, medication can sometimes have side effects. If we do need to consider medication, we’ll discuss the potential benefits and risks carefully, and we’ll start with the lowest possible dose. Right now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Once we have the results, we'll address whatever comes up together. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all for now. You’ve been very patient with me. And you've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate that. I suppose I should go home and… prepare for the fasting. And try to relax. Though I don’t think I’ll be very successful at that. Thank you, Dr. Sieh. For everything. I’ll… see you when the results are back. Hopefully, they won’t be too bad. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Redfern. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, try not to worry too much. I look forward to seeing you again soon. Goodbye, and take care.
