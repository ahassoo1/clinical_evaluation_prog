DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Right, well, it’s… lab work. That's all. Just need some blood tests done, I think. Medicare said I needed 'em. Honestly, I don’t really remember why. Old age, you know? It slips my mind. Can we just get on with it?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. Completely understandable. It's very common for things to be a bit…fuzzy. Just to be thorough, and to ensure I have a complete picture, could you perhaps recall who requested the lab work?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I really don’t. A phone call, maybe? Someone said Medicare… look, it was a while back. I get a lot of calls. It was probably someone official. I don't keep track of these things. Is it important? Can't we just check with Medicare? I'd really like to just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know the specific reason for the tests, Mr. Croonquist, to ensure we order the correct ones and interpret the results accurately. However, I understand your frustration. Let me check your record here… Ah, yes. It appears a routine wellness check was recommended by your primary care physician, Dr. Anya Sharma, approximately three months ago. Does that name sound familiar?
PATIENT: Sharma… Sharma… Maybe? I see a lot of doctors, you know. A specialist here, a generalist there… keeps a man busy. Is she… near? Do I go to her often? Honestly, I'm terrible with names. If she’s the one who said to do the tests, then fine. Just… let's do the tests. Are we getting closer to actually doing them?
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Sharma is affiliated with the clinic, though you haven't been seen by her recently. It appears she recommended a comprehensive metabolic panel and a complete blood count as part of your annual wellness screening. Before we proceed, are you currently experiencing any symptoms – anything at all – that are concerning you?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, I get a little… tired, sometimes. But that’s just getting old, isn't it? And my knees ache. Horribly. But that's arthritis, the doctor told me years ago. Nothing new. No… no fevers, no coughs, nothing like that. Just the usual aches and pains of a long life. Are those the kind of symptoms you mean? Look, I’m not a complicated case, Doctor. Just the tests, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. Fatigue and knee pain – noted. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… I eat. Sometimes more, sometimes less. It varies. Weight… uh… probably lost a bit, I suppose. Hard to say. I don't weigh myself regularly. Used to be a lot bigger, but… well, things shrink as you get older, don't they? I'm mostly skin and bones these days. Can we please just get to the blood work? I have an appointment later.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Croonquist, we’ll get to the blood work shortly. I apologize for the questions, but these details help me build a complete picture of your health. One final question, and then we can proceed. Have you experienced any dizziness, shortness of breath, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Dizziness… no, not really. Maybe a little unsteady sometimes, but that's just… balance. Shortness of breath? Only when I climb the stairs, and that’s always been the case. And my ankles… They’re a bit puffy, I suppose. But like I said, arthritis. Everything swells. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I'm being interrogated! Can we just do the tests now? I'm getting impatient. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist, alright. No further questions. I understand your impatience. It seems we’ve covered the basics. We'll proceed with the comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count. If you’ll have a seat, the phlebotomist will be with you shortly to draw the blood. They'll explain the process. Do you have any allergies to latex or alcohol swabs?
