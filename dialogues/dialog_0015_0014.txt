DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm... let me see. My wife, bless her heart, she said I need to get some… papers. Something about needing them for work? It’s a bit fuzzy, to be honest. Something about time off… or maybe if I can’t work? I’m Directors, Religious Activities and Education, you see, and… well, it's all a bit muddled. I think it has something to do with FMLA or Disability, she mentioned those words. Do you know what I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds like your wife is concerned about potential leave options – either Family and Medical Leave, or potentially short-term disability. It’s good she’s thinking ahead. Let’s clarify what’s going on with you that would necessitate that. Could you tell me about any health concerns you’re experiencing right now?
PATIENT: Health concerns… That’s a good question, Doctor. Honestly, it’s not one big thing. Just…feeling a bit off, you know? A little tired more often. And… my memory isn’t what it used to be. My wife says I repeat myself. It's probably just getting older, though. I don’t know if that's something you’d need papers for? I still get to work every day, mostly. It's just… harder sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some memory issues. It is good that you're still able to work, but it's certainly worth investigating any changes in your cognitive function and energy levels. To get a clearer picture, let's start with the fatigue. When did you start noticing it?
PATIENT: Hmm... when did I start noticing it? Oh dear. That's… a tough one. It wasn’t sudden, you see. It sort of… crept up on me. Maybe… six months ago? Around the time of the church fundraiser, I think. Everything was a little hectic then. But it’s gotten…steadier, I suppose. It’s not like I can’t do things, but it takes more effort now. A lot more. I used to be able to go all day. Now, I need a little… rest. Here and there. It's hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Six months, coinciding with a busy period. That's helpful. And you said it takes more effort. Can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: What does it feel like? It’s… like wading through something, Doctor. Not pain, exactly. More like… everything is a bit slower. Takes longer to think. Longer to get going in the morning. Even just… deciding what to have for breakfast feels like work sometimes! It’s not a constant thing, mind you. Some days are better than others. But on the tougher days, it’s like my brain is…foggy. And then the tiredness just makes it worse, of course. Do you understand? It’s a bit hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. That sounds like significant cognitive fatigue. Okay, let’s move onto the memory issues your wife has noticed. Could you give me a specific example of something you've forgotten recently, or something you've repeated yourself about?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s… embarrassing. Well, just yesterday, I asked my wife what we were having for dinner three times. She had just told me, you know? And then five minutes later, I asked again. And then again after she set the table! She just smiled, bless her, but I felt terrible. And then there was the church meeting last week… I completely forgot who was supposed to bring the refreshments. I had it written down, I know I did, but… it was just gone. Completely vanished from my head. It's little things, mostly. But they’re adding up, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, repeated questioning about recent events and difficulty recalling commitments. Let’s do a quick cognitive assessment. I’ll ask you a few simple questions to get a baseline. It's nothing to worry about, just a standard procedure. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today's date… Oh, goodness. Let me see… It's… August… August the… Is it the 1st? No… my wife said something about the 2nd? Yes! August the 2nd. 2025, right? Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct, August 2nd, 2025. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh… Well, this is… a nice office. It’s not Honolulu, that’s for sure. We moved… a long time ago. Is this… Suburban? My wife mentioned something about Suburban when she made the appointment. Is that the city? It’s… a bit blurry, I’m afraid. I don't recall the actual name...
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… My wife gives me something for my… blood pressure, I believe. A little white pill. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, she gives me something for that too. A yellow one. But that's it, I think. Nothing regularly, really. Just those two, when needed. Do I need to remember the names? My wife usually handles all that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, it’s important that I have accurate information. Knowing the specific medications you’re taking, even if it's just occasionally, is crucial. I’m going to ask my nurse to bring in your EHR information. It should list everything that’s been prescribed to you. While we wait for that, could you tell me about any family history of memory problems, dementia, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Oh… family history… Let me see… My mother… she was always a bit forgetful, now that I think about it. Nothing serious, mind you. Just… misplacing things, forgetting names. My uncle, on my father's side… he had something… a doctor mentioned something about his brain, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the details. It's… a bit fuzzy. We didn’t talk about those things much back then. Mostly just shrugged it off as getting old. I wish I could be more helpful. My memory just isn't what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Maternal forgetfulness and paternal uncle with a possible neurological condition. We will need to investigate that further. My nurse is getting your EHR now. In the meantime, let’s do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your vital signs, reflexes, and do a quick neurological assessment. It’s standard procedure when evaluating memory concerns. If you'll just follow me over here…
PATIENT: Alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I just… hope it’s nothing serious. It's just… unsettling, you know? Not remembering things. My wife is going to be worried. She’s a good woman, bless her heart. She worries about everything. Let’s get this over with, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Limtiaco, I'm just going to check your reflexes now. This might feel a little strange. Two plus bilaterally. Good. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes… I can see it. A little… blurry, maybe. But I can see it. Is it… going left? No, right. It's a bit hard to focus, Doctor. Everything seems to be… swimming a little. Do you mind if I close my eyes for a moment? It might help me concentrate.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, you are exhibiting some concerning neurological signs, including difficulty with visual tracking and mild disorientation. We need to rule out any acute processes. Nurse, could you please prepare an order for a stat MRI of the brain?
PATIENT: MRI? What… what's wrong? Is it serious? I just came in for some papers, you see. Papers for my work… My wife said something about FMLA or disability… Is it… is it my brain? Am I… losing my mind? I don't feel well, Doctor. I really don't feel well.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, please try to remain calm. We are taking the necessary steps to determine the cause of your symptoms. An MRI will give us a detailed picture of your brain and help us rule out any serious underlying conditions. It does not necessarily mean something is wrong, but it is important to investigate. Based on my initial assessment, and given your reported memory issues and these new neurological findings, I strongly recommend you go to the Emergency Department immediately. We need to rule out a stroke or other acute neurological event. I will have the nurse arrange transport for you. This is a precaution, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s better to be safe and get a thorough evaluation right away. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Stroke?… Emergency Department?… Oh dear God… I… I don’t understand… I just wanted some papers… My wife… she’s going to be so worried… Can’t we just… wait? Maybe it’s just… getting old? I don’t feel right, Doctor. I really, really don’t feel right. I think… I think I need my wife. .
