DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Mirriam. It is a pleasure to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups, you see. Been going on for…oh, goodness, a few days now. Not constantly, but enough to be a real nuisance. It’s just…hic!…annoying, really.
DOCTOR: A few days, you say. And they're intermittent, not a continuous barrage?
PATIENT: No, not a barrage, definitely not. That would be awful, wouldn't it? More like…they pop up, hic!…every now and then. Maybe five or six times an hour? Hard to say exactly, I’m not really counting them, you know. Just enough to make me jump a little and sometimes spill my tea. That's the worst part, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Not really, not that I’ve been able to figure out. I was gardening yesterday, but I get hiccups sometimes when I’m just…sitting, watching TV. I had a bit of a fright when the neighbor’s dog barked at me last week, and I remember having a few then, but I don’t know if that’s connected. Honestly, Doctor, it seems pretty random. It’s just…hic!…peculiar.
DOCTOR: Random, you say. And gardening…that could be relevant, but not definitive. Now, Ms. Sucich, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, medical history… Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago – goodness, must be thirty years now? And my knees aren’t what they used to be, naturally. I see Dr. Sharma for that. Nothing major, really. Oh, and I was divorced, a long time ago. Does that count as a medical condition? Just teasing, Doctor. I'm generally quite healthy for my age, I think. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Divorces, while undoubtedly stressful, do not typically feature in my medical assessments, Ms. Sucich. I'm glad to hear you’re generally healthy. And Dr. Sharma manages your knees…are you currently taking any medications, prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, right, silly me. Yes, well, I take a glucosamine supplement for the knees, and sometimes ibuprofen if they're particularly sore. Other than that…just a multivitamin, I think. Nothing regular, nothing strong. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible, you know? I prefer a good cup of ginger tea if I'm feeling unwell. It usually does the trick.
DOCTOR: Glucosamine and ibuprofen as needed. Understandable. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside these hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… No, not really. No chest pain, no trouble breathing, no heartburn. Just the hiccups, hic!… and maybe a little bit of tiredness lately, but I’m 86, Doctor! I think a little tiredness comes with the territory. I sleep alright, though. No problems there. I’ve just felt…a bit unsettled, I suppose. Not sick, just…off. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: “Off” is rather vague, Ms. Sucich. Nevertheless, the lack of other symptoms is…reassuring. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and perhaps palpate your abdomen. It's merely a precautionary measure.
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Sounds sensible. Go right ahead. I'm not squeamish. I’ve had a few examinations in my life, you know. Just…hic!…try not to jump when I hiccup, alright? It’s rather startling for everyone.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please take a deep breath…and exhale slowly. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Now, if you’ll permit me, I’ll just gently palpate your abdomen. No tenderness, no masses detected. Slightly distended, but not acutely concerning given your age and history. Everything appears within normal limits, Ms. Sucich.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear, Doctor. I was starting to worry it was something serious. It's just these hiccups, isn't it? They’re so…hic!...frustrating! Is there anything you think I should do? Any special tea I should drink? Or a position I should try to lie in? I read on the internet that holding your breath can help, but I’m not sure I trust everything I read on the internet these days.
DOCTOR: The internet is rarely a reliable source of medical advice, Ms. Sucich. Holding your breath can sometimes be effective, but it is a temporary measure at best. In your case, given the lack of any underlying pathology detected during the examination, these hiccups are likely benign and self-limiting. I recommend maintaining adequate hydration, avoiding carbonated beverages, and……and attempting to reduce any unnecessary stress. Though I understand stress is inevitable as one ages, minimizing it where possible is always advisable.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds sensible. More water, less fizz, and less…worrying. Easier said than done, Doctor! But I’ll try. It’s good to know it’s probably nothing serious, though. That’s a weight off my mind. Perhaps a nice cup of chamomile tea will do the trick. And if it doesn’t, well…I suppose I’ll just have to live with a few more hiccups. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You are welcome, Ms. Sucich. If the hiccups persist for an extended period—more than a week, or if they become particularly severe—I recommend returning for further evaluation. However, based on today's assessment, I believe a "wait and see" approach is the most appropriate course of action. Do you have any other concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Just the hiccups. Thank you again for your time and patience. And thank you for assuring me it’s probably nothing to worry about. It’s good to know. I appreciate it. I'll try the chamomile tea, and I'll see you if they don't go away. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do not hesitate to contact the office if your condition worsens. Good day, Ms. Sucich. .
