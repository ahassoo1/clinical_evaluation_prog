DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. My name is Dr. Hembrey. I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you please tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, Brum is the name. My head… the back of my head hurts. It started, hmm… maybe three days ago now? Not a bad pain, not like falling, but… always there. Like a weight.
DOCTOR: Three days, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Three days. Maybe four. Time… it goes fast, you know? I try to remember, but… anyway. It’s in the back. Right here. Not my forehead, not my temples. Back. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Brum, that’s… helpful. And would you describe this pain as constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, Doctor. Always there. Like… like a small stone sitting on my head. It doesn’t pulse, you know? Not a thumping pain. Just… there. Even when I sleep. Makes it hard to… focus. I used to be good with numbers, working on the rail yard, but now… it slips away.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you experienced any other symptoms along with this headache?
PATIENT: Hmm. Other… let me think. No fever. No… blurry vision. I eat okay, maybe a little less hungry, but that could be my age. Sometimes I feel… dizzy, but just for a second. When I stand up too fast. Is that… is that the headache, or something else? It’s hard to tell, you know? I’m ninety years old! Things… break.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any recent falls or injuries to your head, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No falls. I walk with my cane, yes, but I’m careful. Used to climb all over those rail cars, see? Now I just… walk. No bumps, no hits to the head. Haven’t had a bad fall in… oh, a long time. Maybe when I was a boy. A long, long time ago. I remember the dust, though. Always dust on the rail yard.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications for any other conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pills. Never been much for pills. I drink my coffee, eat my beans, and try to keep moving. That's all. My wife, she… she had a little trouble with her heart, towards the end, but I don’t take anything. Don’t need anything. I just want this… weight on my head to go away. It’s not big pain, but it’s always there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had allergies. Not to bee stings, not to dust, not to anything. I worked outside all my life, you see? Dust, sun, rain… I got used to it. My wife, she was sensitive, had to be careful with flowers, but me? No. No allergies. Just… old. And this headache.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to perform a brief neurological exam, Mr. Brum. This will help me assess the situation further. It’s just a series of simple tests, nothing to be concerned about. Could you please follow my instructions as best you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. I will try. I might be slow, you know? Things don’t move like they used to. But I will try to do what you ask. Just tell me what to do, slowly. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Good. First, I want you to close your eyes. Now, tell me if I am touching one finger or two, when I touch your forehead.
PATIENT: Closed. Okay. Hmm… one. No, wait. Two. Yes, two fingers. There. Then… one. Now two again. It's… hard to tell, Doctor. They feel close together. Not easy like when I was younger. But I think… two, then one. Are you sure you’re only using two fingers? It feels… crowded.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Brum, I assure you, I am only using two fingers. Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes – don't move your head, just your eyes.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Just my eyes. Not my head. There… and there… it's… getting harder. It feels… strange. Like they don’t want to move. I’m trying, Doctor, I really am. But my neck feels… stiff. Is that normal? It’s like the weight on my head is pulling everything down. I’m following, I think… but it’s not smooth. Like… like watching a boat on choppy water. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, I want you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can.
PATIENT: Okay. Squeeze. Like this? Not very strong, Doctor. I used to have strong hands, working on the rail yard, but… they’re old now. Not much strength left. I’m squeezing, though. As hard as I can. It’s… tiring. It feels strange, like trying to crush something soft. Is that right? Not much power, I’m afraid. But I’m trying.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Breathing. Like this? Deep breaths… It feels… tight. In my chest. I used to run up and down the rail cars, you know? Never had trouble breathing then. But now… it feels like there’s a weight on my chest too. Like the weight on my head… everything feels heavy. Deeper now? Is that right? I’m trying, Doctor. It’s just… harder than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam I’ve conducted, your symptoms—the constant headache, the slight weakness, the breathing difficulties—are concerning. It’s difficult to say definitively what’s going on without further investigation, but given your age and the nature of your symptoms, we need to rule out some serious possibilities. I am ordering a CT scan of your head, as well as a chest X-ray. We’ll also need to do some blood work.
PATIENT: A scan? And blood work? Oh dear. What… what are you looking for, Doctor? Is it something bad? I just have a headache, you know? A small weight on my head. I don't want… I don't want a lot of trouble. Is it going to hurt? And how long will it take? I don’t like hospitals… or… whatever place you send me to. I just want to feel better. Can you tell me… is it serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. Brum, I understand your concerns. However, it's essential we investigate this thoroughly. A CT scan will allow us to visualize your brain and rule out any structural abnormalities, such as a tumor or bleeding. The chest X-ray will assess your lungs. As for whether it's serious, it’s too early to say definitively. We need the results of these tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. The tests themselves are relatively painless—the CT scan involves lying still for a short period of time, and the blood work is a simple prick of the finger. I will have the nurses explain the procedures in detail. I’m also going to order an EKG just to get a baseline of your heart rhythm. I understand you don't like hospitals, but this is for your own well-being. We need to rule out anything serious. I’ll also have a referral sent to a neurologist, just to be safe.
PATIENT: A neurologist? Oh dear. So you do think it’s serious. I just want this weight to go away, Doctor. That's all. Not… not all these tests and doctors. My wife… she had so many tests towards the end. It didn’t help. Is there… is there anything else? Anything I can do now? Before all these… things? Maybe a pill? Just something to take the edge off? I don’t want to be a bother. I just want to feel… a little better. A small weight, that’s all. Is there anything?
DOCTOR: Mr. Brum, I understand you’re anxious, but I’m not going to prescribe medication without a clear diagnosis. Giving you a pill without knowing the underlying cause could potentially mask a serious problem and delay appropriate treatment. Frankly, you’re ninety years old. Some changes are to be expected. But we need to be thorough. The nursing staff will be in shortly to draw your blood and explain the imaging procedures. I suggest you try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results. And please, try not to worry. We're doing everything we can. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: …Other patients. Yes. Just a small weight… I wish I hadn’t come. Thank you, Doctor. .
