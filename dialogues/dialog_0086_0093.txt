DOCTOR: Right. Chanz Redfern, 29 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, that’s me. Look, honestly? I just… don’t sleep well. And I feel kinda… floppy, you know? Like I haven't got much go anymore. It's been… a while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. Things kinda blur. It’s not… debilitating, but it’s annoying. I used to be… more energetic. Much more.
DOCTOR: “Floppy,” you say. Right. And this… lack of energy and trouble sleeping – when did you first start noticing these things?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, that’s the problem! I really don’t remember. A good while after… everything. It wasn’t right after, definitely. I mean, you’d expect that, wouldn’t you? But it just… crept up on me. Months, maybe? Longer? Honestly, doctor, I’m not good with dates. I just know I’m not… firing on all cylinders anymore. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It's… unhelpful when patients can’t pinpoint a timeframe. Months, potentially longer… Alright. And when you say “everything,” what specifically are you referring to?
PATIENT: It's… my wife. She… passed away. A while ago now. I don’t really… talk about it. It wasn’t… pleasant. A car accident. Look, it’s not important for my… floppiness, is it? I just… haven't been the same since. It’s not like I expect you to fix that, obviously. But it was… a big thing. And things just… got fuzzy after that, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course. Loss is… significant. And it certainly can manifest in many ways. Though, we still need to determine if there’s a medical explanation for your current symptoms. Let’s try to be a bit more specific. When you sleep – or attempt to sleep – what exactly is the problem?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s not like I can’t get to sleep, necessarily. It’s just… not good sleep. I wake up a lot. Toss and turn. And when I do finally drift off, I feel like I haven’t rested at all when I get up. Like I just… lay there. And I’m tired all the time. Even after eight hours. It's frustrating, honestly. And I'm always a bit… sluggish, you know? Not sharp. I used to be able to focus for hours on restoring an instrument, now… I get distracted easily.
DOCTOR: So, difficulty maintaining sleep, non-restorative sleep, and daytime fatigue. And you mentioned a loss of concentration. Do you snore?
PATIENT: Snore? Uh… I don’t know, actually. My wife… she used to complain, I think. But I haven’t… slept with anyone since. It’s been a while. So, I honestly couldn’t tell you if I do or don’t. I suppose I could ask… never mind. It’s a silly question, really.
DOCTOR: Not silly, necessarily. It’s relevant. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Hmm… not really. I haven’t been… tracking it, if that's what you mean. I’m pretty… consistently… this size. Always been tall and… not bulky, I guess. Maybe a little less appetite lately, now that I think about it. But nothing drastic. I eat when I'm hungry. Usually just… sandwiches, really. Or something quick. Don’t have much time for fancy meals.
DOCTOR: “Quick meals.” Right. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh, no. Nothing. I try to avoid… all that, if I can. My wife… she was always taking something for this and that. It worried me. So, I just… don't bother. A bit of ibuprofen now and then, if I’ve got a headache. But that's it. Definitely no regular medications. I'm a fairly healthy guy, otherwise. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look in your ears and throat. And I'll need to feel your thyroid. It’s standard procedure, given your symptoms. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Ugh, really? All that? Look, I just told you I’m a healthy guy. I’m not sure poking and prodding is going to tell you anything you don’t already know. But… fine. If you insist. Just… try to be quick, alright? I’ve got work to do. Instruments don't repair themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, rate is 72. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Thyroid is slightly enlarged, non-tender. No nodules appreciated. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Tympanic membranes are normal. Throat appears clear. Alright. Everything appears normal on initial examination, but the slightly enlarged thyroid is something we need to investigate further. I’m going to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a thyroid panel – TSH, T4, T3 – and a Vitamin D level. We’ll also check your iron levels. It’s fairly routine.
PATIENT: Blood work? Seriously? Now we’re getting into… a lot. Look, I really think this is unnecessary. I just need a good night’s sleep, that's all. My wife always said I worried too much. And now this… Is this going to be expensive? I’m on Medicare, you know. I don’t want any… surprises. And it’s still just… floppiness.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, I understand your reluctance, but it's my responsibility to rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms. "Floppiness," as you put it, can be indicative of several things. The blood work is standard procedure and will be covered by Medicare. It's better to be thorough and address any potential issues now, rather than let them progress. It's a relatively simple test. We need to look at your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and overall blood health. It’s not about assuming the worst, it’s about being certain. Are you willing to proceed with the blood work?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, alright. Just… get it over with. But don't expect any miracles. I’m telling you, it’s just… stress. And not enough sleep. Instruments are demanding, you know. They require… attention. But if you have to poke around in my blood, go ahead. Just… make it quick. And don’t bother with anything fancy. Keep it simple.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab is just down the hall, third door on the left. They’ll draw a few vials of blood. It shouldn’t take more than fifteen minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend trying to establish a regular sleep schedule – go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, even on weekends. And avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… tell me if anything is seriously wrong, alright? I haven’t got time for… complications. And I still think this is a waste of time, but… fine. I’ll go get poked. Just… let me know when I can schedule the follow-up, alright? I've got instruments to fix.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The receptionist will schedule that for you when you check out. And yes, we will contact you as soon as we have the results. Have a good day, Mr. Redfern.
