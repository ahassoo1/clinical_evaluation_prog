DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Asthore. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Lahn. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Lahn. It is good to meet you as well. My wife, she make the appointment for me. I been… feeling weaker, you see. Not all at once, but little by little, over some time now. It’s hard to explain. She say I need to have someone look at it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that your wife encouraged you to come in – it's always helpful to have someone notice changes in our health. “Feeling weaker” can mean a lot of things. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, she is a good woman, my wife. Always looking out for me. Hmm… weaker… well, like… lifting things. Used to be, I could carry the groceries in from the car no problem. Now, I need help. And walking… not so far now. Used to walk to the store, every day. Now, I get tired quick. It’s not pain, you understand. Just… no strength. It’s mostly in my legs, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful to know. So it’s a gradual loss of strength, mostly in your legs, making everyday tasks like lifting and walking more difficult. And it's not accompanied by pain, which is good. Has this been happening over a specific period of time – can you estimate how long you’ve been noticing this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It start… maybe six months ago? Small things, at first. I thought I just getting old, you know? But it keep getting a little worse each month. My wife, she notice it faster than me, I think. She say I was shuffling my feet a little when I walk. I didn’t feel it. But she point it out.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of gradual weakness, primarily in your legs, with your wife noticing changes in your gait before you did. That's good information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Sometimes my hands, they feel… numb? Not all the time. Just comes and goes. And… I get tired easier. Not just from walking, but just… all day tired. Like I haven’t slept good, even when I have. And sometimes, my vision, it get blurry. But that could be my glasses, I think. I haven’t had them check in a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, so numbness in your hands that comes and goes, increased fatigue, and some blurry vision. We'll definitely want to look into all of those. Just to clarify, is the numbness in both hands, or just one?
PATIENT: Mostly in both hands, Doctor. It’s not always at the same time. Sometimes just the left, sometimes the right, sometimes both. And it’s not… a bad numbness, you understand? Just like… pins and needles. Not painful, just… strange. And it come and go so quick. Hard to catch.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent pins and needles sensation in both hands. Thank you for explaining that so clearly. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well… I had a bad flu, many years ago. And my blood pressure, it get a little high sometimes, but I take a pill for that. Nothing… serious, you understand? Oh! And the doctor, a long time ago, he say I had something with my… nerves. I don’t remember the name. Something with the… covering of the nerves. He give me some shots, and it went away. My wife, she will remember better than me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of the flu, managed high blood pressure with medication, and a past issue with your nerves – something involving the nerve coverings treated with injections. That’s helpful. Do you know what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it right here in my wallet. Here it is. Lisinopril. That’s the name of it. Twenty milligrams, one pill every day. My wife, she make sure I take it. She is very good at that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 20mg daily. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. I eat everything. Shellfish, peanuts, everything. And no… I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to any medicine. Never. My wife, she ask me every time I go to the doctor, and I always tell her, “No allergies.”
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had surgery. And no other hospital stays. Just the flu, many years ago. It was a bad one, but I got over it. My wife, she take care of me. She make me soup, and keep me warm. She is a very good wife.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my father, he was a strong man, but he got… sick when he was old. Something with his mind, you understand? He forget things. My mother, she live a long life, very healthy. She pass away when she was 90. I have two brothers, they are both healthy. And one sister, she have problems with her… joints. Arthritis, I think. She have pain in her knees and hands. She take medicine for it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of dementia in your father, a long life for your mother, and arthritis in your sister. That’s helpful information. Now, before we do a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I used to work hard. Fisherman, for many years. Very strong work. But I retire now. I like to sit and watch the television. And I like to spend time with my wife. We go to church every Sunday. I don’t drink much anymore. Just a little wine with dinner, sometimes. And I don’t smoke. Never have. I try to eat healthy, but my wife, she does most of the cooking.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re retired, enjoying time with your wife, attending church, and maintaining a relatively healthy lifestyle with minimal alcohol consumption and no smoking. That’s all very good. Alright, Mr. Asthore, based on what you've told me, and looking at your record here, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just tell me what you want me to do. My wife, she always say I need to listen to the doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Now, I’m going to check your pulses in your feet and legs. Your pulses feel a little weak, but present. I'm going to test your reflexes in your knees and ankles now. Okay, those are a little diminished as well. Finally, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam, checking your balance and coordination. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s a little hard, but I can do it. I used to be very strong. Is this okay? I don’t want to fall. My wife, she would be worried.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Asthore, that’s perfectly okay. Please just stay steady as you can. I notice a slight shuffling gait, and some instability when you stand. Could you walk a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s hard to walk straight. I feel like I’m going to fall. I used to be able to walk for miles. It's getting harder and harder.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Asthore. That was very helpful. Alright, based on what you’ve told me and the findings from the exam – the weakness in your legs, the numbness in your hands, the fatigue, the shuffling gait, and diminished reflexes – I suspect you may be experiencing symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. It is likely caused by damage to the nerves in your extremities, causing weakness, numbness, and pain, though you haven’t described pain yet. This can have multiple causes, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, or certain medications. However, to confirm this diagnosis and determine the underlying cause, we'll need to do some blood work and potentially a nerve conduction study. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Peripheral… what was that, Doctor? And a… nerve study? Blood work, that is okay. I get blood work all the time. But a nerve study… sounds scary. What does that involve? And what causes this… this nerve problem? Is it serious? My wife, she would want to know. I don’t want to be too much trouble.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mr. Asthore, and it’s perfectly normal to be concerned. “Peripheral neuropathy” simply means damage to the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord – the nerves that go to your arms and legs. It’s not uncommon, and it doesn't necessarily mean something serious, but it does need to be investigated. The nerve conduction study is a non-invasive test where we place small electrodes on your skin to measure the speed of the nerve signals. It doesn't involve needles or anything painful – it just feels like a mild electrical tingling. It helps us pinpoint exactly which nerves are affected and how severely. As for the causes, there are many possibilities. Diabetes is a common one, so we'll check your blood sugar levels. Vitamin deficiencies, especially B vitamins, can also cause neuropathy. Certain medications can have side effects that affect the nerves. In some cases, it can be due to other underlying medical conditions. To be clear, it’s too early to say definitively what’s causing your symptoms. The tests will help us figure that out. Would you like me to explain the blood work in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. Explain the blood work. I understand about checking for… sugar. My wife, she is always telling me to watch what I eat. But what else will they look for? And if… if it is serious, what can be done about it? Is there medicine? Or… something else? I don’t want to just sit here and get weaker. My wife, she worries about me. I want to be able to still help her around the house.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Asthore, that's a very reasonable concern. The blood work will be quite comprehensive. We'll check your basic metabolic panel – that includes your blood sugar, kidney function, and electrolytes. We’ll also check a complete blood count to look at your red and white blood cells, and we'll assess your vitamin levels, particularly B12 and other B vitamins. We’ll also be checking thyroid function, as sometimes thyroid problems can cause similar symptoms. We'll also run a test for inflammatory markers. If the blood work reveals an underlying cause, such as diabetes, we’ll start treatment to manage that condition. For neuropathy specifically, there are medications available to help relieve the symptoms, such as nerve pain. Physical therapy can also be very helpful to improve your strength and balance. In some cases, lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, can make a big difference. If the cause is unclear, or if the symptoms are severe, we may need to consult with a neurologist, a specialist in nerve disorders. But let's not jump to conclusions yet. We'll start with the blood work, and then we can discuss the results and create a treatment plan that's right for you. Does that sound alright, Mr. Asthore?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… okay. I’m still a little scared, but I feel better knowing what you are going to do. I trust you. And I’m glad you mentioned the physical therapy. My legs feel so weak. Maybe that will help. Can my wife come with me when I get the blood drawn? She always helps me remember things. And she is good at asking questions. My wife, she is very smart.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Asthore. Your wife is very welcome to come with you for the blood draw. Having someone with you for support and to help remember things is a great idea. We'll make sure she is included in the conversation and can ask any questions she may have. I’ll write up a lab order for you now, and I'll also include instructions for fasting, if any are needed. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in about a week, once they come back. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A week sounds… good. Fasting… I think my wife will remind me about that. Thank you, Doctor Lahn. You have been very kind and patient with me. And you explained everything so clearly. My wife, she will be very happy to hear that. I think that is all for now. You can just tell me where to go to get the blood work done.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Asthore. It's my pleasure to help. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. The reception desk will be able to help you check in, and they’ll let the phlebotomist know you’re here for the blood work I ordered. They'll also give you instructions about the fasting requirements, if needed. Here is your lab order. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’re here to help. And please, take care of yourself, Mr. Asthore. And give my best to your wife.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Lahn. We will. Have a good day.
