DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Kelder, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Raymonde Kelder. Though most folks just call me Raymonde. It’s… nice to meet you, Doctor… Memmolo, is it? My mind’s not what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Memmolo. And you can call me Ronnisha, if you must. Though frankly, I’m quite busy. Now, what brings you in today, Raymonde?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this… tummy trouble. It’s been going on for a bit now. I don’t seem to be able to eat much before I feel full, and then… well, I feel sick to my stomach a lot. Not always, mind you, but enough to be worrisome. It's… unpleasant. I just don’t have much of an appetite anymore either. It feels like something's just… off.
DOCTOR: "Tummy trouble," right. And how long has this "tummy trouble" been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question… a good question. Let me think… It feels like… a couple of months, maybe? Hard to say exactly. Time just… slips away, you know? It started gradually, just not wanting much food, and then getting full quicker. Now it's… more frequent, this feeling sick. I don't remember when it really got bad, just that it’s been a while. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: A couple of months. Vague, but alright. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes I feel like I'm going to… well, you know. And I have been sick a few times. Not a lot, thankfully. It’s usually just… in the mornings, or after I try to eat something that doesn’t sit right. Mostly it’s just this queasy feeling, though. Like I've got a stone in my stomach. Does that make any sense? I don’t know if it’s… important.
DOCTOR: Morning sickness… at your age?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh, goodness, no, Doctor! No sickness of that kind. I just meant it happens in the mornings more often. It's just… when I get up, sometimes it hits me. I haven’t… well, I haven't been pregnant in decades! I have three grown grandchildren, you know. It’s just a bad way of explaining, I guess. I'm so sorry. My brain isn’t working well today.
DOCTOR: Fine, fine. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh my. Well… that’s a personal question, isn’t it? Um… yes, a little. I haven’t been… regular, let's put it that way. Sometimes I have trouble going, and sometimes… well, it’s just different. Not as much as usual, that's for sure. I hadn’t really thought much of it, to be honest. I just figured it was… old age catching up with me. Is that… is that important too?
DOCTOR: "Old age." Right. Any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no! No, no blood. At least, not that I’ve seen. I… I always check, you know. Just in case. It hasn’t been anything like that. That would be… alarming, wouldn't it? I haven’t noticed anything unusual in that respect, thankfully. It’s mostly just… less of it, if you know what I mean. I hope that’s not… a bad sign.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, actually. Now that you mention it… my clothes have been a little looser. I hadn’t paid much attention, to be honest. I figured it was just… losing a little weight as I get older. But looking back… I suppose I have lost a few pounds. Not a lot, but… noticeable. I haven't been trying to, that's for sure. I just haven't been very hungry, and I guess I'm not eating as much.
DOCTOR: Unintentional weight loss… Right. And are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes. Not a sharp pain, but a kind of… ache. Mostly in my belly, you know? It comes and goes. It’s not constant, thankfully. Sometimes it’s after I eat, and sometimes it’s just… there. It's more uncomfortable than anything, really. Not like a really bad pain, just a… dull ache. It’s hard to describe. And it’s not always there, that’s the thing. It comes and goes. It feels like… pressure, maybe? I don't know if that helps. It's just a little something, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. Lie back on the examination table. I need to listen to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. A physical exam… yes. Of course. I hope I'm not… a bother. My joints aren't what they used to be, so it might be a little difficult getting up and down. I'll try my best. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I trust your judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Normal bowel sounds, though a bit… sluggish. Palpating abdomen… Tenderness in the lower right quadrant. Not acutely painful, but present. No rebound tenderness. A little discomfort here. Anything specific when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… That’s… that’s where it feels a little uncomfortable usually. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like a pressure, maybe? It doesn't really hurt unless you… well, unless you push on it like that. It's been like that for a bit, I suppose. It's not constant, but that's where I feel it most often. It feels… heavy, almost? It’s hard to explain. Is that… is that a bad sign? I do worry easily, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms – the vague abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite, weight loss, changes in bowel habits, and tenderness in the lower right quadrant – we need to rule out a few possibilities. It could be something minor, like diverticulitis, but we can’t assume anything. We need some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood, and we’ll schedule the CT scan for tomorrow. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. A CT scan… and blood work… That sounds… serious. Allergies to… contrast dye? Um… I don't think so. I’ve had tests before, I believe, but a long time ago. I don't recall having any problems. I haven't been to the doctor in… well, a while, so I’m not sure. I don't remember being allergic to anything, really. But I don't want to risk anything. Should I be worried? I'm not good with medical things, you see. It scares me a little.
DOCTOR: We'll take precautions. The nurse will ask you about allergies again, and we'll monitor you closely during the scan. It's standard procedure. For now, let's focus on getting the tests done. We'll have a clearer picture once we have the results. I'm ordering the blood work now, and the nurse will be in shortly to draw it. Is there anything else you'd like to ask?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. No, I… I think that's all. Just… the sooner it's done, the better, I suppose. I trust your judgement, Doctor. And thank you… for taking care of me. I just hope it’s not anything too serious. I've lived a long life, and I'd like to keep it that way. I'm not afraid of a little discomfort, but… well, you understand. Is there anything I should do before the tests? Anything I should avoid eating or drinking? I don't want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: No, nothing specific. Just try to relax. The nurse will give you detailed instructions before the blood work. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. I'll review the results when they come in, and we’ll discuss them at your follow-up appointment. The nurse will schedule that for you. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Yes, of course. Thank you, Doctor. Good day… I suppose. .
