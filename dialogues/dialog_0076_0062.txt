DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Knabenshue, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Rayshun Knabenshue. It is a pleasure to meet you, Doctor Ruocco.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Pleasure’s all yours, I suppose. Look, I’m a busy man. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, sir, it concerns the requirements at my place of work. We are now being asked to wear masks and… other protective things, all day. And frankly, it’s causing me some difficulty. I’m hoping to discuss a possible exemption, if that is possible.
DOCTOR: Masks… Right. And what difficulties are we talking about, exactly?
PATIENT: It’s… a bit hard to explain, Doctor. It’s not that I can’t wear them, exactly. It’s more… a feeling of being… constricted. Like I can’t breathe as freely. And it brings back… unpleasant memories. I work with people, you see, protecting them. And feeling… hindered… makes it difficult to do my job effectively. It causes a bit of anxiety, to be honest. I’ve never had trouble breathing normally, before this.
DOCTOR: Anxiety?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. A feeling of being… closed in. It’s hard to describe. I work as a Protective Service Worker, and I need to be alert, calm, and able to react quickly. This mask… it makes me feel… less so. It is not a panic attack, Doctor, just a persistent… unease. I want to be able to do my job, to help people, and I worry this makes that harder.
DOCTOR: Protective Services… right. And you expect a medical exemption for… feelings?
PATIENT: Well, sir, I understand it might seem unusual. But these feelings are impacting my ability to perform my duties. I thought a doctor might be able to assess whether this is something that warrants consideration. I am not asking for special treatment, Doctor. Just an evaluation of whether wearing a mask all day is… advisable, given how it affects me. Perhaps there are alternatives?
DOCTOR: Alternatives. Look, Mr. Knabenshue, I’ve got a waiting room full of people with actual medical problems. We’re talking about a cloth over your face. Now, do you have any underlying respiratory conditions?
PATIENT: No, sir. As I said, I’ve never had trouble breathing. No asthma, no COPD, nothing of that sort. Perfectly healthy, otherwise. I had a check-up just last year. I just… experience this discomfort when I am required to wear a mask for extended periods. It is new, this feeling. And I wanted to see if there was a medical reason for it, or if there might be a way to accommodate me.
DOCTOR: So, perfectly healthy man experiencing… discomfort. Alright. Let’s do a quick listen to your lungs, just to be thorough. Sit back.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen. I appreciate you being thorough.
DOCTOR: Deep breaths… and again… Okay. Lungs sound clear. Perfectly normal. No wheezing, no crackles. Honestly, Mr. Knabenshue, I’m not finding anything medically wrong here. It sounds like… a psychological issue.
PATIENT: A psychological issue, Doctor? I hadn't considered that. I suppose that is possible. Would you recommend I speak with someone about that, then? Perhaps a therapist? I just want to be able to do my job, to protect people, and if this requires… addressing something internal, I am willing to do so. Would you be able to provide a referral?
DOCTOR: Here. There’s a list of… counselors in the area. Honestly, I think a bit of… mindfulness, maybe some relaxation techniques, would do you more good than an exemption. Look, I’m not qualified to diagnose… feelings. I’m a doctor. I deal with physical ailments. This… this is above my pay grade. Anything else?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand your position. Thank you for your time, and for the referral. No, that will be all. Thank you again. I appreciate you listening, even if you couldn't provide an exemption. .
DOCTOR: Right. Next. .
