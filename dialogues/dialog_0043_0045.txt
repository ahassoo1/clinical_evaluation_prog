DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… well, my face gets red. A lot. It’s been happening for a little bit now, and it’s… bothersome. Mostly on my cheeks, and sometimes my neck. Feels warm too.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your face gets red, particularly on your cheeks and neck, and it feels warm. And you said this has been happening for a "little bit now"—could you give me a better sense of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… three, four weeks? It started after… after my wife passed, actually. It’s not always happening, but… more often than not, yes. It happens when I… when I think about things, you know? Sad things. Or sometimes, when I eat something spicy. Not always, though.
DOCTOR: I understand. Three or four weeks, starting around the time of your wife's passing, and it seems to be triggered by thinking about upsetting things, and sometimes by spicy foods. That’s helpful information, thank you. It’s perfectly natural to experience a range of physical symptoms during times of grief, Mr. Withycombe. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe what the redness looks like?
PATIENT: It’s… just red. Like, a normal red. Not… rash-y, or bumpy. Just… my skin turns color. A bright color. Sometimes it feels hot to the touch, I think. My daughter, she says I look flushed, whatever that means. It goes away after a while, usually. Maybe… ten, fifteen minutes? Sometimes longer if I’m really upset.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a fairly uniform redness, not a rash, and it seems to resolve within ten to fifteen minutes, although it can linger longer if you’re experiencing strong emotions. “Flushed” just means your skin is redder than usual. Now, aside from the redness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my heart beats fast when it happens. Not… like a scary fast, but… faster than usual. And I get… warm, all over. A little sweaty, maybe. My hands get… clammy. No… nothing else, I don’t think. I haven’t felt dizzy, or anything like that. Just… red face, fast heart, and warm.
DOCTOR: Okay, so along with the redness, warmth, and fast heartbeat, you’ve noticed some clamminess in your hands. Have you been experiencing any chest pain or shortness of breath when this happens?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. And I can breathe just fine. No trouble there. It’s just… uncomfortable, you know? It’s embarrassing. And it makes me think. Think about… everything. My wife… everything that’s happened. It's not painful, exactly, but… it’s not nice.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite distressing, even if it isn’t physically painful. It's completely understandable that it would be embarrassing and triggering, especially given the timing and your recent loss. Let's go through some other things to get a fuller picture. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that's it. Just a small pill, every morning. And… no, no food allergies. I can eat anything, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. You take a medication for blood pressure—do you happen to know the name and dosage?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it written down somewhere. Ah, here it is. It’s… Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. That’s what the doctor told me, anyway.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Lisinopril, 10 milligrams daily. Good. Now, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I had the usual things. A little bit of the flu here and there, a cold every winter. Nothing major. A few years back, I had a problem with my cholesterol, but the doctor gave me a pill for that too, and it went away. And… that's about it, I think. I’ve always been a pretty healthy person, honestly. Before… you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, generally healthy, with some past issues with cholesterol that were managed with medication. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Not once. Always avoided them, if I could. Didn't like the idea of… people cutting me open. And… I’ve never been in the hospital, unless you count when my daughter was born, but that wasn’t… me being sick. That was just… having a baby.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations, other than for your daughter's birth. Now, can you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My… my wife's mother had something with her heart. A long time ago. I don’t really remember what it was. My father… he had high blood pressure, like me. And… my brother had diabetes, but he didn't take care of himself. He… he passed away a few years ago. That’s… about all I know, really. My family wasn’t… big on talking about these things.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a history of heart problems in your wife's mother, high blood pressure in your father, and diabetes in your brother. That gives us some information to work with. Finally, let's talk a little about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And… I used to drink a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped after my wife… it didn't seem right. And definitely no drugs. Never been interested in that. I spend most of my time at home now, just… quiet. Reading, watching television… mostly quiet things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Primarily quiet activities at home. Alright, Mr. Withycombe, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 88 and regular. Skin appears warm and slightly reddened on the cheeks and neck. No rash or bumps noted. Okay, Mr. Withycombe. Based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing what's called rosacea, possibly triggered by emotional stress. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and we should keep an eye on that. It's also important to rule out other potential causes.
PATIENT: Rosacea? What… what is that, exactly? And is that… is that serious? The blood pressure… is that from… from being upset all the time?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. Rosacea is a common skin condition that causes redness, visible blood vessels, and sometimes small, pus-filled bumps. It often affects the cheeks, nose, chin, and forehead – the areas you’ve been describing. It’s not life-threatening, but it can be uncomfortable and affect your self-esteem. We can manage it with various treatments. Now, regarding your blood pressure, it is slightly elevated. While stress can certainly contribute, there are many factors that can cause high blood pressure. It's important to monitor it regularly, and we might want to do some further testing to get a clearer picture. We can discuss lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication to help manage it. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms and get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to… feel better. I want to stop being so… red all the time. And… I guess I want to make sure my heart is okay.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Withycombe. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to feel better, and ensuring your heart is healthy is a priority. I'll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. These will give us a good baseline to work from. I’ll also give you a prescription for a mild topical cream, metronidazole, to apply to the affected areas twice a day. This can help reduce the redness and inflammation. In the meantime, I recommend trying some stress-reducing techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or gentle exercise. Avoiding spicy foods and excessive sun exposure can also help. I can provide you with some resources for stress management if you’d like. We should schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the blood work results and see how the topical cream is working. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, two weeks sounds fine. And yes, please, if you have those resources for… for calming down, that would be wonderful. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. It’s… nice to talk to someone about it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I’m glad I could help. It takes courage to talk about these things, and I commend you for reaching out. Here are a few resources that you might find helpful. They include information on deep breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, and local support groups. I’ll have the lab order sent to the front desk, and they'll schedule your follow-up appointment. If you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you again, Doctor Kalinski. I really appreciate your kindness. I’ll see you in two weeks.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care of yourself, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day.
