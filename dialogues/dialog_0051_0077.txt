DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh. Good morning to you too, doctor. They told me to come. Something about the mine… checking if I’m… still good, I think? I don’t feel nothing wrong, you understand. Been working that mine for… a long time now. Long time.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. We received a request for a check-up, likely related to your work at the mine. It's good that you're here, even if you aren't feeling any immediate issues. It’s always best to be thorough. Could you tell me a little more about what kind of work you do at the mine, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Work? I run the big machines. The ones that dig and move the… the rock. Big levers, big engine. Been doing it… almost fifty years now. Underground mostly. Dark place. Not for the faint of heart, you understand. Heavy work. Very heavy. They keep changing the machines though… not as good as the old ones.
DOCTOR: Fifty years… that’s a considerable amount of time. Operating those machines for that long must be physically demanding. And you mentioned the newer machines aren’t quite as good as the older ones – are you experiencing any difficulties operating them, or causing you more strain than before?
PATIENT: Strain? Not really strain, doctor. Just… different. Old ones, you felt them. You knew what they were doing. These new ones… too much thinking. Too many buttons. And they shake more, I think. But I get the job done. Always do. I don't complain. My wife… she would say I'm too stubborn for my own good. She passed, you know. Five years now. Good woman.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Bigger. Losing someone close is never easy. It sounds like you’ve always been a very dedicated and resilient person, both at work and in life. Let’s focus on your health for now, if you’re comfortable. You mentioned the newer machines shake more. Have you noticed any specific symptoms related to that shaking – perhaps any tingling, numbness, or weakness in your hands or arms?
PATIENT: Tingling? No. Weakness? No. My hands are strong, doctor. Always have been. Maybe a little ache sometimes, after a long shift. But ache is normal. I'm an old man, you understand. Old men ache. It’s the price you pay for a long life of hard work. These young people these days… complain about everything. No backbone.
DOCTOR: That's certainly true, Mr. Bigger. You’ve certainly lived a full life. Besides the ache in your hands, have you experienced any other symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I eat my food, I sleep okay… well, sometimes I wake up a little, but that’s just old age again. No cough, no fever, no… dizziness. I don't fall down or nothing. Everything works, you understand? Mostly. I still drive myself to the market. Still cook my own meals.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Bigger. It sounds like you’re very active and independent. Just to be thorough, sometimes subtle changes can occur that we want to be aware of. Have you noticed any changes in your vision or hearing recently?
PATIENT: Vision? A little blurry sometimes, especially at night. But I always have. Never been good with the dark, you understand. Always needed a little extra light. Hearing? Maybe a little… muffled sometimes. The mine is a noisy place. Been ringing in my ears for years. Always thought it was just the noise.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Bigger. Now, have you been seeing a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? Not really. Only when something really bad happens. Went to see a man when I broke my arm, falling off a ladder. And… when my wife was sick. But other than that… no. Never been much for doctors, you understand. Waste of time and money. My wife… she liked going to the doctor though. Always worrying about something.
DOCTOR: I understand. Many people feel that way. Do you happen to know if your wife had any significant medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told her. Gave her pills. She took them. And… something with her heart, I think. She got tired easily. And… her legs swelled up sometimes. Always complaining about her legs. I always told her to put them up. But she wouldn’t listen. Stubborn woman, just like me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bigger. That’s helpful to know. Now, thinking about your own medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Me? No. Never been sick a day in my life. Well, besides the broken arm. And a little flu here and there. But nothing serious. Always been strong. Always been healthy. I eat my vegetables, you understand? And I don't drink too much. A little beer sometimes, with my friends. But nothing crazy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Nothing. Never needed them. Maybe some pain pills sometimes, when my back aches. But that’s all. And I don’t take them often. Just when I really need to. My wife… she was full of pills. Little white pills, little blue pills, little… everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had an allergy in my life. I can eat anything. I can touch anything. I’m a strong man, you understand? Always been tough. My wife… she was allergic to cats. Couldn't even be in the same room with one. Silly thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bigger. That’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your heart, lungs, and reflexes. It won't take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Exam? Hmph. What for? I told you, I'm fine. But… alright. If you must. Just don't poke me too much. Old bones, you understand. And be quick about it. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bigger. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Okay, 150 over 88. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your age and recent stress. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not loud, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear, but there's some diminished breath sounds at the bases, which is common with age. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Reflexes are a little diminished, but that's also common with age. Finally, I’m going to check your feet and legs for any swelling or changes in sensation. There is some mild swelling in your ankles, and your feet feel a little cool to the touch. I'll make a note of all of that. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. It was quick, wasn't it?
PATIENT: Quick enough. Swelling? Always been a little swelling in my ankles. Comes and goes. Nothing to worry about. My wife… she had terrible swelling. Worse than mine. The doctor gave her water pills. Made her go to the bathroom all the time. So, what does it all mean, doctor? Am I sick? Or am I just an old man with a few aches and pains?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, you're not "sick," but I did find a few things during the exam that we should address. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which we can manage with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. The murmur I heard in your heart is something we'll want to monitor with a follow-up appointment, possibly an echocardiogram to get a clearer picture. The swelling in your ankles and the diminished sensation in your feet suggest some possible circulation issues, which can be common with age. And the diminished breath sounds could indicate some mild lung changes. Overall, it sounds like you’ve lived a very full life, and you’re understandably experiencing some changes related to aging. We want to make sure these changes don’t become more serious. I recommend we start with some blood work to check your kidney function, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. We also should schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to discuss the results and determine if further testing is needed. What do you think?
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking and prodding? Hmph. I don’t like needles. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. My wife… she always said I should listen to the doctor. Stubborn woman, she was. Always right. Follow-up appointment? In a few weeks? I suppose so. But don’t keep me waiting all day. I got things to do, you understand. And… what about these pills? You said something about pills? I don’t want to be taking a bunch of pills like my wife.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about needles and pills, Mr. Bigger. We’ll take things one step at a time. The blood work will help us get a better understanding of your overall health and determine if any treatment is needed. We’ll discuss the results thoroughly before making any decisions about medication. We won't start you on any pills right away. If the blood work shows any abnormalities, we can discuss the potential benefits and risks of medication and see if it's the right option for you. There are also lifestyle changes we can explore, such as diet and exercise, that can help manage your blood pressure and overall health. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood for you today, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for about three weeks from now. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Three weeks… alright. As long as it doesn’t take all day. And make sure the nurse is gentle with the needle. I don’t want any bruising. Lifestyle changes? What kind of lifestyle changes? I eat my vegetables, you understand. And I walk to the market most days. What more do you want from an old man? Hmph. Alright. Let’s get this over with. Just tell me where to go for the blood work. And tell that nurse to be careful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bigger. I’ll make sure the nurse is aware of your concerns. The lab is just down the hall to your left. The nurse will explain everything to you, and it shouldn't take too long. We'll discuss the results at your follow-up appointment in three weeks, and we can talk about some simple lifestyle changes that might be helpful, such as reducing your salt intake and getting a little more exercise if you're able. I’ll have the nurse give you a printed list of instructions before you leave. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Bigger. It was good to meet you.
PATIENT: Alright. Salt intake… exercise… Hmph. I suppose it can’t hurt. Good day to you, doctor. And tell that nurse again… be careful with the needle. .
