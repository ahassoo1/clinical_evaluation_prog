DOCTOR: Hi Teretha, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this tingling… in my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought maybe it’s time to get it checked out. It’s just… annoying, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your hands and feet. “Annoying” is a good way to put it – it’s good you’re getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it's not always there. Comes and goes. Feels like… pins and needles, sometimes. Other times it’s just… numb. Hard to explain. It’s worse when I’m resting, I think. When I’m walking my route for the post office, I don’t notice it so much. It's when I sit down in the evening that it really bothers me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. So it’s more noticeable with rest, and less noticeable with activity. And you deliver mail – is that a lot of walking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. It’s a lot of walking. Rural route, you see. Lots of houses spread out. I’m on my feet for… well, most of the day, really. Six, seven hours easy. Used to be fine, but… I don’t know. Maybe it’s just getting old? Though I still feel pretty good, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a physically demanding job. And you said this has been going on for a little while… roughly how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three, four months ago? At first it was just now and then, I didn’t pay it much mind. But it’s been happening more and more lately. It was bad enough last week I almost dropped a whole stack of flyers! That’s when I figured I should really come in. I don’t want to be dropping people’s mail, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, understandable. Okay, so three to four months, gradually worsening. Have you noticed it in any other parts of your body, or just your hands and feet?
PATIENT: Just my hands and feet, Doctor. Nothing else. Though… sometimes my legs feel a little tired at the end of the day, but I figured that’s just from walking so much. I haven't noticed any tingling there, though. Definitely just the hands and feet. It’s… well, it’s just a little worrisome, you know? I need my hands for my job.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the hands and feet. And you need them for work, absolutely. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… No, not that I know of. The doctor always said I was healthy as a horse, bless his soul. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, it must be five years, maybe more? Since my husband passed. He took care of all that sort of thing, you see. I don't have any problems I know of. High blood pressure… no. Diabetes… no. I try to eat healthy, mostly. It’s just… hard sometimes, living alone.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical problems, haven’t been to the doctor in five years. That’s alright, we can get you back on track. Any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never had any surgeries. Just the usual childhood things, like tonsils out when I was little, but that was ages ago. No hospital stays, no. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. Though I did break my wrist once, falling on the ice, but that healed up fine. A long time ago now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major surgeries or hospitalizations. And you said your husband handled the medical appointments – do you happen to know if he ever mentioned any family history of things like diabetes, nerve problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… Now that’s a good question. He always talked about his mother having… arthritis, I think? Bad arthritis in her hands. And his father… something with his heart, I think. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t really remember the details. He did all the keeping track of things like that, you see. I’m afraid I’m not much help on that front. It’s been a few years since he passed, and things get… foggy, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Okay, possible family history of arthritis and heart problems. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine… well, I haven't taken much medicine lately. I try to avoid it if I can. No allergies at all. I think I’m pretty lucky that way, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I don’t really believe in taking a lot of pills, you see. Just a little bit of ibuprofen now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. And I haven’t even had a headache in months. So, no, nothing regularly. Just the occasional ibuprofen. Does that answer your question? I just… prefer to tough things out, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Alright, Teretha, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable, alright? I’m a bit of a wimp when it comes to needles, you see. But everything else is fine. Just get to the bottom of this tingling, that's all I want.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. No needles today, I promise. I'm just going to have you sit comfortably, and I’ll start with your hands. I'll be touching your hands and feet with different instruments, and asking you to tell me what you feel. Don't worry if it's not a strong sensation, just let me know what you perceive. Okay?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor, sounds good. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m a bit nervous, but I trust you. Go ahead whenever you're ready. I'm sitting comfortably, and my hands are free. Just be gentle, alright? My hands are important for my job, you see. I don’t want to mess them up!
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m starting with light touch. Can you tell me if you feel this when I touch here?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I feel that. It’s… a little faint, but I feel it. Right there, on the tip of my finger. It’s a bit… prickly, almost. Like a little tickle, but not unpleasant. Is that what you were looking for? It’s definitely fainter on this hand… the left one. It feels… numb.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now I’m going to use this tuning fork to check your vibration sense. Can you tell me if you can feel the vibration when I place it on the bony part of your hand here?
PATIENT: Hmm… Yes, I feel that one too. It’s… a buzzing, of course. I feel it in my hand, but… it fades away pretty quickly. And again, it’s much weaker on my left hand. Almost nothing at all, really. Just a little… tingle. Like when your foot falls asleep. Is that normal? It’s worrying me a bit now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's good you're telling me. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’m going to tap this little hammer on your tendon here. Just relax your arm. Can you tell me if you feel a little jerk?
PATIENT: Oh, alright… that little hammer? Okay. Yes, I felt that one. A little… jump. It felt… normal, I suppose. It’s hard to say. But it felt the same on both arms. Not weak, not strong, just… there. Is that good or bad? It’s hard to know what’s normal at my age, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Both reflexes were present and equal. Now let’s move on to your feet. I’ll repeat the same tests—light touch, vibration, and reflexes. Just relax your leg… and let me know what you feel. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright, Doctor. Go ahead. My feet are a bit… cold, actually. I always have cold feet. But they’re ready when you are. Just… be gentle, alright? I don’t want to fall or anything. I need those feet to walk my route, you see. Let’s get this tingling figured out. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m going to start with light touch on your toes. Can you tell me if you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I feel that one. But it’s… very faint. Almost nothing at all, really. And again, it's much weaker on my left foot. Almost like… nothing is there. It’s worrying me, Doctor. It’s getting worse, I think. It's hard to tell, but it feels like it's spreading.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about vibration sense?
PATIENT: Oh… No… no, I don’t feel anything with that one. Nothing at all. Not even a little buzz. Just… nothing. It’s completely numb. On this foot, the left one. The right one… maybe a very faint tingle, but it’s barely noticeable. It’s like… my foot isn’t even there. This is really worrying me now, Doctor. Is something seriously wrong? I need my feet to work!
DOCTOR: Okay, Teretha. I understand your concern, and it's good you came in to get this checked out. The findings of decreased sensation and reflexes in your left hand and foot are concerning for peripheral neuropathy – that means there's some damage to the nerves in your extremities. Now, there are many possible causes for this. It could be related to vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, or other medical conditions. Because you haven't had a physical in several years, I want to order some blood work to check your blood sugar, vitamin levels, and kidney function. We should also consider a nerve conduction study to assess the extent of the nerve damage. Would you be willing to do those tests?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Nerve damage? That sounds… serious. Blood work and… a nerve study? What does that involve? I don’t like the sound of that. But… if it’s the only way to find out what’s going on… yes, alright. Do whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just… I need to keep working. I can't afford to lose my job. What does the nerve study involve? Is it painful? I’m a bit scared now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your fear, and I'll explain everything as clearly as possible. The nerve conduction study involves placing small electrodes on your skin and delivering a mild electrical stimulation to the nerves. It doesn’t hurt, but it can feel like a little shock or tingling. It helps us measure how quickly the nerves are transmitting signals. We’ll also do an electromyography, or EMG, which involves inserting a small needle into your muscles to measure their electrical activity. That can be a little uncomfortable, like a brief muscle cramp, but it's usually well-tolerated. I’ll write you a referral to a neurologist – a nerve specialist – who will perform these tests and interpret the results. In the meantime, I want to start you on a multivitamin to address any potential deficiencies. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… a neurologist? And more tests? It’s a lot, Doctor. But… alright. If that’s what you think is best. A multivitamin… that sounds harmless enough. I suppose I can handle that. So… I’ll get a referral, go see this nerve specialist, and they’ll do these… shock tests and needle tests? And then they’ll tell me what’s wrong? How long will that take? I need to know if I can still… you know, work. That’s the most important thing. Is there anything I can do now to help? Anything at all? I’m a bit worried about falling, with the numbness.
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, that’s correct. The neurologist will schedule the nerve conduction study and EMG. It usually takes a few weeks to get an appointment, and the tests themselves typically take about an hour. The neurologist will then review the results and discuss treatment options with you. In the meantime, to help prevent falls, I recommend using a cane or walking stick for support, especially when walking outside or on uneven surfaces. Wear sturdy shoes with good traction, and be extra careful when walking in the dark or in wet conditions. Also, avoid activities that could put you at risk of falling. I’m also going to give you a handout with information about peripheral neuropathy, including potential causes, symptoms, and treatment options. I’ll also write a note to your primary care physician so they are aware of the findings and can help monitor your overall health. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds like a plan. A cane… I suppose I can manage that. I don’t want to fall and break something. And the handout… that’s good. Information is always helpful. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’m still worried, but I feel a little bit better knowing what’s going on. So… I’ll get the referral, schedule the tests, and take the multivitamin. And be careful not to fall. Is there anything else I need to do before my appointment with the neurologist? Or anything I should tell them specifically? I’m trying to think of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. You're very proactive, and that’s excellent. Before your appointment with the neurologist, try to make a list of all your medications, including over-the-counter drugs and vitamins. Also, write down any specific symptoms you’re experiencing, such as the location and severity of the tingling, any pain or weakness, and any factors that make your symptoms better or worse. It’s also helpful to bring a list of any relevant medical history, such as previous illnesses, surgeries, or family medical conditions. And, if possible, bring a family member or friend with you to the appointment for support. I’ll also send the neurologist my findings from today’s exam, so they have a good starting point. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I'll make a list of everything… the medications, the symptoms, the family history. And I’ll try to get my neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, to come with me. She's a good woman, very reliable. Thank you again, Doctor. I really do appreciate it. I guess… I’ll see you when I get the results back? Or will I see the neurologist first? I’m a bit confused about the order of things. Sorry, I’m just… a bit overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Teretha. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed, and you’re not alone. You’ll see the neurologist first. They’ll schedule the nerve conduction study and EMG, and then they'll contact you with the results. They’ll also likely want to discuss treatment options with you. I'll make a note to have their office send a copy of the results back to me as well. Feel free to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with the neurologist. Here's a handout with information about peripheral neuropathy and a referral to a neurologist in the area. Take care, Teretha, and please be careful.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Be careful… yes, I will.
