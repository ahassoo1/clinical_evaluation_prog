DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady on my feet lately. Like I might fall. It’s been… unsettling, to say the least. I don’t quite recall when it started, exactly. Perhaps a few weeks? It’s all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. Hazy, alright. Well, we’ll try to clarify. Unsteady on your feet… can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It's not a constant thing, thankfully. It feels… like the room is tilting, sometimes. Or like I’m on a boat, even when I’m standing perfectly still. And other times, it’s just a feeling of weakness in my legs. It makes walking… precarious. I’ve nearly stumbled a few times, but thankfully haven’t fallen yet. Do you understand? It’s hard to put into words.
DOCTOR: Tilting, weakness… right. So, intermittent, not constant. And you haven't actually fallen yet, just nearly stumbled. Is this happening with any specific movements?
PATIENT: Specific movements… hmm. I don’t believe so, no. It seems to happen… randomly. Standing, walking, even just sitting and then getting up. I work… well, I did work with heavy machinery, rotary drills for oil and gas. Perhaps it's related to that? It was… physically demanding work. Though, that was before… everything. I’m not sure if it makes a difference.
DOCTOR: Rotary drills... demanding, yes. And this “everything” you mentioned?
PATIENT: It… it was some time ago. My husband… he passed away. It’s been… difficult. I stopped working shortly after. I suppose I’ve been… preoccupied. And perhaps not paying as much attention to my physical well-being as I should. It's a bit of a blur, to be honest. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Snerling. Significant life events can certainly impact one’s health. But we need to rule out any medical causes for this unsteadiness. Let’s go through a quick review of systems. Have you noticed any dizziness with the tilting sensation?
PATIENT: Dizziness… with the tilting? Now that you mention it, yes, sometimes. Not always, but occasionally. It’s not a spinning sensation, exactly. More like… a lightheadedness. Like I might faint. But it doesn’t last long. A few seconds, perhaps. Is that… important? I truly don’t recall if it happens every time I feel unsteady. I apologize again. It’s all so… fragmented.
DOCTOR: Lightheadedness, intermittent… alright. Have you experienced any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in vision… Hmm. I wear glasses, have for some time. My prescription hasn’t been changed recently, if that’s what you mean. But… now that I think about it, things do seem a little blurry sometimes, even with my glasses on. It’s not constant, and I just assumed it was my eyes needing to be cleaned, or perhaps fatigue. But… perhaps it’s related? I’m not entirely sure. Everything feels… disconnected. It’s difficult to pinpoint anything specific.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blurred vision, intermittent… We need to get a better handle on this. Have you noticed any headaches accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: Headaches… Yes, occasionally. Not severe ones, usually. More like a dull ache at the back of my head. They come and go. I often just take something over-the-counter for them. I assumed they were stress-related. Everything has been… rather stressful lately. I hadn't thought to mention them, as they didn't seem particularly significant. Are they… relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Everything is relevant, Ms. Snerling. It's my job to put the pieces together. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Hmm. Not that I recall, no. I’ve always been… relatively healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox, but nothing serious. I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. And I haven’t been hospitalized for anything… ever, I believe. I had regular checkups when I was working, but… it’s been a while. Is that helpful? I sincerely apologize if I'm being… uncooperative. My memory is simply not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior medical conditions, no allergies. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not regularly. I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, as I mentioned, but that’s it. I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a while ago. I haven’t been taking anything consistently. And I certainly don’t take any prescription medications. I prefer to avoid them if possible. Everything just feels… a bit overwhelming as it is. Is that… alright? I worry about side effects, and… well, I simply haven't needed anything long-term.
DOCTOR: Alright Ms. Snerling. Given your symptoms – the intermittent unsteadiness, tilting sensation, dizziness, blurred vision, headaches – and the recent life changes, we need to investigate further. I’d like to perform a brief neurological exam and check your blood pressure and heart rate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. A neurological exam sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment entirely. Blood pressure and heart rate as well, of course. I just want to understand what’s happening, and hopefully… find a solution. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I’ll cooperate fully. I apologize again for being so… fragmented.
DOCTOR: Please, if you could sit up straight for me. I'm going to check your vital signs first. Then we'll move on to the neurological exam. I'll need you to follow my finger with your eyes, and I'll be testing your reflexes and balance. Blood pressure is 110/70. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, follow my finger. Don’t move your head. Good. Now, I want you to close your eyes. Can you tell me if I'm touching your hands and feet?
PATIENT: Yes… I believe so. Yes, that’s my hand. And… yes, that’s my foot. It feels… a little numb, perhaps? But yes, I can feel it. Is that… normal? I apologize if I'm being difficult. It's just… sometimes the sensation is a bit… faint. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Numbness noted. We’ll address that later. Now, I want you to stand up slowly. Now, can you walk a straight line for me, heel-to-toe, for about ten steps?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Heel-to-toe… yes. Oh dear… It’s… difficult. I feel rather off-balance. I almost fell just then. Perhaps… perhaps it’s best if I sit down. I apologize. I’m clearly not very steady. Is this… a bad sign?
DOCTOR: Easy now… easy. Yes, it’s best to sit down. Your gait is unsteady, and you are exhibiting signs of imbalance. I'm concerned about potential neurological issues. I want to order an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. We'll also run some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies and other underlying medical conditions. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood tests. That sounds… thorough. Allergies to contrast dye… hmm. I don’t believe so, no. I’ve never had an MRI before, so I haven’t been exposed to it. But… I am slightly claustrophobic. Small spaces… they make me a little anxious. Would that be a problem? I apologize for the added complication. Everything just feels… rather overwhelming at the moment.
DOCTOR: Okay, claustrophobia noted. We can discuss options for managing that – perhaps a mild sedative or an open MRI if available. I’ll write the orders for the MRI and blood tests now. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. It's important to get these tests done as soon as possible. While we wait for the results, I’m going to prescribe a low-dose medication to help with the dizziness. It’s not a long-term solution, but it may provide some temporary relief. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A mild sedative… that sounds helpful, yes. And the medication for the dizziness… temporary relief would be most welcome. I… I suppose my question is… what are we looking for? What could be causing this? Is it something serious? I apologize for being so direct, but… the uncertainty is rather unsettling. I’m afraid of what the tests might reveal.
DOCTOR: Ms. Snerling, it’s understandable to be anxious. We’re looking for a variety of potential causes for your symptoms. The MRI will help us rule out structural problems in the brain, such as tumors or lesions. The blood tests will assess for vitamin deficiencies – particularly B12 – and other underlying medical conditions that can cause neurological symptoms. It could be something relatively minor, such as a simple vitamin deficiency, or it could be something more complex. It’s too early to say definitively. I want to be thorough, and we will proceed systematically. I'm referring you to a neurologist for a full evaluation and to interpret the MRI results. They will discuss the findings with you in detail and develop a personalized treatment plan. Do you have any questions about the neurologist referral?
PATIENT: A neurologist… yes, that sounds… sensible. A specialist. Will they… will they be able to tell me what’s wrong? And… will it require surgery? I apologize for asking such… blunt questions. It’s just… I’m rather afraid. And… my insurance… will it cover all of this? I know it’s a lot to ask, but I’m simply… overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Ms. Snerling, it's perfectly alright to ask questions. That’s what I’m here for. The neurologist will be able to provide a more definitive diagnosis after reviewing the MRI results and conducting a thorough examination. Whether or not surgery is required depends entirely on the underlying cause. Many conditions can be treated with medication or therapy. As for your insurance, you have private insurance, and I see that your coverage is fairly comprehensive. The MRI and the neurologist consultation should be covered, although there may be a co-pay or deductible. I'll have my staff contact your insurance provider to verify your coverage and provide you with an estimate of your out-of-pocket costs. I'm also going to give you a referral to a therapist. The stress and grief you've experienced are significant, and having someone to talk to could be very beneficial. Would you like me to provide you with a list of local therapists?
PATIENT: A therapist… yes, that sounds… helpful. Very helpful. I haven’t… I haven’t really processed everything yet. The loss… it’s been difficult. And the uncertainty… Thank you, Doctor. Truly. You’ve been very… patient with me. And the list of therapists would be wonderful. I appreciate everything you’ve done today. It’s… it’s a weight off my shoulders, knowing that we’re taking steps to find out what’s wrong. I sincerely apologize for being so fragmented and difficult.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Snerling. This printout includes the referral information for the neurologist and a list of local therapists. My staff will be in touch to schedule your appointments and verify your insurance coverage. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. I want to reiterate that it's important to follow up with the neurologist promptly. Now, do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all for now. Thank you again, for your kindness and patience. I will contact the office if anything arises. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You as well, Ms. Snerling. Take care. .
