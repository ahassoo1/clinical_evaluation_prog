DOCTOR: Right. Betty Schneer, 83. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor... Ruocco, is it? Yes, well, it's my ears, dear. They just don't... work like they used to, you know? Things are a bit muffled. I mostly just ask people to speak up, but my grandkids are starting to make fun of me.
DOCTOR: Muffled, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, muffled. It's hard to explain... like there's cotton in 'em, maybe? Or when you go swimming and get water stuck? Not painful, thankfully. Just… quiet. And I can’t always tell what folks are sayin’. Especially the young ones, they mumble so!
DOCTOR: Right, right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. Seems like… a while now. Maybe a year or two? It's come on slow, you see. I didn't really notice at first. Just figured people weren't speaking clearly. It's hard to keep track when you get to be my age, dear. Everything kinda blends together.
DOCTOR: A year or two... slow onset. Have you noticed it's worse in any particular situations?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… yes, I suppose it is. When there’s a lot of background noise, like at the church social or when the television's on... that’s when it's really bad. Quiet places are better, naturally. And… one-on-one conversations are easier than a group. Though sometimes even then I miss things.
DOCTOR: Background noise… makes sense. Alright. Any ringing in the ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? No, not really. Not that I've noticed, anyway. Sometimes a little… whooshing, maybe? But not a ring. I’ve had my share of loud noises in my life, working in that factory all those years… but no constant ringing. Goodness, that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever had any ear infections, or any problems with wax buildup?
PATIENT: Ear infections… oh, goodness. When I was a little girl, maybe? A long, long time ago. Nothing serious, I don’t think. As for wax… well, I used to try and clean 'em out with a hairpin, back in the day. Don't tell my mother! But I stopped doin' that when I realized it probably wasn’t the smartest thing. Now I mostly leave 'em alone.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a quick look. Just want to have a peek in your ears, see what’s going on.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds good, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. My balance isn't what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, just sit here. Hmm. Right. There's some cerumen buildup in both ears, nothing dramatic, but likely contributing to the muffled hearing.
PATIENT: Oh, is that bad? Cerumen… that’s wax, right? I knew I shouldn’t have poked around in there so much when I was young! Is it something we can fix, Doctor? I really don't want to have to yell at my grandkids all the time.
DOCTOR: It’s… manageable. We can remove the wax. It’s a simple procedure. But, at your age… and given the length of time you’ve had this issue… it’s likely there's some hearing loss as well. We'll need to get a hearing test to determine the extent. I’ll write you a referral to the audiologist. They’ll do the test, and we can discuss options from there. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An audiologist? Oh my. That sounds… serious. Is that someone different than you, Doctor? What sort of options are we talking about? Like… those hearing aids I see people wearing? I don’t know… I always thought those were for really old people. I just want to be able to hear again, you know? It's awful missin' things.
DOCTOR: Yes, an audiologist specializes in hearing. And yes, hearing aids are an option if needed. But we need the test first. Look, you're eighty-three. Hearing loss is common. It doesn’t mean you’re… deficient, or anything. It just means your ears have been working for a long time. I’m writing the referral now. Don’t worry about it too much. We'll figure it out. Any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… that’s… reassuring, I suppose. It's just… a lot to take in. Is the audiologist nearby? And will my Medicare cover the test? I don't want to surprise my grandkids with a big bill. They're good kids, but they’re still saving up for college.
DOCTOR: The audiologist is in town. Medicare should cover most of the test, but there may be a small co-pay. You'll need to check with them directly to confirm. Here’s the referral information. Call them, schedule an appointment, and they’ll sort out the insurance details. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you, Doctor. That’s… very helpful. No, I don’t think so. Just… hoping I can hear my grandkids better soon. I appreciate your help, dear.
DOCTOR: Right. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Oh. You too, Doctor. Goodbye now. .
