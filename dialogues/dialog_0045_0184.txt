DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, Doctor Billman, if you must know... it's this belly. Used to be a strong man, you know. Pile driving ain't easy work. Now... well, it's just… soft. Wife always said I was gettin' too comfortable. She’s gone now, but still. I want it gone. Not happy 'bout it. Waste of a good body, this is.
DOCTOR: Right. "Soft." Okay. And how long has this been bothering you?
PATIENT: Botherin' me? Since I retire, mostly. Maybe... five, six years now? It didn't bother me when I was workin'. Had muscle, you see? Now it’s just… there. Don’t need a doctor to tell me I’m not what I used to be. Just want it fixed. Can you fix it? Is that what you do?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Trendler, I'm a family doctor, so I can certainly look into it. “Fixing” it depends on why it's soft, if you follow me. Has there been any change in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? What kinda question is that? I eat what my wife used to cook. Now I cook for myself. It's food! Chicken, rice, peas... Sometimes a little fish. Not like I'm livin' on cake and ice cream, you know. Always been a sensible eater. This ain't 'bout what I eat, it's 'bout this… …this sag. You understand sag, right? Old age, that's what it is. You got somethin' to help an old man or not?
DOCTOR: Right, right. Sag. Okay. And has there been any unintentional weight loss along with this “sag”?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No! I'm losin' weight? Doctor, I'm tellin' you, I'm not happy with this belly because it's too big, not too small! I’m a bit lighter on my feet, maybe, but that’s 'cause I ain’t swingin’ a hammer all day. Don’t confuse things. I want to get rid of this, not lose more of me. You listenin'?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Trendler, I’m listening. And I am trying to understand. It sounds like you’re concerned about excess abdominal fat. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What now? You askin' if I... go to the bathroom? What kinda doctor asks a man about his bathroom habits when he's complainin' about his stomach? This is ridiculous. I came here to fix somethin', not have a conversation 'bout… that. Look, I'm an old man. Things change. I want to know if you can do somethin' 'bout this belly or not. Yes or no? Don't need a whole life story.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I need to gather information to determine the best course of action. Changes in bowel habits can be relevant. But, fine. Let’s skip that for now. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not exactly pain. Maybe a little… ache sometimes. When I bend over, maybe. But I'm old! Everything aches. That don’t mean nothin’. Look, I’m tellin’ you, I ain’t sick. I’m just… …this. Not happy with this. Is there a pill? A surgery? Somethin'? Stop askin' me 'bout what I eat and when I go to the bathroom and start talkin' solutions. You a doctor or a… a question asker?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. I want to listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. It’ll just take a few moments. Please lie back on the exam table. I’ll listen first. Deep breaths, please. Normal bowel sounds. A little… diminished, but not alarming. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender.
PATIENT: Hmph. Diminished? What kinda doctor uses words like “diminished”? Ouch! Careful now! That's tender! Right there. Not awful, but… sensitive. It's always been a bit sensitive, to be honest. Used to take a good knock, but not anymore. Now, are you gonna tell me what's goin’ on or just poke around?
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness in the lower abdomen. That could be a number of things. Given your age and history, and the tenderness, I want to rule out a few possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work - a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. That will give us a baseline and help me understand if there’s any underlying inflammation or other issues. I also want to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. That will give us a more detailed look at the organs in that area. It's important to be thorough, especially with abdominal pain. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: CT scan? Blood work? For a bit of a sag? Doctor, you're makin' a mountain out of a molehill. But… fine. Do what you gotta do. Just get it over with. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Wife always said I could eat anything. Little bit sensitive to dust, maybe. But that ain't an allergy. Just makes me sneeze. Don't waste time writin' that down. Just get these tests done. I got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Here are the requisitions for the blood work and the CT scan. The lab is just down the hall, and you can schedule the CT scan at the imaging center – the number is on the form. I’ll also send these results to your primary care physician. It's best to have a comprehensive team looking at this. While we wait for the results, I recommend maintaining a healthy diet and staying hydrated. Avoid any strenuous activity that causes abdominal discomfort. And if you experience any worsening pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Hydrated? Strenuous activity? Doctor, I'm an old man, not a marathon runner! Look, I appreciate you lookin' at it, but I still think you're makin' a fuss over nothin'. No, I don’t have any more questions. Just get the tests done. And please, try not to use so many big words. I need to go. .
