DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s just get straight to it. It’s… a bit embarrassing, frankly. It’s a problem in my mouth. A white coating, you see? It’s rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schieber. It’s perfectly alright to feel embarrassed discussing these things; it's quite common. We’ll get to the bottom of it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe this white coating a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it's... white. Obviously. It’s mostly on my tongue, and it looks like… cottage cheese, perhaps? Not a lot of it, but enough to be noticeable. And it’s… slightly raised. I noticed it a few days ago. It doesn't particularly hurt, but it's... there. I haven’t been doing anything differently, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white coating on the tongue, resembling cottage cheese, slightly raised, present for a few days, and without significant pain. That gives me a starting point. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this, such as a sore throat, difficulty swallowing, or changes in your taste?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Taste is… normal, I suppose. I eat everything as usual. No sore throat. It’s just… this. Honestly, Doctor, I keep myself very clean. I doubt it’s anything serious. Probably just something I ate. I eat a very… varied diet, you see. I travel often for work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good you maintain good hygiene. Traveling and a varied diet can sometimes contribute to these sorts of things. Before we assume it's something simple, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Medical problems? Not particularly. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I'm a healthy man. I work very hard, keep active. I don’t have time for… ailments. I'm married, if that's relevant. My wife is very concerned, naturally. She insisted I come. No insurance, unfortunately. A bit of a hassle, that is.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information. It’s good to hear you’re generally healthy. And it's good your wife is looking out for you. Not having insurance can certainly add to the stress. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, never. Absolutely nothing of the sort. I’ve always been… robust. A strong constitution, you see. I've never even broken a bone. I avoid risky activities. Frankly, Doctor, I find all this questioning a bit… unnecessary. It’s a white coating on my tongue, not a life-threatening disease. Surely a quick look will tell you everything?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schieber, and I appreciate your patience. I ask these questions to build a complete picture, to ensure I don’t miss anything. It's important to rule out underlying causes, even if it seems straightforward. Let’s proceed with a brief examination of your mouth and tongue. Please open wide for me.
PATIENT: Just get it over with, please. I have a meeting this afternoon. A very important meeting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. I see the white coating on your tongue, primarily on the dorsal surface, as you described. It appears somewhat patchy and can be gently scraped off, revealing a slightly reddened underlying tissue. There's no obvious inflammation of the gums or other areas of the mouth. No enlarged lymph nodes that I can feel externally. Based on this initial examination, it could be oral thrush – a fungal infection – or possibly a case of geographic tongue with secondary fungal overgrowth. However, to be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to perform a simple potassium hydroxide preparation. This involves taking a small scraping of the coating and examining it under the microscope to identify any fungal elements. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Potassium… what now? Look, Doctor, are you telling me you need to scrape my tongue even more? Honestly, this is becoming quite unpleasant. Is this absolutely necessary? I haven’t got all day, you know. And frankly, I’m not keen on having things scraped off my mouth. Can't you just… prescribe something? An antifungal, perhaps? My wife mentioned something about that. She’s very good at Googling. Is that an option?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Schieber, and I apologize for any discomfort. A KOH preparation is a relatively quick and painless procedure. It allows us to definitively identify if a fungus is present, which would confirm a diagnosis of thrush and guide appropriate treatment. While your wife’s research is valuable, prescribing medication without a confirmed diagnosis isn’t ideal. It could mask the underlying issue and potentially lead to complications. However, given your time constraints and discomfort with further testing, and acknowledging the lack of other significant symptoms, we could proceed with a trial of an antifungal medication, specifically nystatin oral suspension. It’s a relatively safe medication with minimal side effects. However, please understand that if your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if they worsen, we will need to revisit this and consider further investigation, potentially including a referral to a specialist. Does that approach sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… give me the medicine and let me be on my way. A week. If it doesn’t work, I’ll come back. But frankly, I doubt it will come to that. It’s probably just a bit of indigestion. What does this… “nystatin” taste like? I have a very important client meeting. I need to be presentable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. I'll write you a prescription for nystatin oral suspension. It has a slightly sweet taste, but it can be a bit chalky. It's best to swish it around in your mouth for as long as you can, about 15-20 seconds, and then swallow it. Try to avoid eating or drinking for at least 30 minutes afterward to allow it to work effectively. I'll also provide some instructions on proper oral hygiene to help prevent recurrence. Rinse your mouth with warm salt water a few times a day and continue brushing and flossing regularly. Here is the prescription. If your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if they worsen at any point, please schedule a follow-up appointment. And if you experience any difficulty swallowing or develop a fever, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… efficiency.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Schieber. I hope you feel better soon. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
