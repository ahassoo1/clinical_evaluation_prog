DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 87 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Eighty-seven, yes, that’s right. Seems like yesterday I was a young man, eh? Well, it’s this headache I’ve been getting. Right at the back of my head, it is. Been botherin’ me for a little bit now. Not constant, comes and goes.
DOCTOR: A headache, you say. And you mentioned it’s at the back of your head, intermittent. How long, precisely, has this “little bit now” been?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think now… not “little bit” really, more like… three weeks, I’d say. Maybe a bit longer. Hard to keep track when you get to be my age, you know? It started kinda slow, just a dull ache. Now it gets sharper sometimes, then fades again. Not every day, though. Some days I don’t feel a thing.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, give or take. And it’s progressed from a dull ache to sharper pains intermittently. Do you associate anything with the headache coming on?
PATIENT: Associate… you mean, does anything make it happen? That’s a good question. Not that I’ve noticed, really. I do a bit of gardening, mostly. Roses, you know? And I help my wife with the cooking sometimes. But no, nothin’ specific. Sometimes it’s there when I wake up, sometimes not. I don't think stress is the cause either, I'm a pretty relaxed man. I don't recall doin’ anything out of the ordinary.
DOCTOR: Alright. No clear triggers identified. Gardening, assisting with cooking... and you state no significant stress. Has anything changed recently in your diet, or your typical daily routine?
PATIENT: Diet... well, my wife, bless her heart, she keeps me well-fed. Lots of fish, vegetables, rice and peas. She’s been makin’ more callaloo lately, I suppose. I do enjoy that. Routine hasn't changed much either. Wake up, breakfast with my wife, a bit of work in the garden, maybe a visit from the grandkids. Same as always, really. I haven't been sleepin’ too well, now that I think about it. Tossin’ and turnin’ a bit. But I figured that was just old age catchin’ up with me.
DOCTOR: Increased callaloo consumption... and some difficulty sleeping. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying the headache or the sleeplessness?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. No dizziness, no blurry vision. My appetite's still good, as I said, my wife makes sure of that! No fever, no nausea. Just... tired, sometimes. A bit more forgetful than usual, perhaps, but I always said my memory wasn't what it used to be. Though I recall every detail of the roses I’ve grown over the years, if you want to know! Nothing major, honestly. Just feelin’ a bit… off, you know? Not myself, exactly.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no nausea, appetite is good. You mentioned increased forgetfulness. Is this new, or has this been a gradual process?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not new new, Doctor. Happens with age, I expect. But it feels a bit… sharper lately, if that makes sense. Not losin' things, or not knowin' people, mind you. More like… words on the tip of my tongue, you know? Or forgettin’ what I went into the garden shed for. Small things. My wife says I repeat myself sometimes, but she’s always teasin’ me. It's not cause for alarm, I don't think. Just… a bit more frequent lately. And this headache... it seems to come on when I’m tryin’ to concentrate on somethin’. Like readin’ the newspaper.
DOCTOR: So, headache exacerbated by concentration, some increased forgetfulness… Have you experienced any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness? No, Doctor, not at all. Arms and legs feel fine. I'm still able to tend to my roses, and I walk around just fine. No trouble gettin’ up and down the stairs either. Strong as I ever was, I reckon. Well, maybe not quite as strong, but I get by! It’s just this headache and the little memory lapses that bother me. And I was hoping you might have some idea what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. Let's have a quick look at your blood pressure and do a brief neurological exam, just to be thorough. Then we can discuss potential causes. If you'll just have a seat here for me.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Happy to do whatever you think is best. Lead the way, eh? I trust your judgment. Hope it’s nothin’ too serious.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… 145 over 90. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Reflexes are normal. Now, I'd like you to close your eyes and tell me what day it is.
PATIENT: Alright, closed my eyes. Hmm... let me think now. Today is… August the 2nd, yes? August the 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I try to keep track, but it all blends together sometimes, you know. Is that what you wanted to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat a few words after me. Listen carefully. The words are: Apple, table, penny.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. There you go, Doctor. Apple, table, penny. Did I get them right? My ears aren't what they used to be, you know. Sometimes things sound a bit muffled.
DOCTOR: You repeated them correctly. Now, I’m going to ask you to tell me what year we are in.
PATIENT: Oh, that's an easy one! It's 2025, of course. Like I said, I try to keep track. A good year so far, even with this headache botherin' me. Though I sometimes forget what I had for breakfast, I remember the year just fine!
DOCTOR: Very well. Based on this brief examination, and your reported symptoms, it appears you are experiencing mild cognitive impairment, likely age-related, alongside tension headaches. It’s not uncommon at your age, Mr. Popova. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. I’m going to order some blood work to check your thyroid function and vitamin levels. And I’d like you to schedule an MRI of your brain. Just to be thorough.
PATIENT: MRI… and blood work? Oh dear. That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it somethin’ bad? I just thought it was a bit of a headache and some forgetfulness, you know? I'm not sure I'm up for an MRI. They aren't very comfortable, are they? And I don't have insurance, so… will that be expensive?
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, I understand your concerns. An MRI is a precautionary measure. It allows us to rule out any underlying structural issues. It does not necessarily indicate a serious problem. As for the cost, we can discuss payment options with the clinic administrator. The blood work is relatively inexpensive. However, it’s important to address these symptoms promptly. I'm also going to recommend increasing your fluid intake and getting regular, moderate exercise. And I'll prescribe a mild analgesic for the headaches. In the meantime, try to keep a headache diary – note when they occur, how long they last, and any associated symptoms. We’ll review everything at your follow-up appointment in two weeks. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A headache diary… and follow-up appointment. Alright. Two weeks, eh? I suppose that sounds reasonable. I can try to keep a diary, though I might forget sometimes. And I’ll try the extra water and walkin’, like you say. Just… about this MRI… is it absolutely necessary? I’m not a fan of hospitals or machines, Doctor. And I worry about the cost, to be honest. My wife and I are on a fixed income. Maybe we could just… monitor things for a while first? See if the headaches get worse?
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, I understand your apprehension. However, as a physician, it is my duty to conduct a thorough investigation to rule out any serious underlying pathology. While I appreciate your concerns about the cost, delaying a proper diagnosis could have negative consequences. The MRI is not optional. We need to establish a baseline assessment. I will speak with the clinic administrator regarding potential financial assistance programs. In the meantime, I will write you a prescription for naproxen, which should help manage the headaches. And please, attempt to adhere to the recommendations. We’ll discuss the results of the blood work and schedule the MRI at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s best, Doctor. I trust your judgment, I suppose. Naproxen, eh? I’ll take it. And I’ll try my best with the diary and the walkin’. And I’ll see what the clinic administrator says about the cost. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help, even if it means a bit of a hassle. I suppose that’s all for now.
