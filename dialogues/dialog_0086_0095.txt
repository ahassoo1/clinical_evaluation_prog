DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have all day to explain things. It's… obvious, isn't it? I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of one ear, and half my face feels like it’s drooping. Is that not what doctors are for? Figuring out obvious things?
DOCTOR: Well, “obvious” is a rather subjective term in medicine, Ms. Nissenbaum. While your symptoms do sound concerning, I still need to gather some information to understand what might be going on. It's important to be thorough. So, let's start with when exactly did you notice this hearing loss and facial drooping?
PATIENT: This morning! I just told you that. When I woke up. Before that, everything was perfectly fine. I don't need to give you a minute-by-minute account of my sleep schedule. Really, is this necessary? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is necessary, Ms. Nissenbaum. Sudden onset is important. And while you say “perfectly fine,” was there anything unusual yesterday?
PATIENT: Unusual? Let me think… No. Nothing. I had dinner, watched television, went to bed. The usual. I don't go gallivanting around doing reckless things that would cause my face to suddenly fall off, if that's what you're implying. Honestly, this is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And before yesterday, say, in the last few weeks, have you experienced any dizziness, headaches, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I have excellent health, or had excellent health before… whatever this is. Look, are you going to examine me or just interrogate me about my life? I'm a radiologist, I understand the importance of a good history, but this is getting ridiculous. I'm not prone to dizziness, I don’t get headaches, and my vision is 20/20. Or was 20/20. Before today, that is.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a look then. Please sit forward. I’m going to need to examine your ears, and I’ll also check your facial muscle strength and reflexes. It will only take a few moments.
PATIENT: Fine. But if this involves anything… uncomfortable, I want to know beforehand. I have a very low tolerance for… poking and prodding. And please, be gentle. My skin is quite sensitive. Honestly, the things they let people practice these days...
DOCTOR: I assure you, I'm quite experienced, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let me take a look in your ears. Hmm. The ear canal appears clear. No obvious signs of infection… Now, the left… There's some slight redness and… mild swelling. I’ll need to assess your facial nerves now. Could you please raise your eyebrows for me?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Slight redness? Is that all you’ve got? There. Happy? It's not exactly a dramatic display, is it? And frankly, it feels… odd. Like pulling something. Is this going to be painful? Because I really don’t have the patience for pain.
DOCTOR: There is some weakness on the left side. Now, could you please try to smile for me?
PATIENT: Is that satisfactory? Because it feels… humiliating. And it's clearly not working properly. Are you going to actually do something about this, or just keep pointing out the obvious? Honestly, I've seen more competent medical students.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, based on what I’ve observed, this presentation is concerning for Bell's Palsy. It's a condition that causes sudden weakness in the facial muscles. It's usually temporary, but it requires prompt evaluation to rule out other, more serious causes. I'm going to order some blood work to check for things like Lyme disease and other infections, and I also recommend an MRI to rule out any structural problems. We need to get this imaging done quickly.
PATIENT: Lyme disease? I haven’t been bitten by a tick in decades. Honestly, this is ridiculous. Structural problems? I’m a perfectly healthy woman! You’re going to poke and prod me with needles and put me in a giant machine… all for something that you’re already calling “Bell’s Palsy”? Is that even a proper diagnosis? It sounds… made up. And an MRI? I get claustrophobic! I don't like this. Not one bit. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your concerns, but it's standard procedure to rule out other possibilities, even if Bell's Palsy seems likely. I wouldn't order these tests if I didn't think they were necessary. And while Bell’s Palsy is often self-limiting, it's important to determine the cause and start treatment as soon as possible to improve your chances of a full recovery. The blood work is a simple draw, and we can discuss options for the MRI – like a shorter scan or medication to help with any anxiety. But we need to gather more information. Are you allergic to contrast dye?
