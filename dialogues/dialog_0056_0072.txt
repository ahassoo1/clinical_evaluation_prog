DOCTOR: Hi Ebony, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I've been…forgetting things. Little things, mostly, but it's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to be embarrassed at all, Ebony. It's good you're bringing it up. Memory issues can happen for lots of reasons. “Little things” can still be disruptive. Can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Like, I’ll go into a room and forget why I went there. Or I’ll start a sentence and the word just…vanishes. And I keep repeating questions I've already asked, without realizing it. It’s not constant, but it’s happening more and more often. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely makes sense. And it's good you're noticing a pattern. When did you first start noticing these memory lapses?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. That's a good question. It's hard to say exactly… maybe six months ago? It was really subtle at first, just thinking, “Did I lock the door?” or something. But I’d say in the last three months it’s become more noticeable, like I’m really struggling sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months of a progressive increase is helpful to know. Have you noticed any other changes along with the memory issues?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me see. I’ve been a little more… irritable, maybe? My friends have said I seem a bit more on edge than usual. And I’ve been sleeping okay, but I wake up feeling… not refreshed, like I haven't rested well. I don’t know if that's related.
DOCTOR: Okay, irritability and non-restorative sleep are good things to note. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles – but nothing major. I broke my wrist when I was a teenager, but it healed fine. No serious illnesses or surgeries, thankfully. I’m generally pretty healthy, which is why this memory thing is so unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And how about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tougher one. My mother had some… confusion towards the end of her life, but it was after a stroke, so we didn’t really think it was anything else. My father was perfectly fine, mentally sharp until he passed. No Alzheimer’s or dementia that anyone knew of, on either side of the family, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Let's talk about your current medications and any allergies you have. Are you taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, honestly. And I take ibuprofen occasionally for headaches, but that’s it. No allergies that I know of. I’m not really a big pill-taker, if you know what I mean. I try to stay natural, as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No current medications to interact with. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I don’t drink, never really liked it. And I’ve never smoked. Definitely no recreational drugs. I'm a dentist, remember? I try to set a good example.
DOCTOR: Right, of course! A dentist. That's good to know. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then I'd like to do a brief neurological assessment, just to get a baseline. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and coordination. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is that okay? I feel a little silly doing this, but I'm happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Good. And now, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today is… August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I think it’s right. I've been a bit preoccupied lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's correct. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words, and then I'll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny. Okay, got it. Hopefully, I won't forget those!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let’s move on to a quick cognitive assessment. I’m going to ask you to spell “world” backwards. Just take your time.
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. Let me think. D-l-r-o-w. Is that right? I always struggle with spelling backwards. It's terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's close. It's actually d-l-r-o-w-l-d. But don't worry about it. Now, let's go back to those three words. Can you tell me what words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is embarrassing… Let me see… I remember… apple, I think. And… something with a “t”… table? I’m not sure about the third one. It's on the tip of my tongue…
DOCTOR: Okay. It's alright, it's a normal part of the assessment. You remembered apple and table. The third word was penny. Based on this brief exam and your history, it does sound like you're experiencing some cognitive difficulties. While it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis, these symptoms warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Okay. That… doesn't sound good. What kind of investigation? What could it be? I mean, I'm only 38. It's scary to think something might be…wrong. Is it…Alzheimer’s? I've heard terrible things.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Ebony. It is scary. But let's not jump to conclusions. Alzheimer’s is less common in someone your age, though it's not impossible. There are many other potential causes for these symptoms - vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, even stress and sleep deprivation can sometimes cause cognitive changes. I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out some of the more common causes. And I’d also like to schedule you for a more comprehensive cognitive assessment with a neurologist. That’ll give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good, actually. Anything to figure out what’s happening. Blood tests and a neurologist… okay. Can you explain a little about what the cognitive assessment with the neurologist will involve? I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. And how long will it take to get the results from the blood tests?
DOCTOR: Of course. The cognitive assessment is more in-depth than what I did today. The neurologist will ask you a series of questions and give you some tasks to test different aspects of your cognitive function - memory, language, problem-solving, attention, spatial reasoning. It's a bit longer, usually takes about an hour or two, but it’s not painful or invasive. They will also ask about your medical history and lifestyle. As for the blood tests, the lab usually takes a couple of days to process everything. I’d expect to have the results back within three to five business days. Once I have those, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and the neurologist's findings. In the meantime, I want you to focus on getting good sleep, eating a healthy diet, and managing any stress you might be experiencing. These things can make a big difference. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. I'm going to write you a referral to a neurologist and a lab requisition for the blood tests now.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… manageable, I guess. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel a little less anxious now, just knowing what to expect. I’ll try to focus on sleep and diet. And I'll definitely call if anything changes. Is there anything else I should be doing, or anything I should be avoiding? Like, should I stop driving or anything? I hate to think of that.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ebony. I'm glad I could help ease your anxiety. As for anything else, it's generally safe to continue with your normal activities for now. However, I would advise against any complex tasks that require a lot of concentration until we have a better understanding of what’s going on. Regarding driving, at this point, I don't think it's necessary to stop. But, please be honest with yourself. If you feel unsafe or disoriented while driving, even for a short distance, then you should absolutely avoid it. We can discuss this further after we have the results from the tests. I’m also going to give you a handout with some resources for cognitive health and support groups, just in case you'd like to explore them. Do you have any other questions for me today before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Amussen. You've been very kind and helpful. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I'm still worried, of course, but I feel a little more prepared now. I'll schedule the appointments and get the tests done as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ebony. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we're just gathering information at this point. And I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up, even if it seems small. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will.
