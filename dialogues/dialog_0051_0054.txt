DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… cough. Yeah, I got this cough. Been a long time, actually. And… tired a lot. Feels like… sinus, always stuffy, you know? Like a cold, but it don’t go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, a persistent cough, fatigue, and sinus congestion… sounds frustrating. “Long time” is a bit vague, could you tell me roughly how long you’ve been dealing with these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… vague, you say? Yeah, you’re right. I’m not good with time. Maybe… six months? Or more? It comes and goes, but mostly it’s there. I dunno, Doctor. I just feel… blah. Like I can’t shake it off. Work is hard when you feel like this. Tire shop… lots of lifting.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months or more of on-and-off symptoms. That does sound concerning enough to investigate further. And you mentioned it impacts your work at the tire shop… lifting, you said. Any pain associated with the lifting, or is it mostly just the fatigue making it difficult?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… heavy. Hard to breathe sometimes when I lift. Like chest tight, you know? Not all the time. When I really push myself. Mostly just tired after. Like I used no energy. And… sometimes, when I lie down, the cough is worse. Makes it hard to sleep. My wife… she complainin’ too. She say I snore a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, tightness with exertion, worsening cough when lying down, and your wife mentions snoring… That gives me a little more to work with. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats with this?
PATIENT: Fever… not really. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but not like… sick warm. Chills… no. Night sweats… uh… I dunno. I sleep pretty hot, always have. My wife say I kick off the blanket all the time. She say I sweat a lot, but I always have, even before this cough. I dunno if that’s… different now. It’s hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s good you’re able to recall those details, even if it's a little difficult to pinpoint. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… maybe a little less. Not much. I still eat. But… not as much as before. And… weight… I think I lost some. My pants feel a little loose, but I haven’t… you know… weigh myself. I just feel… smaller, I guess. Wife say I look tired. She always notice everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Decreased appetite, some weight loss… I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, check your sinuses, and just get a general sense of how things are. It shouldn’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds good, Doctor. Lung and heart… okay. Sinus… yeah, stuffy. Whatever you need. I just wanna feel better. It's hard to work when I feel like this. And my wife… she worry a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Let’s get started then. If you could just have a seat on the exam table, please. I'm going to listen to your lungs first. Take deep breaths in and out when I tell you. Okay, take a deep breath… and exhale… good. And again… deep breath in… and out… Alright. A few crackles in the lower lobes, but nothing terribly concerning at this stage. Now I'll listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular. Blood pressure is 130/85. Now let's take a look at your sinuses. This might be a little uncomfortable, just let me know if it's too much. Tenderness over the frontal and maxillary sinuses. Some congestion noted. Now I’m going to check your throat. Say “Ahhh.” Mild redness in the throat. No obvious signs of infection. Alright, that completes the basic exam. We should get some imaging done to help us determine what's going on. I'm thinking a chest X-ray would be a good first step. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… okay. Sounds… serious. Is it bad, Doctor? I just wanna know what’s wrong. Chest… okay. My wife… she scared easy. Should I tell her about the X-ray? She’ll worry all night.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking those questions. An X-ray isn’t necessarily serious, Mr. Tati. It’s simply a tool to help us see what's going on in your lungs and rule out any potential issues. It allows us to get a clearer picture of what might be causing your cough and fatigue. It's standard procedure with symptoms like yours. As for telling your wife, that’s up to you. You know her best. If she tends to worry easily, you might want to simply mention we’re doing some tests to get a better understanding of things and reassure her it's a common procedure. There’s no need to cause unnecessary alarm. Would you like me to explain the X-ray procedure to you in more detail?
PATIENT: Explain… yeah, okay. I don't like surprises. My wife… she always wants to know everything. What do they do? Is it… painful? And… will it show what’s wrong? I just wanna know. It’s hard to work when you don’t know what’s happenin’.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The X-ray itself is very quick and painless. You’ll be asked to remove any jewelry or metal objects around your chest and upper body. Then, a technician will position you between an X-ray machine and a film plate. You'll be asked to remain still for a few seconds while the image is captured. It doesn't involve any radiation entering your body. The image produced will show your lungs, heart, and major blood vessels. It can help us identify things like pneumonia, fluid buildup, or any other abnormalities. However, it’s important to remember that an X-ray is just one piece of the puzzle. We may need further testing, such as blood work, to get a complete picture. I'll be able to review the results with you as soon as they're available and discuss the next steps. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… no pain. Good. No metal. I can do that. Just… still. I’m not good at still. But I’ll try. And you look at the picture… and tell me what’s wrong? Will it show… what I’m afraid of? I don’t like bein’ sick. My wife… she’ll worry.
DOCTOR: Yes, I will carefully review the picture and explain the findings to you in detail. It may show what's causing your symptoms, and if it doesn't, we'll discuss other tests to help us reach a diagnosis. It's understandable to be afraid, and it’s okay to feel anxious. We'll take things one step at a time. It's important to remember that we're doing this to figure out what's going on and get you back to feeling better. We'll address any concerns you have and work together to find the best course of action. I’ll write an order for the chest X-ray now. The technician will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once you’ve had the X-ray, please let my office know, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – such as high fever, difficulty breathing, or chest pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright, Mr. Tati?
PATIENT: Okay… emergency room. I remember. Worsen… yeah. Chest X-ray… technician. I’ll call… or they call me. My wife… she can drive me. She always drives. Okay. I think… I think that’s everything? I’m tired, Doctor. Just wanna sleep.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Tati, I believe that’s everything for today. I completely understand your fatigue. Getting some rest is a good idea. Here’s a copy of the X-ray order and a summary of our conversation. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Thank you for coming in today, and I hope you get some much-needed rest. Take care, Mr. Tati.
