DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pandolfi. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Ruocco, it’s about this… gentleman I’ve recently begun seeing. It's a bit delicate, really. I suppose you could say I’m vetting him, and I thought it prudent to have a professional opinion before… things progress any further. It’s not every man who appreciates a woman of my… standards, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. “Vetting,” you say. And what exactly are you vetting for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where does one begin? Financial stability, of course. A man must be able to provide. Then there’s his social circle – are they… presentable? And his character, naturally. I’ve simply no patience for… shall we say, rough edges. I need someone who understands the importance of a certain… lifestyle. It’s rather exhausting, explaining these things, honestly. You wouldn’t believe the sorts of men I encounter.
DOCTOR: So, this isn’t a medical concern, per se?
PATIENT: Medical? Well, not directly. Although, a man’s health is indicative of his discipline, isn’t it? One wouldn’t want to be saddled with…constant ailments. It’s a matter of overall suitability, Doctor. I’m simply being thorough. I've always been a very… practical woman. I suppose you could say I’m assessing his long-term viability as a companion. It's a significant investment, after all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, with all due respect, this office is for medical evaluations. I’m a physician, not a…compatibility assessor. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms, or shall I direct you to another professional?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I didn't realize you were so… literal. Honestly. I thought a doctor of your… standing would understand the importance of preventative care. Ensuring one doesn’t end up with a disappointment later on is certainly a matter of health, wouldn’t you agree? Emotional distress, stress…those are physical ailments, are they not? I simply wanted a discreet professional opinion on whether he… appeared to be a suitable candidate. Perhaps a general health screening would suffice? Just to be certain, you understand.
DOCTOR: Look, I can do a basic physical. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. I'm not going to analyze his "social circle" or his financial stability. Is there anything you are feeling, anything physically bothering you, that prompted this visit?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, my sleep has been a bit disturbed lately. Not nightmares, exactly. More… restless nights. I find myself thinking, overanalyzing, you understand. And a slight tension in my shoulders. It’s probably just stress, honestly, worrying about…well, everything. But a doctor should consider the whole picture, shouldn’t they? Perhaps a mild sedative? Just until I’ve…sorted things out.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, disturbed sleep and shoulder tension. Anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. My appetite has been a bit…off. Not a loss of appetite, exactly. More like…a lack of enthusiasm for it. I used to enjoy a lovely brunch on Sundays, but lately, it just doesn't seem appealing. And perhaps a little fatigue, though I’ve always been rather active. I walk three miles every morning, you know. But even that seems…more arduous than usual. It’s probably just a vitamin deficiency, honestly. Or…the stress. It’s always the stress.
DOCTOR: And you’re currently taking any medications, or have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I pride myself on maintaining excellent health. Natural remedies only, you understand. A little chamomile tea, perhaps. And I’m extremely careful about what I ingest. No allergies, though. Never had any. I’m rather…robust, constitutionally. Though, as I said, lately… I feel just a little less than my usual self. It's disconcerting, really. It's vital to address these things proactively, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, quick neurological check, and I'll palpate your thyroid. Then we’ll discuss some basic blood work to rule out common deficiencies. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…sensible. Although, I must say, my thyroid is perfectly fine. I assure you. But very well. Proceed. I trust you’ll be gentle. And I do hope it won’t take too long. I have a luncheon engagement this afternoon. With…a colleague. A rather important colleague, you understand. So, efficiency would be greatly appreciated.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 72, regular. Take a deep breath for me…and again…Lungs sound clear. Any history of shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, none whatsoever. As I said, I walk three miles every morning. Quite briskly, I might add. I maintain an active lifestyle. Always have. Shortness of breath would be…most unusual. I do get a little winded climbing the stairs, perhaps, but that's simply a matter of age, wouldn’t you agree? One can’t expect to maintain the vigor of youth indefinitely, can one? Though I do try. And I'm very diligent about my hydration. It's all about preventative measures, you see.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It's probably benign, but we'll want to get an EKG just to be certain. Open your mouth… Say “Ah…” Stick out your tongue… Okay. Neurological exam appears normal. No obvious deficits. Now, I’m going to palpate your thyroid… Thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but no nodules detected.
PATIENT: Enlarged? Oh dear. That is…concerning. My mother had some…thyroid issues later in life. Though she didn’t take particularly good care of herself. I, on the other hand, am very conscientious about my health. A murmur and an enlarged thyroid? Perhaps we should order a full thyroid panel. And an ultrasound, just to be certain. One can never be too careful, you understand. Especially with these things. It’s probably nothing, but…it’s best to be thorough. And I do hope it won't interfere with my luncheon engagement.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm ordering a complete thyroid panel, including TSH, T4, and T3. And an ultrasound of the thyroid gland. We’ll also do an EKG to assess the murmur. While we wait for the results, I’ll order a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count to check for any underlying deficiencies. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…extremely comprehensive. Rather reassuring, actually. You seem very… diligent, Doctor. It’s good to know I’m in capable hands. Though, I do hope the luncheon won't be unduly delayed. It’s rather an important meeting, you see. A potential business opportunity. One must prioritize, you understand. And if the results indicate anything… serious, should I postpone any further… social engagements? It wouldn’t do to present oneself in a…compromised state.
DOCTOR: I’ll have the lab results faxed to my office by tomorrow afternoon. Once I’ve reviewed them, I’ll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and managing your stress levels. As for postponing social engagements, that’s a decision you’ll have to make based on how you’re feeling. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. You’ve been…remarkably thorough, Doctor. Though I must reiterate, I am generally a very healthy individual. This is likely just a minor anomaly. A small blip, you understand. I appreciate you taking the time to address my concerns. And do let me know as soon as the results are available. I have a rather busy schedule, as you can imagine. Thank you. I suppose I should be going then.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab technician will call you when they're ready. Have a good day, Ms. Pandolfi. .
PATIENT: Yes, you too, Doctor. Honestly. All that fuss over a little…restlessness. It’s probably just the stress. .
