DOCTOR: Hi Betty, it’s so good to meet you. I’m Chriselda Morenomartinez, and I’m one of the family medicine doctors here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It's nice to meet you too. Well, now… let me see. It's about my ears, I think. Everything’s a bit… fuzzy these days. I just don't hear things like I used to. Not sure when it started, honestly. It just… happened, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, “fuzzy” and not hearing things like you used to. That’s a good starting point. When you say it “just happened,” can you think of anything specific that you were doing or any event that coincided with when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking a lot of an old woman! Let me think… Hmm. I used to work at the shoe factory, you know. Lots of noise there. Machines clatterin’ all day long. Could be somethin' to do with that? I don’t rightly remember when I noticed it got bad, just that it… gradually got harder to hear folks. It wasn’t sudden, not that I recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, the shoe factory – lots of noise exposure. That's definitely helpful information. So, it sounds like it developed gradually over time, rather than a specific incident. And you said it’s gotten harder to hear folks – is it harder to hear all sounds, or mostly people talking?
PATIENT: Mostly people talkin’, I think. Like… if there's music on, I can usually hear that alright. And the TV… I just turn it up louder, see? But when someone’s speakin’ directly to me, it's like they’re mumblin’ or somethin’. Or I just… miss parts of what they say. It's awfully frustrating. My nephew keeps tellin' me to get my ears checked. He’s a good boy, that one.
DOCTOR: He sounds like a very considerate nephew. Okay, so music and the TV are okay with the volume up, but it's specifically conversation that’s difficult, and it feels like people are mumbling or you’re missing parts of what they say. Is this happening in both ears, or is it worse in one than the other?
PATIENT: Oh, now that's a good question. Let me think… I think it’s… both, maybe? It's hard to tell. Everything sounds a bit muffled, really. I don't lean on one ear more than the other, if that makes sense. I just… try to get by. I don’t know if it’s worse on one side than the other, no. I never really paid that close of attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, both ears, muffled sound. That's helpful. Now, have you noticed any ringing, buzzing, or hissing sounds in your ears at all?
PATIENT: Ringing… buzzing… Oh, yes! Sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. It’s like a high-pitched whine, I suppose. Not loud, but… annoying. It comes and goes. More when it's quiet, I think. Like at night when I'm tryin' to sleep. It's been happenin' for… well, a good long while, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in both ears, a high-pitched whine, more noticeable when it's quiet and especially at night. And you’ve been experiencing this for a long while. Do you have any dizziness or balance problems at all?
PATIENT: Dizziness… Balance problems… No, not really. I'm a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, but that’s just bein’ old, I expect. Nothing that makes me fall or anything. I just… take my time, you know? No more dizziness than usual, I suppose. I get a bit lightheaded when I stand up fast, but everyone does that, don’t they?
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant dizziness or balance issues beyond what you'd expect with age, and occasional lightheadedness when standing. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… Well, the doctor told me years ago my blood pressure was a little high, but he put me on a pill for it. I took it for a while, but I stopped. It was makin’ me feel… funny. I haven't been back to the doctor in ages, honestly. I don't really have any other… what do you call it… conditions. Just old age, I suppose. I try to stay active, though. Walkin’ to the store and all.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure that was treated with medication, but you stopped taking it because of side effects, and you haven't been to the doctor in some time. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anythin'. I used to take penicillin when I was a child, but that was ages ago. I don't think I’m allergic to anything, no. Sometimes my skin gets a bit itchy if I use certain soaps, but that’s just a mild irritation. Nothin' serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies, and only mild skin irritation with certain soaps. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis. It's called… well, I forget the name now. The pills, they’re little white ones. And I take a multivitamin every day, just to keep things topped up. Here, maybe this will help? I haven't refilled it in a while, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, this is naproxen for arthritis. And a multivitamin. Alright. Now, let's do a quick exam of your ears. I’ll just take a look with this instrument. It won’t hurt, I promise. I see some wax buildup in both ears, and the eardrums look a little dull. That could be contributing to the hearing difficulties. I’m also noting some redness in the ear canals.
PATIENT: Oh, my. Well, that don’t sound good, does it? Redness… Is that bad? The wax… I suppose I should’ve cleaned them more often. I never really knew how. Is it somethin’ serious, doctor?
DOCTOR: The redness could indicate some inflammation or minor infection. It’s not necessarily serious at this point, but it’s worth addressing. The wax buildup is also pretty significant, and that can definitely block sound. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’m seeing, it sounds like you likely have a combination of cerumen impaction and some mild otitis externa—inflammation of the outer ear canal. The noise exposure from your previous work likely contributed to some hearing loss over time. The tinnitus is also common with hearing loss. I’d recommend we start with a cerumen removal. We can do that here in the office. After that, I’d like to prescribe you some ear drops for the inflammation. We’ll also want to monitor your hearing. Do you have any family history of hearing loss?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness, all those fancy words! Cerumen… otitis… It's all goin' over my head, dear. So, wax and… inflammation, is that right? My ears are just a mess, aren't they? Family history… Let me see. My mother… I think her hearing wasn't the best when she got older. But that was just old age, I always thought. My brother… he could hear just fine, as far as I know. I don’t really keep track of such things. I just know I can’t hear as well anymore. Is that wax removal painful? I'm a bit scared of things goin' in my ears.
DOCTOR: Okay, wax and inflammation – that's right. And a family history of some hearing loss, that's good to know. The cerumen removal is usually not painful at all. I use a gentle irrigation system – it’s just warm water. It might feel a little strange, like a mild pressure, but it shouldn’t hurt. I’ll explain the process step-by-step before we start, and you can tell me to stop at any time. After the removal, I’m going to prescribe some ear drops to help with the inflammation and prevent any infection. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Warm water… That sounds… better, I suppose. A bit of pressure is alright, as long as it's not too much. And the ear drops… Will they make my ears feel funny? I don't like things messin' with my head. And how long will this take? I have to get back to make dinner for my nephew. He's comin’ over, you see.
DOCTOR: The ear drops shouldn't make your ears feel funny, but you might feel a slight cooling sensation when you put them in. They’re just to help reduce the swelling and prevent infection. The cerumen removal itself should take about 10-15 minutes, and then I’ll explain how to use the ear drops, which will only take a few minutes more. We should have you out of here with plenty of time to make dinner. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… yes, that sounds alright. 10-15 minutes… I can manage that. And if it feels too uncomfortable, I can just tell you to stop, right? I don’t want to be a bother. I just want to be able to hear my nephew when he talks to me. He worries about me, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You can stop me at any time if you feel any discomfort at all. That’s my priority. And yes, being able to hear your nephew is a wonderful reason to get this taken care of. Alright, let's go ahead and get started. I'm going to have you lean back, and I’ll gently start the cerumen removal. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, okay?
PATIENT: Alright… I’ll try. It's just… I don't like things in my ears. Just be gentle, dear. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, Betty. I'm just starting now. You'll feel a gentle stream of warm water. It might tickle a little, but it shouldn't be painful. Just breathe deeply and try to relax. Let me know if you feel any discomfort at all. How are you doing so far?
PATIENT: It’s… tickly, you were right. And a little bit cold. But not… awful. It's just… strange, you know? Like water in my ear. Is it working? Can you tell?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's definitely working! I’m seeing a good amount of wax coming out. Okay, I think we've got most of it out now. Let me take a look. There we go. Much better. The eardrum is much clearer now. Alright, Betty, that wasn’t too bad, was it?
PATIENT: No… not too bad, I suppose. A bit strange, but not painful. Is it all out? Really? I think I can hear you a little better already. What happens next?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's all out. Well, almost all! There might be a tiny bit left, but it won’t affect your hearing. Now, I'm going to write you a prescription for some ear drops called ciprofloxacin otic. They’re antibiotic drops to prevent any infection in the ear canal, now that we’ve removed the wax. You'll want to put 2 drops in each ear twice a day for 7 days. I’ll also give you some written instructions on how to use them properly. It’s important to keep your head tilted for a few minutes after you put them in, so they can soak in. Do you have any questions about the drops, or anything else?
PATIENT: Seven days… twice a day. Alright, I can remember that. Tilt my head… for how long? And do I need to warm the drops up first? I don’t want to mess anything up. And is it alright if my nephew helps me put them in? He's a very good boy, and his hands are steadier than mine.
DOCTOR: Good questions! You don't need to warm the drops up – room temperature is fine. And you only need to tilt your head for about a minute after putting them in, just to make sure they get down into the ear canal. And absolutely, it's perfectly fine if your nephew helps you put them in. That’s a great idea. Having someone assist you, especially someone with steadier hands, is always helpful. Do you have any other questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all. Seven days, twice a day, room temperature, tilt my head for a minute, and my nephew can help. I think I’ve got it. Thank you, dear. You were very patient with me. And you explained everything so well. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Betty. I’m glad I could help. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any problems or questions after you start using the drops. I'm going to give you a little note to take to your primary care physician, just letting them know what we did today. And if your hearing doesn’t improve after a week, or if you notice any pain or drainage from your ears, please make an appointment to see them. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, dear. You've been a lifesaver. Now I can hopefully hear my nephew properly. Alright, I best be gettin' home to start dinner. Have a good day! And thank you again for your patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Betty. You have a good day too, and enjoy your dinner with your nephew! And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
