DOCTOR: Hi Brad, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's about my stomach. Been bleedin', see? Not a good thing, bleedin' from down there. Thought I’d better get it checked, though frankly, these country doctors… no offense.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Brad. It's good you came in to get it checked, and you’re right to be concerned about bleeding. It’s always best to be cautious. Can you tell me a little more about the bleeding?
PATIENT: It started, oh, maybe a week ago? Just a little at first. Thought it was somethin’ I ate. But it’s gotten… worse. Dark stuff, mostly. And it ain't just a little now, if you catch my drift. Makes me feel weak, tired. Used to be able to work all day, now… not so much. Crematory work ain't easy, you know. Gotta be strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, dark stool, starting about a week ago and getting progressively worse… and it's affecting your energy levels. Crematory work is physically demanding. That's important information. When you say dark, can you describe the color a bit more?
PATIENT: Like… black. Not brown, black. Like… well, like tar, almost. You know, like what they use on roads. And it smells… awful. Different than usual. Look, doc, I ain’t a doctor, I just know somethin' ain’t right. I haven't been eatin' nothin' different either, so don't go askin' me that. It just started.
DOCTOR: Okay, black, tar-like stool with a noticeable odor, and no changes to your diet. That helps. And you mentioned feeling weak. Any dizziness, lightheadedness, or shortness of breath along with that weakness?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Just tired. Really, really tired. And a little… queasy, sometimes. Mostly just worn out. I used to be able to lift, carry… now I'm winded walkin’ up the stairs. And frankly, I don't have time for this. Got work to do, people to… well, you know. It's a busy season. Shouldn't be bleedin' now, of all times.
DOCTOR: I understand you're busy, Brad, and we'll try to figure this out as efficiently as possible. Queasiness along with the tiredness is good to know. Now, have you noticed any pain in your abdomen, chest, or back?
PATIENT: Pain? A little. Not sharp pain, nothin' like a broken bone. More like a dull ache, kinda… low down. Comes and goes. And sometimes it feels… bloated, like I ate too much. Though, like I said, I haven't. It's not constant, thankfully. Mostly just annoying. Is this gonna take long? I got a schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent dull ache and bloating along with the other symptoms. We'll get through this quickly. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical history? Look, doc, I'm a simple man. Not much to tell ya. Had the usual childhood stuff, measles, mumps… nothing serious. And then… well, my wife passed a few years back. That was… hard. Other than that? Just gettin' older. No fancy diseases, no nothin'. Don't waste your time askin', I'm tellin' ya. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Brad. And I’m sorry for your loss. We don’t need to go into a lot of detail. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than your wife’s passing?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been cut open. Never needed to be. Just… tough luck, mostly. Broke a finger once, fell off a ladder. Set it myself, didn’t bother with a doctor then either. Waste of time and money. I’m a practical man, doc. Get things done, don’t complain. This bleedin’… that’s new. And that’s why I’m here, grudgingly. Now, are you gonna poke and prod me, or what?
DOCTOR: Alright, Brad. I appreciate your honesty. It would be best to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. It won’t take long. If you could lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I'll explain everything as I go.
PATIENT: Poke and prod… just what I figured. Fine. But don’t go lookin' for nothin' you won't find. I ain't a fragile flower, you know. Just get it over with. And be gentle, would ya? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Brad. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope, to check for any unusual sounds. Then, I’ll gently press on different areas to see if anything feels tender. Just let me know if anything feels painful. I'm listening now... Can you tell me if you've noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently, besides the dark stool?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Look, I go when I gotta go. Not much to report there. Maybe a little… looser than usual. But that could be anything. Been stressed lately, you know? Worryin' about things. Work's busy, and… well, everything. Don't go makin' a fuss over a little… regularity. Just get on with it, doc. This is uncomfortable. And frankly, I don’t appreciate bein' poked and prodded like some… some experiment.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little looser than usual, and understandably you're stressed with work. I’m just trying to get a complete picture, Brad, and I apologize if it’s uncomfortable. I’m being as gentle as I can. Alright, I'm noticing a little tenderness here, on your left side. Does that feel particularly sore when I press?
PATIENT: Ow! Yeah, that’s it. That’s a little sore. Not sharp pain, like a knife, but… yeah, definitely tender. What’s wrong with me, doc? You findin' somethin' bad? This ain't good, is it? I knew I shoulda just stayed home and toughed it out. Now you're tellin' me somethin's wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad, it’s good that you told me. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong, but tenderness in that area does warrant further investigation. We'll need to run some tests to figure out what's causing the bleeding and the tenderness. I’m going to order a complete blood count to check your red blood cell levels and look for signs of anemia, and a stool test to check for blood and infection. We should also get a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. I’d also like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis, to get a better look at your organs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan? What are you lookin’ for? Cancer? An ulcer? Don’t tell me I gotta get a… a colonoscopy or somethin’. Look, I ain’t afraid of a little pain, but… this is gettin' out of hand. I just wanted to know why I was bleedin', not… not have my insides ripped apart. And who’s gonna pay for all this? I ain’t got insurance, doc. I told you that. You think I can just magic up money for a CT scan? This is a disaster. A complete disaster.
DOCTOR: Brad, I understand your concern, and it’s okay to feel anxious. A CT scan will help us rule out serious problems and get to the root of what’s going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious is wrong, but it’s the best way to get a clear picture. As for the cost, I know you mentioned not having insurance. Our clinic does have a financial assistance program, and we can work with you to find a payment plan that fits your budget. I’ll have our billing department contact you to discuss your options. We won’t move forward with any tests until we’ve figured out a way to make it affordable for you. In the meantime, to get a better understanding of your situation, can you tell me if you’ve experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Well… yeah. A few pounds, maybe. But I’ve been workin' long hours, stressin’ a lot. Didn’t think nothin’ of it. But now that you mention it… I guess I haven't been eatin’ as much. Not much appetite, really. And my clothes… yeah, they feel a little looser. Not drastically, but… noticeable. It's probably just the stress. But it’s somethin’ else now, isn't it? Always somethin’ else.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. The weight loss, along with the bleeding, tenderness, and change in bowel habits, are all concerning. It's good that you told me. Based on everything you’ve described, it's important to rule out some serious possibilities, like colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. That’s why the tests are important. To be clear, I’m not saying you have cancer or IBD, but we need to investigate to be sure. We will start with the blood work and stool tests today. Then we can schedule the CT scan as soon as possible. I’ll also write you a referral to a gastroenterologist, who is a specialist in digestive health, for a consultation after we have the test results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist? Specialists… more tests… more bills… This is a nightmare. Look, doc, can't you just give me somethin' for the bleedin'? Stop the pain? I got work to do, people rely on me. I can't be runnin' around to specialists and havin' scans done. This is… this is too much. But… if I gotta, I gotta. Fine. Do the blood work. Do the stool tests. Schedule the scan. And get me a referral to… to whatever that doctor is called. But please, doc, just… get it over with. And keep the bills down, alright? I'm a simple man, with not much money.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. I understand your frustration and anxiety. We'll do everything we can to get this sorted out as quickly and efficiently as possible. I’ll get the orders for the blood work and stool tests sent to the lab right away, and our nurse will take you to get those done. I’ll also schedule the CT scan for the earliest available appointment, and we’ll get the referral to the gastroenterologist processed. I’ll make sure our billing department contacts you to discuss the costs and explore all available options. And please, don't hesitate to ask any questions you have along the way. We’re here to support you. For now, I’m going to write you a prescription for iron supplements to help with the anemia, and I recommend you stay hydrated and eat a bland diet to minimize irritation to your digestive system. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… no questions. Just… get it over with. I'll take the pills. Drink water. Eat bland food. Just… get it over with. Is there anything else? Anything at all? I just want to go home, doc. And get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. I understand. That’s all for today. Our nurse will show you where to go for the blood work, and we’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Here's the prescription for the iron supplements, and a sheet with some dietary recommendations. Please, take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. We’re here to help. Do you need me to call anyone to drive you home?
PATIENT: No… no, I’m alright. I’ll manage. Just want to get home. And… and think about this. Thanks, doc. I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. Take care. We'll be in touch soon. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. .
