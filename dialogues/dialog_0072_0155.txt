DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're seventy-nine years of age. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Seventy-nine, is it? Seems like yesterday… anyway. It’s this… shaking. My hand, mostly. Been getting worse, you see. It’s… bothersome. I don't rightly recall when it started started, just that it is happening now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Shaking, you say. And it’s primarily in your hand?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. Though sometimes… sometimes it feels like it’s… all over? Hard to say, really. It's not constant, mind you. Comes and goes. It’s just… makes things difficult. Pouring a cup of coffee, that’s a whole ordeal now.
DOCTOR: And when did you first notice this… intermittent shaking, to the best of your recollection?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. See, my memory… isn’t what it used to be. Could’ve been… six months ago? A year? I really couldn’t say for sure. It just sort of… gradually got worse, you know? It wasn't a sudden thing. I’ve been trying to ignore it, but it's getting harder to do that these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the difficulty with tasks like pouring coffee, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this shaking?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. Not really. No… nothing I can put my finger on, anyway. Maybe a little… tiredness. But I’m an old man, Doctor. What do you expect? I get tired easily. I don’t think that’s related, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any stiffness, slowness in your movements, or any changes in your speech?
PATIENT: Stiffness… not particularly. My joints ache a bit now and then, but that’s just… old age, I presume. Speech… no. People still understand me, I think. My daughter complains sometimes, but she always has something to complain about.
DOCTOR: Do you have a family history of any neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease or essential tremor?
PATIENT: Neurological… now that’s a big word. Family history… hmm. My mother, she… she got forgetful toward the end. Real bad, actually. But I don't know if that was… neurological. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he used to have a bit of a tremble when he was older, but he was a heavy drinker. Could’ve been that, right? I’m not sure. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t keep track of all that family business.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Doctor?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… No, not really. Just a little something for my blood pressure, sometimes. But I try not to take it, if I can help it. Don't like taking pills, you see. Makes me feel… foggy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to conduct a brief physical and neurological examination. That will involve checking your reflexes, coordination, and observing the tremor. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just try to be quick, if you would be so kind. I have… things to do, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. I’m observing a tremor in your right hand, and a slight slowness in some of your movements. Your reflexes appear within normal limits. Let me note these findings… .
PATIENT: Right hand, you say? That figures. Always been my dominant hand. I told you it was getting worse. Is it… bad? Please, just tell me straight. I don't want to be fussed over if it’s nothing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, while I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis without further testing – which I will order shortly – your symptoms and the findings of this preliminary exam are suggestive of a possible movement disorder. This could be essential tremor, which is quite common, or something else. It’s important to rule out other possibilities, such as Parkinson's disease. I want to order some blood work and a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Neurologist… blood work… Oh, dear. That sounds… complicated. Parkinson's, you say? Is that… serious? I just want this shaking to stop. I don't want a lot of tests and fussing. Can’t we just… get something for it? A pill or something?
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your concern. However, it's crucial to determine the cause of the shaking before we can consider any treatment options. Simply prescribing a "pill" without knowing the underlying condition could mask the symptoms and delay appropriate care. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder, and early diagnosis and management are important. The blood work will help rule out other potential causes. The neurologist will perform more specialized tests to confirm or rule out a diagnosis. I'm ordering the blood work now. And I will prepare a referral for a neurologist. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Maybe a bit of a rash sometimes, but nothing serious. Mostly I just get annoyed by things. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you looking into it. But honestly, I'm an old man. I've lived a long life. I don’t want to spend my remaining years running around to doctors and taking tests. Could we just… try something simple first? A pill, as I said. Or… maybe just leave it alone?
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, while I respect your wishes, I have a professional obligation to ensure you receive appropriate medical care. Ignoring this shaking without a proper diagnosis could have consequences. I understand you are hesitant about further testing, but it's the responsible course of action. I will order the blood work. And I will be submitting a referral to a neurologist. We can discuss medication options after we have a diagnosis. I’m also going to give you a list of resources about movement disorders, in case you’d like to learn more. Do you have any questions about the referral process?
PATIENT: Fine. Do what you have to do, Doctor. But please, try to keep it quick. And not too many tests, if you could. I suppose it's better to know. Though I’m not sure I want to know. No, I don't have any questions about the referral. Just… let me know when I need to go.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve submitted the lab orders, and the referral to Dr. Anya Volkov, a neurologist specializing in movement disorders. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. You will receive a copy of the lab results when they become available, and I will follow up with you after you’ve seen Dr. Volkov. Do you need a work note?
PATIENT: No, no work note. Retired, you see. I don't have a job to miss. Just… thank you, Doctor. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse give you the lab slip and information about Dr. Volkov’s office as you leave. Please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any changes in your condition. .
PATIENT: .
