DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs… my shins, mostly. They’re really bothering me. They’re red and kinda painful, you know? Been getting worse for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, bumps on your shins that are red and painful, and getting worse. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed them?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was probably… oh, maybe a month or so ago? They started small, just little red spots. I didn’t think much of it at first, figured I bumped them somehow. But then they got bigger, and more of them showed up. Now they really hurt if I touch them, or even if my pants rub against them. I’m not sure what caused it. I work a lot with my hands, moving things around, but I haven’t hit my legs that hard lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, so they started about a month ago as small red spots and have gradually gotten bigger and more painful. And you haven’t experienced any recent trauma to your legs that you can recall?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said, I do physical work, but nothing special lately that would explain it. Just the usual lifting and carrying. I don’t remember any specific injury or anything. Maybe a little brushing against things, but that’s it. It's just… strange. They weren’t there before, and now they’re really noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are the bumps just on your shins, or are they anywhere else on your legs, or even other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Just my shins, Doctor. Both of them, pretty much the same. Not on my knees, not on my thighs, not anywhere else. Just right here… …on the front of my legs. It's a good thing I wear long pants to work, honestly. They rub a bit, but it's better than everyone looking at them.
DOCTOR: Alright, just on both shins. And you said rubbing your pants against them makes them a little more uncomfortable, is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. It’s not terrible pain, but it’s… irritating. Like a constant little ache. And sometimes they feel warm, too. Not feverish, just… warmer than the rest of my skin. I don’t know if that makes sense. I haven’t really noticed any other symptoms, just the bumps, the pain when I touch them, and the rubbing.
DOCTOR: Okay, warmth is good to know. Have you noticed any itching with the bumps?
PATIENT: No, no itching at all. That’s one thing I can say for sure. They just… hurt. And they look kinda angry, you know? Red and raised. I tried putting some lotion on them, but it didn’t really help. I thought maybe it was just dry skin at first, but the lotion didn’t make it better.
DOCTOR: Alright, no itching, and lotion hasn’t helped. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of, like diabetes, or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I don’t have diabetes, no. The doctor checks my blood sugar when I go for my yearly check-up, and it’s always fine. Circulation… well, I get tired feet sometimes, after a long day at work, but nothing serious. I walk a lot, so I figured it was just that. My wife, she worries about it, but the doctor says it’s okay. I’m on Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly. Other than that… I don't really have any big health problems. I've been pretty lucky so far, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix taken out when I was a young man, a long time ago. And I had a hernia fixed maybe ten years back. But that’s it, I think. Nothing else. They were both pretty straightforward, no complications or anything. I recovered fine from both of them.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix and hernia, both in the past with no complications. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mother, she had high blood pressure, but that’s about it. My father was pretty healthy, lived to be a good age. My wife’s mother, she had arthritis, bad in her hands. But nobody in the family had anything like these bumps on their legs, that I know of. We don’t really talk about illnesses much, to be honest. We try not to dwell on it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no family history of similar skin conditions. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my blood pressure, a small one. The doctor prescribed it a few years back. It seems to be working fine, my blood pressure is always good when they check it. Other than that, no. I don't like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it. I try to stay healthy, eat good food, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, just a small pill for blood pressure. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. And I’ve never had a problem with any medication the doctor’s given me. My wife always asks the same question, just to be safe, but I always tell her the same thing – no allergies. I think I’d know if I had one, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you would. Alright, that’s helpful. Now, would you mind if I took a look at your legs?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. Please do. I’m ready when you are. I’m just hoping you can figure out what’s going on. They’re really bothering me, and I’d like to get them fixed if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the bumps you were talking about. They are erythematous – meaning red – and raised. There’s some mild warmth to the area. And they are tender to the touch, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Tender to the touch. Especially right here… …and here. Not all of them are that bad, but those ones hurt a little more. It feels like a… a bruise, almost, but not quite. It's a deeper ache, you know? It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Are they infected, Doctor? Is that what it is?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No sharp pain, more of a deeper ache. I don’t see any signs of a full-blown infection – no pus, no significant swelling, no red streaks radiating from the bumps. However, there is some inflammation. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’m seeing, it’s likely these are stasis dermatitis, also sometimes called venous stasis dermatitis. Do you have a history of swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Stasis… what did you call it? Venous stasis… sounds serious. Swelling… hmm. Sometimes, yes. After a long day at work, my ankles get a little puffy. My wife notices it more than I do. She tells me to put my feet up, and it usually goes down after a while. I figured it was just from being on my feet all day. Is that what you think it is, Doctor? That’s what’s causing these bumps?
DOCTOR: It’s a possibility. Venous stasis dermatitis happens when there’s poor circulation in your legs, often leading to fluid buildup and inflammation. The swelling you experience after work could be a contributing factor. It’s common in people with a history of varicose veins, even mild ones, or with any condition that affects circulation. To confirm, and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a simple blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any other underlying causes. I also think a venous Doppler ultrasound would be beneficial to assess the blood flow in your legs and see if there's any evidence of venous insufficiency. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood test and… a what-now? A Doppler… ultrasound? Sounds a bit complicated, Doctor. But if that’s what you think is best, then I trust you. I just want to get these bumps figured out. So, a blood test and the ultrasound… will that tell you for sure what’s going on? And will Medicare cover all that?
DOCTOR: Yes, those tests will give us a much clearer picture. The blood test will help rule out other potential causes of inflammation, and the venous Doppler ultrasound will allow us to visualize the blood flow in your legs and identify any blockages or valve dysfunction that might be contributing to the swelling and dermatitis. Regarding Medicare, yes, both tests should be covered, but we’ll need to get pre-authorization for the ultrasound just to be certain. My nurse will handle all of that for you, so you don't need to worry about that. In the meantime, to help manage the symptoms, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible, especially at the end of the day. Wearing compression stockings can also improve circulation and reduce swelling. I’ll also prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream to reduce the inflammation and itching, even though you haven’t reported itching yet, it can help calm the skin. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… reasonable. Elevate my legs, compression stockings, and a cream… I can do that. My wife will be happy to hear that, she’s always telling me to put my feet up! And you’ll handle the paperwork with Medicare? That’s good, that’s one less thing for me to worry about. So, we’ll do the blood test and the ultrasound, and then come back to see you once we have the results? Is there anything else I need to do before then?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. We’ll schedule you for the blood test and ultrasound, and then you’ll come back for a follow-up appointment once the results are available. My nurse will set that up for you before you leave. In the meantime, avoid prolonged standing or sitting if possible, and try to stay hydrated. If you notice any signs of infection – increasing redness, swelling, pus, fever – please contact the office immediately. I’m also going to give you a printed handout with information about venous stasis dermatitis and tips for managing your symptoms. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and figure out what’s going on. I’m still a little worried, but I feel a lot better knowing we’re taking steps to get it checked out. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I understand your concerns, and we’ll work together to get this under control. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your tests and go over the handout with you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Have a good day, and please take care.
