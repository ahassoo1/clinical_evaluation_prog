DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Pirl, is it? Hmm. It’s this… this waterworks situation. Been going on a while now, I suppose. I just… go to the bathroom a lot. More than I used to, anyway. It’s a nuisance, mostly. Not a serious thing, I don’t think. Just… frequent. That’s the word, isn’t it? Frequent.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination. Yes, I understand. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. Honestly, I couldn’t put a date on it. Months, I reckon. Maybe longer? Time… it slips away, you know? My wife, bless her heart, she keeps track of these things. I just notice when it gets… bothersome. It’s not painful, mind you. Just…constant. It interrupts things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be disruptive when something like this interferes with your daily life. And you said it's been months…do you notice any particular time of day it’s worse, or is it fairly consistent throughout the day and night?
PATIENT: Consistent, I think. Though… now that you mention it… …maybe a little worse at night? I get up once, sometimes twice, to… you know. Used to sleep right through, but now… not so much. It’s not a big deal, really. Old age, I suppose. Everything starts to…leak, eventually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so more noticeable at night, requiring you to get up one or two times. And you’ve noticed this has gradually increased over time. Besides the increased frequency, have you noticed any change in how you urinate?
PATIENT: Change in how…? …Well, it comes out, doesn't it? I mean, it’s not straining or anything. Not a weak stream, not that I’ve noticed. It’s… normal, I suppose. Look, I'm a farmer, I’m used to things coming out regularly. You're asking awfully specific questions, Doctor. Is this something serious?
DOCTOR: I apologize if the questions seem detailed, Mr. Segretto. I just want to gather as much information as possible to understand what’s going on. It's good to hear it's not painful and the stream seems normal. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this increased frequency?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? ...Let me see… No fever, no chills. I haven't noticed any… blood. My wife would have said something, she's very observant. I get thirsty, of course, having to go so often. Does that count? And… sometimes I feel a little… shaky. But that's probably just my age, or the weather. It's been a hot summer, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no chills, no blood in the urine. Increased thirst, and some shakiness. And you mentioned a hot summer, so we’ll keep that in mind. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Past conditions…? Hmm. Well, I had a touch of the flu a few years back. Nothing serious. And my knees… they aren't what they used to be. Arthritis, the doctor said. But that’s just old age, again. And… I had my prostate checked once, years ago. Everything was fine, they said. Honestly, I don’t remember much else. I’ve always been a pretty healthy fella.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of arthritis, and a prostate check years ago which was normal. Do you take any medications currently, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Medications… …Let me think. Just a little something for the knees, sometimes. When they’re really acting up. Ibuprofen, I think it is? Over the counter. And… that’s it. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. My wife keeps some vitamins, but I don’t bother with those. I get my nutrients from my garden. Real food, that’s what I believe in.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. And you prefer to avoid medication when possible. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Allergies? … Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve been stung by bees a few times, working in the garden, but that’s just a bit of pain. I get a little itchy sometimes, with certain plants, but that’s just a rash. Nothing serious. My wife is the one with the allergies, poor thing. Pollen, dust… everything bothers her.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick abdominal exam. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Examination? … Well, I suppose so. I don't like being poked and prodded, but… if you think it's necessary. Just… be gentle, Doctor. And don’t take too long. I've got things to do, you know. The garden doesn’t weed itself.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. If you'll just have a seat here, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Now, have you had a recent weight check?
PATIENT: Weight check? Hmm… … Not recently, no. My wife has a scale, but I haven't bothered with it. I reckon I've lost a little weight, maybe. Been too hot to eat much, and all this… running back and forth. Not that I'm complaining. A little less weight can't hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness. Do you feel any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a little tender there, actually. Right about… there. Not painful, mind you, just…sensitive. I get a bit of discomfort sometimes, after… well, after a big meal. I thought it was just indigestion.
DOCTOR: Alright, I appreciate you letting me know. Tenderness in the lower abdomen. That’s useful information. Now, I’m going to take a quick look at your prostate via a digital rectal exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will provide me with more information. We can skip this step if you'd prefer. It's entirely up to you.
PATIENT: Oh… now hold on just a minute. That part? Well, I… I’m not sure. I’ve never been too keen on… that procedure. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t you tell something just by… feeling my stomach? Honestly, Doctor, I’m an old man. Do we really need to… delve into that territory?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely, Mr. Segretto. It's a sensitive exam, and you are absolutely right to question its necessity. It's not strictly required at this stage, but it can help rule out certain causes for your symptoms, such as an enlarged prostate, which is common in men your age. However, we can proceed without it if you are uncomfortable. We could instead order a urine analysis to check for infection or other abnormalities, and potentially a PSA blood test to screen for prostate issues. Would that be a more comfortable approach for you?
PATIENT: A urine analysis and a blood test? Yes, that sounds… much more reasonable. Much less intrusive, certainly. My wife always said I should get my blood work done regularly, anyway. Yes, let’s do those tests. A urine analysis and a blood test. That’s what I’d prefer, Doctor. Thank you for understanding.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. We’ll get those tests ordered right away. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood, and I’ll provide you with a container for the urine sample. Once we have the results, we can discuss them further and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, please try to drink plenty of fluids and avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate your bladder. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… get those tests done, and hopefully we can figure out what’s causing all this… running back and forth. I appreciate your patience, and for not… delving into that territory. Thank you, Doctor Pirl.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Segretto. It was my pleasure. The nurse will be with you shortly. If you experience any fever, chills, or significant pain in your abdomen or back, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic or go to the nearest emergency room. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again to discuss your results. .
