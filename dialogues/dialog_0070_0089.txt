DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… lovely to meet you as well. Oh dear, where to begin? Well, it's my stomach, mostly. I’ve been having these… episodes. Quite severe pain, low down. It comes and goes, you see. It’s been… a while now. I believe it's related to… something the other doctors mentioned years ago? Lupus, was it? I'm terribly sorry, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Glymph, it's quite alright. Memory can be tricky. Lupus is a possibility, and we will certainly explore that further. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me think… well, they start rather suddenly. A cramping, a twisting… it feels very deep inside. And then it just… builds. It's quite debilitating, actually. I usually have to lie down. And… sometimes, I feel a bit nauseous. Not always, though. It doesn't last terribly long, thankfully – usually a few hours, perhaps? But it's frightening when it happens. I haven't been able to pinpoint anything that causes it, if that makes sense. It just… comes on. I've tried taking some over-the-counter remedies, but they haven't been much help.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, sudden onset of cramping, twisting pain low in your abdomen, lasting a few hours, sometimes with nausea, and not consistently related to anything you've noticed. And over-the-counter medications haven’t provided much relief. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the location of the pain a bit more precisely?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Precisely… that’s always been my trouble. It’s… lower down, certainly. Around my… well, my lower abdomen, I suppose. It’s not exactly in the middle, more to the… left side, perhaps? Though sometimes it feels… spread out. It's difficult to pinpoint. I suppose it’s… all down there. I wish I could be more specific, Doctor. I truly do. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… deep ache that builds into a cramping sensation.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. It sounds like it's localized to the lower abdomen, somewhat more on the left side, but can be more generalized. A deep ache building to cramping is very helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… oh dear. Well, not drastically, I don’t believe. Perhaps a little… looser, on occasion? But nothing terribly concerning. I haven't had… any blood, thankfully. And the frequency hasn’t changed much either. I haven’t been feeling… constipated, or anything of that nature. It's just… a little different, sometimes. I suppose I haven’t been eating as well lately, either. It’s hard to have an appetite when you’re worried about your stomach hurting, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, somewhat looser stools on occasion, but no blood, no significant change in frequency, and you’ve noticed a decreased appetite. That gives me a bit more information. Now, to get a broader understanding, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides the lupus you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the lupus. It was… many years ago now. I remember a rheumatologist… Dr. Eldridge, I think her name was. She mentioned something about my immune system attacking itself. Aside from that… let me see. I had my gallbladder removed, oh, goodness, nearly twenty years ago. And I have a bit of arthritis, mostly in my hands. It’s not terribly severe, just a little stiffness in the mornings. And… I think that’s it. I've been generally healthy, all things considered. Although, I do get… rather fatigued easily. But I always assumed that was just… getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of lupus diagnosed by Dr. Eldridge, gallbladder removal nearly twenty years ago, and some arthritis, primarily in your hands. You also mention fatigue. That's helpful. Has the lupus been actively treated recently, or is it currently in remission?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a good question. Remission… yes, I believe that's the word. Dr. Eldridge said it was… under control. I haven’t seen a rheumatologist in… well, a very long time. Probably over fifteen years, I would imagine. I haven’t needed to, you see. I felt… fine. Until these stomach pains started. I was taking some medication for it at one point… Plaquenil, I think it was called. But I stopped taking it, years ago. She said I could, once I was stable. I haven’t really… followed up since. I suppose that was foolish of me.
DOCTOR: It’s not foolish at all, Ms. Glymph. Life happens, and it's common for follow-up to lapse. It's good you were stable for a long time. And now that you're experiencing these new symptoms, it's wise to revisit everything. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. Not to food, no. I eat most things. And I don’t believe I’m allergic to any medications… although, I did have a bit of a reaction to penicillin many years ago. Just a rash, nothing serious. But I’ve avoided it ever since. And… no, nothing else comes to mind. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. I don’t have any sensitivities to… latex, or anything like that. Just the penicillin, I suppose. A very minor allergy, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild rash with penicillin in the past, otherwise no known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I take a multivitamin, every day. And sometimes, when my arthritis is acting up, I take some ibuprofen. But that’s it, really. I don’t take any… regular prescription medications, aside from the ibuprofen when needed. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you see. And I don’t take any herbal supplements, or anything like that. Just the multivitamin and the occasional ibuprofen. That’s all. I hope that’s not too much.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly fine, Ms. Glymph. Multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to perform a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and gently press on it to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. I trust your judgment entirely. Please, do whatever you think is best. I just want to find out what’s causing these pains. And hopefully, get some relief. I am a bit worried, you see. But I feel… much better having spoken with you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you feel that way. Alright, Ms. Glymph, if you could lie back on the examination table, please. We'll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm listening for bowel sounds now. They seem… a bit normal, although slightly diminished. Now I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for tenderness. I'll start lightly and gradually increase the pressure. Please tell me if you feel any pain at any point. I’ll begin in the upper right quadrant. Okay. There’s some mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant, Ms. Glymph, but no significant guarding or rigidity. No rebound tenderness noted. The rest of the abdomen feels relatively soft, but there is some diffuse discomfort on deep palpation.
PATIENT: Oh… that did feel a little tender, yes. Just in that lower left area. But it wasn't… excruciating, Doctor. More of a… dull ache, like the pain I’ve been experiencing. The rest felt… alright, I suppose. A little uncomfortable, but nothing I haven’t felt before. You’re very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. It’s reassuring to know you’re taking everything seriously. What does that mean, Doctor? About the tenderness? Is it… something serious?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know it's consistent with the pain you've been describing. And yes, I always want to be thorough. The tenderness in the lower left quadrant is a bit concerning, but it's not necessarily indicative of anything serious. It could be related to several things, including muscular strain, irritable bowel syndrome, or diverticulitis, especially given your age. It's also possible it's related to your history of lupus, although less likely given the long period of remission. To help narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to order a few blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an inflammatory marker called a C-reactive protein. We may also want to consider a stool test to rule out any infection. Depending on the results of these tests, we may also need to consider a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a more detailed look at your organs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A CT scan… that sounds… quite involved. But if it's necessary, Doctor, then I suppose so. I trust your judgment. Blood tests are fine, of course. I’ve had those before. And the stool test… well, it's not the most pleasant thing, but if it helps, then I'll do it. Is the CT scan… painful? And will it take long? I just… I worry about radiation, you see. I’ve read things… I just want to feel better, Doctor. And I’m a little anxious about all these tests. Is it likely to be something serious?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Ms. Glymph, and your concerns about radiation. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. The CT scan itself is not painful at all. You'll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. The technician will be in another room, and we’ll communicate through an intercom. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. Regarding radiation, modern CT scanners use very low doses of radiation, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. We take every precaution to minimize your exposure. As for whether it's likely to be something serious, it's too early to say. That’s why we need to run these tests. These tests will give us a better picture of what's going on and help us determine the best course of treatment. It could be something relatively minor, like a flare-up of IBS, or it could be something more serious, like diverticulitis or, less likely, something related to your lupus. We’ll start with the blood tests and stool test. I'll give you the requisitions now, and you can go to the lab whenever it's convenient for you. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and decide whether a CT scan is necessary. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better, Doctor. To start with the simpler tests. And then we’ll see. I appreciate your patience with me. I do worry easily, you see. And yes, please, the requisitions. I’ll go to the lab as soon as I can. Is there anything special I need to do to prepare? Fasting? Anything like that? I want to make sure I do everything correctly.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Ms. Glymph. It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have. For the blood tests, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water. For the stool test, I’ll give you a collection kit and instructions. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully to ensure accurate results. Here are the requisitions for the blood tests, and here’s the kit for the stool test. The lab technicians will guide you through the process. Do you have any questions about the instructions or the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. Fasting… alright, I can do that. And I’ll read the instructions carefully for the… collection kit. It doesn’t sound terribly appealing, but if it helps… I think I understand. No, I don't think I have any questions at the moment. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I suppose I’ll just go to the lab and get it done. And then we’ll wait for the results. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I feel… a little better already, just knowing what we’re going to do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I'm glad I could ease your mind a bit. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns after you leave. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results, usually within a few days. In the meantime, try to relax and take care of yourself. It was a pleasure meeting you. I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I appreciate it more than you know.
