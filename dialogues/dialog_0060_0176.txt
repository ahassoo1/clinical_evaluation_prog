DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just… won’t stop. It’s been going on for two days now, at least. It’s quite annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Two days, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, since Monday, I think. It started… hmm, let me think… after I had a rather large glass of iced tea with my lunch at the diner. It was a really hot day, you see. I usually don't drink things that cold.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything else happened alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I mean, I’ve felt a little… bloated, maybe? But I eat a lot, you know? I manage the entertainment at the community center, so I’m always tasting things, trying new recipes for events. It’s part of the job. But nothing different than usual, if that makes sense. Just… the hiccups. And the slight fullness.
DOCTOR: So, no nausea, vomiting, heartburn, or any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No sickness at all, thankfully. And swallowing is fine. It's just… hic… these little jerks keep happening. It’s exhausting, honestly. hic It's starting to give me a headache.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was ages ago and no trouble since. I usually stay pretty healthy, if I can help it. I used to dance, you know? Still try to walk every day, but it’s hard with the work. hic Oh, and I had a bad fall a few years back, twisted my ankle, but that healed up fine too. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Never been much of a pill-taker, if I can avoid it. And no allergies that I know of. I've had a few mosquito bites this summer, but that's about it. hic Nothing serious. I usually just put some cream on them.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a listen to your lungs and abdomen, just to rule things out. Then we can talk about some things you can try at home. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. hic I’m just hoping you can help me get rid of these things! It’s… embarrassing, really, when I’m trying to run events.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could just lie down for me, that would be great. I'm going to listen with my stethoscope first. Take a nice, deep breath… and exhale.
PATIENT: Okay, here we go. inhales deeply… exhales slowly hic Sorry about that one.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lungs sound clear. Abdomen is… a little tender, but nothing alarming. No masses or anything like that. verbalizing for documentation “Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen soft, mildly tender to palpation in the epigastric region, no rebound or guarding. No palpable masses.” I pause, looking at her. How about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… hmm. My mother had some trouble with her stomach, always complaining of indigestion. But she lived to be eighty-five, so it couldn’t have been too serious. My father was healthy as a horse, worked in the fields his whole life. And my brother… he has high blood pressure, I think. Nothing much else comes to mind, really. hic Sorry if that’s not very helpful.
DOCTOR: No, that’s fine. It’s helpful to know. And just to clarify, you said you were tasting a lot of new recipes for events?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I’m trying to come up with a theme for the summer festival, and I've been experimenting with different flavors. Lots of spices, different kinds of sauces… I made a really spicy chili yesterday, maybe that had something to do with it? hic It was quite hot, even for me. I even had a little heartburn later, but it went away quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like these hiccups are likely related to something irritating your esophagus, possibly the spicy foods. It’s probably just a temporary irritation. I'm going to recommend a few things. First, avoid spicy foods for a few days. Second, try drinking some water slowly, sipping it throughout the day. Third, there are a few over-the-counter remedies you can try, like simethicone, for the bloating. verbalizing for documentation “Recommend dietary modifications, hydration, and OTC simethicone for symptomatic relief.”
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. No spicy food for a few days. I can do that. I do enjoy it, but I can make do. hic Water is easy enough. And simethicone… what does that do exactly? Is it one of those things I need a prescription for? hic I just want to be sure.
DOCTOR: No, it's not something you need a prescription for. It’s an over-the-counter medication that helps relieve gas and bloating. It won’t directly stop the hiccups, but it can help with the discomfort. You can find it at any pharmacy, usually in the digestive aid section. I pause, looking at her expectantly. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, gas and bloating… that makes sense. I have been feeling a little full, so maybe that will help. hic Pharmacy… right. I go to the one down on Main Street. hic No, I think I understand. So, just avoid spicy food, drink water, and try the simethicone if I need it. And if it doesn't get better…?
DOCTOR: If it doesn’t get better after a week, or if you develop any other symptoms, like trouble breathing, chest pain, or persistent vomiting, then you should see me again, or go to the emergency room. But honestly, it’s probably just a temporary irritation. I close the chart. Any other concerns today, Ivette?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. hic I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for not making me feel silly about these hiccups. It's just… annoying. hic I hope I can get them under control. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, try those things, and hopefully you’ll be feeling better soon. verbalizing for documentation “Patient instructed on dietary modifications, hydration, and OTC simethicone. Advised to return if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.” Have a good day, Ivette.
