DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get this over with. I need a… a permission slip, for somethin' the… the nice folks at Rejuvenate MedSpa want. Said I gotta see a real doctor first. Cosmetic… procedure, they call it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A note for Rejuvenate MedSpa. No problem at all, happy to help with that. Just so I can get a good picture of things, could you tell me a bit more about what procedure you’re looking to have done?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't rightly remember all the details. They showed me pictures, fancy brochures… somethin' about… liftin' and tighten' and… well, makin' me look younger. It’s on my face, naturally. A man my age… things droop, you know? I just want it done and over with. Don’t need a lecture on gettin' old.
DOCTOR: I certainly won't lecture you on getting older, Mr. Honcoop. It happens to the best of us! It's good you're thinking about what's important to you. So, it sounds like you’re interested in a facial rejuvenation procedure. Do you recall where on your face you’re hoping to have this done?
PATIENT: Everywhere, Doctor. Everywhere. Look at me! The cheeks… the jawline… the… the bits around the eyes. It’s all saggin’. They showed me a before-and-after, and it looked… acceptable. I’m not askin' for a miracle, just… tightened. Is that so much to ask? And quickly, if you please. I got appointments.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a more comprehensive facial rejuvenation. That gives me a better idea. Before I write a note, just to be thorough – and to make sure we’re on the same page – have you had any similar procedures done in the past?
PATIENT: Similar procedures? Heavens, no! I ain’t one of them… vain types. This is my first rodeo, Doctor. Never had nothin' done to my face before. Though… Mabel down the street, she had somethin' done a few years back. Looked like a wax figure, if you ask me. But I just want a little… fixin’. Not a whole new face.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know this is your first procedure. And I understand you're looking for a natural result, not a dramatic change. Just a little "fixin’" as you put it. Now, I just need to ask a few routine questions, just to be sure everything is safe. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me see. Dust, probably. And sometimes my skin gets itchy when I use that cheap soap my niece sends me. But real allergies? No, nothin' serious. Never had a reaction to nothin'… that I recall. Honestly, Doctor, is this necessary? I just need a signature.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop, and I do want to get this done quickly for you. But these questions are important to make sure you’re a good candidate for the procedure and to minimize any risks. It’s a standard part of the process. Okay, next question. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness, no. I try to stay away from all that stuff. Makes you feel… sluggish. Maybe a little aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. And vitamins… I used to take somethin' for my joints, but that was years ago. I can't even remember what it was called. Really, Doctor, I'm a perfectly healthy man for my age. Can we get on with it?
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. That’s good to know. Now, just a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever had any serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses? Oh, boy. Let me think… I had the flu a few times, I suppose. And I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbin’ a tree. But nothin’ serious. No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothin' like that. I was a strong young man. I used to work with wires, you know. Real physical work. Kept me healthy. I don’t see what any of this has to do with liftin’ my face.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical issues or surgeries. That's helpful. Now, just one more section, and then we can move on to the physical exam. Do you have any family history of significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Family history… Lord. My mama lived to be eighty-somethin’, but she mostly complained about her arthritis. My daddy… well, he worked himself to the bone, and died of… exhaustion, I guess. And my sister… she had somethin’ with her stomach, but I don’t rightly remember what. We weren't close. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t keep track of all that family nonsense. It just brings up bad memories. Can we please move along? I’m startin’ to feel faint.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, and I appreciate you answering my questions. It's good to have some general idea of your medical background. Now, just to be thorough, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and just take a look at the areas of your face you're concerned about. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And don’t poke and prod too much. I don’t like bein' touched. Get on with it. The sooner this is over, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a quick check. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 158 over 92. We can keep an eye on that. Your pulse is 78 beats per minute and regular. Okay, looking at your face, I see some moderate skin laxity in the cheeks and jawline, and some wrinkles around the eyes and forehead, as you mentioned. Your skin appears generally healthy, but there is some dryness. Okay, that’s all I needed. Before I write the note for Rejuvenate MedSpa, I do want to mention that because your blood pressure is elevated, it might be a good idea to have it checked by your primary care physician. Elevated blood pressure can sometimes affect the results of cosmetic procedures. But, it doesn’t necessarily prevent you from having it done. It's just something to consider. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Blood pressure, shmood pressure. I've had high blood pressure my whole life. Never bothered me none. My mama had it too, lived to be eighty-somethin', didn't she? Listen, Doctor, I just want the note. I ain't lookin' for a lecture on my health. I got things to do. Write it down, and let's be done with this. I got an appointment to keep.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I understand. I’m happy to write the note for Rejuvenate MedSpa authorizing you for a facial rejuvenation procedure. However, I want to document that I’ve advised you that your blood pressure is elevated and recommend you follow up with your primary care physician. Here you go. This note authorizes you for a facial rejuvenation procedure, with the caveat that your blood pressure is elevated and you should consult with your primary care doctor. I’ve also documented the dryness of your skin. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Nope. That’s it. Thank you, Doctor. Finally. Don’t expect a Christmas card. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Honcoop. Have a good day, and please do consider following up with your primary care physician regarding your blood pressure. .
