DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… something about a check-up? For… work. Yes, work. They said I needed a… clearance. For acting, I think. It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. Been a long time since I worried about… well, anything, really. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Okay, a work clearance for acting. That’s perfectly alright. We can definitely do that. It sounds like your employer has some requirements for a physical exam. It shouldn't take too long, but we’ll want to get a good overview of your health to make sure you’re fit for the demands of the work. Just to clarify, is this a new acting job, or have you been acting previously?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. New job, I think. Yes, that’s right. New. It’s… been a while since I did much of anything strenuous, to be honest. Mostly just… ushering, you know? At the theatre. Lobby stuff. Tickets. Not much lifting involved. Before that… well, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I really couldn’t say how long ago that was. Is… is this about whether I’m strong enough? Because I can still… manage. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. We’re not just looking at strength, though that’s part of it. We want to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, reflexes – the basics, really. And it's good you mentioned the ushering job, that gives me a sense of your current activity level. Before we get to the physical exam, let’s go through a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been seeing a regular doctor recently?
PATIENT: A regular doctor… No, not really. Not for… a long time. Honestly, I haven’t been to a doctor unless something was really wrong. And even then… I just tried to tough it out, usually. My ex-wife… she always handled all that sort of thing. She was very organized. I'm afraid I don't remember the last time I had a check-up. Is that bad? I take some… something for my knees, sometimes. They ache, you know? But I get it over the counter. Just… ibuprofen, I think. Or something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. Many people don't see a doctor regularly until they need to. We’ll just start from scratch then. The occasional ibuprofen for knee pain is good to know. We’ll talk more about that in a bit. First, let's go over any major medical problems you have had in the past. Have you ever been diagnosed with things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or any other serious illness?
PATIENT: Serious illness… hmm. Let me think. My father… he had something with his heart, I think. But I don't think I ever had anything like that. I had the flu a couple of times, of course. And a bad cold last winter. Nothing… major. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. But that healed fine. My ex-wife… she used to say I had high cholesterol. But I never really paid much attention to it. She liked to worry. I don't remember a doctor ever saying anything serious was wrong with me, if that makes sense. Does that help? It’s all very hazy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Mr. Krahn. It sounds like you’ve been generally healthy, aside from the occasional illness. Family history of heart problems is good to know, and we can certainly discuss your cholesterol levels later. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… oh, dear. Let me see… I think… yes. When I was young, I had my tonsils out. A very long time ago. And… I think I had a small operation on my knee, years and years ago. Something about cartilage, I think. But honestly, it was so long ago I barely remember it. It didn’t seem very serious at the time. And that’s… I think that’s it. No major surgeries, as far as I can recall. My memory is just… terrible. Is it okay if I pause for a moment? My head feels a little… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krahn. Take your time. It’s perfectly alright to pause whenever you need to. It’s more important to be accurate than to rush. We can always come back to these questions later if you need to. You mentioned your knees bothering you. Besides the over-the-counter medication, do you experience any specific symptoms with your knee pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The knees. They ache, mostly. Especially when it’s cold, or damp. And… after I’ve been standing for a long time. Like at the theatre. Sometimes they feel… stiff, you know? And a little… creaky. Not sharp pain, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. It's worse in the mornings, usually. And… sometimes they feel like they're going to give out. But that doesn't happen often. I try to ignore it. It's just… old age, I suppose. I haven't told anyone about it much. My ex-wife… she would have insisted I see a specialist. But I just… manage. Is that enough information? I'm afraid I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Krahn. "Achy, stiff, creaky, worse with cold and standing, occasionally feeling like they’ll give out" – that gives me a good understanding. It does sound like it would be worth getting it checked out, but we can discuss that further after the physical exam. Now, just to finish up with your medical history, are you currently taking any other medications besides the over-the-counter pain relief?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don't think so. Not that I can recall. Oh! Wait. There was something… The doctor gave me some pills for my… sleep, a few years ago. I didn't like them. They made me feel… strange. So I stopped taking them. And… I think that's it. No, definitely no regular medications. I try to avoid them, if I can. My ex-wife… she was always taking something. But I prefer to just… tough it out. Is that okay? I'm really trying to remember, but my head is… swimming a little.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. It's good you let me know about the sleep medication, even though you stopped taking it. We'll make a note of that. Okay, so we've covered quite a bit of your medical history. Now, let's move on to some lifestyle questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never smoked. Never even tried it. My ex-wife… she used to get very upset with people who smoked. Said it was terrible for your health. I always agreed with her. No, definitely not a smoker. And… I don't drink much alcohol either. A glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. But that's it. Nothing heavy. Is that okay? I'm afraid I'm rambling a bit. This is all a bit… much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's great to hear, Mr. Krahn. No smoking and minimal alcohol consumption are both very good for your health. It's perfectly alright if you're feeling a bit overwhelmed. We'll take it one step at a time. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, I don't think so. I've never had a serious allergic reaction to anything. Sometimes I get a little… itchy, when I'm around cats. But that's just a mild irritation. Nothing serious. And… no, I haven't noticed any allergies to food. I eat pretty much anything. My ex-wife… she was very careful about what she ate. But I don't have any dietary restrictions. Is that enough information? I'm afraid my mind is… blanking a bit. This is all so… long ago.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Krahn. No known allergies is helpful. A mild itchiness around cats is good to note, but doesn't sound like a serious allergy. Okay, so we've covered a lot of ground with your history. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, is there anything you're particularly concerned about or would like me to focus on today?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, if I’m honest, Doctor… I worry about my balance. It’s been… off, lately. Not terrible, but… I stumble sometimes. Especially when I’m tired. And… my memory, of course. It’s been getting worse. But I don’t know if that’s something a doctor can even do anything about. Mostly, I just… try to be careful. And I suppose I worry about my knees, too. They ache a lot. But I don’t want to make a fuss. I just want to be sure I'm still fit enough to… well, to keep working. That’s all. Is that too much to ask? I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Krahn, that's not too much to ask at all. Your concerns about balance, memory, and knees are all very valid, and we'll definitely address them today. Balance issues and memory problems are things we should investigate. And we can certainly discuss options for managing your knee pain. That’s what I’m here for. Now, let’s move on to the physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Then, I’ll do a quick neurological exam to assess your reflexes and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… as long as it’s not too uncomfortable. I’m not very good with… poking and prodding. But… I’ll try. Just… please be gentle? And… if I start to feel a little faint, please let me know. I’m afraid I get a bit… nervous with doctors. Is it okay if I close my eyes?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krahn. We'll take it slow and steady, and I'll be as gentle as possible. Please do close your eyes if that makes you more comfortable. And please, let me know immediately if you feel faint or uncomfortable at any point. I’ll explain everything as I go along. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds a little… irregular, Mr. Krahn. Nothing alarming at this point, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. We’ll check that again later. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Can you just relax your arms at your sides?
PATIENT: Okay… relaxing. Trying to relax. My heart… irregular? That doesn’t sound good. But… I suppose I’m not getting any younger. And… my blood pressure? Is that very bad? I always felt a bit… stressed, I suppose. Especially with my ex-wife… she was always worrying about something. Reflexes… alright. Just tell me what to do. Trying to stay calm. This is… a bit much. Are you sure everything is alright? My head feels a little… swimmy. Is it okay if I sit up for a moment?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Mr. Krahn. Please sit up. It's perfectly alright to take a break. You're doing great. Your head feeling swimmy is concerning, and we should take it slow. The slightly irregular heartbeat and elevated blood pressure aren’t ideal, but not necessarily an emergency on their own. However, combined with the feeling of dizziness, we need to investigate further. Let's just take a few deep breaths together. Now, I’m going to check your ears, nose, and throat. This will just take a moment. Then, we'll do a quick balance test to see if we can pinpoint what's going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… deep breaths. Trying to breathe. That helps a little. Ears, nose, and throat… alright. As long as it’s gentle. And… quick. I don’t want to make a fuss. This is all a bit… overwhelming. I feel a bit… shaky. Are you sure everything is alright? I’m not usually like this. I just… get nervous with doctors. And… a balance test? Is that going to be difficult? I’m afraid I might fall. Please be careful. And… if I start to feel faint again, please let me know. I’m really trying to cooperate, but… I’m just not very good with… medical things.
DOCTOR: You’re doing wonderfully, Mr. Krahn. And I completely understand your nervousness. We will take things very slowly, and I will be right here with you every step of the way. I’ll hold your arm for support during the balance test, and we’ll do it close to the chair so you have something to hold onto. Let’s start with your ears, nose, and throat. This will just involve shining a light and looking inside. Everything looks normal in your ears, nose, and throat. Now, let’s try the balance test. Just stand up slowly, and I’ll be right here to support you. We’ll start with just standing with your feet together and your eyes open. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay… standing slowly. Feet together… eyes open. That’s… alright. A little wobbly. But… I can manage. As long as you’re here. Please hold my arm. I’m afraid I might fall. And… if I start to feel faint again, please let me know. This is… a bit scary. I’m not very good with… balance. And… I feel a little… dizzy. Is that normal? Should I close my eyes? Please be careful. I don’t want to make a fuss. I just… want to be sure I’m still fit enough to work.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Mr. Krahn. It's perfectly alright to feel a little dizzy. That's actually quite common with balance issues. Just focus on a point in front of you. I'm right here, and you’re very secure. Okay, you’re swaying a bit, and your balance isn’t quite as steady as it should be. Let’s try closing your eyes for just a few seconds. This will help us assess if the issue is with your vision or your inner ear. Are you comfortable trying that?
PATIENT: Closing my eyes… hmm. That sounds… scary. But… alright. If you think it will help. Just… please hold my arm very firmly. And… let me know if I start to sway too much. I’m afraid I might fall. And… if I start to feel faint again, please let me know. This is… very overwhelming. I feel a little… shaky. And… my heart is racing. Is everything alright? I’m not very good with… medical things. And… I feel a little… nauseous. Please be careful. I just… want to be sure I’m still fit enough to work. And… I feel a little… dizzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krahn, that’s enough for now. Let’s sit down. You’re experiencing several symptoms – dizziness, racing heart, shakiness, nausea – and it's best to take a moment to rest. Your blood pressure has increased further, and your heart is still racing. I’m concerned about your symptoms, and I think it’s best to be cautious. I’m going to call for an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and I’d like to get a blood test to rule out any other underlying issues. I also want to discuss the possibility of referring you to a cardiologist for a more thorough evaluation. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: EKG… cardiologist… hmm. That sounds… serious. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I just… want to be sure I’m still fit enough to work. I don’t want to make a fuss. But… I’m starting to feel a little… scared. I don’t want to be a burden. And… I feel a little… nauseous. Please be careful. And… if I start to feel faint again, please let me know. Is everything alright? I’m not very good with… medical things. And… I feel a little… dizzy. And… my heart is racing. Please be careful. And… I feel a little… nauseous. And… my head is swimming. Please be careful. And… I feel a little… scared. And… I just… want to be sure I’m still fit enough to work.
DOCTOR: You’re not a burden at all, Mr. Krahn. And it's perfectly alright to be scared. We are taking these precautions to make sure you are safe and healthy. I'm going to call for the EKG and blood tests right away. In the meantime, I'm going to get you a cool compress for your forehead and a glass of water. I’ll also have the nurse come in to monitor your vital signs. Nurse, can you please come in and assist Mr. Krahn?
PATIENT: Okay… cool compress… water… alright. Just… please be careful. And… if I start to feel faint again, please let me know. I’m afraid I might fall. And… my heart is racing. I just… want to be sure I’m still fit enough to work. I don’t want to make a fuss. I just… want to be sure I’m still fit enough to work. And… I feel a little… dizzy. And… my head is swimming. Please be careful. And… I feel a little… scared. And… I just… want to be sure I’m still fit enough to work. I don’t want to make a fuss. I just… want to be sure I’m still fit enough to work. And… I feel a little… dizzy. And… my head is swimming. Please be careful. And… I feel a little… scared. And… I just… want to be sure I’m still fit enough to work.
DOCTOR: We will figure this out, Mr. Krahn. I promise. We’re going to take things one step at a time, and we’ll make sure you get the care you need. Please try to relax, and let the nurse know if you feel any worse. I’ll be right back as soon as I’ve spoken with the nurse and arranged the tests. .
