DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun. So, tell me… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Batara. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I requested a general wellness panel, if you recall. Just wanted to get a good overview of how things are holding up, you know? At my age, one likes to be… proactive. I believe the results came back recently?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the “proactive” types. It’s… common. The results did come back. And frankly, Mr. Mombrun, there are a few things we need to discuss. Let’s not waste time with pleasantries, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I appreciate your directness. Though I must confess, I wasn’t expecting… concern. What specifically has caught your attention? I do try to keep myself quite active, you see. Working construction keeps a man busy. Perhaps that’s influencing the results in some way?
DOCTOR: “Active.” Right. Well, Mr. Mombrun, your cholesterol is… elevated. Significantly. And your blood pressure is creeping up there as well. Construction work doesn’t explain that. It exacerbates it, perhaps. Have you been experiencing any… symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… not that I’ve consciously noticed, Doctor. A bit of fatigue sometimes, after a long day, naturally. But I attribute that to the physical exertion. Perhaps a little shortness of breath when I'm climbing the scaffolding, but again, that's to be expected, isn't it? I wouldn’t call it troubling. Do you mean something… specific I should be looking for? Like chest pain or dizziness? Perhaps you could elaborate?
DOCTOR: “A little” shortness of breath is enough to mention, Mr. Mombrun. And fatigue… well, everyone is fatigued these days. But your lipid panel is concerning enough that we need to investigate further. Have you ever been diagnosed with high cholesterol before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve had regular check-ups over the years, of course, but this is the first time anyone has mentioned anything about my cholesterol being… elevated. I’ve always considered myself quite healthy, all things considered. Is it something I should be very concerned about? I understand you’re the medical professional, so please don't hesitate to be frank. My wife will want to know, naturally, and I'd prefer to be well-informed.
DOCTOR: "Quite healthy" and having a cholesterol level this high are… mutually exclusive concepts, Mr. Mombrun. It’s not an immediate emergency, but it is a significant risk factor for heart disease. We need to rule out secondary causes – things like thyroid issues or kidney problems. And frankly, lifestyle modifications – diet, exercise – probably aren't going to be enough. I'm going to order some further blood work – a full lipid panel, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. And I'll want to schedule a stress test, just to be on the safe side. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. No allergies that I’m aware of, thankfully. Not to medications, foods, or anything of that nature. I've always been rather… robust, constitutionally speaking. A stress test, though… that sounds a bit more serious. Is that something I should be worried about? What does that involve exactly? I confess, the thought of it is a little unsettling. Also, my insurance… it is private, thankfully. Will these tests be covered?
DOCTOR: “Robust” doesn’t negate the risk, Mr. Mombrun. A stress test simply monitors your heart's activity while you exercise. It’s a standard procedure. As for your insurance, that’s between you and them. We’ll submit the claims, naturally, but I don’t manage billing. Now, before we continue, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not currently. I’ve always avoided medication whenever possible. Prefer a more… natural approach, you see. Just a bit of ibuprofen occasionally for aches and pains after a particularly strenuous day. But nothing regular, nothing prescribed. I suppose that's good news, at least? It eliminates one potential complicating factor, yes? Also, before you move on, is there anything you require from me? Any further questions that would be helpful for these tests? I'd like to be as prepared as possible.
DOCTOR: “Natural approach” is irrelevant when your arteries are starting to clog, Mr. Mombrun. And ibuprofen, while seemingly innocuous, can affect kidney function, which is why I asked. Do you have any family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. You’re quite right. I apologize if I sounded… dismissive. I simply meant I haven’t actively sought medication. As for family history… my father, he had… some heart issues later in life. Not a diagnosis, exactly. Just… weakness and shortness of breath. He was a farmer, quite a physical job. He didn’t seek treatment until it was rather late, I’m afraid. My mother, she had high blood pressure, I believe, towards the end of her life as well. Is that relevant? And is it possible these tests will involve any… discomfort? I'm not particularly fond of needles.
DOCTOR: "Some heart issues" and "high blood pressure" are still relevant, Mr. Mombrun, even without a formal diagnosis. It suggests a genetic predisposition. And yes, the blood work will involve needles. A standard venipuncture – it’s a brief discomfort. We’ll need a fairly substantial sample for all the panels. Now, before we order anything, have you ever had any surgeries or serious illnesses beyond what you've mentioned?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing significant. I broke my arm when I was a boy, a rather clumsy fall from a tree. And I had a bout of pneumonia many years ago, but that resolved completely. Otherwise, I’ve been remarkably… fortunate, health-wise. Considering my profession, it’s somewhat surprising, I admit. Are we certain these tests are absolutely necessary? Perhaps we could… monitor things for a while first, see if they improve with… lifestyle changes? Although, I understand your concern, given the family history. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. And regarding the venipuncture... is there anything I can do to make it easier? I'm not a complete coward, Doctor, but I do dislike needles. Perhaps looking away? Or a cold compress beforehand?
DOCTOR: “Remarkably fortunate” and having elevated cholesterol doesn’t quite align, Mr. Mombrun. And monitoring things “for a while” is precisely how people end up with heart attacks. We’re ordering the tests. Looking away won't change the fact that we need a sample. And a cold compress… will provide minimal benefit. Try to relax. Our phlebotomist is quite skilled. Now, let's get you scheduled for these tests. We'll need a fasting lipid panel, so you'll need to abstain from food for 12 hours beforehand. Do you understand those instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Fasting for 12 hours. A skilled phlebotomist. I’ll… endeavor to relax. And I appreciate you explaining everything, even if I’m… not entirely pleased with the situation. Very well. Let’s proceed with the scheduling, then. What’s the best day for these tests? And how long will they take, approximately? Also, how will I receive the results? Through you, I presume? Or is there a separate portal I need to access? I’m rather… technologically challenged, I must confess.
DOCTOR: We have availability on Thursday morning, at 8:00 AM. It should take about an hour, including the waiting period. The results will be sent to me, and I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We do have a patient portal, but given your… challenges, I'll just go over them with you personally. Now, is there anything else I need to know?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. Thursday morning at 8:00 AM. I’ll make sure to abstain from food. And I appreciate your patience with my… inquiries. I simply like to be informed, you see. It helps me… manage my anxiety. Is there anything you require from me before Thursday? Any paperwork I need to complete? Or specific clothing I should wear? I'll also remind my wife, so she can ensure I adhere to the fasting requirements. I hope these tests don't reveal anything too… alarming. Thank you, Doctor Batara. I look forward to our follow-up appointment.
DOCTOR: Just arrive on time, and don't eat anything before. That is all. Good day, Mr. Mombrun.
