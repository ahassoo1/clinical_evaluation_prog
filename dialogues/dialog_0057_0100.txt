DOCTOR: Good morning, Lytisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Let me see… right. Well, they told me something about a… a check-up? Something to do with making sure I'm alright. Honestly, my memory ain't what it used to be. It’s about… a test, I think? For… stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, a general check-up. That’s perfectly alright. It sounds like Medicare scheduled a preventative visit for you, which is excellent. Those are important. And don’t worry about your memory; it's very common as we get older. We’ll take things at your pace. To start, could you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Hmm… Well, I work, you know? Out on the road, with the… the paving machines. Keeps me busy. I get tired, of course. That’s just… life, I guess. And sometimes my back aches somethin’ awful after a long day. But that's just the job, right? I don’t… I don’t really feel sick, if that makes sense. Just… worn out.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. It sounds like you’re a very hard worker, and it’s not surprising you’d feel tired and have back pain with that kind of job. We definitely want to address both of those things. Let's talk a bit more about the back pain. Can you tell me where exactly it hurts?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s mostly… lower down, you know? Right in my lower back. Sometimes it shoots down my legs a little bit, but mostly it’s just a dull ache. It’s worse at the end of the day, naturally. And if I try to lift something… well, forget about it. That’s when it really hurts. It’s been going on… oh, goodness, I don’t even know how long. Years, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain that sometimes radiates down your legs, worse at the end of the day and with lifting. Years of pain… Alright. And would you say it's a constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. There are some days it's barely noticeable, just a little stiffness. But other days… other days I can hardly move. It depends on what I've been doin’, I suppose. And the weather, maybe? My joints get achey when it’s cold and damp. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very normal, Lytisha. Joint pain often does worsen with changes in the weather. It sounds like you've been dealing with this for a long time, and it’s good you’re finally getting it checked out. Now, just to get a full picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about other areas of your health. Have you been having any trouble with your breathing, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, not really. Sometimes I get a little… winded, you know, after a long day. But that’s just from the work, I think. And maybe a little shortness of breath when it’s real hot out. But nothing… serious. Breathing… no, I haven't had any trouble breathing that wasn’t explained by workin’ in the sun. Though… now that you mention it, sometimes I cough a bit in the mornings. But it’s just a little tickle, nothin’ to worry about, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, some shortness of breath with exertion and a morning cough. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, how about your digestive system?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let’s just say workin’ on the road ain’t always kind to your stomach. I get a little… irregular, sometimes. And heartburn now and then. But I just take some… something over the counter, you know? Those little pink tablets. Seems to help. But it’s nothing… regular, if you get my meanin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, irregular bowel movements and heartburn managed with over-the-counter medication. That’s good you’re addressing it. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. And I haven’t taken much in the way of medicine lately, except for those pink tablets I mentioned. Oh! Wait a minute. I think… when I was a little girl, I broke out in hives after eatin’ strawberries. But that was a long time ago. I haven’t had strawberries in years, and I haven’t had any trouble with anything else. So, no, I don’t think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible strawberry allergy as a child, but none currently. That’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, besides those pink tablets for heartburn?
PATIENT: Just the pink tablets, really. These ones, right here. I take ‘em when my stomach gets upset. And… oh! Sometimes I take a little somethin’ for my arthritis in my hands. It’s just a cream, though, nothing you swallow. It helps a bit with the achin’, but it don’t last long. That’s about it. I don’t really like takin’ medicine if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, antacids as needed and a topical cream for your hands. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious illnesses, like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tough one. Let me think… My husband… he had high blood pressure, I remember that. But me? I don't think so. The doctor did tell me somethin’ once, years ago, about my cholesterol bein' a little high. But I don’t recall what he said exactly. He put me on a diet for a while, I think. But other than that… no, I don't think I've ever been diagnosed with anything serious. Just the usual aches and pains that come with gettin’ older.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of slightly elevated cholesterol. We can certainly check that today. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… Oh! Yes, actually. A long time ago, when I was younger, I had my appendix taken out. And… I think I had some work done on my hands, years ago, after I hurt ‘em pretty bad on the job. But that wasn’t a proper surgery, just a little somethin’ the doctor did to fix ‘em up. That’s about it, I think. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and some minor work on your hands. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family, are there any serious illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother… she had a bad heart, I remember that. She passed away when she was pretty young. And my father… he had arthritis, real bad. Couldn’t hardly move his hands towards the end. And my brother… he had diabetes, I think. But other than that… not that I recall. We weren’t a particularly healthy bunch, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease, arthritis, and diabetes. That’s helpful information. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked for a while, but I always told him it was a terrible habit. He quit eventually, thank goodness. But me? Never. I can't stand the smell of it.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just a small one, though. Nothing fancy. It helps me relax after a long day on the job. But I don’t drink every day, and I certainly don’t drink a lot. Just a little somethin’ to take the edge off, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional small glass of wine. Last question about your lifestyle. Do you have any pets?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I have a little terrier named Coco. She's the sweetest thing. Keeps me company, you know? She's a bit of a handful sometimes, but I wouldn't trade her for the world. She loves going for walks with me, and she always knows when I need a cuddle. She’s a good girl, Coco is.
DOCTOR: That’s lovely. It sounds like Coco is a wonderful companion. Okay, Lytisha, that gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your hands and feet. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I haven't had a proper check-up in a while, so I'm sure I need it. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable. You go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 140 over 90. We'll need to monitor that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your lungs sound clear, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s probably nothing to worry about, but we may want to investigate it further with an EKG. Now, can you extend your hands for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Go ahead, Doctor. They ache a bit, but that’s just the job, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see some significant arthritis in your hands. It looks like you've got some Heberden’s nodes and some Bouchard’s nodes as well. Do these areas feel particularly painful when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s tender. Right there, and over here too. It’s worse when it’s cold, like I said before. And after a long day of workin’ with the machines, they get all swollen and achy. It makes it hard to grip things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There's some definite swelling and tenderness in your wrists and several of your finger joints. I'm also going to take a look at your feet now. Could you please take off your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There you go, Doctor. They get a bit swollen at the end of the day too. It’s just part of the job, I guess. Standin’ and walkin’ all day on hard ground.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some swelling in your ankles and some bunions on both feet. I'm also going to check your reflexes. Everything seems to be within normal limits, but we'll get a better idea once we run some tests. Alright, Lytisha, that completes the physical exam. Now, I'd like to order some blood work and an EKG to get a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Blood work and an EKG, alright. No, not right now, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything pretty clearly, Doctor. Is somethin' wrong? Is that why you want to do all these tests?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily "wrong," Lytisha. It's just a standard procedure to get a baseline understanding of your health, especially since it’s been a while since your last check-up. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, I heard a slight murmur during the exam, and you’ve mentioned several symptoms like fatigue, back pain, and joint pain. These tests will help us determine the cause of these issues and ensure you receive the best possible care. It's better to be thorough and rule things out. We’ll check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, liver function, and look at your complete blood count. The EKG will check your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Oh, I see. That makes sense. Just wantin' to make sure everything’s alright, right? Alright, well, whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. So, what do I need to do about the blood work and the EKG?
DOCTOR: That’s right, just want to make sure everything’s alright. I’ll have the nurse draw a few tubes of blood right here in the office. And then we’ll schedule you for an EKG at the imaging center across the street. It’s a quick and painless test, just some stickers on your chest. The nurse will give you a slip with the address and appointment time. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other materials we should be aware of before we proceed with the blood work?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had any trouble with bandages or anything like that. Nope, I think I’m good. Just go ahead, Doctor. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood now. She’ll explain everything as she goes, and you can let her know if you feel any discomfort. After the blood work, we’ll get you scheduled for the EKG. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do to prepare for the tests.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lytisha. No special preparation is needed for the blood work or EKG, just relax and try not to worry. The nurse will be in shortly. In the meantime, is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable?
PATIENT: No, I'm alright, thank you. Just a little anxious, I suppose. But I’m sure it’ll be fine. I've faced worse, workin’ on the road. Just let me know when it's time.
DOCTOR: You’ve certainly handled a lot, that’s for sure. I’ll let you relax for a moment. I'll be right outside if you need anything. The nurse should be in very soon. And remember, we're here to help you every step of the way.
