DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor... it's about my bruising. I'm on that blood thinner, you know, ever since... well, it doesn’t matter. But I seem to be black and blue all over for just bumping into things. It’s ridiculous, really. A normal person wouldn’t be like this.
DOCTOR: Right. A blood thinner… yes. And you're saying this bruising is new or significantly worse than it was before?
PATIENT: Oh, it's definitely worse. It used to be just a little mark if I really whacked myself, you understand? Now… now I just look like I’ve been in a fight. I haven’t, of course. I just… I’m a bit clumsy, perhaps. But it’s embarrassing, Doctor. Really embarrassing. And my housekeeper keeps giving me these looks.
DOCTOR: Clumsy, you say. Hmm. And how long has this increased bruising been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness... let me think. It’s been… probably a month, maybe six weeks? It crept up on me, honestly. At first it was just a little more than usual, then it just… got worse. I didn’t think much of it at the time, thought I was just having a string of bad luck. Now… well, now it’s a bit concerning. Though, honestly, I don’t see what can be done about it. It’s probably just old age, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Old age rarely causes this sudden an increase in bruising, Mr. Farson. We need to rule out other possibilities. Now, besides bumping into things, are you noticing any bruising for no reason at all?
PATIENT: No reason? Goodness, no. I mean, I don't go around deliberately bruising myself! I don't do anything reckless. Just… normal things. Gardening, walking around the house… things a man my age does. It's not like I’m boxing or anything. And I certainly haven't fallen. Not recently, anyway. Honestly, Doctor, I’m quite careful. Perhaps too careful, these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any bleeding that’s difficult to stop?
PATIENT: Difficult to stop…? Hmm. Well, when I shave, it sometimes takes a bit longer to get the bleeding to quit. Nothing major, just… a little more blotting than it used to be. And a nosebleed a few months back, but I get those sometimes. Dry air, you know. But that was ages ago. I wouldn’t say difficult to stop, exactly. Just… a bit more than usual. Is that what you're asking?
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk about any other medications you're taking. Anything at all – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… everything. It's important to know everything you're putting into your system. And have you started taking anything new in the last few months?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that's a long list. Let me see… Well, there’s the blood thinner, of course. Then I take something for my arthritis, the one the old doctor gave me… can’t remember the name. And a vitamin D supplement, the nurse told me to take that. Oh, and sometimes I take something for my heartburn, if I eat something spicy. New…? Hmm. My neighbor gave me some sort of herbal tea for sleeping, a few weeks ago. Said it was very good. I've only had it a couple of times, though. It tasted awful, honestly. And I think that's it. Really. I don’t believe in all that fancy medicine, you know.
DOCTOR: Herbal tea…right. And the name of the arthritis medication, if you can recall it?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s on the tip of my tongue... It was a white pill… and the name started with a… a ‘M’, I think. Maybe ‘Metho-something’? It's one of those names doctors like, long and complicated. Honestly, I just ask the pharmacist to refill it. I don't bother trying to remember all these things. It’s all a bit much, if you ask me. People used to get better without all these pills, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll need to look into this “Metho-something.” Do you mind if I take a quick look at your arms and legs, just to assess the bruising?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Though I assure you, it's quite unsightly. I don't like showing this to people. But if you must. I suppose it’s part of your job. Just… be gentle, alright? I bruise easily enough as it is. And please don't make a fuss. I don't need a lecture on being more careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Just relax. This will just take a moment. Yes, I see quite a bit here. And some appear to be relatively new. Are these areas tender to the touch?
PATIENT: A little bit. Not terribly, but… yes, if you press on them. Especially that one, right there, on my shin. It stings a bit. Honestly, Doctor, I don't understand what's going on. I haven't done anything to myself! I take care of my body, you know. I eat healthy, I get my rest… well, as much rest as an old man can get. This is just… unsettling. Are you going to poke me all over?
DOCTOR: No, I won’t poke you all over, Mr. Farson. Just needed a quick assessment. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it seems we need to rule out a few possibilities. While the bruising could be related to the blood thinner, the sudden increase and tenderness warrants further investigation. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a coagulation panel to see how your blood is clotting. We’ll also want to check your liver function. And frankly, Mr. Farson, I'd recommend seeing a hematologist – a blood specialist – for a more thorough evaluation. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A hematologist…? Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. And more tests? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure I need all this fuss. I just want to stop bruising like a peach, not become a science experiment. But… if you think it’s necessary. I suppose I trust your judgment, to a degree. Though, honestly, I’ve never been one for doctors. Is it going to be expensive? Medicare barely covers anything these days. And will I have to go to a fancy hospital? I don’t do well in hospitals. They smell awful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Farson. It is a bit of a process. However, we need to get to the bottom of this to ensure there isn't something more serious going on. The hematologist will be able to determine the cause of the bruising and recommend the best course of action. Medicare should cover the majority of the costs, but we’ll have to verify that with your insurance. As for the hospital, it doesn’t necessarily have to be a large one. I can refer you to a hematologist who has an outpatient clinic. Less…hospital-like, shall we say. I'm going to order the blood tests first, and then we’ll discuss the referral based on those results. It’s better to be safe and investigate thoroughly, rather than ignore the problem and potentially face complications down the line. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Well… alright. The blood tests, then. As long as it doesn't involve too much poking. And if the results are… not alarming, then perhaps we can forget about this whole hematologist business. I really don't see the point of putting myself through more tests and visits if it's just a little bit of bruising. And please, Doctor, make sure the lab technician is gentle. I don't want to end up with a huge welt on my arm. Honestly, some of these people are so rough. Can you at least promise me that?
DOCTOR: I’ll make a note to request a gentle phlebotomist for your blood draw, Mr. Farson. Though, I cannot guarantee it will be completely painless. It's unavoidable to some degree. The lab is right down the hall, desk number three. They’ll need your insurance information and a copy of this order, which I’ll have the receptionist give you. Once the results are back—usually within a few business days—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you notice any new symptoms—such as unexplained bleeding, fatigue, or fever—contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… get it over with, I suppose. Honestly, this has been quite stressful. A bit of bruising is one thing, but all this worry… it's not good for an old man's heart. And thank you, Doctor. For listening, at least. Even if you’re sending me off for more tests. I’ll go find desk number three, then. Hopefully, they have a gentle hand. .
