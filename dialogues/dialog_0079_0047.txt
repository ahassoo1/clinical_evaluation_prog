DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. I’m Dr. Gonzalezperez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Uh… well, it’s about… long-term care, I think? My daughter, bless her heart, she set this up. I don’t really… remember all the details, to be honest. Something about making sure I’m covered if… if things get hard down the road. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see a note here regarding advanced care planning. It appears your daughter is quite proactive. “Long-term care” is a broad term, Mr. Rover. Perhaps we can start with what concerns you specifically?
PATIENT: Concerns… hmm. Well, my wife… she passed a few years back. And I’ve been on my own since then. Mostly okay, I get by. But… I worry about needing help someday. Not wanting to be a burden, you know? Just… getting old, I guess. It’s hard to think about. I mostly just want to make things easy for my daughter if she has to… take care of things. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Rover. It sounds like you're concerned about potential future care needs and want to minimize the burden on your daughter. We can discuss advance directives – a living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare – which outline your wishes and designate someone to make decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to do so yourself. Before we delve into that, let's get a better understanding of your current health status. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Existing conditions… Oh, geez. I… I see Dr. Olsen for my heart, sometimes. It gets a little… fluttery now and then. And my knees… they ain’t what they used to be. Arthritis, I think the doctor said. But nothing… major, really. I get around, I work. I move freight down at the docks, you know? It’s… it’s not too bad. I take some pills for the heart, but that’s about it. I can’t remember the names of them, though. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Rover. We can look those up in our system. Do you recall approximately when you were diagnosed with the heart condition and the arthritis?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… Geez. That was… a while back. The heart, maybe… ten years ago? Or a little more? The knees… probably five or six years back, I reckon. It all kinda blends together, you know? I don’t really keep track of dates. I just… go to the doctor when things bother me. Dr. Olsen, he’s a good man. He knows what he’s doing. I just show up and he gives me pills.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Rover, while I appreciate your trust in Dr. Olsen, it’s important for me to have a complete medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, Doc. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything. My wife, she was always careful about that sort of thing, checking labels and all. But me? I just… eat. I don’t think I’ve ever had a problem. Except… maybe shellfish. I think I felt a little funny once after eating some shrimp, but it could have just been a bad shrimp. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: A possible shellfish allergy… noted. And what about past surgeries or hospitalizations, Mr. Rover?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think… Oh! When I was a kid, I broke my arm falling out of a tree. Had to have a cast. That’s… that’s about it, I think. Never been in the hospital for anything else. Just… the broken arm when I was little. I was always getting into trouble back then. My mother wasn’t too pleased.
DOCTOR: Alright. And family history, Mr. Rover?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, geez. That’s… tough. My wife’s family, they were mostly healthy, I think. She had a brother with… something, maybe diabetes? But I don’t really remember. My side… well, my father, he worked on boats his whole life. Tough as nails, he was. Lived a long time. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She passed when I was young. That’s… that’s about all I remember. We didn’t really talk much about health, you know? Just… lived life. It’s all a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs, Mr. Rover?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doc! Never! Not me. I don't smoke, never have. A little beer now and then, maybe with supper, but that’s about it. Nothing fancy. And… no, definitely no drugs. I’m a working man, Doc. Gotta keep a clear head. Never been one for any of that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, regarding your work down at the docks, is it physically demanding?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah! It’s hard work, Doc. Lifting boxes, loading trucks… it’s a good workout, keeps me moving. That’s why my knees bother me sometimes. But I manage. Been doing it for years. Gotta earn a living, you know? It’s… it’s honest work. Keeps me busy, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Rover, I think I have a basic understanding of your history now. Let's do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Sure, Doc. Just give me a second. Old bones creakin’, you know? There. All right. What do you want me to do? I ain’t been to a doctor in a while, so I might need a little… help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me, Mr. Rover… and exhale. Deep breath… and exhale. Your heart rate is slightly elevated, and I hear a mild murmur. Not particularly concerning at this point, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Now, can you bend at the waist and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ooof. Not as easy as it used to be, Doc. Knees are killin' me. There. That’s about as far as I can go without… well, without makin’ a fuss. Gets tighter every year, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Your gait is slightly unsteady, and you appear to have limited range of motion in your lower back and knees. Based on this brief examination, it appears you have some degree of osteoarthritis, as suspected. Your elevated heart rate and murmur warrant further investigation. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG, and an X-ray of your knees. Do you have any questions so far, Mr. Rover?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a second, Doc. Blood count… what? EKG? X-rays? Sounds… serious. What does all that mean? Am I… sick? And what does all this have to do with… with making sure my daughter doesn’t have to worry about me? I just wanted to… plan ahead, you know? This is all a bit much.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, these tests are routine. They will help us get a clearer picture of your overall health, not necessarily indicate you are seriously ill. The blood work will check your organ function and identify any underlying issues. The EKG will assess your heart rhythm, and the X-rays will help us visualize the condition of your knees. This information is crucial for developing a comprehensive care plan, which is what you came in for, correct?
PATIENT: Yeah… yeah, that’s right. Care plan. My daughter… she said something about that. But… will these tests be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you know? And… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to keep waiting around, makin’ a fuss.
DOCTOR: The tests are covered by your insurance, Mr. Rover. You may have a co-pay, but our billing department can provide you with an estimate. As for the results, they typically take 24 to 48 hours. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with your regular activities, but avoid any strenuous exertion that aggravates your knee pain. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doc. Just… try not to find anything too bad, okay? My daughter… she worries enough already. And… thank you. For… explainin’ everything. It’s just… a lot to take in. I guess I’ll see you… in a couple of days?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Rover. Our office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any concerning symptoms before then. Have a good day. .
