DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, to be honest. Waste of time, mostly. But… well, I’ve been throwing up blood. Not buckets of it, you understand, but enough to make me take notice. And my wife… she would have insisted. She always worried about everything.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. It's good that your wife encouraged you to come in. Throwing up blood is certainly something we need to investigate. It’s always best to be cautious. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it started… maybe three days ago? Hard to say exactly. Everything feels a bit blended together lately, if I'm honest. It's not like bright red, gushing… more like… dark, old coffee grounds, you know? And it’s not every time I throw up, just… sometimes. I’ve been feeling a bit weak, too. Tired. Like I ran a marathon. And my stomach's been hurting, on and off. It’s… lower down, mostly. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Three days ago, dark, old coffee grounds appearance, intermittent, with weakness and lower abdominal discomfort. That paints a clearer picture. Just to clarify, has there been any change in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? Look, I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about that stuff. They're… regular enough, I suppose. Maybe a bit darker than usual. But again, I don’t really look. Is that something I’m supposed to be doing? Honestly, doctors these days… asking a man about his… Never mind. Just… a little darker. And maybe a bit looser, yeah. But not like… diarrhea, if that makes any sense. More… soft.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. It’s good you’re telling me, and no, you’re not necessarily supposed to examine everything closely, but changes can be important clues. So, darker and softer stools. Now, have you noticed any pain in your chest, shortness of breath, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Dizziness? A little, maybe. Now that you mention it. Gets worse when I stand up too quickly. Happens every now and then. Chest pain… not really. A little heartburn sometimes, but I get that from spicy food. I enjoy a good Yemeni stew. Shortness of breath… no, not that I’ve noticed. I get a bit winded climbing stairs, but that’s just because I’m… not as young as I used to be. It's this heat, probably. It's been brutal.
DOCTOR: Alright. Dizziness upon standing, occasional heartburn. That’s all useful information. And the heat certainly doesn’t help. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, liver problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Look, I’ve been mostly healthy, to be honest. Never had much trouble with doctors. My wife… she handled all that. She was the one always going to appointments. I remember she said something about my cholesterol being a little high a few years back. She made me take some pills for a while, but I stopped. Didn't feel like they were doing anything. Never been told I had diabetes or anything serious. No liver problems, as far as I know. I… drank a bit back in the day, but nothing excessive. I mostly just stick to tea now. And water, of course. Is this going somewhere?
DOCTOR: That's good information, Mr. Gentz. It's helpful to know about the slightly elevated cholesterol and that you previously took medication for it. It's okay that you stopped taking it if you weren’t feeling any benefit, but we’ll need to revisit that. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any surgeries you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And… oh, a hernia repair. Maybe ten years ago? Something like that. It wasn't a big deal, a quick in-and-out procedure. Nothing else that I can recall. I’ve always been pretty lucky. Didn't need much doctoring. Why are you asking about all this? Is this… is something seriously wrong?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Tonsillectomy as a child and a hernia repair about ten years ago. We ask about these things to get a full understanding of your health history. And, Mr. Gentz, it’s good that you've been relatively healthy. We are just gathering information at this point, and it’s a bit too early to say definitively whether anything serious is wrong. But the vomiting of blood does require us to investigate. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can take most things, usually. My wife always asked me that question too. She was a worrier. I once had a bit of a rash after using some cheap aftershave, but that was years ago. Nothing serious. I’m not one of those people with a list of sensitivities. You know, I used to be able to eat anything without a second thought. It’s just been downhill since… since she passed. Everything feels different.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. No known drug allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just some aspirin now and then for a headache. Nothing regular. And a multivitamin, I suppose. Started taking that a few months back, thought it might do some good. Can't remember the brand. Just something I picked up at the store. That’s it. I don’t really believe in all those fancy pills and potions. My wife… well, she had a cabinet full of them. Said they were good for everything. I mostly just drink my tea. It's calming. Is this all you need to know? I’m starting to feel a bit tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional aspirin and a multivitamin. That’s good to know. I understand you’re feeling tired, Mr. Gentz. We're almost finished with the questions. Just one last thing – can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he had a heart problem, I think. Died when I was still young. Mother lived to be old, thankfully. Healthy as a horse. I don't really know much about anyone else. My family... they were back in Yemen. Didn't keep in touch much. It's… complicated. Is this important? It all seems a bit… unnecessary, frankly. Are you going to poke around in my stomach now? I’m really not fond of hospitals. Or doctors, for that matter.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Gentz. It’s completely understandable that you don’t know much about your family history. Knowing about your father’s heart problem is helpful. And no, I won't poke around right away. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I would like to perform a physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart, check your abdomen, and a few other things. It’s a standard procedure and will help me assess your condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, I suppose. Just get it over with, alright? The quicker this is done, the quicker I can go home and have a cup of tea. Just… be gentle. And don't tell me everything that's wrong with me, alright? I don’t want a list. I just want to know what I need to do to get rid of this… problem. I’ve got things to do. And I’m not particularly fond of being touched by strangers.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. I will be as gentle as possible and I will only explain what you need to know. I won’t give you a long list of everything that might be wrong. Alright, if you could please lie down on the examination table, that would be great. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breath in… and out… And now I'll listen to your lungs on this side… I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just… be quick about it. And don’t poke too hard. It’s already sore enough. Ouch! That’s a bit tender… right there. That feels… bruised, almost. But I don't remember hitting myself or anything. It’s just been hurting lately, getting worse with the… well, you know. It’s all rather unpleasant. Hurry up and tell me what’s wrong, alright? I’ve got a good strong cup of tea waiting for me at home.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I'm noting tenderness in your lower abdomen, as you pointed out. Your heart sounds are regular, but a little fast. I also notice you seem a little pale, but that could be from feeling unwell. Based on what you've told me and my initial examination, I suspect we need to investigate the source of the bleeding in your stomach. The dark, coffee grounds appearance in your vomit, the abdominal tenderness, and the weakness are all concerning. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests. These will help us check your blood count, kidney function, and liver function. I would also recommend a stool test to check for any hidden blood. And, to be on the safe side, I would like to refer you to a gastroenterologist for an endoscopy. They can use a small camera to look directly into your stomach and identify the source of the bleeding. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Endoscopy? A camera? Are you serious? You want to stick a camera down my throat? Absolutely not. No way. I’m not doing that. That sounds… barbaric. Blood tests, fine. Maybe. But no cameras. I’m not putting a camera down my throat. Not for all the tea in China. I think I’ll just… go home and see if it gets better. I’m sure it’s just something I ate. A bad kebab, maybe. It’ll pass. You don't need to stick things down me to figure it out. Just give me something for the heartburn, alright? And I'll be on my way. I’ve wasted enough time here already. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I understand your reluctance to undergo an endoscopy, and I respect your decision. However, I must emphasize that it is the most accurate way to determine the cause of the bleeding in your stomach. Without knowing the cause, we cannot provide you with the appropriate treatment. That being said, I will not force you to undergo a procedure you are not comfortable with. I can prescribe you a medication to help manage your heartburn symptoms. However, if your symptoms worsen or if you start experiencing any new symptoms – such as dizziness, weakness, or black, tarry stools – you must seek immediate medical attention. I also strongly advise you to reconsider the referral to a gastroenterologist. They can discuss the risks and benefits of the endoscopy with you in more detail and answer any questions you may have. Would you like me to write you a prescription for the heartburn medication?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Just… give me the heartburn stuff. And maybe something for the dizziness, if you have it. I don’t want to fall over in the street. Look, I've got things to do, alright? I can't be spending all day in hospitals and clinics. This has already wasted half my day. Just... no cameras. Understand? No cameras. And if I start feeling worse, I'll… I'll think about going back. Maybe. But no promises. Just… get me out of here.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. No cameras. I understand. Here is your prescription. Please take the medication as directed, and please, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, especially if you notice black, tarry stools or any significant dizziness, go to the emergency room immediately. I’m also going to give you a handout with information about the signs and symptoms of internal bleeding. I wish you all the best, Mr. Gentz. And please, don't hesitate to seek medical attention if you need it. If you don't mind, I’ll just get my nurse to help you with your discharge instructions. .
PATIENT: Right. Thank you. Cameras… ridiculous.
