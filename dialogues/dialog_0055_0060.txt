DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I am Dr. Eaddy. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it's... family history, mostly. My mother, she had some issues. Heart, I think. And my grandfather... it was something with his brain, wasn't it? Dementia, maybe? Anyway, everyone keeps telling me I should get checked out "just in case," you know? It’s a bit ridiculous, honestly. I feel perfectly fine. But they worry.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's prudent to be proactive, especially with a family history of cardiac and neurological conditions. While feeling well is certainly positive, some of these conditions can have subtle beginnings. Let’s document this concern. You mentioned your mother had “some issues” with her heart… could you elaborate on that, if you recall?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Honestly, I was pretty young. She just… got tired a lot. Then she had some surgery. Bypass, I think. Something like that. My aunt handled all the details. I just remember visiting her in the hospital. She was… frail. Look, I’m an engineer. I deal with facts, with things I can see. This is all just… vague memories and worry. It’s not very helpful, is it?
DOCTOR: A cardiac bypass surgery in your mother… noted. It is understandable that vague recollections make this challenging. However, even limited information is helpful. And I assure you, preventative measures are a fact-based approach to your health. Now, regarding your grandfather… you mentioned potential dementia?
PATIENT: Right. Dementia… yeah. That's what everyone said. He just… forgot things. Got confused. He didn’t recognize people sometimes, even family. It was… sad, really. He got worse over time. My father said it ran in his family, too. But again, I wasn't really involved in all that. I was busy with school. Is this going to involve a lot of tests? I really don’t have the time for a lot of… fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time commitments, Mr. Theriot. We will, of course, proceed thoughtfully. Given your family history – cardiac issues in your mother, potential dementia in your grandfather – a basic assessment is warranted. I'd like to start with a thorough neurological exam and some blood work to rule out any underlying deficiencies or inflammation. We can discuss more advanced testing later, if necessary. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Look, I appreciate you trying to be… thorough. But a “thorough” exam? What does that even mean? And blood work... fine, I guess. But honestly, I suspect it’s just a waste of time. People in my family are generally healthy. It's probably just… anxiety. Everyone gets worked up about things. I really don't see the point of putting myself through all of this. Is there anything I can do to just... skip to a conclusion? Like, tell me I'm fine and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, with all due respect, a blanket reassurance without proper assessment is not ethically sound, nor is it in your best interest. While I acknowledge your feeling of good health and your family’s general wellness, we cannot dismiss potential risks based on assumptions. A neurological exam is a relatively quick and non-invasive procedure – it involves checking reflexes, coordination, and cognitive function. It's a standard part of assessing risk factors, and frankly, a waste of my time if you refuse to cooperate. I am hesitant to proceed without at least this basic evaluation. Would you be willing to allow me to perform a brief neurological exam?
PATIENT: You're saying I'm wasting your time? That's… incredibly condescending. Look, I'm a professional. I don't appreciate being talked down to. And frankly, the fact that you're pushing me to do something I've already said I don't want is… frustrating. Fine. Do your exam. But I expect it to be quick. And if it's all just a waste of time, I’m letting you know right now. Don't expect me to be happy about it. Let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Theriot. Please follow me to the examination room. We will keep this as efficient as possible. Please sit on the examination table. I'll begin with a basic assessment of your reflexes. I'd like you to relax your legs. Now, I’m going to test your patellar reflex.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry up. And please, don't explain everything you're doing. I understand basic physics. I don't need a lecture on knee-jerk reactions. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Right leg… good response. Left leg… also good. Now, I'd like you to close your eyes and tell me when I touch your fingers and toes. Can you tell me which finger I’m touching?
PATIENT: That one. The… index finger, I think? Look, is this really necessary? It feels like… a child’s game. You’re a doctor, aren’t you? Shouldn't you be doing something more… sophisticated? It's not exactly a rigorous assessment of my cognitive abilities.
DOCTOR: It is a preliminary assessment, Mr. Theriot. We are establishing a baseline. Now, please extend your arms out in front of you, palms up. I want you to close your eyes and touch your nose with your index finger. Please repeat that five times.
PATIENT: One… two… three… this is ridiculous. Four… five. There. Are you happy now? It’s perfect. Flawless. I’ve touched my nose five times while blindfolded. Clearly, my brain is functioning at peak capacity. Can we please be done with this charade? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, I noticed a slight tremor in your right hand during the finger-to-nose test. It's subtle, but worth noting. Also, there was a slight delay in initiating the movement on your left side. While these findings are not definitive, they warrant further investigation. I would like to order a complete blood panel, including a thyroid function test, Vitamin B12 levels, and a basic metabolic panel. Additionally, I recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. It's crucial to address these potential concerns promptly.
PATIENT: An MRI? You're serious? Over a slight tremor? Look, I told you I’m fine. This is preposterous. You’re trying to find problems that don’t exist. I’ve been perfectly healthy my entire life. I don’t need an expensive, time-consuming MRI based on… what? Your subjective observation? No. Absolutely not. I refuse. I think I’ve wasted enough of my time here. I’m leaving. And frankly, I suggest you rethink your approach to patient care. This is… insulting.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, I respect your decision, though I strongly advise against dismissing potential risks. However, I cannot ethically pursue testing against your will. I will document our discussion and your refusal of further investigation. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – weakness, dizziness, memory loss, or changes in coordination – please seek immediate medical attention. .
