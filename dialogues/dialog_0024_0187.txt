DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowic. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get straight to the point. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Point is good. Chest…feels funny. Like bird flapping. And my wife, she says my face is red. Blood pressure, she check. High. Very high. I don't like feeling this. Waste of time, honestly.
DOCTOR: “Funny,” Mr. Sobkowic?
PATIENT: Like…fluttering. Not ha-ha funny. Like little wings. And thump-thump fast. I eat good food. Not junk. Maybe too much kimchi? My wife, she worries too much. Always with the numbers. What do you think?
DOCTOR: Kimchi is…unlikely to be the sole cause, Mr. Sobkowic. When did this “fluttering” begin?
PATIENT: Hmm. Maybe…two, three days ago? Hard to say. Old man, things…blend together. It come and go. Not all the time. Just when I…move around. Or after I eat something heavy. Like pork belly. My wife make good pork belly. But maybe not good for my heart, eh?
DOCTOR: And you’ve noticed this coincides with activity and larger meals. Any shortness of breath with this sensation?
PATIENT: Shortness…no. Not really. I walk up stairs, no problem. But…sometimes feel dizzy. Just a little. Like head is…empty. Not fall down empty, just…light. Especially after pork belly. You think it's the pork belly? I like pork belly.
DOCTOR: We will need to rule out other possibilities, Mr. Sobkowic. Lightheadedness can be a symptom of…several things. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmph. Just little pills for…water. You know. Old man, need help with water. And sometimes, when my knee hurts, little white pill. That's all. My wife gets them. I don't remember the names. Why you ask so many questions? Just fix my chest, doctor.
DOCTOR: It is imperative I have a complete understanding of your medical history, Mr. Sobkowic. The “little pills for water,” as you call them, are diuretics. These can affect your electrolyte balance. And the white pill for your knee…is that a pain reliever?
PATIENT: Electrolytes…what are those? Just make water go away. And knee…yes. Pain. Hurts when it rains. White pill make it better. Look, doctor, I don't understand all this fancy talk. I came here because my chest feels bad, not to take a test on body parts. Can you just…listen to my heart? Is it broken? That's all I need to know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us perform a basic examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I will auscultate your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure again. Afterwards, we will discuss some potential causes and, if necessary, further testing. It is unlikely your heart is “broken,” but we must determine the source of this discomfort.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But don’t keep me long. I have things to do. This table is too high. My legs are short.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is somewhat elevated, and there is a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 160 over 95. As I suspected. This is…concerning. Do you experience any pain in your chest, radiating to your arm or jaw?
PATIENT: Radiating? No. No pain in arm or jaw. Just…fluttering. And tightness. Like someone is squeezing. Not hard squeezing, just…uncomfortable. Like too tight shirt. And sometimes…a little sweat. But only when I worry about pork belly. Is it the pork belly, doctor? Please, just tell me it's the pork belly. My wife will be happy.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowic, with all due respect, attributing this to “pork belly” is…simplistic. Your symptoms, combined with your elevated blood pressure and murmur, suggest a possible cardiac issue. I am ordering an electrocardiogram – an ECG – to assess your heart’s electrical activity. We also need blood work to check your cholesterol and other important markers. And I strongly advise you to significantly reduce your sodium intake. And, for the time being…limit the pork belly.
PATIENT: Sodium? What's that got to do with my chest? And ECG…more tests? Hmph. This is ridiculous. I came here for a quick fix, not a whole day of poking and prodding. My wife will be furious. She hates when I have to wait at the doctor’s office. She says it’s bad for my…something. Oh, never mind. Just…do the tests, I guess. But hurry. And don't tell my wife about the sodium. She'll lecture me for a week. .
DOCTOR: Prepare Mr. Sobkowic for an ECG and blood draw, please. And make sure he doesn’t leave the premises until we've reviewed the results. Honestly, some patients… .
