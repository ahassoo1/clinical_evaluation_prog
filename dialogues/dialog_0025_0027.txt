DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time for this, Doctor. It's this… stuff. Coming back up. My stomach, you know? It's just… unpleasant. Been happening for a few weeks now. Mostly after I eat.
DOCTOR: "Mostly after you eat," you say. Alright. And when you say “stuff coming back up,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean specific? It's… food. Undigested food, sometimes. And… acid. It burns, alright? Like, heartburn, but it actually comes up. Is that specific enough for you? Honestly, it's not a complicated problem.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know it’s undigested food and acid. It helps me narrow things down. And no, it’s not necessarily a simple problem, Mr. Altine. The digestive system is quite complex. Now, is this happening with every meal, or are certain foods more likely to bring it on?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Look, I eat normal food. Meat, potatoes, vegetables… I'm not one of these… fancy eaters. It seems worse with… heavier things. Steak, maybe. Or a big plate of pierogi. Though, to be honest, everything seems to bother it lately. Don't tell me I have to change my diet.
DOCTOR: I'm not telling you to change your diet, Mr. Altine. I'm trying to understand the pattern here. So, it's more likely after larger meals, and especially heavier foods. Any pain associated with this?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. A little burning in my chest, like you’d expect. Not like a stabbing pain, just… uncomfortable. It usually goes away pretty quick, though. Look, I'm a busy man. I run the emergency management for the whole county. I don't have time to be walking around with indigestion. Is there a pill you can give me or what?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, jumping straight to a “pill” isn’t the best approach, Mr. Altine. We need to rule out anything serious before we start treatment. Have you noticed any weight loss lately?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, I've gained a few pounds. My wife keeps telling me I need to watch it, but… well, she always does. Look, I'm a solid 197, always have been. This isn't about weight. It's about getting this… regurgitation under control.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Trouble swallowing? No. I eat just fine. I haven’t choked on anything, if that’s what you’re asking. This isn’t about not being able to get the food down, it’s about it coming back up. Honestly, Doctor, are you even listening to me?
DOCTOR: I am listening, Mr. Altine. And I apologize if my questions seem redundant, but it’s important to be thorough. Now, any nausea or vomiting besides this… regurgitation?
PATIENT: Look, no. Just the… the stuff. Coming back up. No throwing up, no feeling sick to my stomach. Just this unpleasantness after I eat. This is… honestly, it's really not that complicated. I'm a practical man, Doctor. I deal with real emergencies, not… tummy troubles.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just do a quick physical exam then, Mr. Altine. I want to listen to your abdomen and chest, just to rule out anything obvious. It will only take a few minutes. Please lie back on the exam table.
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I've got a meeting with the county commissioners in an hour.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Normal bowel sounds. No tenderness to palpation. Now, I'm going to listen to your chest. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds are regular. Okay. Everything sounds… normal, physically. But we still need to investigate further. Have you ever had an endoscopy or a barium swallow?
PATIENT: An… what now? Look, I'm not one for fancy medical procedures. I've had a few stitches here and there, a broken arm when I was a kid, but… endo-something? Barium what-now? No. Never. And frankly, I don't want to. Is there really something seriously wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Those procedures help us visualize the esophagus and stomach, Mr. Altine, to rule out things like ulcers, inflammation, or blockages. It's the most accurate way to determine the cause of your symptoms. But, given your aversion to those options, let's start with a trial of medication. I'm going to prescribe a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, to reduce your stomach acid. However, if your symptoms don't improve within two weeks, or if they worsen, I strongly recommend you see a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. A pill. That's what I wanted in the first place. Look, I'm a reasonable man. If it doesn't work, I'll… consider talking to one of those… stomach doctors. But two weeks. If I'm still feeling like throwing up after two weeks, I'm not wasting any more time. Alright? And make sure it doesn't interfere with my blood pressure meds. My wife keeps a close eye on those.
DOCTOR: Alright. This is omeprazole, 20mg once daily, before breakfast. It should not interact with most blood pressure medications, but it's always best to double-check with your pharmacist. Here's the prescription. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience any side effects like black stools, difficulty swallowing, or unexplained weight loss, stop taking the medication and contact my office immediately. I've also included a handout with common side effects and instructions. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get me out of here. I’ve got a county to run. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon, Mr. Altine. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
