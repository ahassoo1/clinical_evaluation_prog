DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have a lot of time. I just... I want to get pregnant. And I want it to work this time. No problems, you understand? I’m not getting any younger, and frankly, I’d like to get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Carmaleta. It's perfectly reasonable to want things to go smoothly, and wanting to be proactive is excellent. We’ll definitely do our best to figure out what’s going on and help make that happen. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your previous attempts to get pregnant?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? It was a mess. My husband… well, he’s gone now. And things just… didn't happen. We tried for a while, you know? Normal stuff. But it never took. I don't really remember all the details, it was years ago. Lots of appointments, I think. And then… nothing. It’s not something I like to dwell on. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Of course, Carmaleta. That’s perfectly understandable. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it’s completely valid that you don’t want to rehash painful memories. No need to go into details you're not comfortable with. Just to get a clearer picture, would you mind if I ask about roughly how long you were trying, and if any testing was done at that time?
PATIENT: Testing… hmm. I think so. Blood tests, maybe? And… something with looking at my insides. Honestly, the doctor then was very… thorough. It was all a blur. We tried for… a couple of years, I guess? It wasn't like we were keeping strict track. We just… hoped. And then stopped when… well, you know. Is that what you need to know? Because I really don't remember the specifics. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of years of trying with some testing done – that’s helpful. And it’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember the specifics; we can focus on now. To get a good starting point, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Let me think. I had the usual things, colds, flu, a bad bout of food poisoning once. Oh! And I had my gallbladder removed, years ago. That was… unpleasant. But nothing serious. My husband always said I was as healthy as a horse. I don’t really go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to. Is that good enough? I doubt that’s what’s causing any problems.
DOCTOR: Having your gallbladder removed is good to know, thank you. And it's good that you generally feel healthy. Okay, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any fertility issues in your mother, sisters, or other close relatives?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, everyone on both sides just… gets old and dies. My mother had arthritis, I think. And my aunt… she had cancer, but a long time ago. Everyone just fades away eventually, you know? I don’t really pay attention to all that medical stuff. It just makes you worry for no reason. I doubt it’s relevant. Can we just get to figuring out what I need?
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Carmaleta. It's frustrating when details feel distant or irrelevant. However, sometimes family history can offer clues, even if it's just to be aware of potential risks. Okay, let’s shift gears then. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Nothing regular. I take a multivitamin sometimes, if I remember. And I’ve been taking some iron supplements lately, because I feel a bit tired. But that’s it. Really. I prefer to just eat healthy and get on with things. Is that what you wanted to know? Because I’m starting to feel like this is going nowhere.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and some iron supplements occasionally. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Really? Are you seriously asking me that? I am a professional! Do I look like someone who does any of those things? I maintain a healthy lifestyle. I eat well, I get enough sleep, and I avoid anything that could be harmful. Honestly, I find this whole line of questioning rather insulting. Are you implying something?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions came across as insulting, Carmaleta. That was not my intention at all. I ask these questions of all my patients as part of a standard medical evaluation. It's simply to gain a complete understanding of your overall health. I assure you, I wasn't implying anything. Let's move on then. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me about your menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're getting personal. Look, it’s… regular. It comes every month, like clockwork. What else do you want to know? The color? The length? Honestly, I don’t keep a diary of it or anything. I just… have a period. Is that sufficient? I really don’t see how this is relevant to getting pregnant. I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. It’s helpful to know it’s regular, and that’s a good starting point. I ask because irregularities can sometimes indicate underlying issues. Alright, let's try something different. Are you currently sexually active, and if so, do you use any form of contraception?
PATIENT: Are you seriously asking me this? Do you think I would be here if I weren’t trying to get pregnant? Of course I’m sexually active! And of course I’m not using contraception! Honestly, I’ve answered enough personal questions for one day. I came here for help, not an interrogation. I think I’m done. I’ll find another doctor. .
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize, Carmaleta. I clearly haven't established a comfortable rapport, and I understand your frustration. It was not my intention to make you feel interrogated or uncomfortable. You are absolutely right to seek a doctor you feel more at ease with. Before you go, would you allow me to quickly take your height and weight?
