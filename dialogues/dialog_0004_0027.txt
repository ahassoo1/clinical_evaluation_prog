DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, so let's get right to it. It's this... stuff coming back up. Acid, I guess. Happens mostly after I eat, and it's just… unpleasant. I've had it on and off for a while now, but it's been worse lately. I really don’t need a long explanation of why it’s happening, just tell me what to do about it.
DOCTOR: Right. “Acid coming back up,” as you put it. We call that acid reflux, or heartburn. While I understand you’d prefer to skip the explanation, it is important to understand the underlying cause to determine the best course of action. However, we can be efficient. To start, how often would you say this is happening?
PATIENT: Efficient is good. Happens… a few times a week, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly. Depends what I eat, I suppose. Heavy stuff, you know? Steak, pasta… things a man should be eating. Not rabbit food. I don’t track it or anything. Why would I? It’s not like I want it to happen.
DOCTOR: Right. A few times a week with heavier meals. And when you say “acid coming back up,” can you describe the sensation?
PATIENT: Well, it burns. Starts in my chest, kinda feels like… like someone’s squeezing it. And then, well, the acid. Tastes awful. Sometimes it gets in my throat, too. Makes me cough. It’s not pleasant, believe me. I've had it before, years ago, but it usually goes away on its own. This time it's sticking around.
DOCTOR: Chest pain, burning sensation, acid taste, and it’s extending into your throat, causing you to cough. And you said it’s been happening on and off for years, but is more persistent this time. Do you experience any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, I can swallow fine. Never had trouble with that. Food goes down, just… comes back up later. It's annoying, that’s all. Honestly, I'm a busy man. I run the emergency management for the whole county. Don't have time for stomach troubles. Is there a pill for this or what?
DOCTOR: Yes, there are certainly medications that can help. However, before we jump to prescriptions, I need to gather a bit more information. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No! I haven't been weighing myself, but I haven't lost any weight. If anything, I could probably stand to lose a few pounds, but that's a different story. Look, I eat well. I like good food. That’s all there is to it. I’m a big guy, always have been.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you experience any nausea or vomiting, aside from this “acid coming back up”?
PATIENT: No, not really vomiting. Just… the regurgitation. It’s not like I’m throwing up, just… stuff comes up. Sometimes it’s sour, sometimes it's just… food. And no nausea, thankfully. I hate feeling sick to my stomach. Just the burning and the taste. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good Lord, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but nothing heavy. And recreational drugs? Are you serious? I run the emergency management department! I have a reputation to uphold. I need a clear head, not… whatever you're implying.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. And what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Just a statin. For cholesterol. Doctor put me on it a few years back. And a multivitamin, that’s it. Nothing else. I try to keep things simple. I don’t like filling my body with a bunch of chemicals if I don’t need to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll palpate your abdomen. Just relax. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the epigastric region. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Given your symptoms and the physical exam findings, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. However, because of your age and the persistence of symptoms, I'd like to order a few tests to rule out anything more serious. Would you be willing to do an upper endoscopy and a pH monitoring study?
PATIENT: Endo…what-oscopy? And pH…what? Look, I told you, I don't have time for a lot of tests. Are you saying something is seriously wrong? Because if it’s just heartburn, I want a pill. A simple pill. I’m a practical man, Doctor. I don't need a bunch of invasive procedures. I've got a county to run, and honestly, this is wasting my time. If it’s serious, tell me. If it's not, give me something to stop the burning. That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, I understand your concerns about time, but I am ethically obligated to rule out more serious conditions before simply prescribing medication. An upper endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to look for any abnormalities, such as ulcers or inflammation. The pH monitoring study measures the amount of acid in your esophagus over a 24-hour period. Given your age and the duration of your symptoms, it’s prudent to investigate further. While it's likely just GERD, we need to rule out conditions like Barrett's esophagus, esophageal strictures, or even esophageal cancer. I can prescribe a proton pump inhibitor – a medication that reduces acid production – as a temporary measure to alleviate your symptoms. However, without these tests, we’re simply masking a potential problem. I strongly recommend proceeding with the endoscopy and pH monitoring. Will you agree to those tests?
PATIENT: Esophageal cancer? Now you're just trying to scare me. Look, I appreciate you being thorough, but frankly, this is ridiculous. I’ve had heartburn before, it goes away. I’m a healthy man, I eat well, I exercise – well, I used to exercise more, but still. Fine. Fine! Do your tests. But make them quick. And I want a prescription now for whatever you’re talking about, that proton…thing. Just to get me through until then. But if this is going to take weeks, forget it. I have a county to run, remember?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. I understand. I will schedule the endoscopy and pH monitoring as quickly as possible. The lab will contact you to arrange the appointments. I will prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor – specifically, omeprazole 20mg once daily in the morning, 30 minutes before breakfast – to manage your symptoms in the meantime. It usually takes a few days to reach its full effect. Here is a prescription for omeprazole. I also have a handout detailing potential side effects and instructions on how to take the medication. I will also give you a referral to a gastroenterologist for the endoscopy and pH monitoring. They will contact you directly to schedule the appointments. Please contact my office if you have any questions or experience any concerning symptoms while on the medication. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: No. Just...make sure they get me in quickly. And tell them I’m a busy man. That's all. Hopefully, this proton… thing works. I really don’t have time for this. Alright, well, thank you. I suppose. Let’s just hope this is all it is.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Altine. We'll do our best to expedite the process. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve with the medication. Have a good day, Mr. Altine. .
