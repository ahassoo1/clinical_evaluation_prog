DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Espinueva, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain I keep getting in my side, lower down, on both sides, if you please. And… I seem to be getting water infections quite often now, too. It’s been going on for a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds uncomfortable. Pain on both sides, and frequent water infections. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. When did this pain start, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me think… it’s hard to say exactly. Probably… oh, maybe three or four years ago now? It started off mild, just a bit of a niggle, really. But it’s been getting worse, slowly, over time. It comes and goes, you see. Not constant.
DOCTOR: Right, three or four years ago, starting mild and gradually worsening, coming and going… And can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not sharp, Doctor. More of a… a dull ache, really. And sometimes it feels like a pressure. Like something’s… full. Especially when the water infection is acting up, it feels worse. It’s hard to explain properly. It’s just… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache and pressure, worse with water infections. That gives me a bit more to work with. Now, about these water infections… how often would you say you’re getting them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it used to be maybe once or twice a year. But this last year… it’s been more like every other month, maybe even more often. It’s a nuisance, really. And tiring, having to keep going to the doctor. I'm not sure what's changed.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increasing in frequency – used to be a couple times a year, now it's more like every other month. That definitely warrants investigation. Have you noticed any other symptoms with the water infections – like burning when you pee, needing to go urgently, or blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, quite a few things, actually. The burning is definitely there when I go to the toilet, and I have to rush, almost immediately after feeling the need. And… yes, sometimes there’s a bit of blood, a little bit, you see. Not a lot, but enough to notice. It worries me, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning, urgency, and blood in the urine with the infections. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions before, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor, a few years back – about the same time as the pain started, I believe – he told me I have something with my kidneys. Polycystic… something. Polycystic Kidney Disease, that was it. He said it means I have little sacs on my kidneys. I don’t really understand all the details, to be honest. He said it's something I’d just have to manage. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important! Polycystic Kidney Disease explains a lot. Okay, we'll definitely need to consider that. Do you remember if he recommended any specific monitoring or treatment for the PKD at the time?
PATIENT: Hmm, he said to keep an eye on my blood pressure, and to drink plenty of water. He also said to come back if I had any pain, which… well, here I am. He didn’t really say much else, to be honest. Just that it's something that runs in the family, and to be aware of it. I don’t think he did any specific tests just for the PKD, just the usual blood pressure check and urine sample when I came in for other things.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure monitoring and water intake. Good. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. Nothing like that. I've been very lucky, apart from this kidney business and these troublesome infections, of course. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a very long time ago, but that was it. Nothing since.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter ones or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a couple of things. I take a tablet for my blood pressure, losartan, I think it’s called. And when these water infections flare up, the doctor gives me antibiotics. That’s it, really. I don’t take anything else. I try to stay away from pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, losartan for blood pressure and antibiotics as needed for water infections. Let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. I've never had any bad reactions to anything. I eat most things, and I've never had any trouble with any medication. I'm quite fortunate that way, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had kidney trouble, as I said. I think it was something similar to what I have, but the doctors didn’t explain much back then. It was a long time ago. My father was healthy, as far as I know. And I have three brothers, but they’re all doing alright, no kidney problems that I'm aware of. It’s funny, you see, it skipped a generation.
DOCTOR: Okay, kidney trouble in your mother, skipped a generation. And finally, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I live on my own, in a small house just outside of town. I’m retired now, used to be a receptionist at the hospital. I don't do much strenuous activity these days, mostly gentle gardening and a bit of walking. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a small glass of wine with my dinner sometimes. I try to eat a healthy diet, lots of fruit and vegetables. I don’t go out much, prefer to keep to myself, really. Peaceful life, if you please.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Mr. Espinueva. Thank you for giving me such a detailed history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then I'll gently feel your abdomen. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I’ll do as you say. I trust your judgement. It's good to get things checked, you see. It puts my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva, your heart and lungs sound good. Your blood pressure is a little bit high, which we can discuss. I felt some tenderness in your sides, especially when I pressed on your flanks, which is consistent with the pain you described. Your abdomen is a little bit full, but not alarmingly so. I’m going to order some lab work now. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and a urine analysis to look for infection and blood. We'll also need to repeat a urine culture. I’d also like to order a renal ultrasound, to get a better look at your kidneys and see how the PKD has progressed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. All those tests… it's good to be thorough. I trust your judgement completely. When will I know the results? And… will I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: The lab results should be back within a couple of days, and the ultrasound will take a little longer – maybe a week or so. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you once the results are in. We can discuss them then and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of antibiotics for your current water infection, just to get that under control. I'll also advise you to increase your fluid intake even more than you already do - aim for at least eight glasses of water a day. I want to stress that we are still gathering information, but given your history of PKD and frequent infections, we need to be proactive. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good indeed, Doctor. Antibiotics for the infection and more water… I can manage that. And a follow-up appointment… excellent. I feel much better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of things. Thank you for your time and attention. You’ve put my mind at ease. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could help. At this point, just focus on staying hydrated and taking the antibiotics as prescribed. Also, try to avoid any strenuous activity that might aggravate your pain. If you develop a fever, severe back pain, or notice any blood in your urine that is more than a small amount, please contact the clinic immediately. We always want to err on the side of caution. Here's a prescription for the antibiotics, and the nurse will give you a list of instructions before you leave. Do you have any further questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything. I appreciate your thoroughness and your kind explanations. You’ve been very reassuring. Thank you again for everything. I'll see you at the follow-up appointment.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns before your follow-up. Take care, and have a good day.
