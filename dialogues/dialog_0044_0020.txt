DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. I… how you say… this is a check-up, yes? My insurance, Medicare, they said I need to have this… talk with a doctor. My husband, he always did this, but… he is gone now. I just want to make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. A check-up is a great idea, and it’s very smart of you to get one scheduled, especially with the change in things. It sounds like you're mostly here for a general wellness visit, making sure everything is as it should be. I see here you're 57 years old. And I have your height and weight listed as 196 centimeters and 80 kilograms, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. One-ninety-six… and eighty kilograms. It is… a lot, maybe? But I am tall, you see. Always have been. My mother, she was tall too. Is that… bad? I do not know these numbers very well.
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily bad at all, Ms. Benites. Height does play a role, and you are right, being tall means your weight can be a bit higher and still be healthy. We use something called Body Mass Index, or BMI, to get a better idea. Let me just calculate that quickly… Okay, your BMI is 20.7. That falls within the healthy weight range. So, no immediate concerns there. Now, to get a good picture of your overall health, I'd like to ask a few questions. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is good to hear about the numbers. Okay, questions are fine. I will try to answer them the best I can. Sometimes my memory… it is not so good, you understand? But I will try. What do you want to know?
DOCTOR: Of course, that’s perfectly understandable. We'll take our time, and there's no rush at all. I’ll also be documenting everything, so don’t worry about repeating things unnecessarily. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My husband, he had problems with his heart, but not me. I had… a bad back, a long time ago. I went to a… a specialist, for that. They gave me pills, and it got better. Not now, though. It is okay, mostly. And… I think that is it. Nothing else that I remember. I had the usual, you know, colds and flus, but nothing serious. Doctor always said I was strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. A history of back problems, but currently doing well. And no other major medical diagnoses. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never. I… I do not like hospitals. My mother, she had a surgery on her knee, and it was very bad. I always said I would avoid them if I could. So, no surgeries for me. Never have, never will, if I can help it!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Ms. Benites. No surgeries at all. Alright. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there a history of any significant medical conditions in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that in your parents, siblings, or other close relatives?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he smoked. He died of… something with his lungs, I think. The doctor said it was the smoking. My mother, she lived a long time, but she had problems with her bones, I think. She broke her hip, and then she was never the same. I had one brother, but he died when he was young, in an accident. He was healthy, though, as far as I know. No… no cancer in my family, I don’t think. Not that I remember. It was a long time ago, you understand?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Father with lung problems due to smoking, mother with bone issues and a hip fracture, and a brother who passed away young. No known history of cancer. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? Like… what I eat? Or what I do all day? I live alone now, since my husband passed. I mostly stay home. I like to garden, when the weather is nice. And I… I watch television. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables and… chicken. Not too much red meat, you know? I drink tea, lots of tea. I do not smoke, never have. And I do not drink alcohol, either. My husband, he liked his beer, but not me. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I wanted to know, Ms. Benites. That’s very helpful. So, you live alone, enjoy gardening, watch television, eat a healthy diet with lots of vegetables and tea, and don't smoke or drink alcohol. That all sounds very good. Now, one last question for this part. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I do not like mushrooms, but that is not an allergy, just a preference! And no allergies to pills, either. I have taken many pills in my life, for my back, and for little things, but never had a reaction. I am very lucky, I think. No allergies at all.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Ms. Benites. No known allergies. Okay, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a few other basic things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Physical exam is good. I always go to the doctor for check-ups, you know? To make sure everything is working. You can listen to my heart and lungs, and check my… blood pressure. Whatever you need to do. Just be gentle, please. My bones, they are not as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Benites, I will be very gentle. Alright. If you could just sit back and relax on the examination table, that would be wonderful. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130 over 78. That’s slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning. We can keep an eye on it. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Throat is clear, ears are normal. Everything sounds good so far, Ms. Benites. I don't hear or feel anything concerning. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to order a few basic blood tests – a complete blood count, a chemistry panel, and a thyroid test. Just to check your overall health and make sure everything is functioning properly. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, blood tests are fine. My doctor always did blood tests, you know? To make sure everything is okay. Complete blood count, chemistry… and thyroid. Whatever you think is best. I trust you, Doctor. Just… tell me when I need to go to get them done. And… how long will it take to get the results? I hope it is not too long. I do not like to wait.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Benites. I’m glad you trust me. I’m ordering those tests for you now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’re expecting you. You don’t need an appointment. Just tell them Dr. Asami ordered the tests. They'll draw some blood, and it should only take about 15-20 minutes. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for them to come back. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, or anything else that concerns you – please don’t hesitate to call the office right away. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. Three to five days… that is okay. And I will call if something is wrong. You explained everything very well, Doctor. Thank you for being so gentle and patient with me. It makes me feel much better, you know? It is… hard being alone. I think that is all. Perhaps… perhaps you could tell me a little about yourself? What made you become a doctor?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. And you're right, it can be hard being alone. That’s a very kind question. Well, I grew up in Egypt, and my grandmother was a traditional healer. She always helped people in our village with herbs and remedies. I was fascinated by her ability to make people feel better, and I think that’s where my interest in medicine began. I came to the United States to get a formal medical education, and I’ve been practicing internal medicine for about 25 years now. I really enjoy getting to know my patients and helping them navigate their health concerns. It’s very rewarding. But enough about me! Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Egypt… that sounds very beautiful. I always wanted to travel. My husband, he never liked to leave home. He said it was too much trouble. But I always dreamed of seeing the world. No, I do not think there is anything else. You have been very helpful, Doctor. I will go to the lab now, and get the blood tests done. And I will wait for your nurse to call. Thank you again. You are a very good doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And I hope you have a good day. Take care now.
