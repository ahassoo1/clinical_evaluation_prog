DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 51 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that's right, 51. Well, it’s a bit… strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and I’ve been kind of yellow, you know, in my skin and eyes. And it always seems to happen after I eat fava beans. It’s really worrying me.
DOCTOR: Yellowing of the skin and eyes… and this correlates with the consumption of fava beans, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It's like… the more I eat, the more yellow I get. And then I just feel really weak. It's happened a couple of times now, and I thought I should get it checked out, just in case. I don't know what it could be, exactly. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Weakness in conjunction with jaundice… and a dietary link to fava beans is… noteworthy. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your stool colour, Ms. Haggar?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really abdominal pain. I haven't been sick, no vomiting. My… stool? It looked normal, I think. Maybe a little paler than usual, now that you mention it, but I didn't really pay much attention. I mostly just feel tired and… worried, honestly. Is this something I should be really concerned about? I haven't had any other symptoms, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any dark urine, Ms. Haggar?
PATIENT: Dark urine… you know, I think so, actually. Yes, now that you ask, it has been a bit darker than usual. Not dramatically, but… yeah, a bit darker. I hadn’t really thought anything of it, I just figured I was maybe not drinking enough water. But it’s definitely been darker than normal, especially after… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Dark urine, fatigue, jaundice following fava bean consumption… This is suggestive, Ms. Haggar, though we need to rule out other possibilities. Have you had any previous medical conditions diagnosed?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, and I broke my wrist once, but that’s about it. Nothing serious, nothing chronic. No allergies that I know of, and I don't take any medications regularly. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest, which is why this is so strange. I’ve never had anything like this happen before.
DOCTOR: No significant medical history, no allergies, no medications… Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother had some trouble with her stomach when she was older, but I don’t know what exactly. My father was healthy as a horse, really. And my brother… he’s fine, as far as I know. Nothing really stands out, honestly. We're Romanian, you know, and things weren't always… well, kept on record very well, if that makes sense. So I don't have a lot of details. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It's… acceptable, Ms. Haggar. We’ll proceed regardless. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Specifically, I’m going to palpate your abdomen to check for tenderness or enlargement of the liver or spleen, and I’ll also examine the sclera of your eyes to confirm the degree of jaundice. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to figure out what's going on, and get back to feeling normal again. I'm happy to do whatever tests you need. Just… please be gentle, my stomach's a bit sensitive already, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Haggar. I will be as gentle as possible. Now, I’m just feeling for any tenderness or enlargement. Take a deep breath for me, please. Alright… There is mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant, and I can feel a slight enlargement of the liver. And yes, as suspected, there is definite jaundice present. The sclera are notably yellowed. Alright. These findings are… suggestive of G6PD deficiency. It's a genetic condition that affects red blood cells and can be triggered by certain foods, like fava beans. However, we need to confirm this with a blood test.
PATIENT: G6PD… deficiency? What does that… mean exactly? Is that serious? And what kind of blood test? Will it be painful? I'm a little scared now, Doctor. Fava beans… I always loved them. If that's what's causing this, will I have to… stop eating everything I like?
DOCTOR: Ms. Haggar, it means a deficiency in an enzyme that protects your red blood cells. It’s not uncommon, particularly in certain populations. As for seriousness, it can cause hemolytic anemia – essentially, your red blood cells are being destroyed faster than they can be replaced. However, it's manageable with some dietary modifications. We’ll perform a simple blood draw to confirm the diagnosis. It’s a standard test, and the discomfort is minimal – a brief pinprick, really. And yes, you may need to avoid fava beans and certain other substances. It’s a small price to pay for your health, wouldn’t you agree?
PATIENT: A small price… well, I suppose so. But fava beans are… important to me. My grandmother used to make them every spring. But if it’s truly necessary, I understand. A blood draw… okay. Where will you take it from? And how long will it take to get the results? I just… I’d like to know what to expect, you know? And what other substances should I be avoiding, if it is G6PD deficiency? I don't want to accidentally make things worse.
DOCTOR: The blood draw will be from your arm, a standard venipuncture. It will take approximately five to ten minutes. Results usually take between 24 and 48 hours, depending on the laboratory workload. As for substances to avoid, beyond fava beans, certain medications – sulfa drugs, for example – can also trigger a reaction. We'll provide you with a comprehensive list once we have a confirmed diagnosis. Now, I’ll write the order for the blood test. Please proceed to the laboratory, and they will take care of the rest. Do you have any other questions, Ms. Haggar?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it for now, Doctor. Just… thank you. For explaining everything, even if… well, even if you seemed a little impatient. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I'll go to the lab now. Where exactly is the lab, please? Is it far?
DOCTOR: It’s just down the hall, Ms. Haggar, third door on the left. You can't miss it. It’s a standard procedure, really. Don’t worry yourself unduly. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Thank you again. .
