DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine. Well, I received a letter… a notice, really, about an unusual test result from a gastrointestinal examination I had recently. It mentioned something was… not quite right, and suggested I schedule a visit. I confess, I’m not entirely sure what it means, but I wanted to have it checked out, of course. I do hope you can explain things clearly for me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Minatra. I’m happy to help clarify things. To start, could you tell me when you had this gastrointestinal examination?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was… June 12th, I believe. Yes, June 12th of this year. At Saint Jude’s Hospital, with Dr. Ramirez. A very thorough gentleman, Dr. Ramirez. He seemed quite concerned when he ordered the follow-up, which is why I’m here, naturally.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I will make a note of that. I can pull up the results from Saint Jude’s. Just one moment. …Okay, I see here a colonoscopy performed on June 12th with Dr. Ramirez. The report indicates the presence of multiple polyps were found, and one was concerning enough to warrant further investigation. Do you recall Dr. Ramirez discussing the polyps with you at the time of the procedure?
PATIENT: Yes, he did mention… something about growths. He said “polyps”, I believe that was the word. And he spoke of removing them, which he did. He did say one was a little… different. Larger, perhaps? And that’s why he wanted me to see someone – a specialist, I think he called it – to ensure everything was alright. I was rather groggy afterward, I’m afraid, so the details are a bit hazy. But I do remember him saying not to worry too much, just to get it checked.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. It’s good he removed the polyps. We’ll certainly investigate the one he found concerning. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Well, that’s the curious thing, Doctor. I haven’t been experiencing any noticeable symptoms at all. No pain, no changes in my… habits, if you understand. No fatigue, no weight loss. Nothing. That’s what makes this so perplexing. I feel perfectly well, honestly. Which is why I was so surprised by the test results. Perhaps it was a false alarm? Though Dr. Ramirez seemed rather serious, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you're feeling well, Ms. Minatra, but it’s important we investigate any abnormalities regardless. Polyps don’t always cause symptoms, especially not in their early stages. Let’s move through a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I've been quite fortunate in my health, all my life, really. A bit of arthritis in my hands, as one gets older, but nothing serious. And a touch of high blood pressure, years ago, but that was easily managed with diet and exercise. Dr. Hernandez, my previous physician, always said I was remarkably healthy for my age. He retired a few years ago, unfortunately. That’s when I had to find a new doctor, and things haven’t quite been the same since, to be honest. But as for any diagnoses… no, nothing major.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… just the removal of my tonsils when I was a little girl. And a hysterectomy, many, many years ago. That was… 1978, I believe. Other than those two procedures, no, nothing else. They were both fairly routine, as I recall. Nothing complicated.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That's a difficult question, Doctor. My family… we didn’t keep very good records, I'm afraid. We came from a very rural area in Mexico, and medical care wasn't readily available. My parents both passed away when I was quite young, and I don’t recall any specific illnesses they suffered from. My mother, I believe, had some issues with her stomach, but it was never properly diagnosed. As for my siblings… well, my brother immigrated to the United States many years ago, and I haven’t seen him in decades. I don't know anything about his health. So, unfortunately, I can’t provide you with much information regarding family history. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Minatra. We can proceed without it. Now, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I am widowed, as you know. My husband, Ricardo, passed away ten years ago. It was a great loss, naturally. We didn’t have any children. I live alone, in a small house in the suburbs. I enjoy gardening, reading… and visiting with my friends. I used to be very active in the church, but I haven’t been as involved lately. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. And I try to get plenty of exercise, though my arthritis sometimes makes it difficult. I lead a quiet life, Doctor. A peaceful life, for the most part.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I am aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had any reactions to medications, and I can eat pretty much anything. Sometimes I get a bit of a rash from certain plants when I’m gardening, but that’s just a minor irritation. Nothing serious. I’ve never had a severe allergic reaction to anything in my life, thankfully. I’m rather fortunate in that regard, I believe. I've always been very careful about what I consume, and I avoid anything that might cause me discomfort.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a low dose of ibuprofen occasionally, for my arthritis. Perhaps two or three times a week, when my hands are particularly sore. And I take a multivitamin every morning, just to supplement my diet. That’s it, Doctor. Nothing else. I prefer to avoid taking medications whenever possible. I believe in natural remedies, when appropriate, and I try to manage my health through diet and exercise. I hope that answers your question thoroughly.
DOCTOR: Yes, it does, Ms. Minatra, thank you. Now, let's get back to the results from Saint Jude’s Hospital. The pathology report indicates that the polyp removed during your colonoscopy was a tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia. There were also multiple smaller polyps, but they were benign. Do you understand what I’ve said so far?
PATIENT: Tubular… adenoma? Dysplasia? Honestly, Doctor, no. I do not understand. I apologize. I’ve never been very good with medical terminology. I know it involved growths… and Dr. Ramirez removed them. But these terms… they’re completely unfamiliar to me. Could you perhaps explain it in simpler language? I’m afraid I’m a bit lost. I understand growths, I understand they took them out, but everything else… it’s a bit overwhelming. Perhaps if you tell me what that means for me?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Minatra, I apologize for using technical language. Let me explain it in simpler terms. An adenoma is a type of polyp - a growth on the lining of the colon. These are fairly common, and most are harmless. Dysplasia refers to the fact that some of the cells in the polyp were abnormal. It doesn't mean it's cancer, but it can potentially become cancerous over time if left untreated. The fact that it’s low-grade dysplasia means the abnormal cells weren’t very aggressive. Essentially, this polyp could potentially develop into cancer, but it’s a slow process, and it’s much more manageable when caught early, which you have done. That’s why Dr. Ramirez recommended a follow-up. Does that make more sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… a little clearer. So, it wasn’t cancer. And it’s not currently cancerous. But it could become cancerous, if left alone. That’s… concerning, naturally. But I’m relieved to hear it was caught early. So, what happens now, Doctor? What sort of treatment do I need? Will I need surgery again? Will there be… side effects? I apologize for all the questions, but I’m rather anxious about this. Knowing what it is, even if it’s not an immediate threat, is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, and your questions are very reasonable, Ms. Minatra. There’s no need to apologize at all. The standard approach in this situation is a follow-up colonoscopy, typically in one year, to ensure no new polyps have developed and to monitor the area where the previous polyp was removed. We'll need to repeat the bowel preparation, the same one you had previously, to clear your colon completely. Based on the pathology report, we don't need further surgery at this time. We can also discuss a blood test called a fecal immunochemical test, or FIT, that you can do at home annually to screen for any signs of blood in your stool, which could indicate the presence of polyps. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A follow-up colonoscopy in a year… that’s… manageable. I confess, I don’t look forward to the preparation, but if it’s necessary to ensure everything is alright, I’m willing to do it. And the blood test… the FIT test… that sounds quite convenient, actually. Something I can do at home. Yes, Doctor, that sounds acceptable. But… will I need any special diet restrictions before the colonoscopy? Or any medication adjustments? I take a low dose of ibuprofen, as I mentioned. And… are there any risks associated with the colonoscopy itself? I’ve had one before, but I don’t recall all the details.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ms. Minatra. For the colonoscopy, you'll need to follow a clear liquid diet for 24 hours prior to the procedure. You'll also need to take a strong laxative to completely empty your colon. We'll provide you with detailed written instructions outlining the exact steps. Regarding your ibuprofen, you should stop taking it 5 days before the procedure, as it can increase the risk of bleeding. As for the risks associated with colonoscopy, they are generally very low. The most common risks include abdominal discomfort, bloating, and mild bleeding. There is a very rare risk of perforation, or a tear in the colon, but this is extremely uncommon. We take all necessary precautions to minimize these risks, and we'll be monitoring you closely throughout the procedure. I’m happy to address any further concerns you may have. Would you like me to schedule the follow-up colonoscopy now?
PATIENT: Five days before… I can manage that. And a clear liquid diet… I’ve done that before, though I don’t relish the thought. And the risks… yes, I understand. It’s all rather… daunting, but I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. Yes, Doctor, if you wouldn’t mind scheduling the follow-up colonoscopy now, I would appreciate that. Perhaps sometime in… July of next year? That would give me plenty of time to prepare. And to stop taking the ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let me check the availability. Okay, we have a few openings in July. Would July 15th at 9:00 AM work for you?
PATIENT: July 15th… yes, that should be fine. 9:00 AM is perfectly acceptable. Wonderful. Thank you, Doctor. I feel much better now that we have a plan in place. Is there anything else I need to do or know before the procedure? Any paperwork I need to fill out? Or any dietary restrictions I need to begin now, other than stopping the ibuprofen five days beforehand?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will have the receptionist send you a packet of information including the pre-colonoscopy instructions, a consent form, and some medical history questionnaires to fill out before your appointment. Please bring those with you, along with a list of any medications you are currently taking. There are no other dietary restrictions you need to begin now, just stop the ibuprofen five days before the procedure. Do you have any further questions for me at this time, Ms. Minatra?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and patient with my questions, and I appreciate it very much. I feel much more at ease now that we have a plan in place and I know what to expect. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I’m glad I came in to see you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Minatra. I'm glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, please don't hesitate to call the office. We're here to help. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in July.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. I certainly will, and I appreciate your kindness and patience. Goodbye, Doctor Shely. And thank you again.
