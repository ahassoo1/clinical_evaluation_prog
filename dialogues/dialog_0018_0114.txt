DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It's a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Stilaire. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I’m here because of my breathing. It’s troublesome when I try to lie flat. It feels… constricted, you might say. I don't like it at all.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constriction when lying flat is certainly concerning, Ms. Vanderwiele. Thank you for sharing that with me. Can you tell me more about this troublesome breathing?
PATIENT: Well, it isn’t constant, you understand. Only when I’m… horizontal. If I sit up, or even lean back a little bit in my chair, it’s perfectly fine. But if I attempt to recline… it becomes difficult. Almost as if something is pressing on my chest. It started, oh, perhaps a month ago? Maybe a little longer. I don't keep precise track, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Ms. Vanderwiele. The positional aspect – only occurring when lying flat – is particularly important. And roughly a month’s duration… alright. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the sensation more precisely?
PATIENT: Precisely… yes. That’s a good word. It's not a pain, exactly. More… a tightness. A squeezing, perhaps? Like a band around my chest, though not a painful band. It makes it harder to take a full breath, you see. I find myself… conscious of each inhale and exhale. It’s unsettling. And it sometimes wakes me up at night when I roll over. It’s a nuisance, truly. I don’t want to be a bother, but it is impacting my sleep.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Vanderwiele. That sounds very unsettling, and impacting your sleep is certainly something we need to address. A tightness and squeezing sensation, positional, occurring for about a month, and waking you at night… alright. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this breathing difficulty?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me consider. Well, my ankles have been a little swollen lately. Not terribly so, mind you. Just… puffier than usual. I thought it might be the heat, honestly. And I tire more easily. Climbing the stairs, for instance. It’s… more effort than it used to be. But other than that… no. No coughing, no wheezing, no chest pain, nothing like that. Just the breathing and the swelling and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Vanderwiele. That’s all very useful information. Swelling in the ankles and increased fatigue alongside the breathing difficulties… Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Medical history… Well, I had a bout of pneumonia many years ago. Perhaps forty years ago? It was quite serious at the time, but I recovered fully. Other than that… nothing major. My doctor always said my blood pressure was a little elevated, but nothing requiring medication. Just to watch my salt intake. And my knees… they are aging, naturally. But no formal diagnoses, if that makes sense. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting older. I have Medicare, if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Vanderwiele. Pneumonia forty years ago, mildly elevated blood pressure, and age-related knee discomfort… And thank you for letting me know about your Medicare coverage. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: Let me see... I had my gallbladder removed, oh, goodness, twenty-five years ago? It was a relatively minor procedure, thankfully. Other than that… no hospitalizations. Nothing that required a lengthy stay. Just the routine things, you understand. A broken wrist as a child, a few stitches here and there… But nothing significant. No serious operations, if that's what you're asking. I pride myself on being quite healthy, despite my age. Or, relatively healthy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Vanderwiele. Gallbladder removal twenty-five years ago, and otherwise no significant surgical history… Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a difficult question. My mother had… heart trouble, I believe. She passed away when I was quite young, so I don't have many details. It was before all this… modern medicine, you understand. And my father… he was a strong man, but he had diabetes later in life. That's all I recall, truthfully. No one else, to my knowledge, had any particularly serious ailments. It’s a small family. My brother passed away several years ago from… an accident. Not a health issue. I hope that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Vanderwiele. I appreciate you sharing that, despite it being difficult. A family history of heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your father… Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… I live alone, in my own home. I try to stay active, although it's becoming more difficult. I enjoy gardening, when the weather permits. And I do a bit of… cross-stitch. It keeps my hands busy. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I try to eat a balanced diet, although I do indulge in sweets occasionally. I'm a member of the Zuni Pueblo, and we have… certain traditions, you understand. I try to maintain those. That’s about it, truthfully. A quiet life. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: That is very sufficient, Ms. Vanderwiele. A quiet, active life, gardening, cross-stitch, healthy habits… And it’s wonderful that you maintain your traditions. One last question about your medical background, if you don’t mind. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, thankfully. And no food allergies either. I eat most things. Dust bothers me a little, sometimes, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Just a bit of a sniffle. Nothing serious. I pride myself on having a… robust constitution. Is that adequate? I'm rather impatient to be finished, if you don't mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Vanderwiele, that is perfectly adequate. No known allergies… And I apologize for the length of these questions; I just want to be as thorough as possible. Now, with your permission, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and examine your ankles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that will be… acceptable. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon. And I would prefer to remain seated, if possible. My knees aren't what they used to be. I trust you understand. Let's proceed, then. I hope you'll be quick.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. We will keep it as brief as possible, and you can certainly remain seated. I understand about your knees. Alright, Ms. Vanderwiele, your heart rate is a little quick, and I’m hearing slightly diminished breath sounds. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated at 148/82, and I’m noting some mild swelling in your ankles. I also notice some slight discoloration of the skin on your lower legs. Based on what you’ve told me, and my initial examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms related to heart failure. The shortness of breath when lying flat, the swelling in your ankles, the fatigue, and the diminished breath sounds are all consistent with this. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm this diagnosis. I would like to order an EKG, a chest X-ray, and some blood work, including a BNP level to assess your heart function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. I’ve never been seriously ill. Is it… is it curable? And what does all that testing entail? An EKG… isn't that where they attach things to your chest? I don't like things attached to my chest. And blood work… well, that's just unpleasant, isn't it? I don’t understand… what caused this? I live a quiet life! I just want to breathe normally again. Explain, please. And quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Vanderwiele. It is concerning to hear that term, and I apologize if I caused you alarm. Heart failure doesn't necessarily mean your heart is stopping; it means your heart isn't pumping as efficiently as it should be. It's often a gradual process, and it is often manageable with medication and lifestyle changes. As for the testing, yes, an EKG involves placing small stickers on your chest to record your heart’s electrical activity. It's painless, and it only takes a few minutes. The blood work will involve taking a small sample of blood from your arm. It’s not comfortable, but it’s relatively quick as well. As for the cause, there are many potential causes. It can be related to high blood pressure over time, previous heart problems, or other medical conditions. Sometimes, it develops without a clear cause. We’ll need the test results to determine the specific cause in your case. For now, I want you to try to rest and avoid strenuous activity. We’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible, and then we can discuss a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Treatment plan… So, medication? I don’t want to take a lot of medication. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. And strenuous activity… I barely do any! Gardening isn't strenuous. And what if it’s… serious? What if I need to go to the hospital? I don't want to be in the hospital. And about the tests… can they be done today? I have an appointment this afternoon, as I mentioned. Will the results be available quickly? I really need to know. I don't like uncertainty. And can I have a copy of the test results for my own records? I like to be informed.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about medication and hospitalization, Ms. Vanderwiele, and I assure you we will discuss all available options before making any decisions. We can certainly explore natural remedies in addition to, or in some cases, as an alternative to medication, but it’s important to be realistic about their effectiveness. And we will only consider hospitalization if absolutely necessary. I will do my best to expedite the testing. The lab is quite efficient, and I expect the results should be available within 24-48 hours. I will have my nurse call you as soon as they are available. And yes, absolutely, you are entitled to a copy of your test results. We will provide you with a complete copy for your records. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. I will write you an order for the EKG, chest X-ray, and blood work. My nurse will assist you in scheduling these tests and answer any questions you may have. Do you have any other questions for me at this moment?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that will be all for now. Just get the tests done quickly, please. And make sure they are gentle. My knees… well, you understand. And could the nurse explain the process to me in detail? I don’t like surprises. I suppose I’ll go now. Thank you… I think. I still don’t like the sound of heart failure. But thank you. Let’s hope for the best. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. I will personally speak with the nurse to ensure she explains the process thoroughly and answers all your questions. And I will do my best to expedite the results. I understand your concerns, and I share your hope for the best. We will work together to determine the cause of your symptoms and develop a treatment plan that is right for you. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your results are available. Take care, Ms. Vanderwiele, and we will be in touch soon.
