DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Obarr, is it?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s me. Norval Obarr. Though most folks just call me Norval. It’s good to meet you, Doctor… Batara, is it? I was told you were the one to see about… well, about not being able to eat much anymore.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s not waste time with pleasantries, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Sorry. Didn't mean to take up your time. It just... started happening a few months back, I guess. I get full awful quick. Even a small plate of food, and I feel like I’ve eaten a feast. It’s… unsettling. Makes it hard to enjoy anything.
DOCTOR: A few months… and before that?
PATIENT: Before that… well, I always had a good appetite. Always liked my food, you know? Fish, berries, whatever my wife, Elsie, cooked up. Never had trouble finishing a plate. It just… changed. Not suddenly, mind you. Slowly at first. I’d feel a bit full sooner than usual. Then it got worse, quicker and quicker. Now, it's like… two or three bites and I gotta stop. It's strange. I don’t want to stop, but my stomach just… tells me to.
DOCTOR: And has your weight changed at all during this time?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. I've lost weight. Elsie's been worried sick about it, she has. I used to be a good solid 150, maybe a bit more. Now… well, I haven’t weighed myself lately, but my clothes are getting awfully loose. She says I’m looking thin as a rail, and she’s probably right. It's not like I'm trying to lose weight. Quite the opposite, really.
DOCTOR: You said 150… and now?
PATIENT: Well, Elsie says I'm down closer to… oh, I’d guess around 130, maybe even less. It’s hard to say exactly, we don't have a fancy scale. Just the old one in the bathroom. It's a bit wonky, but it's enough to know I'm shrinking, that's for sure. And it's happening quick now, I think. It was slow at first, but the last couple of months… noticeable.
DOCTOR: And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I get a bit tired, maybe more tired than usual. But I'm 88, Doctor, so that could just be… old age, right? And sometimes, after I eat even a little bit, my stomach feels… kinda full and uncomfortable. Not painful, just… heavy. And Elsie says I've been a bit quiet lately, but I mostly just sit and think, so… I don’t know if that counts as a symptom. Oh! And I've been burping a lot. More than usual, anyway. Does that sound important?
DOCTOR: Burping. Yes, well. Let's try to be more precise, shall we?
PATIENT: Precise, you say? Right. Sorry. It's hard to explain. The burps... they don't bother me much, just… happen. And the stomach feeling, it's like a fullness, but not a painful fullness. More like… stretched. Like I ate too much, but I didn't. It happens pretty quick after I start eating, even if it's just a few mouthfuls. And the tiredness… it's not like I'm sick in bed tired, just… less energy. Don't feel like doing much. Mostly just sit and watch the tide come in. Elsie worries I'm getting weaker.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… now you’re asking. Hmm. I… haven’t really been paying much attention, to be honest. Elsie does most of the noticing in that department. But I think… I think they’ve been a bit… looser, maybe? Not diarrhea, exactly, but not as… solid as they used to be. And a bit less frequent, I guess. It’s hard to say for sure. Sorry, Doctor. I'm not much help on that one. I usually just… try to ignore it. Is that a bad thing?
DOCTOR: Ignoring things rarely makes them better, Mr. Obarr. Let’s move on. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. Never had that. And no nausea either. Not sick to my stomach, no. Just… the fullness. And the tiredness. And the weight loss. It’s mostly the not being able to eat that bothers me. I used to enjoy a good meal. Now… it's just frustrating. And Elsie's worried, and I don't like to see her worry. That's probably the worst part of it all, really. Is there something seriously wrong, Doctor? I'm a bit scared, to be honest.
DOCTOR: All right. Let’s have a quick look. Please lie down on the examination table. And try to relax. I need to feel your stomach.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Lie down, you say? Okay. Always hated doctors poking around, but… alright. Tryin’ to relax… just tryin’ to relax. It's a bit cold, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is… soft. Not particularly tender. No masses that I can feel. Bowel sounds are… present, but somewhat diminished. Hmmm.
PATIENT: Diminished, you say? That doesn’t sound good, does it? What does that mean? Is it serious? I… I don’t understand all this medical talk. Is there something blocking things up? Elsie always said my insides were a bit delicate. Is it my age? Is it… cancer? I’m sorry, Doctor, I didn’t mean to ask so many questions. I just… I’m worried sick.
DOCTOR: Mr. Obarr. Let's not jump to conclusions. Diminished bowel sounds can mean a number of things. It doesn't automatically mean cancer. It could be a simple slowing down of things, given your age. Now, I'm going to order some blood work and a stool sample. Just to rule things out. And I want you to get a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a fecal occult blood test. The lab will give you instructions. We'll also need to consider a possible endoscopy. But let's see what the blood work says first. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Endoscopy? What's that? Is that… a camera? Going inside? Oh dear. I… I don't like the sound of that one bit. But alright. If you think it's necessary. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Elsie always handled the medications. I might have reacted to something once, years ago, but I can’t remember what it was. A bit of a rash, maybe? Nothing serious. Mostly just take a little aspirin now and then for my knees, but no problems with that. No, no allergies, not that I’m aware of. And Elsie would know if there were any, she's got a good memory. Is this going to take long, Doctor? I'm not a fan of hospitals and doctors, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, the endoscopy is just to look at the lining of your stomach and small intestine. It's the best way to determine the cause of your symptoms. The lab will call you to schedule it. And I’ll have the nurse give you instructions on how to prepare. It involves fasting, of course. I'm also going to order a CT scan of your abdomen. Just to rule out anything more serious. It’s standard procedure. Now, let's talk about your medications. You said you take aspirin. How much, and how often?
PATIENT: Oh dear, a CT scan too? That sounds… serious. Elsie isn’t going to like this. She worries about radiation. I... I don’t want to be poked and prodded and scanned if I don't have to. As for the aspirin, it’s just a little bit. One or two of those little white tablets, maybe three if my knees are really bothering me. It’s the kind you can get at any store, not a prescription. I take it when they ache, usually in the evenings. Not every day, mind you. Just when I need it. Elsie gets it for me, so I don’t really know the exact dose. Just a little bit to take the edge off. Is all this really necessary, Doctor? I'm just an old man with a funny stomach, not a complicated case, surely?
DOCTOR: "Just an old man"?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh dear. I didn't mean… I just… I'm worried. It’s all happening so fast. All these tests… it feels like something is seriously wrong. And Elsie is going to be beside herself. She doesn’t like me going to the doctor, she says it never does any good. I just… I get anxious, that’s all. And I tend to ramble when I’m nervous. I didn't mean to dismiss my problems, or disrespect you, Doctor. I just… I'm a bit scared. I'm an old man, yes, but I still want to enjoy my life, and not spend it in hospitals and waiting rooms. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Mr. Obarr. I understand you're anxious. But dismissing your symptoms as "just an old man" is not helpful. Weight loss, diminished appetite, changes in bowel habits… these are not normal signs of aging. And we need to rule out serious causes. I'm going to order these tests, regardless of your concerns. It's the responsible thing to do. I'll explain everything to Elsie, and we'll work together to get you a diagnosis. Now, do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: Alright. You’re right. I shouldn’t dismiss it. Elsie always said I worry too much and don’t take things seriously enough. You're the doctor, and I trust your judgment. Do what you think is best. A primary care physician… hmm. Not really. We used to see Dr. Henderson, back in town, but he retired a few years back. And we haven’t really found anyone to replace him. Elsie handles most of the medical appointments, and she just uses walk-in clinics when we need something. I don’t see a doctor regularly, not unless something is really wrong. I suppose… I don’t have a primary care physician. Should I? Elsie always said they just want to give you more pills.
DOCTOR: Yes, you should have a primary care physician. Regular check-ups are important, even for "just an old man". Alright, I'm going to write you a referral to Dr. Chen. She's an excellent internist. And I'll send these test results to her once they're available. Now, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Dr. Chen, you say? Alright. I suppose that’s a good idea. Elsie will be glad. She always worries about me not seeing a doctor. Questions… hmm. Well… how long will it take to get the test results? And… will the tests be painful? And… will I have to go to the hospital? I don’t like hospitals. And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Should I change my diet? Should I be resting more? I just… I’m a bit overwhelmed, and I don’t want to do anything to make things worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. Let's go through this one at a time. The test results will take a few days, maybe a week or so. It depends on the lab. The blood work won't be painful, just a little prick. The CT scan is non-invasive, but you will need to lie still for a short period. And you might need to go to the hospital for the endoscopy, but we’ll discuss that in more detail once the blood work is back. For now, try to eat small, frequent meals. Avoid anything that upsets your stomach. And get some rest. I'm going to write you a prescription for a multivitamin. It won’t cure anything, but it can’t hurt. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Small meals… alright. And rest. Elsie will be glad to hear that. She always said I need to slow down. A multivitamin… that sounds sensible. Hmm… Yes, actually. One more question. Will these tests… will they tell me what’s wrong? Will they find out why I can't eat? I'm just… scared of not knowing. Elsie says I worry too much, but… it’s hard not to, when you don’t know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Mr. Obarr. That’s a perfectly reasonable question. And the answer is… yes, these tests should help us determine what’s wrong. We’ll get a clearer picture of your condition once we have the results. It might be something simple, or it might be something more complex. But we won’t know until we have all the information. I know this is scary, and it’s okay to be worried. But we’re going to work through this together, step by step. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Together… alright. That’s… good. That’s very good. Elsie will be glad to hear that too. No. No, I think that’s all. You’ve answered everything. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. I suppose I should go now? Elsie is probably worried sick.
DOCTOR: Yes, you should go. And please, try to relax. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Here’s a card with the clinic’s number. And remember, we're here to help. Have a good day, Mr. Obarr. And give Elsie my best.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
