DOCTOR: Good morning, Demondre. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, to be honest, I just… I was kinda curious, you know? I ain't really sick sick. Just wanted to get a check-up and see how things are doin'. Been workin' on the boats a while now, figured it couldn't hurt.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise of you, Demondre. Preventative care is excellent. It's good you're thinking proactively about your health. So, you're feeling generally well, but would like a comprehensive check-up?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Comprehensive sounds good. I mean, I lift a lot of heavy stuff with the oilin' and all, so I guess I want to make sure my body is holdin' up alright. No real complaints, just… wanna be sure. Everything feelin' okay, but you never know, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's always best to have a baseline understanding of your health, especially with physically demanding work. We’ll certainly do a thorough examination. To start, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbin' a tree, but that healed up fine. Other than that… nothing major, I don't think. Usual colds and stuff, but nothin' that needed a doctor or anything. I had the usual shots when I was little, I guess, goin' to school and all. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Demondre. A childhood broken arm and routine vaccinations are helpful information. Thank you. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mom's still around, she's doin' okay, a little bit of high blood pressure, I think. My dad, he passed away a few years back. He was… he had problems with his heart, I think. It was kinda sudden. And I got a sister, she's healthy as a horse, lives down south somewhere. That's pretty much it. Does knowin' about my dad's heart help? I ain't sure how much that matters.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Demondre. Family history is quite important, particularly with conditions like heart disease. Knowing your father had heart problems is useful information. We'll want to keep that in mind during your evaluation. Now, regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, sir. Don’t smoke. Tried it once, didn’t like it. And I don't really drink much, maybe a beer with the boys every once in a while, like on a special occasion. Definitely don’t do any of those other things, no. I try to stay pretty clean, you know? Gotta be sharp for workin’ on the boats.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Demondre. A healthy lifestyle is a great foundation. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. I don't really believe in takin' a bunch of pills unless I really need 'em. Just try to eat right, get enough sleep when I can, and stay busy. I've got some muscle aches sometimes after a long shift, but I just rub 'em out. No need for nothin’ extra, usually.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, Demondre. Before we proceed to the physical examination, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nah, not that I know of. I've eaten pretty much everything, and never had a reaction. I used to help my grandma in her garden, and I was always stickin’ my hands in the dirt. Never had no trouble with plants or nothin'. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. Hopefully. You gotta let me know if somethin' does happen, right?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And yes, absolutely, we will. Now, let’s move on to a brief physical examination. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general physical condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Go ahead. I ain't got nothin' to hide. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. Been workin' kinda hard lately, so things might be a little… tense. But I'm feelin' alright.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit up on the examination table, that would be wonderful. I'll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not overly concerning. Let's listen to your heart now. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'd like to examine your abdomen. Please lie back and relax. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure and family history of heart disease, I'd like to order some routine blood work. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. You're doin' a good job. Everything feels alright to me, so I trust your judgment. Blood work sounds smart, especially with my dad and all. Just let me know what I gotta do and where I gotta go. I ain't been to the doctor in a while, so I might need a little help with it. Is it somethin' I gotta schedule?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Demondre. I appreciate that. Yes, we'll need to draw some blood. We have a lab right here in the clinic, so we can do that today. I'll write you a lab order. The nurse will take you back and draw the blood. It will take only a few minutes. We'll check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and some basic kidney and liver function tests. We'll also do a complete blood count. Here is the lab order. Please take this to the nurse’s station, and she’ll get you set up. Do you have any questions before you head over there?
PATIENT: Nope, I think I got it. Just take this to the nurse, she'll do the rest. That sounds easy enough. Thanks a lot, Doctor. You made this whole thing a lot less scary than I thought it'd be. Appreciate you takin' the time. I'll go find the nurse now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Demondre. I'm glad I could help. We’ll review the results as soon as they come back, and we can discuss them in detail. Please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions along the way. Have a good day, and feel free to check in with the front desk if you need anything. .
