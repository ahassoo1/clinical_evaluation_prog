DOCTOR: Hi Westly, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Though I must admit, getting here was a bit of a journey. I’ve been… well, going to the restroom quite a bit lately. More than usual, certainly. It’s been… troublesome. I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it’s been on my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent restroom visits. That is troublesome. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Hmm… more than usual, you said. Can you tell me a little bit more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. More than usual… let me think. Normally, I suppose, it’s… a standard amount throughout the day. Perhaps three or four times. But lately… it feels like every hour or so. Perhaps even more frequent than that at times. And it’s… a considerable amount each time, if you understand me. I haven’t been… restricting fluids, if that’s relevant. I drink… water, mostly. And tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a noticeable increase from your usual three or four times a day to… every hour or so. And a larger volume each time. No change in your fluid intake – mostly water and tea. That’s helpful to know. Do you feel like you have a strong urge to go, or is it more of a gradual need?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. It's… difficult to say precisely. Sometimes it's a rather sudden, urgent feeling. A bit… alarming, actually. Other times, it builds up more slowly. I wouldn’t say painful, but… insistent. Yes, insistent is a good word. It’s… a bit unnerving, especially when I’m out and about. I find myself… planning routes with restroom access. It's become a habit, I suppose. A rather inconvenient one.
DOCTOR: Okay, so both a sudden urge and a gradual build-up. And it’s impacting your daily activities, needing to plan around restrooms. I understand that can be really disruptive. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… hmm. Let me see… I suppose not dramatically. It seems… reasonably clear, as far as I can tell. Perhaps a slightly darker shade than usual at times, but I attribute that to… not drinking enough water, perhaps? I wouldn't say there's any blood, or… anything unusual in terms of color or smell. Though my sense of smell isn’t what it once was. I’m afraid my recollections are rather vague on such details, Doctor. I do try to stay hydrated, but… perhaps I should be drinking even more?
DOCTOR: Okay, reasonably clear, perhaps a little darker at times, no blood or unusual smell. And you're trying to stay hydrated. That's good. It's perfectly alright that your recollections are vague, we'll try to piece things together. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you experienced any pain in your abdomen, lower back, or side?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not precisely. A bit of… discomfort sometimes, a dull ache, perhaps. Mostly in my lower back, I believe. But I attribute that to… old age, mostly. I do have a rather strenuous hobby, you see – gardening. Perhaps it's just a pulled muscle. It's not constant, and it’s not severe. I wouldn’t say it’s related to… the restroom issue, but… I thought I should mention it, just in case. I do try to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back discomfort related to gardening. Good to know. And you think it's separate from the frequent urination. Let's move on to your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult question, Doctor. My records are… rather scattered. I believe I had a bout of… bronchitis, many years ago. And perhaps some mild hypertension at one point, but it was… easily managed with diet, as far as I recall. Nothing… serious, I assure you. I’ve always been a rather healthy individual, despite my age. I don’t recall any specific diagnoses… like diabetes, no. I try to eat a balanced diet and get regular exercise – gardening, you see. But my memory… it fails me. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Westly. We’ll do our best to piece things together. No major diagnoses as far as you recall, mild hypertension managed with diet, and a bout of bronchitis. And you garden regularly, which is excellent. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I believe I had my… appendix removed, many years ago. As a young man. It was… a rather unpleasant experience, but thankfully uncomplicated. Aside from that… no, I don't recall any other surgeries. Nothing major, I assure you. I've always been fortunate in that regard. I tend to avoid hospitals whenever possible, if you understand me. A bit… unsettling, the whole atmosphere.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a young man. That’s good to know. And I understand your aversion to hospitals. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have had any medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney problems, or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s another area where my recollections are… hazy. My father… he suffered from… some heart trouble, as I recall. High blood pressure, perhaps? It was many years ago. My mother… she lived a long life, thankfully. I don’t recall any specific medical conditions on her side. I have a sister, but we haven’t spoken in… decades. I’m afraid I don’t know anything about her medical history. We lost touch a long time ago. I apologize for my vagueness, Doctor. It's… frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Westly. It’s perfectly alright. Knowing about your father’s heart trouble and high blood pressure is helpful. We can work with that. Now, just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see… No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had any adverse reactions to medications, as far as I can recall. I’ve taken… antibiotics, occasionally, for minor infections. And perhaps some pain relievers, for gardening-related aches and pains. But nothing… serious. No rashes, no difficulty breathing, no swelling. I’m fortunate in that regard, as well. It’s… reassuring, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're not currently taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. No, I’m not taking any medications at present. Just… herbal tea, occasionally, for relaxation. Nothing… prescribed, or anything of that nature. I prefer to… manage things naturally, whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Westly. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a quick neurological assessment. It’ll just take a few minutes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I suppose a quick examination is in order. I trust your judgment, of course. Do let me know if anything… feels uncomfortable, or if I need to adjust my position. I’m… not particularly fond of medical examinations, but I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Westly. I'll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you’re uncomfortable. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Sounds are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. I'm just feeling for any tenderness or masses… There’s a little bit of… mild discomfort in the lower abdomen, but nothing too concerning. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. Blood pressure is 140/85, and pulse is 72. Overall, the exam is unremarkable, but I do want to run a couple of tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Tests, you say? Oh. Very well. What sort of tests are we speaking about, Doctor? I confess, I'm not particularly fond of… needles, or any invasive procedures, if you understand me. Is it something… serious?
DOCTOR: Nothing too serious, Westly, I assure you. Just a standard set of tests to rule things out. I'd like to order a complete blood count , a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a urinalysis to look for any infection or abnormalities in your urine. And, given your age and symptoms, I also think it's prudent to do a prostate-specific antigen blood test to screen for prostate issues. The blood tests will require a small blood sample, and the urinalysis will just involve providing a urine sample. It’s all quite routine. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Routine, you say… yes, I suppose that's reassuring. A PSA test, you mentioned… for the prostate. Hmm. I confess, I hadn't considered… that. Very well, Doctor. If it's routine, and necessary, then I shall cooperate. Blood samples and… urine samples. I suppose I can manage that. Where do we begin?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll start with the blood draw. The nurse will come in shortly to take a sample from your arm. Then, I'll give you a cup, and you can provide a urine sample in the restroom. It's best to try and collect a mid-stream sample – that means you start urinating, then collect the sample mid-flow. I’ll give you instructions before you go. The results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Mid-stream sample, you say… yes, I believe I recall that instruction from… a previous examination, many years ago. Very well. No, I don’t believe I have any immediate questions, Doctor. Just… when will I hear about the results? A few days, you said? And will the nurse… explain the process? I confess, I’m not particularly adept at… medical procedures.
DOCTOR: Yes, a few days – typically 3 to 5 business days. The nurse will explain the blood draw process in detail, and she’ll be happy to answer any questions you have. And once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. We'll go over everything together. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of water – around 8 glasses a day – to help keep your urinary system flushed. Do you have any other concerns, Westly?
PATIENT: Eight glasses… yes, I can manage that. More tea, perhaps. No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for your… patience, and your thoroughness. I confess, I’m not the easiest of patients, with my… vague recollections and anxieties. But I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Westly. It's my pleasure. Don't worry about your recollections – it's perfectly alright. We'll work through this together. The nurse will be in shortly. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
