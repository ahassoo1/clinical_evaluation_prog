DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Fourney. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I requested this wellness panel myself, actually. I just turned seventy-four, you see, and I like to keep a close eye on things. Preventative care, as they say. I’m feeling quite well, all things considered, but I figured a thorough check-up couldn’t hurt.
DOCTOR: A wellness panel, hmm. Self-requested. That’s…uncommon. Most people come in when something is wrong, not before. Still. Alright. Let's get some details, just to be thorough. Can you tell me about any specific concerns you have, even if they're minor?
PATIENT: That's fair, Doctor. Most folks probably do wait until something aches, I suppose. It's just…my father, he wasn't one for doctors. He always said, “If it ain't broke, don't fix it.” And well, things do break eventually, don't they? Specific concerns… let me think. Nothing truly worrying, no. Perhaps a little less energy than I used to have, but I attribute that to the years. And occasionally, my knees protest a bit after a long day at the construction site. Nothing that a good night’s rest doesn't fix, though. I wouldn’t call those concerns, precisely. More…acknowledgements of aging, I think.
DOCTOR: “Acknowledgements of aging.” Right. And you’re still working at a construction site?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am. Been doing it for… well, nearly fifty years now. Started with my father, as I said, and I just never really left. It keeps me active, you see. Keeps the blood flowing. I wouldn’t know what to do with myself if I were retired and sitting around all day. Though, truth be told, the work is a little more strenuous these days than it used to be. But I manage. I'm careful.
DOCTOR: Fifty years… at a construction site. That's…a remarkably physical job for someone your age. Do you have any pain anywhere besides the knees?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor. I try to keep myself in good shape, though I admit, my bones aren’t what they once were. And you are right to ask about pain. My lower back sometimes gives me a bit of trouble after lifting heavy materials, but I’ve learned to pace myself and lift with my legs, not my back. I also find that a warm bath at the end of the day does wonders. It’s not constant, mind you, just…an occasional reminder that I’m not twenty years old anymore. And my hands, sometimes they ache a little. Just the usual wear and tear, I presume.
DOCTOR: “Usual wear and tear.” Of course. Alright, Mr. Mombrun. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I’ve been quite fortunate in that regard. My father always said good genes and hard work are the best medicine. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was a young man, stationed in Venezuela with the military, but I recovered fully. Otherwise, I’ve been remarkably healthy. I do have slightly high cholesterol, according to the last check-up my wife insisted on a few years back, but it’s manageable with diet, she says. Mostly avoiding fried foods and red meat, which is…difficult, I confess. But I try. Very important to keep my wife happy, you see.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia. High cholesterol… “manageable with diet.” And your wife manages that diet, I presume?
PATIENT: Indeed, Doctor, she does. My wife, Elena, is…thorough. A very practical woman. She keeps a close eye on what I eat, and she’s quite adept at preparing delicious, healthy meals. I wouldn’t be here today, quite possibly, if not for her nagging… I mean, encouragement. She’s a retired nurse, you see, so she knows a thing or two about keeping a man in good health. A very astute woman, Elena is. And a wonderful cook. I’ve learned not to argue with her about the importance of vegetables.
DOCTOR: Right. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Not a single one, thank goodness. I’ve always been careful on the job site, and I've always believed in letting my body heal naturally whenever possible. A few broken bones when I was a boy, climbing trees and getting into mischief, but those healed up just fine. Elena says I was a terror as a child, always running and jumping and refusing to stay still. She says I’m lucky I made it to seventy-four without needing a scalpel. I suppose she's right.
DOCTOR: Family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My mother’s side, they had a tendency towards heart disease. Her father, he passed away quite young from a heart attack, and several of her siblings also suffered from similar ailments. That’s why I’m particularly diligent about keeping my cholesterol in check, and why Elena is so strict about my diet, as well. My father’s side, they were mostly healthy, strong farmers and laborers. A few cases of arthritis, but nothing major. It’s the heart disease on my mother’s side that worries me the most, to be honest. It’s a concern I’ve carried with me for many years.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned being in the military. Any issues related to your service?
PATIENT: No major issues, Doctor. I served in the Venezuelan army during my early twenties, mostly administrative work, thankfully. A bit of basic training, but nothing too strenuous. I did have a minor injury to my shoulder during a field exercise, a slight dislocation, but it healed completely. No lingering pain or complications. No exposure to any hazardous materials, no head injuries, no psychological trauma. Just a young man doing his duty, as they say. It was a good experience, but I was glad to return home afterwards. A quiet life suits me better.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to a physical exam, then. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your reflexes. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you need. I'm at your service. Please, take your time. I'm a patient man, used to waiting for things to be done properly.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds… regular, but slightly strong. I’m detecting a faint murmur, which isn't necessarily cause for alarm given your age, but we'll need to monitor it. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Now, blood pressure. 145/90. A little elevated. Again, not immediately concerning, but something to keep an eye on. Let's check your reflexes now. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Good. Now, let's take a look at your hands and wrists. Do you experience any swelling or stiffness in your joints?
PATIENT: Sometimes, Doctor. Especially in the mornings, or after a particularly long day on the job site. My hands aren’t as nimble as they once were, that’s for certain. A little stiffness, a little ache, but nothing debilitating. Elena rubs them with some sort of liniment at night, which helps. And warm water, of course. Warm water is always good. The liniment she uses has… cloves, I think? A rather pungent smell, but it seems to do the trick. It's just the wear and tear of a lifetime of hard work, I presume.
DOCTOR: Right. And your grip strength?
PATIENT: Let me show you. Still respectable, I think, for an old man. I can still swing a hammer, still lift heavy materials, still build a sturdy wall. It’s not the grip of a young man, of course, but it's sufficient for the task at hand. It's a grip built on years of experience, years of hard work.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll run some blood work to get a clearer picture of your cholesterol levels and kidney function. And I'm going to order an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. We need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues, given your family history and the murmur I detected.
PATIENT: That sounds…thorough, Doctor. And wise. I appreciate your diligence. My wife, Elena, would be pleased to hear you’re being so cautious. She always said it’s better to be safe than sorry. An EKG, you said? Is that…painful? I've never had one before. Just want to know what to expect. Elena always likes to know what to expect, as well.
DOCTOR: No, it's not painful, Mr. Mombrun. It's a simple, non-invasive procedure. We’ll attach some electrodes to your chest, arms, and legs, and it will record your heart's electrical activity. It doesn't involve any needles, no discomfort whatsoever. It will take just a few minutes. The lab will call you to schedule the blood work. And the nurse will set up the EKG for you before you leave. Do you have any allergies to latex or adhesives?
PATIENT: Ah, good. No needles. Elena will be pleased to hear that as well. She's always been a bit squeamish around needles. And no, Doctor, no allergies to latex or adhesives that I'm aware of. I’ve never had any problems with either. My wife, however… she has a mild reaction to certain perfumes, but that’s hardly relevant in this case, is it? Perhaps it’s best to focus on my allergies. No, I don’t believe I have any significant ones. I can tolerate most things, thankfully. Though I do prefer a quiet, dust-free environment when possible. It's easier on the lungs, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's what we're doing. Complete blood count, lipid panel, kidney function tests, and an EKG. The nurse will go over everything with you in detail before you leave. We'll review the results in a week. If anything concerning arises, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment sooner. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's very thorough, as I said. No, I don’t believe I have any questions at this time. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Perhaps… one small thing, if you don’t mind. When you say “lipid panel,” is that the cholesterol test? Just want to be sure I understand everything correctly. Elena likes me to be precise with these things, you see. And I want to be prepared when she asks.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Mombrun. A lipid panel is a cholesterol test. It measures your total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. It’s a comprehensive assessment of your fat levels in the blood. Are we clear now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly clear. Cholesterol. LDL, HDL, triglycerides… I shall remember them all. Elena will be pleased. She’s always said knowledge is power. And I intend to be well-informed. Thank you for your patience, Doctor. I know I can be a bit…inquisitive. I believe that concludes my questions for now. I shall await the results with… optimism. And I'm sure Elena will have a few questions of her own when they arrive.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the discharge instructions and schedule your follow-up appointments. Have a good day, Mr. Mombrun.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. Goodbye.
