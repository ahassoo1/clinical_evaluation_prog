DOCTOR: Hi Lucia, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... I keep... belching. It's embarrassing, really. I just... burp ...see? Like that. It happens a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It can be really disruptive when that happens. And it's perfectly okay to talk about these things – we’re here to figure out what’s going on. “A lot” is a little vague though – could you tell me roughly how often you're experiencing this belching?
PATIENT: Hmm... every day, I think. Maybe... five or six times? Sometimes more if I eat something... big. Or drink soda. But even when I don't, it still happens. Not always after eating, you know? Sometimes just... when I'm sitting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so several times a day, even independent of meals sometimes. And it seems to be worse with bigger meals or soda, but it happens regardless. Have you noticed anything else that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Let me think... um... when I'm nervous, maybe? Like if I have to talk to people I don't know very well. Then it's really bad. I don't think anything makes it better, actually. I tried drinking water... but it doesn't really help.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s exacerbated by nervousness, and water doesn’t seem to provide much relief. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the belching?
PATIENT: Other symptoms... hmm. Sometimes my stomach feels... full. Even when I haven't eaten much. And a little... bubbly? Not painful, just... weird. I don't have... heart burn. No pain, really. Just the fullness and the bubbles.
DOCTOR: Okay, fullness and a bubbly sensation in your stomach, no heartburn or pain. That’s helpful. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That's fine. Ask away.
DOCTOR: Great. First, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the flu once, a long time ago. And I broke my arm when I was little. But nothing... serious. No doctor ever told me I had anything, if that makes sense. Just the normal things, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chronic medical conditions. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had one.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives have any medical problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... my grandmother had... high blood pressure, I think. And my uncle, he has diabetes. But that's all I can really remember. My mom was always pretty healthy, and my dad... well, he passed away a long time ago. I don't really know about his health.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some family history of high blood pressure and diabetes. And thank you for sharing about your dad. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle... what do you mean?
DOCTOR: Just a few things. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: I drink sometimes. A little wine with dinner, maybe. Not every night, though. Maybe... two or three times a week? Nothing much.
DOCTOR: Okay, light alcohol use. And what about your diet generally?
PATIENT: Um... I try to eat healthy. Rice and beans a lot. Chicken sometimes. I like fruit. But I also... I like sweets. And sometimes I eat fast food when I'm really tired. Not often, but it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mix of healthy foods and some less healthy choices. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything. No pills, nothing. Just... sometimes I drink chamomile tea if I can't sleep. But that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for all of that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your stomach and check a few things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That's fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just listening to your stomach. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. I do hear some increased bowel sounds. They sound… active. No masses or any other concerning findings on initial palpation. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a complete picture. Everything sounds clear there too. Your heart rate and blood pressure are normal.
PATIENT: Okay... That sounds good, I guess. What does "active" mean? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: "Active" bowel sounds just mean your digestive system is working. It’s not necessarily bad, but in your case, with the increased sounds and the belching, it suggests there’s a lot of gas moving through your system. It could be a number of things. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve heard during the exam, it's likely related to how your body is processing food and gas. It doesn't sound like anything urgently concerning, but we can do a few things to try and figure out what's going on. Are you familiar with a low-FODMAP diet?
PATIENT: Low... what? I don't think so. I've never heard of that. Is that something I have to... stop eating everything?
DOCTOR: No, not everything! A low-FODMAP diet is a temporary eating plan that reduces certain types of carbohydrates that can be difficult for some people to digest and can cause gas and bloating. It involves eliminating certain foods for a short period to see if your symptoms improve, then slowly reintroducing them. It can be a little complicated, so I wouldn’t want you to start without guidance. Another option, especially given the anxiety connection, is to try an over-the-counter medication like simethicone or activated charcoal. These can help to reduce gas. We could also consider a referral to a gastroenterologist if your symptoms don’t improve, but I think let's try some conservative measures first. What do you think?
PATIENT: Hmm... I don't know. That sounds... complicated. I'm not very good at remembering all those food things. Maybe the medicine? Is that easy? And... what is simethicone?
DOCTOR: Okay, medicine sounds more manageable. Simethicone is a gas-relieving medication, like Gas-X. It helps break up the bubbles in your stomach and makes it easier to pass gas. It’s very safe, and you can find it over-the-counter at most pharmacies. You would take it after meals, as needed. I'd suggest starting with the recommended dose on the package. We’ll also keep an eye on whether the anxiety plays a big role. Sometimes simple relaxation techniques can also help to reduce gas and bloating. Would you be interested in some resources for relaxation exercises?
PATIENT: Okay, gas medicine sounds good. I can try that. And... relaxation? Like... breathing?
DOCTOR: Exactly! Deep breathing exercises, meditation, even just taking a few moments to focus on your breath can help calm your nervous system and reduce bloating. I can print you out a handout with some simple exercises you can try. I’m going to write you a note explaining what we discussed and recommending the simethicone. If you don’t see any improvement in a week or two, or if your symptoms worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment so we can explore other options. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that's okay. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lucia. I’m glad I could help. Remember, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Here's that handout and the note for the simethicone. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you. You too. .
