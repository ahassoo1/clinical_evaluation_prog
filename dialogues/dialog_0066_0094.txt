DOCTOR: Hi Airam, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Huh? Oh. Hi. I… the paper said something about… learning? I don't really remember. My husband, he made the appointment. Something about… being healthy? I work with metal, all day. It's… hard work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. It sounds like this might be a general check-up, maybe something your husband thought would be a good idea given your work. No worries at all if you don't remember the specifics. So, you work with metal all day – that is hard work. Can you tell me a little more about what kind of metal work you do?
PATIENT: Uh… sheets. Big sheets. And… cutting. Lots of cutting. And… bending. It’s noisy. Very noisy. I wear… ear things. But still. It’s… a factory. Lots of people. And… dust. Yes, lots of dust. I don’t know what kind of dust. Just… metal dust. Is that bad? I don't usually think about it.
DOCTOR: Metal dust… yeah, that could be something we want to talk about. It depends on what kind of metal, but it’s good you’re bringing it up. We’ll definitely get some more information on that. Okay, so noisy factory, lots of metal dust, cutting and bending sheets. Do you experience any specific problems because of the work?
PATIENT: Problems? Like… what kind of problems? My back hurts sometimes. Always. But I think that's just… old age. I'm not that old. Thirty-three, right? My husband says I complain too much. And… my hands get tired. Very, very tired. And… I cough sometimes. But everyone coughs, right? Especially in the… dust. I don't know. Is this what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful, Airam, thank you. Back pain, tired hands, and a cough... those could all be related to your work, or something else entirely. It's good we're talking about it. Let's start with the back pain. How long has your back been hurting?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time. Years, I think. Since… I started the job, maybe? It’s not… terrible. Just… always there. Dull ache. Like… carrying heavy things all the time. Which I do. Big sheets of metal. Very heavy. Sometimes I take… pills. My mother gives them to me. Red pills. I don't know what they are for. She just says, “Take these for the pain.” Is that… okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, so the back pain started around the time you started the job, it's a dull ache, and you take red pills your mother gives you for it. That's good information, thank you. It's important for me to know what you're taking, even if it's given by a family member. Do you know the name of the red pills, or maybe what they're for according to your mother?
PATIENT: Uh… no. She just says “pain pills.” She gets them… from a friend. I don’t ask questions. She says it’s better not to ask. I just… take them when it hurts too much. I don’t like taking pills, but… the pain is worse. It makes me… sleepy sometimes. And… I forget things. More than usual, anyway. I already forget a lot. This job… it’s hard on the brain, I think. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Okay, so "pain pills" from a friend, makes you sleepy and you've noticed some memory issues. That’s definitely something we need to discuss further. Taking medication without knowing exactly what it is, or what it does, can be risky. And yes, it is possible for hard physical work to contribute to fatigue and cognitive issues. Let's try to get some more details. First, let’s talk about your cough. How often do you cough, and what is the cough like?
PATIENT: A lot. Especially at work. It's… dry. Not much… stuff comes out. Just… a tickle. And then I cough and cough and cough. It gets worse when… the dust is bad. Which is… most days. Sometimes it hurts my chest. Not terrible, just… uncomfortable. It doesn't… stop me from working. I just… cough through it. My coworkers cough too. Everyone coughs. Is this… normal? I don’t know what to expect. No one ever asks.
DOCTOR: A dry cough, worse with dust, some chest discomfort… It sounds like the cough is definitely related to your work environment. It’s not necessarily normal, even if your coworkers experience it too. We need to investigate that further. Okay, let's switch gears a bit. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… Let me think. My hands… they shake sometimes. Not all the time, just… when I’m tired. And… I get headaches. A lot of headaches. Especially after work. And… I feel… angry sometimes. Very angry. For no reason. My husband says I’m… difficult. He doesn’t understand. It’s hard work, okay? Very hard. It makes a person… grumpy. Is that a symptom? I don't know what symptoms are.
DOCTOR: Shaky hands when tired, headaches, feeling angry… Those are all things we need to consider. And yes, those can be symptoms, meaning they could be signs of an underlying issue. It's good you're telling me all of this. Let me just quickly check your record… Okay, it seems this is your first visit with us. No prior medical history listed. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. I don't think so. I eat everything. My mother made me try everything when I was little. I don’t remember being… allergic to anything. Maybe… dust? But everyone coughs in the dust. It’s not an allergy. I just… don’t like it. It’s itchy. And makes me cough. Is that an allergy? I don't understand. My husband says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. It sounds like you might be experiencing irritation from the dust, but we can explore that further with some testing if needed. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the pain pills your mother gives you?
PATIENT: Just the red pills. Sometimes. When it hurts. That’s it. I don’t… like taking pills. They make me feel… strange. And sleepy. And I forget things even more. My husband says I should just… tough it out. He says I’m strong. But it’s… hard. Very hard work. Is it normal to feel this bad after work? I don’t know anyone else who works with metal. Everyone else has… office jobs. They look… happy.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the red pills, as needed for pain. It's good you're being so open about how the pills make you feel. Okay, Airam, I think we have a good starting point. It sounds like you're experiencing a number of symptoms – back pain, headaches, hand tremors, fatigue, a cough, and some memory issues – that could be related to your work environment. I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. If you want. But I don’t like doctors. They always poke and… prod. And then they ask questions. And I forget the answers. My husband says I’m… uncooperative. But it’s hard to remember things, okay? Very hard. Is it going to hurt? I don’t like pain. That’s why I take the red pills.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Airam. We'll take it slow, and I’ll explain everything as we go. It won’t be too bad, I promise. We'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and maybe take your blood pressure. It's mostly just to get a baseline, so we know what's normal for you. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Can you take a nice, deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay… deep breath. Like this? I take a shaky, shallow breath. It’s… hard to breathe deeply. The dust… it gets in your lungs. My husband says I need to… toughen up. He says everyone coughs. I cough a couple of times, a dry, hacking sound. Is that… okay? Am I doing it right? I don’t want to… mess it up.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Airam. You're doing great. It's okay to cough – it doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong. I’m just listening to see if there’s any wheezing or crackling in your lungs. I'm hearing some scattered crackles in your lungs, which could be due to irritation from the dust. Your breath sounds are also a little decreased in the lower parts of your lungs. Now, I'm just going to gently press on your chest to see if anything feels tender. Does this hurt at all?
PATIENT: It… stings a little. Here. I point to my left side, just below my ribs. It always hurts here after work. Like… something is bruised. But I don’t remember… hitting anything. My husband says I’m… clumsy. And I’m always tired. Maybe that’s why. Is it… bad? Is something broken? I don't like being poked and prodded. It makes me… anxious. I start to fidget with my hands.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. There is some tenderness on your left side, below your ribs. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is broken, but it's good we've noted it. It could be muscle strain, or something else. Now, let's check your reflexes. This will just involve a little tap on your arm and leg. Your reflexes are a little bit slower than I’d expect. Again, that isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but it's another thing we need to consider. Your blood pressure is a little high and your pulse is a bit fast. This could be due to pain, anxiety, or something else. Okay, Airam, I've completed the physical exam. I want to be honest, your symptoms and exam findings suggest we need to do some further investigation. I'm concerned about the effects of the metal dust on your lungs, the possibility of muscle strain, and your elevated blood pressure and pulse. I think it would be a good idea to order a chest X-ray and some blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? I don’t like tests. They always make me… nervous. And what if they find something bad? My husband says I worry too much. But… I do feel bad. Very bad. I just want to… feel normal again. Can’t you just… give me something for the pain? And maybe… something to help me sleep? I’m so tired. But tests… I don’t know. What kind of tests? Will they hurt? And who will… pay for them? I don’t have… much money.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Airam. It's okay to feel nervous about tests. We'll take things one step at a time. The chest X-ray will just give us a picture of your lungs, so we can see if there's any damage from the dust. The blood tests will help us check your overall health and see if there are any underlying issues. They won't hurt – the X-ray is just a quick scan, and the blood tests are a simple prick of a needle. Regarding the cost, I know you mentioned you don’t have much money. We can explore some options. We can see if there are any assistance programs available, or if we can work out a payment plan. I don’t want the cost of the tests to be a barrier to getting you the care you need. And while I understand you want something for the pain and sleep, it's important to figure out the underlying cause of your symptoms first. Giving you medication without knowing what's going on could mask the problem and make things worse in the long run. For now, let's focus on getting the tests done. Would you be willing to schedule them?
PATIENT: …Tests. Okay. Fine. But… can you explain everything again? Slowly? And… who do I talk to about the money? And… will my husband have to come with me? I don’t want him… to worry. He says I’m strong. But I don’t feel strong. I just want… answers. And maybe… something to help me sleep tonight. Just… a little something. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Airam. We'll take everything slowly, and I'll explain everything as many times as you need. Let's start with the tests. The chest X-ray is a quick scan that takes a picture of your lungs. It doesn't hurt at all – you'll just stand or sit in front of a machine, and a technician will take the picture. The blood tests are also simple – a nurse will take a small sample of blood from your arm. It might sting for a moment, but it's usually over quickly. The results will help us understand if the dust is affecting your lungs, if there's any muscle strain, and if there are any other underlying issues causing your symptoms. As for the cost, I'll have my office manager, Sarah, talk to you about assistance programs and payment plans. She’s very helpful and can answer all your questions. And you don’t have to bring your husband with you if you don’t want to. This is your health, and you should feel comfortable doing what’s best for you. I understand you're looking for something to help you sleep tonight. Unfortunately, I can't prescribe anything without knowing what's causing your sleep problems. But I can offer some advice – try to create a relaxing bedtime routine, avoid caffeine before bed, and make sure your bedroom is dark and quiet. Does that help?
PATIENT: …Okay. I guess. I don't know. It's… a lot to take in. Sarah, you said? I’ll… talk to Sarah about the money. And maybe… I'll try the bedtime routine. But it's hard to sleep when… you're coughing all the time. Can I… ask one more question? My hands… they shake sometimes. Is that… serious? My mother always said… shaking hands means you’re… losing your mind. Is that true? I don’t want to… lose my mind. It’s scary. I look up at you, my eyes filled with worry.
DOCTOR: That's a very understandable concern, Airam. And no, shaking hands does not mean you're losing your mind. That’s a very old misconception. There are many reasons why your hands might shake, and most of them are perfectly treatable. It could be due to fatigue, stress, anxiety, or even certain medications. Sometimes, it can be a sign of a more underlying medical condition, which is why we’re doing the tests. But we won’t know for sure until we get the results. Right now, let’s focus on taking things one step at a time. We’ll schedule the tests, and then we’ll go from there. I want you to know that I’m here for you, and we’ll figure this out together. Do you feel comfortable scheduling the tests now, or would you like a little more time to think about it?
PATIENT: …Okay. Let’s schedule them. But… can you make sure Sarah explains everything very slowly? And… can I have a list of questions to ask her? I always forget things. And… can you write down the name of the tests? Just… in case. And… can I bring a pen? I just… want to be prepared. I don't like surprises. And… thank you. For… not laughing at me. My husband… he sometimes laughs. When I forget things. It makes me sad.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Airam. We'll make sure Sarah explains everything very slowly, and I'll write down the names of the tests for you. I'll also create a list of questions you can ask her. And yes, please bring a pen! It's always good to be prepared. I want you to know that you don't have to worry about me laughing at you. I'm here to help, and I take your concerns very seriously. It's perfectly okay to be nervous, and it's perfectly okay to forget things. Okay, here are the tests we're scheduling: Chest X-ray: This takes a picture of your lungs. Complete Blood Count : This checks your overall health and looks for any signs of infection or anemia. Basic Metabolic Panel : This checks your kidney function and electrolyte levels. Here’s a list of questions you can ask Sarah: What is the cost of each test?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Airam. Remember, we’re here to help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Sarah will be in touch shortly to schedule your tests. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
