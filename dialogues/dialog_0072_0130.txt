DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're a new patient with us. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, new patient. My… family, they have some… problems. Heart things, mostly. My mother, my sister… and I just want to make sure I am okay. You know? I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. It's always wise to be proactive, especially with a family history of cardiac issues. “Heart things” is rather vague, though. Could you be more specific about what your mother and sister experienced?
PATIENT: Um… my mother, she had… chest pain. A lot of it. Then she had to have… something done. With tubes. I was young. My sister… she fainted a few times. Doctor said it was her heart… something about not beating right. I don’t… I don’t know all the details. It was a while ago. Mostly just worry, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. Chest pain requiring intervention and fainting spells… that gives us something to work with, even without precise details. We'll need to gather some more information. Let's start with you. Have you ever experienced chest pain yourself, Mr. Schwer?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Sometimes… a little tightness, maybe? When I walk up a big hill. But it goes away if I stop and rest. It’s not like my mother’s pain, I don't think. She couldn’t… well, she couldn’t move. Mine is just… a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how often would you say this tightness occurs?
PATIENT: Not often. Maybe… once a month? If I’m doing something hard. Like… carrying wood. I live in the country, you see? Need to do things around the house. It's not every day. I mostly feel fine. But… like I said, I just want to be sure. Old age, you know? Things start to go wrong.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, preventative care is always a sound idea. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, aside from this occasional tightness, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Sometimes I get… short of breath. But only when it’s very hot. Or if I’m walking really fast. And my ankles… they swell up a little sometimes. But not always. I thought it was just… from standing too long. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Shortness of breath and ankle swelling…those could be related. It's good you're mentioning these things. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me see… I don’t think so. The doctor… a long time ago, he said my blood pressure was a little high, once. But he didn’t… he didn’t give me any pills or anything. He said to watch my salt. And… I try to. I don’t eat a lot of fast food. Never really liked it much. I mostly eat what my wife used to make. But she… she’s gone now. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Schwer. And that’s good you’ve been mindful of your salt intake. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than a minor illness?
PATIENT: No. Not really. When I was a boy, I broke my arm falling out of a tree. But that was a long time ago. And… when my wife was sick, I was in the hospital with her, of course. But I wasn’t… sick sick. Just… there with her. Nothing for me, you understand? I’ve mostly been healthy. A few colds, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Um… just some vitamins. A multivitamin, and… fish oil. My daughter told me to take it. For my heart, she said. But that’s it. I don’t like taking pills if I don’t have to. They make me feel… funny. Not sick, exactly, just… off. That's all. No regular medicines, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I eat all sorts of things. My wife, she was the picky eater. I can’t say I've ever had a bad reaction to anything. I might get a little itchy if I get stung by a bee, but that’s… that’s just a sting, you understand? Nothing serious. No allergies, really. Never had them.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. Thank you for that thorough history. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your ankles. That will give us a better idea of what might be going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know I'm okay. I don't want any surprises. You do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll please have a seat on the table. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please try to breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, but I do detect a faint murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 148/86. That's a little elevated. I'm also noticing some mild pitting edema in both ankles. It's not severe, but it is present. Okay, Mr. Schwer. Based on the physical exam, the murmur, the elevated blood pressure, and the ankle swelling, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. We should also do an EKG to assess your heart's electrical activity.
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… complicated. Is that bad, Doctor? The murmur and the swelling and all those tests? My daughter, she always worries when she hears about tests. She's a nurse, you see. And she's very… thorough. Is this something serious? I just wanted to make sure I wasn't going to… you know… fall apart.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, it’s understandable to be concerned. Let me assure you, these tests are not necessarily indicative of anything serious. They are simply a way for us to gather more information. The murmur could be benign - many people have them. The elevated blood pressure and swelling warrant further investigation to rule out any underlying issues. Your daughter is a nurse, and her thoroughness is a good thing. I will be happy to share the results with her, with your permission, of course. We need to understand why your blood pressure is elevated and what is causing the swelling. This will allow us to create a plan to address the issue and ensure your health. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
