DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Bloating. Look, I don’t have time for a lot of…details, alright? Just…bloated. Feels like I ate a watermelon, even when I haven’t. It’s been…a bit. Not fun. Can we just figure out what it is and get it sorted?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik, I understand you're experiencing bloating and want to get to the bottom of it quickly. “A bit” is a little vague, though – could you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Roughly…? Honestly, I don’t really keep track of that stuff. Weeks, maybe? Months? Look, my wife…she usually handled all the…timing of things. It’s just been there. It’s uncomfortable, okay? And getting worse, I think. Is that helpful? Can we skip the calendar stuff?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. Okay, so weeks to months of increasing discomfort. And it feels like fullness, even when you haven’t eaten much?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. Like I said, watermelon. And it's…gassy. A lot of…air. It’s embarrassing, to be honest. I don’t go out much as it is. Look, is this something serious? Because I really don’t have the energy for…a big thing. I just want a pill, if that's possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Kristofik. Bloating and gas can be very uncomfortable, and it's good you're addressing it. We need to rule out anything serious, but many things can cause this. Let’s start with some basic questions, and then I'll do a quick exam. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – diarrhea, constipation, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… Honestly? I try not to think about it too much. It…happens. Usually normal, I guess. Sometimes a little slow, yeah. Old age, probably. But nothing…dramatic. I don't keep a log or anything. Is this going somewhere? Because, again, I don't have a lot of time. Can we just fast-track this? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Mr. Kristofik. I want to be efficient, but it’s important to gather enough information to make the right decision. Okay, “sometimes a little slow” is helpful. Any abdominal pain accompanying the bloating and gas?
PATIENT: Pain…yeah, sometimes. Sort of a dull ache, low down. Not sharp, not crippling. Just…uncomfortable. Like a constant pressure, really. It comes and goes. Worse after I eat, I think. But I eat pretty regularly, so…it’s hard to say. I don't baby myself with special diets or anything. Just normal food. Look, is this going to involve a colonoscopy or something? Because I've heard…things.
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily a colonoscopy, Mr. Kristofik. We are nowhere near that point yet. We’ll start with a physical exam and see what we find. Then, depending on that, we may consider some blood work to rule out any underlying issues. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Look, can we get to the exam? I’m starting to feel a bit…claustrophobic just talking about this stuff. The waiting room wasn’t great, and this… questioning is making me anxious. I appreciate you trying, but honestly, I just want a solution. Fast.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik, I understand. Let’s do the exam. Just lie down on the examination table, and I’ll listen to your abdomen and feel for any tenderness. It shouldn't take long.
PATIENT: Fine. Let’s just…get it over with. Hurry up, please. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. This might be a little uncomfortable. Just let me know if anything is particularly painful. I’m hearing some normal bowel sounds. Now, pressing here… any tenderness?
PATIENT: Oof. Yeah, that’s…not great. Not excruciating, but definitely…uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, as I said. It’s been like that for a while now, on and off. Don't poke too hard, alright? I'm not made of iron. Is that what you wanted to know? Can we move on? This is… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Just wanted to see how sensitive it was. Now, just feeling around…I don't feel any masses or anything concerning. Your abdomen is a little distended, which fits with the bloating you’ve described. No significant pain in the other areas. Do you have any fever, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Not that I've noticed. Nausea…sometimes, a little queasy. Usually after I eat something heavy. Not proper vomiting, just…a bit of discomfort. Like I said, I'm not a delicate flower. I just want to feel normal again. This bloating is embarrassing and annoying. I got things to do, you know? I don't have time for being sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing chronic bloating and gas, possibly with some mild abdominal discomfort and occasional nausea. The location of the tenderness and the distention suggests it could be related to your colon, but it’s not specific enough to pinpoint a cause yet. To rule out any more serious conditions and get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work: a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a C-reactive protein to check for inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… fine. Whatever you think is necessary. Just… don’t take all day about it, alright? I got things to do. Is this going to be expensive? My insurance is… private, but I don’t want any surprises. And will I need a special appointment for that? I don’t do well with a lot of appointments. Look, just tell me what I need to do, quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik. The blood work is relatively standard, and your insurance should cover most of it. There will likely be a co-pay, which you can check with your insurance provider. We can draw the blood here in the clinic, and it shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes. No special appointment needed. Here’s the form. Just take this to the lab technician down the hall, and they’ll take care of everything. Once the results are back – usually within a couple of days – we’ll schedule a brief follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Fine. Couple of days. Don't take longer. Look, I'm going to go do that now. Hopefully, this won't be a huge hassle. .
