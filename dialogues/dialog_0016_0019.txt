DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me? My wife... she wants a baby. We… we talk about it. She says it’s time. I think so too, maybe. But… we are older. I am… seventy, yes? And she is not so young either. We want to make sure… everything is okay.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful that you and your wife are considering this! It's very thoughtful of you both to want to make sure everything is healthy before trying. It’s absolutely right to think through this carefully, especially given your ages. So, just to clarify, you're coming in today to discuss the possibility of starting a family and to assess your overall health to make sure you're both able to do so safely?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Safe is good. Very good. I… I don't remember much about… about having babies, you see. It was a long time ago. And things… things are different now, I think? My wife, she knows more about it. But she wanted me to come too, to… to hear what you say.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Carlotta. Medicine has changed quite a bit over the years, and it’s smart of your wife to want you both informed. And it’s great that you’re here with me. Okay, let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… illnesses… let me think. I had… a cough, a bad cough, many years ago. And… my back. My back is not so good. Old age, you know? I work with my hands… making little things. Metal and plastic. It makes my back hurt sometimes. Nothing… nothing serious, I don’t think. I take… a little pill for the pain. A white one. I forget the name.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough in the past and some back pain currently, managed with a white pill. We’ll definitely get the name of that pill later – it’s important to know what you’re taking. And have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no, I don’t think so. Not that I remember. Maybe when I was a little boy? But… no big surgeries. Just… a little cut on my hand once, when I was working with the metal. But my wife… she fixed it. She was a nurse, you see. Very good with hands, like me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no major surgeries. And that’s wonderful your wife has a medical background – it’s always helpful to have someone knowledgeable close by. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family… that is hard to remember. My father… he had… problems with his heart, I think. Old age, again. And my mother… she was always tired. Very tired. But… I don't know what kind of problems, exactly. We didn’t… we didn’t talk about it much. They lived far away, you see. Back in Somalia.
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart issues with your father and your mother experiencing fatigue. It’s not uncommon for families not to have detailed medical histories readily available, especially if they lived far away. We’ll make a note of that. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never. My wife… she would be very angry. She says it is very bad for you. I drink… sometimes. A little beer, with dinner. Not every day. Maybe… two or three times a week. Just a little.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. A little beer a few times a week is relatively moderate. Now, do you exercise regularly, or do you have any hobbies that keep you active?
PATIENT: Exercise… no, not really. I work with my hands, you see. Making the little things. That is exercise enough, I think! And… I like to read. About history. Old things. And… I walk a little, sometimes. With my wife. But not… not a proper exercise. Just a slow walk.
DOCTOR: Okay, working with your hands and gentle walks with your wife – that's good. It’s important to stay as active as you are able. Now, I’d like to ask about any allergies you may have. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm… I don't think so. Nothing that I know of. My wife, she always checks when she gives me medicine. She is very careful. I sometimes get… a little itchy, when I touch certain plants. But that is not a proper allergy, I think. Just… a little itch. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication or food allergies, just some mild skin irritation with certain plants. That’s good to know. And lastly, are you currently taking any other medications besides the white pill for your back pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I take… a little orange pill, sometimes. For my water. My wife says I need it. For… for my plumbing, she says! I forget the name. Old age, you see. And… that is all, I think. Just the white one for my back and the little orange one for my water.
DOCTOR: "Plumbing" – that’s a good way to put it! We’ll get the names of both those pills for me. It's important to have a complete list. Okay, Mr. Carlotta, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind, just to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. A quick look is good. Whatever you need. I trust you, Doctor. Just… be gentle with my back, please! It is not so strong anymore.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Carlotta. We’ll be very gentle with your back. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s a little elevated, but not overly concerning right now. Your pulse is 72, which is normal. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Your lungs sound clear. Your reflexes are a little slower than expected, which is not uncommon at your age. Your neurological function seems otherwise intact. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your back does have some tenderness to the touch, especially in the lower region. You do have some limitations in your range of motion. Okay, Mr. Carlotta, that concludes the physical exam. Everything seems generally okay, but we do need to address the elevated blood pressure and the tenderness in your back. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Elevated… that is not good, is it? And the murmur… what does that mean? Is it serious? My back… I know it is not so good, but I can still work. I need to work. My wife… she worries too much.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about those things, Mr. Carlotta. Elevated blood pressure means your heart is working a little harder than it should to pump blood through your body. It’s not immediately serious, but it needs to be managed to prevent problems down the road, like heart disease or stroke. We can start with some lifestyle changes, and if that's not enough, we might consider medication. The murmur is a slightly unusual sound when I listen to your heart. It can be caused by a variety of things, and often isn't a cause for concern, especially if it's mild. But we’ll want to do an echocardiogram – that’s an ultrasound of your heart – to get a clearer picture and make sure everything is functioning properly. And it’s good that you’re still able to work! We’ll focus on managing your back pain so you can continue to do the things you enjoy. We can discuss some stretches and exercises to help, and possibly some pain relief options. Before we go further, can you tell me what the name of the white pill and the orange pill are?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… my wife keeps them in a special box. She writes the names on the bottles. One moment… Ah, here it is! The white one is… Naproxen. And the orange one is… Tamsulosin. Does that mean anything to you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does mean something! Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, commonly used for pain and inflammation – that explains why you're taking it for your back. And Tamsulosin is used to help with urinary issues, often in men. Okay, Mr. Carlotta, thank you for finding those names. That gives us a much clearer picture. Now, to summarize, you're 70 years old, with a history of some heart issues in your father, and some fatigue in your mother. You have elevated blood pressure, a slight heart murmur, and back pain managed with Naproxen. You're also taking Tamsulosin. You’re active with your hands and walk with your wife. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else we’ve discussed so far?
PATIENT: No, that sounds… about right, I think. My wife will be happy you know all of this. She worries so much! So... what happens now, Doctor? Do I need more tests? And… will I be able to keep working? That is very important to me.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear your wife will be happy. It’s always good to have a supportive partner! And yes, I understand how important it is for you to continue working. Okay, so, next steps. I recommend we do a few things. First, we’ll schedule an echocardiogram to get a better look at your heart and evaluate the murmur. That's a non-invasive test – it just involves using sound waves to create a picture of your heart. Second, I want to do some blood work to check your kidney function, liver function, and overall health. Third, we’ll discuss some lifestyle changes to help lower your blood pressure, such as reducing sodium intake, increasing physical activity, and managing stress. And fourth, we can talk about strategies for managing your back pain, including stretches, exercises, and possibly some over-the-counter pain relief options. We can also discuss a referral to a physical therapist if that’s something you’re interested in. As for your work, I don’t see any reason why you shouldn’t be able to continue working, as long as you’re comfortable and take breaks when needed. We’ll work together to manage your pain and ensure you can continue to do the things you enjoy. Does that sound like a plan to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. A plan is good. Echo… that is the heart one, yes? And the blood work… I don't mind that. And I will try to eat less salt. My wife makes very salty food! Less salt, more walking… I can do that. And I will talk to her about the physical therapist. She always knows best, anyway. Thank you, Doctor. You have made me feel much better.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. It sounds like you have a wonderful support system with your wife, and that’s a great starting point. Okay, so, I’ll have my nurse schedule you for the echocardiogram and blood work. She’ll also give you a list of resources for managing your blood pressure and finding a physical therapist. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant changes in your back pain, please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. You have answered everything I was worried about. And you were very kind. Thank you again, Doctor Maskal. And please tell your nurse to be gentle with the blood draw! My veins are… old.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. I’m happy to help. And I’ll be sure to let the nurse know to be gentle with the blood draw. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a wonderful day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
