DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't the time for this. It’s… well, it’s my vision, and my hearing. They've just… gone. Not entirely, you understand, but… diminished. Terribly inconvenient. I’m a surgeon, you know. Precision is rather important. And I have patients waiting.
DOCTOR: A surgeon, you say?
PATIENT: Pediatric, actually. Though, at this rate… I doubt I'll be doing much surgery. It came on so suddenly, just yesterday. It’s really quite unsettling. I don't recall doing anything differently. Perhaps it’s stress. Though, a good surgeon doesn’t succumb to stress, now does she?
DOCTOR: Indeed. Let’s try to be methodical, Ms. Julie. Sudden changes like this warrant investigation. Tell me, when you say “diminished”, can you quantify that?
PATIENT: Quantify? Really, Doctor. I’m not a… a statistician. Things are blurry, especially at a distance. And sounds… muffled. Like speaking underwater. Is that sufficient? I haven’t a measuring tape for my ears or eyes, you know. I simply want it fixed.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's begin with your medical history. Have you had any previous issues with your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, Doctor, I'm 66 years old! A few things here and there, naturally. Nothing… consequential. I've always been quite healthy, if you must know. I eat well, I exercise… well, I used to, before all of this. I honestly can’t recall specifics. It was years ago. Why does it matter? This is new.
DOCTOR: It matters, Ms. Julie, because past medical issues can provide clues. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Heavens, no! I have always been very careful about what I eat. Sugar is simply dreadful for the complexion, you know. Besides, I would feel it if I had something like that. I’m a surgeon, Doctor, not an invalid. I take pride in my health. Honestly, are you suggesting… I find that rather insulting.
DOCTOR: It was merely a routine question, Ms. Julie. Let’s move on. Any family history of vision or hearing loss?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had cataracts, I believe, quite late in life. And my uncle, on my father’s side, was rather… deaf. Always shouting, poor man. But that was just old age, wasn’t it? They weren’t… professionals like me, you understand. They didn’t require such acute senses. It’s hardly the same thing. This is… different. I need answers, Doctor, not a genealogy lesson.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a quick physical examination. I'd like to assess your vision and hearing, just to get a baseline. Could you please follow me?
PATIENT: Must we? It all seems rather… unnecessary. But, very well. Let's get this over with. I have appointments, you know. But I assure you, if it involves any… unpleasantness, I will stop you immediately. Lead the way, Doctor. And please, be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. We'll start with your vision. I’ll need you to read these letters on the chart, starting with the top row. Cover your left eye with this card, please. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor. These things are always so blurry. Is it really necessary to use such…small print? E… is that an E? Or perhaps a C? Oh, dear. This is dreadful. I can barely make anything out. It’s like looking through a fog. Simply dreadful. Do you have a larger chart, Doctor? This is quite embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Let's move to the next line. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Julie. Focus, please. What letter do you see here?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I’m trying. It’s…it looks like a… a P? No, wait. Is that an F? They all look so…smudged. It’s terribly frustrating. I have excellent vision, usually. Precision, you know. It’s vital for my profession. Are you sure this chart is correctly calibrated? Perhaps it’s the lighting in here? This isn't working. It's simply a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll proceed with a brief hearing test. I'm going to put these headphones on you and ask you to indicate when you hear a tone. Please raise your hand when you do.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. This is all rather…demeaning, isn’t it? Very well. Get it over with quickly. I trust these haven't been… thoroughly cleaned? Proceed, Doctor. But I warn you, if it’s a high-pitched tone, I have a very sensitive constitution.
DOCTOR: Please tell me when you hear the tone in either your left or right ear. It will start softly and increase in volume.
PATIENT: I… I don’t hear anything. Are you certain this device is working, Doctor? It’s completely silent. Absolutely nothing. Perhaps you haven't turned it on correctly? This is… concerning. My hearing is usually impeccable. I need to be able to clearly understand my patients, you know. Well? Is there a problem with the machine? It's rather unsettling to be in a silent room with a doctor fiddling with equipment. Do try to hurry.
DOCTOR: Let’s try again. Perhaps it was a momentary issue with the headphones. Can you hear anything now, Ms. Julie?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely nothing. It’s… muffled, like speaking through cotton. I can’t discern any tone at all. It's… rather frightening, to be honest. Is this serious? You are a qualified doctor, aren’t you? This is… quite alarming. I’ve never experienced anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Based on this brief examination, it seems you are experiencing both diminished vision and hearing. Given the sudden onset, I recommend a referral to an ophthalmologist and an audiologist for a comprehensive evaluation. We need to rule out any underlying serious conditions. I’ll have my assistant schedule those appointments for you. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, Doctor, I don't have time for allergies! This is simply dreadful. An ophthalmologist and an audiologist? That’s… more appointments. It’s all so inconvenient. I… I suppose I’m not allergic to anything specific, but I do have a rather sensitive constitution. And I dislike waiting rooms. Terribly dislike them. Will they… be able to fix this quickly? Because I have patients waiting, you know. And quite important ones, at that. This is simply unacceptable.
DOCTOR: I will request expedited appointments, Ms. Julie. However, a comprehensive evaluation takes time. In the meantime, avoid any strenuous activities that require sharp vision or acute hearing. Do you take any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a small dose of… something for my nerves. It’s hardly anything, really. My practice is rather demanding, you understand. It’s purely preventative. A little something to… calm the system. Though, clearly, it hasn’t been working. It’s not important. Just a small blue pill. I believe. Honestly, I leave all the specifics to my… assistant. It’s all so… tedious. Do you think this is stress, Doctor? Perhaps a long vacation is all I need.
DOCTOR: I will note that you are taking medication for anxiety. It’s important to consider how that might be interacting with any potential underlying causes. We will have the specialists investigate further. I’m going to have my assistant print out referral paperwork and instructions for you. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Questions? No, Doctor, I believe you've made everything perfectly clear. More appointments. More waiting. It’s simply… unacceptable. Although… Could you perhaps write a note to my patients? Explaining my… temporary indisposition? They are rather… demanding. And I wouldn't want them to worry. Well. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. Although I doubt this visit has been particularly… helpful. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Julie. My assistant will provide that note as you leave. Please follow up with the specialists as soon as possible. Have a good day.
