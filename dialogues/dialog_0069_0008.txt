DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Right, yes. It’s… my ear. Feels blocked, full. Been like that for a bit now, I think. Honestly, it’s hard to say how long. Time… slips away, you know? It's just… annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It can be difficult to keep track of time, and that's perfectly alright. “Annoying” is a good way to describe it – we want to get to the bottom of it. So, it feels blocked and full… has that sensation been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Um… mostly constant, I’d say. Though… sometimes it feels a little worse than others. Like when the weather changes, maybe? Or… I don’t know. It’s just… there. I haven’t really paid much attention, to be honest. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. It’s good you mentioned it seems to correlate with weather changes. That can give us some clues. And don’t worry about not paying close attention – people have a lot going on. Okay, so it's mostly constant, worsens sometimes with weather. Have you noticed any pain with it?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not really. A little discomfort, maybe. Like… pressure. But not pain. Definitely not. I mean, I’ve had proper pain before, and this isn’t it. It's more… a dull feeling. Like something is… stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull pressure, not sharp pain, and a feeling of something stuck. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No, not that I’ve noticed. No dizziness, no ringing… My hearing seems alright, I think. Though… I don’t listen to much music these days. It’s hard to say if it’s worse than usual. Sorry, I'm not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You're being perfectly helpful, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It's good you're thinking through this with me. No dizziness or ringing is good. And it's alright that you're not sure about your hearing – we can check that. Now, have you experienced any recent cold, flu, or sinus infections?
PATIENT: Recent… infections? Ah. Now that you mention it… I think I had a bit of a cold a few weeks ago. Nothing major, just a sniffle and a cough. It didn't last long. But… yes, I think that was around the time this ear thing started getting worse. Does that… matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely matters. A recent cold can often be linked to ear issues. Okay, so recent cold a few weeks ago, around the time the ear fullness worsened. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you ever had any problems with your ears before – like ear infections as a child, or any surgery on your ears?
PATIENT: Surgery… no, never. As a child… I think I had one ear infection, maybe? A long time ago. I don’t remember much about it. My mother… she always took care of things. I just remember being… uncomfortable. It wasn't a big deal, I don’t think. It didn't happen often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible ear infection in childhood, but not frequent or significant. And no ear surgery. Now, do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. I haven’t taken any new medications recently, either. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. My wife… she was the one who kept track of all that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and no new medications. It's helpful you mention your wife usually handles that. Just a few more questions about your general health. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Never liked it. My wife… she hated it too. Always said it was a terrible habit. I used to work outside a lot, on the land, but never picked up smoking.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No history of smoking. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing much. I… don’t really enjoy it enough to have more than that. It’s… not a habit, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. So, occasional glass of wine with dinner. Alright. I think I have a good understanding of your history now. Would you mind if I take a quick look in your ears and do a brief examination to get a better idea of what’s going on?
PATIENT: No, no, that’s fine. Go ahead. I suppose that’s what doctors do, isn’t it? Just… try to be quick, if you could. I have… things to get back to.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as quick as possible. Okay, I'm looking at your right ear now… I see a little bit of redness and some fluid behind the eardrum. Your left ear looks similar. The eardrums themselves don’t appear to be perforated, which is good. It seems like you have some fluid buildup in both middle ears, which is consistent with an ear infection, possibly related to the cold you had a few weeks ago. I'm also noting some cerumen buildup in both ears, which could be contributing to the fullness you're feeling.
PATIENT: Infection… right. And… earwax? Well, that doesn’t sound too serious. Is it… bad? Should I be worried? I just want to get it sorted, really.
DOCTOR: It's good you want to get it sorted. It’s not serious in the sense that it’s not life-threatening, but it can be uncomfortable and affect your hearing. The fluid buildup and earwax are likely the cause of the fullness and possible slight hearing reduction you’re experiencing. We can treat this fairly easily. I recommend a course of antibiotics to clear up the infection and a professional earwax removal to relieve the blockage. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… and wax removal. Right. Sounds… sensible. I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… will it hurt? I don't do well with pain, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about pain. The antibiotic course is just oral medication, so no pain there. As for the earwax removal, there are a few different methods. We can use ear drops to soften the wax first, which doesn't hurt at all. Then we can either gently irrigate the ear with warm water or use a small instrument to carefully remove the wax. Both are generally well-tolerated. If you’re particularly sensitive, we can start with just the ear drops and see how you feel. We will take it slow and I'll explain each step. Would you prefer to start with the ear drops?
PATIENT: Ear drops… yes. That sounds… least unpleasant. Let’s start with those, then. As long as they’re not cold. And… how long will I have to use them for? I really need to get back to things, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, they will be at room temperature. You’ll use the ear drops twice a day for about five to seven days. After that, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to check your ears and see if the wax has softened enough for removal. I’m writing you a prescription for the ear drops now. I'll also give you written instructions on how to use them properly. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today, to check on your progress. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: A week… yes, that should be alright. As long as it’s not too early. I have… commitments, you see. Written instructions are good. I’m not very good at remembering things these days. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll make sure the appointment is scheduled at a convenient time for you. And no problem at all – that’s what I’m here for. Here are the prescription and instructions. It also includes a contact number if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. Please let me know if you experience any pain, dizziness, or changes in your hearing while using the ear drops. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… get rid of the blockage, if you can. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll… see you next week, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I'll do my best. Have a good day, and I'll see you next week. .
