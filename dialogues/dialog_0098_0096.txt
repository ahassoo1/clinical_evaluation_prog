DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for having me. Well, it’s a bit of a strange one, really. I’ve been getting really bothered by the light lately. Like, really bothered. It’s…photosensitivity, I think my friend called it? Everything feels too bright, even on cloudy days. It’s been happening for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Okay, photosensitivity… a few weeks. That is something we should look into. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not pain, exactly. More… discomfort? Like my eyes are really straining, even with sunglasses on. And sometimes, I get headaches after being outside, or even just looking at a bright screen for too long. It's just… unpleasant, you know? It’s making it hard to get things done. I used to love gardening, but now I can barely spend ten minutes out there before I have to come back inside.
DOCTOR: Headaches, definitely something to note. And it’s interfering with your usual activities… gardening, that’s good to know. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the light sensitivity and headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I haven’t really noticed anything else, specifically. Though… now that you mention it, my eyes do feel a little dry sometimes. Not always, but often when they're bothering me from the light. And… I’m not sure if this is related, but I’ve been feeling a bit more tired lately. Just generally run down, you know? It could just be the summer heat, though.
DOCTOR: Dry eyes… and fatigue. Okay. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… well, last year was… hard. My wife, God rest her soul, passed away in February. It was sudden. I’ve been trying to get back to normal, slowly, but it hasn’t been easy. I started spending more time in the garden, trying to keep busy, I guess. Before that, we used to travel a lot. So, yeah… a lot has changed. I'm sorry, I didn’t mean to… just ramble.
DOCTOR: Please, don't apologize at all, Mr. Komarov. That is… a significant loss. It's completely understandable that things have been difficult, and it's important for me to know everything that's going on in your life. It sounds like you've been through a lot. Now, let's get back to the symptoms. You mentioned starting gardening after your loss. Was this gradual or sudden?
PATIENT: It was pretty sudden, actually. She loved gardening, always had a green thumb. After… after she was gone, I just started doing it, I guess. Trying to feel close to her, you know? It started with just a few pots on the porch, then I cleared out a little patch in the backyard. It was… therapeutic, for a while. But like I said, the light started bothering me around the same time I really started getting into it. Maybe a month or so after I started spending more time outside? It’s hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or so after starting the gardening, the light sensitivity began. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any changes to your vision other than the discomfort with bright light?
PATIENT: Not that I’ve noticed, no. Everything looks clear, as far as I can tell. No blurriness, no floaters, no double vision. Just… sensitive to the light. And sometimes a little bit of a burning sensation, especially if I'm outside for a long time. It's not constant, though. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in visual acuity, just the sensitivity and occasional burning sensation. Do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I've never been one to have hay fever or anything like that. I get the occasional mosquito bite, but no serious allergies, no. I don’t take any medication regularly either, unless you count the occasional pain reliever for a headache. But I've been taking those more often lately, because of the light sensitivity, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, no regular medications, occasional pain relievers. What about family history?
PATIENT: That’s a tricky one. My wife’s side of the family, they had some problems with their eyes… cataracts, mostly, I think. My own parents were pretty healthy, actually. My mother had high blood pressure later in life, but nothing major with their eyesight. To be honest, we didn’t really talk about medical history much. It wasn’t really something we did.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of cataracts on your wife’s side. That's good to know. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to check your eyes and a few other things, just to get a better picture of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm happy to do whatever I need to. I just want to figure out what’s causing this, and hopefully get some relief.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat, and I’ll get started. I'm going to start by checking your visual acuity with a standard eye chart. Then, I’ll do a quick examination of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope to look at the back of your eyes. After that, I’ll check your pupils and reflexes. It shouldn’t take too long. Can you read the smallest line on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Sure. Let me… Okay, uh… E… F… P… T… O… V… Yeah, I can read all those letters, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good. Excellent. That's normal. Now, let me shine a light into your eyes… it will be brief. The optic discs look clear, no signs of edema. The retina appears normal, with no obvious hemorrhages or lesions. Vessels are normal caliber. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Okay, that all looks good. Now, do you feel any pain or discomfort when I do this?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Just the light, like usual, but nothing extra. Feels pretty normal, I suppose. Though, if you don’t mind me asking… what are you looking for exactly? I’m not trying to be difficult, I just like to understand things, you know?
DOCTOR: Not at all, you’re not being difficult. It’s always good when patients are involved in their own care. I'm looking for any signs of inflammation, damage to the optic nerve, or any unusual blood vessel changes. Things that might explain the light sensitivity and headaches. Based on what I've seen so far, your physical exam doesn't reveal any obvious cause for your symptoms. The normal visual acuity, clear optic discs, and intact pupil responses are all reassuring. However, the light sensitivity is definitely concerning, and we need to investigate further. Given your history and the exam findings, I’m going to recommend a few blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing this. Specifically, I want to check your Vitamin D levels, your thyroid function, and your inflammatory markers. I also want to consider the possibility of migraine, even though you don't describe a typical migraine headache. We can explore that further with a headache diary. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests, headache diary… it all makes sense. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I’m just eager to get to the bottom of this. I don't want it to keep interfering with my life. Vitamin D, thyroid… I haven’t thought about those things before.
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad you feel comfortable with that plan. It’s quite common for vitamin deficiencies and thyroid imbalances to cause symptoms like fatigue and sensitivity to light. And a headache diary can help us identify any patterns or triggers. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood tests now. You can take it to the lab at [Name of Lab], and they’ll be able to draw the samples. The results should be back in about a week. In the meantime, I’d like you to start keeping a detailed headache diary. Note the time of the headache, the location of the pain, the intensity on a scale of 1 to 10, and anything that might have triggered it. I also recommend wearing sunglasses outdoors, even on cloudy days, to protect your eyes. And try to minimize your exposure to bright screens if possible. I’ll also print out a detailed instruction sheet on how to keep the headache diary. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand everything, Doctor. Blood tests, headache diary, sunglasses… I can do all that. Thank you for taking the time to explain it all so clearly. It's a relief to have a plan. And… thank you for listening, as well.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Komarov. I’m glad I could help, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll review the blood test results in a week and discuss the next steps. I’m hopeful we can get to the bottom of this. In the meantime, take care, and try not to worry too much. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. A follow-up appointment in a week is great. Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your help. I'll go get the blood tests done as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. You take care too, Mr. Komarov. And remember, if anything changes or worsens, don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you next week.
