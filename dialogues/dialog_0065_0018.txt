DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Hmm... well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I seem to be… going to the bathroom rather frequently. More than usual, I believe. It’s been happening for… oh, a while now, I suppose. It’s not painful, just… inconvenient. I don’t recall exactly when it started, though. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, you say. Alright. And when you say “frequently,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… oh dear. That is a challenge. Perhaps… every couple of hours, during the day? Maybe more? It’s difficult to be precise. I drink a fair amount of water, you see. Always have. But I don’t think it’s significantly more than usual. It just… ends up being more trips to the facilities, if that makes any sense. I truly apologize for not being able to offer a clearer answer. My memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: A fair amount of water. And you said it’s not painful, no burning or urgency?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not a bit. And no burning sensation, certainly not. And I wouldn't say urgency, either. It’s… a regular feeling, just… more often. It doesn’t keep me awake at night, if that’s what you’re thinking. Just… a constant awareness, really. I do find myself checking the location of restrooms when I’m out and about, more than I used to. A small thing, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… Hmm. Let me think. That’s a good question. It appears… normal, I believe. The usual color, nothing cloudy or… foamy, I don’t think. I haven’t noticed any blood, thankfully. It’s hard to say, though, isn’t it? I don’t spend a great deal of time analyzing it, if you understand. It goes in, it comes out… usually. I hope that isn’t too blunt.
DOCTOR: No, that’s… acceptable. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: Fever or chills… no, none at all. No, thankfully. And no lower back pain. Everything else feels… normal, I suppose. I haven’t felt unwell in any other way. Just this… frequent urination. It's a bit bothersome, mostly because it interrupts things. I do enjoy my gardening, you see, and having to make frequent trips indoors isn't ideal. I don’t believe it’s serious, but I thought it best to have it checked.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… let me see. I’ve generally been quite healthy, truthfully. A touch of high blood pressure a few years back, but it was managed with… well, a small pill, I believe. I don’t recall the name, I’m afraid. And I had a bout of… influenza, perhaps ten years ago? Nothing major. No surgeries, no… chronic illnesses. I try to stay active, eat a reasonable diet. I'm a simple man, Doctor. A garden, a book… that's about it. I don't take many medications currently, just a daily vitamin, I think.
DOCTOR: And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. That is another difficult one. My father had… something with his heart, I believe. A weak heart, perhaps? He passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t recall the specifics. My mother lived to a good age, though. She had… arthritis, I think. In her hands, mostly. And an uncle, on my mother's side, had… diabetes, perhaps? It’s all rather hazy, I apologize. My family wasn’t one for discussing medical details, if that makes any sense. It was considered a private matter.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Well, as I mentioned, I live a rather simple life. I'm single, never married. I don’t smoke, never have. And I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, if anything. I live alone, but I have a few acquaintances in the village. I enjoy my own company, mostly. Gardening keeps me busy, of course. And reading. I’m quite content, truthfully. No… risky behaviours, if that’s what you mean. A quiet life, Doctor. A very quiet life.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with listening to your abdomen and checking your reflexes.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you require. Listening to my abdomen… very good. I shall lie down on the table, then. Please let me know if you need anything. I hope I’m not proving to be too much trouble with my… lack of precise recollection.
DOCTOR: Alright. Abdomen is soft, no masses or tenderness to palpation. Bowel sounds are normal. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is within normal limits. I'm going to perform a quick neurological exam, just to be thorough. Follow my finger with your eyes, please. Don’t move your head.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. There. Is that satisfactory? I hope I’m not too shaky. It’s nothing deliberate, I assure you. Simply… getting older, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Your cranial nerves are intact. Now, I'm going to need a urine sample. There’s a collection cup in the bathroom. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample. And could you please bring it back to me when you’re finished?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A urine sample. Yes, of course. Mid-stream… I recall that. I shall go to the bathroom and collect the sample, then. I apologize for the inconvenience. Hopefully, I can manage it without too much difficulty.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Verbos.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I believe I managed it correctly. It was a little… challenging, but I followed the instructions as best I could. Please let me know if you require anything further. I’m rather concerned that I’m being a bother.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verbos. I'm going to send this off to the lab for a urinalysis. We’ll check for infection, glucose, and protein. While we're waiting for the results, I'd like to order a Complete Blood Count as well, just to rule out any other underlying issues. This will give us a better picture of your overall health.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. A Complete Blood Count and a urinalysis. That sounds… thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to investigate this matter so diligently. I confess, I was rather worried it might be something serious. I shall await the results with… anticipation, I suppose. Please let me know as soon as they are available.
DOCTOR: We’ll get the results back within a couple of days. In the meantime, I'd like you to keep a bladder diary. Write down every time you urinate, including the time and the amount of fluid you drink. This will help us identify any patterns. Also, I want to be cautious. Given your age and the mild tremor I observed, I’m going to refer you to a neurologist for a quick evaluation. It’s likely nothing, but it’s best to rule out any neurological causes.
PATIENT: A bladder diary… and a neurologist? A bladder diary, I can manage, I suppose. It will require some discipline, but I shall endeavor to be precise. However, a neurologist… Is that… is that cause for alarm, Doctor? I confess, I hadn't anticipated this. Is my tremor a significant concern? I truly hope it is nothing serious.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Verbos, it is not cause for alarm. It’s simply a precautionary measure. The tremor is mild, and you’re of an age where these things can occur. It’s better to be thorough and rule out any underlying neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's or essential tremor. We’ll get you in to see the neurologist quickly, and they’ll perform a quick assessment. It’s likely nothing, but we need to be certain. In the meantime, focus on the bladder diary. And try not to worry.
PATIENT: Parkinson’s… essential tremor… Very well, Doctor. If you believe it is necessary, I shall schedule an appointment with the neurologist. Although… I confess, the prospect is rather unsettling. I appreciate your thoroughness, truly, but it is… concerning. Are you certain it is nothing to worry about? I understand you must be cautious, but… I would greatly appreciate your honest assessment. And thank you again for your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbos, I understand your concern. And I assure you, it is highly likely that this is nothing serious. We are simply being proactive, ruling out all possibilities. It's better to know one way or the other, and the neurologist will provide a definitive answer. Don't anticipate the worst. Focus on the bladder diary and try to maintain a positive outlook. I’ll contact you as soon as the lab results are back. Have a good day, Mr. Verbos. And please, try not to worry.
