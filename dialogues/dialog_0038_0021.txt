DOCTOR: Good morning, Ricky. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my foot… it’s been swelling up. It started a few days ago, and it just keeps getting bigger. It’s on this side, <points to left foot> mostly around the ankle. It kinda hurts, but not bad bad, you know? Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Swelling in the left ankle, started a few days ago. And you'd describe the pain as uncomfortable rather than severely painful?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Uncomfortable is a good word. Like, I can still walk on it, I have been walking on it, to get here and all. But after a while, especially at the end of the day, it gets… achy. And it feels kinda warm, if that makes sense? Not fever warm, just… warmer than my other foot.
DOCTOR: Okay, warmer to the touch. And you said it’s been getting progressively worse over the last few days?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely getting bigger each day. I noticed it first when I was putting on my shoes, felt a bit tighter than usual. Now… well, look at it. <lifts left leg slightly to show ankle> It's not like, huge, but it's not normal, is it? I haven't done anything to it, either. No twist or bump or anything like that. Just… happened.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. No specific injury, just gradual onset of swelling and warmth. Have you noticed any changes in the color of your skin around the ankle?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. <Looks down at his foot, flexing his toes> It looks… maybe a little bit redder than usual? It's hard to tell, I have… you know, darker skin. It's not bright red or anything, just a bit… flushed, maybe? I don't know if that's the right word. And it feels a bit tight, like my skin is stretched.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little redness and tightness. Have you had any fever, chills, or any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. Nothing like that. I just feel a bit tired, but I'm always a bit tired, to be honest. Old age, you know? <chuckles softly> No, nothing else. Just the foot. I haven't felt sick or anything. I ate a good breakfast this morning, though! Oatmeal. Very healthy. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Oatmeal is healthy, Ricky, but probably not directly related to your foot. Alright. Let's take a look at it. Would you mind if I examined your foot and ankle?
PATIENT: No, no, go ahead, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I'm happy to help. Just tell me if it's going to be uncomfortable. I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to poking and prodding. <grimaces playfully>
DOCTOR: Okay, Ricky. I'm just going to feel around your ankle and check how it moves. Tell me if anything is particularly sore. …Alright. It is warmer than your other ankle, and there’s some tenderness when I press here, on the outside of your ankle. Your range of motion is a little limited, but not severely. Your pulses feel good and strong, which is reassuring. I don't see any breaks in the skin. It’s definitely swollen compared to your right ankle. How about if I take your blood pressure and check your temperature just to get a baseline?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. That all sounds right, what you're saying. It is warmer, I knew it! And yeah, moving it isn’t as easy as it used to be. Blood pressure and temperature is fine, go ahead. Hopefully everything's alright. I haven't got insurance, you see, so I'm a bit worried about big bills. <fidgets with his hands> Not that I expect anything bad, but you never know.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 138/82, and your temperature is 98.6, so those are both within normal limits. Given what we’ve discussed, the swelling, the warmth, the tenderness, and the limited range of motion, it sounds like you might have a sprain, or potentially some early signs of arthritis in the ankle. It's difficult to say for certain without an X-ray, but given that you haven't had any specific injury, arthritis is a possibility. Do you have any history of arthritis in your family?
PATIENT: Arthritis… Hmm. My mother, she had trouble with her hands, real bad. Couldn't open jars, always needed help. She went to a special doctor for it, a long time ago. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had problems with his knees. Always complaining about them. So, yeah, there's some history of it in the family, I guess. My sister is fine, though, as far as I know. She lives in Canada, so I don't see her much. <pauses> Does that mean I need an X-ray? How much does one of those cost?
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis is good to know. Given that, and the fact that your symptoms haven’t improved with rest, an X-ray would be a good idea to rule out a fracture and get a better look at the bones and joints in your ankle. It will help us determine the cause of the swelling and guide treatment. I understand your concern about costs. The price of an X-ray can vary, but around here it typically costs between $100 and $300 without insurance. We can also look into options for a lower-cost imaging center, or see if there are any assistance programs available. I'll have my staff look into that for you. Would you be comfortable with me ordering an X-ray of your left ankle today?
PATIENT: Okay, $100 to $300… that’s… manageable, I think. If it helps figure out what’s wrong, then yeah, go ahead and order the X-ray. I’d rather know for sure, you know? And thank you for looking into cheaper options, that would be very kind of you. I appreciate that. Is it a long wait to get one done? I have a… appointment with the mosque on Friday, so I don’t want to miss that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ricky, I’ll go ahead and order the X-ray now. The radiology department is just down the hall, and they usually can get you in pretty quickly. I'd estimate a wait time of about 30-45 minutes, but I’ll ask my staff to check for you and let you know. They'll also give you information about the cost and payment options. In the meantime, let’s talk about some things you can do at home to help manage your symptoms. We call this RICE therapy: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. Try to avoid putting too much weight on your foot, apply ice packs for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day, use a compression bandage, and elevate your foot whenever possible. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation… RICE. Okay, I can remember that. Rest, I can do. I'm retired, so I don’t have much to run around for. Ice… I have some frozen peas in the freezer. Will that work? And compression… I think I have a bandage somewhere. Elevation… I can put my foot up on a chair, yeah. Sounds sensible. My mother always used to put her feet up. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I hope this X-ray doesn't show anything too bad. <nervously fidgets with his hands again>
DOCTOR: Frozen peas work perfectly fine, Ricky! They mold nicely to the ankle. And yes, elevating it on a chair is great. I understand your nervousness, but we'll take it one step at a time. We’ll get the X-ray done, review the results, and then discuss the best course of action. My staff will come in shortly and let you know when you're ready for the X-ray. Do you have any other questions for me before they come in?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything I was worried about. Just… thank you again, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease a little bit. It’s good to have someone explain things properly, you know? Some doctors just rush you through. You've been very patient with an old man like me. <smiles weakly> I'll just sit here and try not to worry. And I'll remember RICE. Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation… hopefully that'll help until I get the results. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ricky. It’s my pleasure. And don’t worry about being an “old man” – you're a valued patient, and I’m happy to take the time to ensure you understand everything. We’ll get those X-ray results back as quickly as possible. My staff will be in touch to schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they have them. In the meantime, just focus on resting and following the RICE therapy. Take care, Ricky.
