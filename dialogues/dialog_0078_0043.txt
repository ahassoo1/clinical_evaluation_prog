DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been gettin’ these headaches… right in the back of my head, near the neck. Been happenin’ for… oh, I’d say a couple weeks now, maybe a little longer. Not constant, comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches for a couple of weeks, coming and going, located at the back of your head near your neck. Can you describe the headache itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s not a throbbing headache, not like a migraine my daughter used to get. More… a dull ache, kinda pressure-like. Sometimes it feels tight, like a band squeezin’ my head. It doesn’t make me wanna throw up, and light doesn’t bother me none. Just… uncomfortable, ya know? Makes it hard to concentrate sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A dull ache with a pressure or tightness sensation, not throbbing, and no nausea or sensitivity to light. It's affecting your concentration. That’s helpful to know. Now, when these headaches come on, is there anything that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed a specific thing. Sometimes it happens when I’m workin’ on the computer for a long time, helpin’ folks with their finances. But other times it just… starts. I been tryin’ to think, but I can’t pinpoint anything for sure. I do sometimes feel a little stressed with the market bein’ so unpredictable these days, if that makes a difference. I worry about my clients losin' money, ya know?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes a difference, Mr. Gibbel. Stress can certainly play a role. So, the headaches can occur when you’re working on the computer, but also seem to happen spontaneously, and you’ve been experiencing some stress related to the financial market. Let’s talk a little bit more about those times when you're working on the computer. How long are you typically working at a time before you start to feel the headache coming on?
PATIENT: Oh, usually a few hours, I guess. Sometimes longer if I'm really focused on somethin' important for a client. I try to take breaks, but… well, you know how it is. When you’re busy, time just flies by. I'm usually sittin' at my desk, lookin' at charts and numbers all day. My posture isn't the best, I reckon. I tend to slouch a bit when I'm deep in thought. My daughter keeps tellin' me to sit up straight!
DOCTOR: Daughters always seem to know best, don’t they?
PATIENT: That's the truth. She’s a physical therapist, so she's always naggin’ me about my back and posture. She’s probably right, though. I haven't been takin' care of myself as well as I should. It’s hard when you’re self-employed and always on the go. But back to these headaches… they don’t usually last long, if that makes sense. Maybe an hour, sometimes two, then they fade away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the headaches last about an hour or two, and they come and go. They don't seem to be progressively worsening, and you've noticed they can occur during periods of prolonged computer use, and possibly when you’re stressed. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no dizziness, no blurry vision. I haven't been feelin' nauseous, like I said before. My neck does get a little stiff sometimes when the headache’s botherin' me, but I figured that was just from sittin' at the computer too long. And… I guess I have been a little more tired than usual lately, but I chalked that up to gettin’ older.
DOCTOR: Getting older does come with its own set of changes. No fever, no dizziness, no blurry vision, no nausea. Neck stiffness with the headaches and increased fatigue. That’s all very helpful information. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high cholesterol for a while, but I changed my diet and it got under control. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy, knock on wood. No diabetes, no arthritis, nothin’ like that. I used to smoke a bit, years ago, but I quit over thirty years ago. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, well that’s good to hear. History of high cholesterol which is now controlled with diet. You quit smoking over thirty years ago, and you drink alcohol occasionally. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a kid, that’s about it. And I had a cataract removed from my left eye a few years back, but that went pretty smooth. Other than that, nothin’ major. No broken bones, no serious injuries, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and cataract removal from the left eye a few years ago. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had heart disease, and my father had some problems with his memory as he got older, maybe Alzheimer's, but it was a long time ago and we didn't really have a proper diagnosis. My sister has arthritis, but that’s about it. No cancer that I know of, thankfully. Oh, and my grandmother on my mother’s side had really bad migraines, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: That is relevant, Mr. Gibbel, thank you for mentioning that. History of heart disease in your mother, possible Alzheimer’s in your father, arthritis in your sister, and migraines in your grandmother. Now, before we proceed, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven't had any problems with medications in the past. My daughter always double-checks when she takes me to the dentist, just to be safe, but they haven’t found anything yet. I guess I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No known allergies. Okay, Mr. Gibbel, this is all very helpful information. It sounds like you've been experiencing headaches for a couple of weeks now, located at the back of your head and neck. They’re typically a dull ache with a pressure sensation, not throbbing, and don’t seem to be progressively worsening. They’re associated with neck stiffness and sometimes fatigue, and can occur during periods of prolonged computer use or stress. You have a history of high cholesterol which is now controlled with diet, an appendectomy as a child, cataract removal, and a family history of heart disease, possible Alzheimer’s, arthritis, and migraines. And no known allergies. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like these headaches could be tension headaches, possibly exacerbated by stress and your work habits. However, given your age and family history, I want to rule out other potential causes. Would you be comfortable if I perform a brief physical exam, just to check your neurological function and blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ everything into consideration. I’d be comfortable with that, definitely. I just want to make sure it’s not somethin' serious. I’ve been feelin’ a little worried about it, to be honest. So, yeah, go ahead with the exam. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gibbel. It’s always best to be thorough. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 142/90, but that could be due to some anxiety about the visit. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Neurologically, your reflexes are normal, and your cranial nerves are intact. I’m also palpating your neck muscles and scalp to assess for any tenderness. I’m noticing some mild tenderness in the muscles at the base of your skull. Alright, everything seems normal so far, but given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the tenderness in your neck muscles, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also recommend we get an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. I trust your judgment. A blood test and an EKG, that's fine with me. Whatever you think will give us the clearest picture. I appreciate you takin’ the time to check everything out so thoroughly. When do I need to get those done?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gibbel. It’s my pleasure. We can get the blood test and EKG done right here in the clinic today. It’ll take about 30 minutes. After we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the next steps. While we're waiting for the results, I’m going to recommend some conservative measures you can take at home. First, try to manage your stress levels with relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises or meditation. Secondly, make sure you’re taking frequent breaks from the computer and maintaining good posture. Lastly, I’m going to recommend an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the headaches, if needed. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds good, Doctor. Deep breathin’, breaks, and good posture. I can definitely try to do that. And I have some ibuprofen at home, so that’s covered. I don’t think I have any questions right now. I guess we just wait for the results, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll wait for the results. The lab should have them back to us within a couple of hours. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if your headaches worsen or you develop any new symptoms like fever, dizziness, vision changes, or weakness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Gibbel. I’m optimistic that we’ll be able to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better soon. Do you have any other concerns before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. I really appreciate your thoroughness and your kind manner. You've put my mind at ease. I'll definitely follow your instructions and let your nurse know if anything changes. Thank you again for everything. I hope you have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gibbel. I’m glad I could help. And you have a good day as well. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: .
