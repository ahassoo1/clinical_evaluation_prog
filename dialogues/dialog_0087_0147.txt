DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump in my lower abdomen, and it’s been… concerning me a bit. I wanted to get it checked out, just to be sure everything is alright.
DOCTOR: I understand. A lump is certainly something to get evaluated. To help me understand what's going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it’s probably been there for a few weeks, maybe a month? At first, I didn’t really notice it, just felt a little… fullness. But it’s grown a bit since then. It doesn’t really hurt, not usually, but sometimes I feel a little discomfort, especially if I move around a lot. It feels… firm, I guess? Not really soft or squishy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks to a month, growing slowly, firm, and some discomfort with movement. That’s helpful. Can you point to exactly where you’re feeling this lump?
PATIENT: Right here, Doctor. About… this much below my belly button. It’s kind of in the middle, but maybe a little to the left. I hope that makes sense. It’s hard to describe exactly.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. And to clarify, has anything caused the lump, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Hm… that’s a good question. Not that I'm aware of, no. I haven’t had any injuries or anything like that to the area. I haven’t changed my diet or anything recently either. It just… appeared, as far as I can tell. I did have a bit of a stomach bug a couple months ago, but that was completely resolved, and this lump wasn't there then.
DOCTOR: Alright. No injury, no dietary changes, and it appeared after a stomach bug that has since resolved. Thank you. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with this lump?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little more tired than usual, lately. But I figured it was just from work, honestly. I’ve been putting in some long hours with a new choreography project. And, come to think of it, I’ve been going to the bathroom a bit more frequently. Nothing terrible, but… more often than I usually do. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: That is relevant. Increased fatigue and more frequent bathroom visits are good things to note. To be more specific with the bathroom visits, are we talking about needing to urinate more often, or is it changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Mostly needing to urinate more often, Doctor. Not so much with my bowel movements. I’ve been…regular, if that makes sense. But definitely needing to go to the bathroom to pee more frequently throughout the day and sometimes even during the night. It's not painful, just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased urinary frequency without pain. That’s helpful information. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’m generally quite healthy, thankfully. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything serious. I do have some mild seasonal allergies, but that’s about it. And I take a daily multivitamin, just to keep things topped up, but no prescription medications or anything like that. My wife always tells me to mention that!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No serious medical conditions, mild allergies, and a daily multivitamin. And family history - are there any significant medical issues that run in your family?
PATIENT: Let me think… My father had high blood pressure, and he was treated for it for years. My mother, she had some problems with her gallbladder, I believe, and needed to have it removed. And my grandmother, on my mother's side, she had diabetes. But other than that, not that I'm aware of. I don't really know much about my family history beyond that, honestly. It's… not something we talked about a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. High blood pressure in your father, gallbladder issues in your mother, and diabetes in your grandmother. Thank you. And finally, just to cover all bases, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication before. I can take most things without issue, as far as I know. I haven’t needed much medication in my life, thankfully! Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No allergies to medication. Okay, Mr. Raghunathan, thank you for that thorough history. I'd like to perform a physical exam now, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen and feeling for the lump you described. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I want to get this figured out. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table, if you would. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay, good. Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen, starting away from the lump and working my way towards it. Please let me know if anything feels tender or uncomfortable. …Okay, I’m feeling a firm, non-tender mass approximately two inches above your navel, slightly left of the midline. It's approximately… two centimeters in diameter. It does not appear to be mobile. It’s not painful to the touch, which is reassuring. I’m also not feeling any signs of guarding or rebound tenderness. Do you feel any discomfort now as I’m pressing here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that doesn’t feel particularly uncomfortable. It feels… about the same as before, just the usual firmness. Not painful at all. It's a little strange feeling it being pressed on, but not unpleasant. I'm just… anxious to know what it is, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety. Alright, based on the physical exam findings, we have a firm, non-tender mass, approximately two centimeters in diameter, located two inches above your navel, slightly left of the midline. It's not mobile and doesn't cause rebound tenderness. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I'd like to order a few tests. I’m going to order a Complete Blood Count to check your overall blood health and rule out any signs of infection. I’d also like to order a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel to assess your kidney and liver function. And finally, I'm going to order an abdominal ultrasound. The ultrasound will give us a detailed image of the mass and help us determine its size, shape, and composition. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that all sounds very reasonable. Whatever you think is best. A CBC, CMP, and an abdominal ultrasound… yes, please. I just want to know what we’re dealing with. How long will it take to get those results? And… will I need to do anything to prepare for the ultrasound?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll get those orders processed right away. You can have the blood work done at the lab just down the hall. As for the ultrasound, typically, you don't need any special preparation. You can eat and drink normally before the appointment. We'll schedule that for you as soon as possible - let me check availability. Okay, we can get you in for an abdominal ultrasound on August 7th, at 10:00 AM. Does that work for your schedule?
PATIENT: August 7th at 10:00 AM… yes, that works perfectly fine. Thank you. Will the results of the ultrasound be sent to you directly? And… should I expect a call when they’re ready, or do I need to follow up? I just want to make sure I don’t miss anything. My wife is very… concerned, and she’ll want to know as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: August 7th at 10:00 AM is confirmed. The results will be sent directly to my office electronically. I will review them as soon as they are available, and my staff will contact you directly to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. We will make sure to get that scheduled quickly – likely within a few days of receiving the results. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll make sure to get the blood work done right away, and I’ll be ready for the ultrasound on August 7th. Thank you again for your help. I think that’s all for now.
