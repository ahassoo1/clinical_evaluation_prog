DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, apparently. My husband made the appointment. He’s been fussing over my numbers with that new machine he got. Honestly, I feel fine.
DOCTOR: “Apparently,” you say. Well, it’s good that your husband is proactive about your health, even if it's a bit… concerning of you to dismiss it. High blood pressure can be very dangerous even if you feel fine, as you put it. Do you have any idea what those numbers were, specifically?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. He just kept saying they were “too high” and I needed to see someone. Numbers aren't my thing. I fix things, I don’t memorize them. He gets obsessed with gadgets, always has. It's probably just the machine is wrong.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll certainly verify the accuracy of the machine. However, dismissing a potential health issue simply because you “fix things” and don’t enjoy looking at numbers isn’t… particularly helpful, Ms. Dudney. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've always been… healthy. I work outside, lots of physical labor. I don’t sit around all day, unlike some people. And I certainly haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Is this going to take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: “Lots of physical labor” doesn’t necessarily preclude someone from developing hypertension, Ms. Dudney. In fact, it can sometimes contribute to it. And yes, I understand you have a busy schedule. I assure you, I will be as efficient as possible. Before we proceed, let's get some baseline information. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Not even bee stings. My husband tried to get me to take some allergy pills last spring when the wildflowers were blooming, said I was sneezing too much, but I told him I was just enjoying the smell. Waste of money, those pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. When I remember. My husband buys them, too. He’s always trying to get me to “optimize” something. Honestly, I think he just likes the idea of having a healthy wife more than he cares about my actual health. Does that count?
DOCTOR: It’s… good that he’s invested in your well-being, even if his methods are… unorthodox. However, a multivitamin isn’t going to address potential hypertension. Now, let's move on to your family history. Do either of your parents have high blood pressure, heart disease, or any kidney problems?
PATIENT: My dad… he worked construction his whole life, really hard labor. He was always big, you know? Big guy. He died when I was young, heart attack, I think. My mom… she didn't really do much of anything. Stayed home, baked, that kind of thing. She lived a long time, though. I don't remember her ever being sick, really. So, no. Not that I know of. It’s been a while, though. I was pretty young when my dad passed.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What am I, a history book? I work. I come home. I eat dinner with my husband. We watch TV sometimes. We don’t really… go out much. He prefers to stay home, too. Is this really necessary? I thought we were here for my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Ms. Dudney. Lifestyle factors significantly impact blood pressure. I need a complete picture to assess your risk and determine the best course of action. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Never. Makes you smell terrible and it’s just… pointless. My dad tried it once, years ago. Didn’t last long. He coughed for a week. A waste of money, like everything else.
DOCTOR: And how much alcohol do you consume, if any?
PATIENT: Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. When I’m feeling fancy. Usually, it’s just water. My husband drinks beer, a couple of them after work. He says it helps him relax. But me? Not really a drinker. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like your lifestyle is generally… straightforward. Now, let's get some actual measurements. I'm going to take your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and perform a quick physical exam. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, I don’t see what all this fuss is about. I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Dudney, try to relax. Just breathe normally. 168 over 92 on your right arm, and 165 over 90 on your left. Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated at 88. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No murmurs, rubs or gallops detected. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Pulses are 2+ and equal bilaterally. No edema noted in extremities. Your blood pressure is significantly elevated, Ms. Dudney. That is well above the normal range. It confirms your husband’s concern.
PATIENT: Elevated? It feels normal. See? I told you. He always worries too much. Is that all? Can I go now? I have a fence to fix.
DOCTOR: “Feeling normal” and being normal are two very different things, Ms. Dudney. Untreated hypertension can lead to serious complications – stroke, heart attack, kidney failure – it's not something to dismiss lightly. We need to investigate this further. I’d like to order some blood work – a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and an EKG to assess your heart function. And I recommend a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to get a better understanding of your blood pressure fluctuations throughout the day.
PATIENT: More tests? Seriously? I don’t have time for this. I have things to do. Can’t you just… give me something for it? A pill or something? My husband has a bunch of different medications, maybe one of those will work.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Ms. Dudney. I cannot and will not prescribe medication without a proper diagnosis based on comprehensive testing. Taking someone else’s medication is incredibly dangerous and irresponsible. And "a pill or something" is not a treatment plan. Ignoring this could have severe consequences, and frankly, your dismissive attitude is concerning. I strongly advise you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the tests and develop an appropriate treatment plan. If you continue to refuse testing and treatment, I must document your refusal in your medical record.
PATIENT: Fine! Whatever. Just… give me the papers for the tests. Get it over with. But don't expect me to come back. My husband can deal with it if he's so worried. He always has to have things his way.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Dudney. Here are the lab orders and the consent form. The lab is located just down the hall. They require a photo ID. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with my office as soon as you have the results. I strongly encourage you to reconsider your approach to your health. Dismissing potential serious conditions is never advisable. You may get dressed now. .
PATIENT: Gadgets and pills… honestly.
