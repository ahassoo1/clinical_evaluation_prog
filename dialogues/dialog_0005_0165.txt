DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it's this fever. Keeps comin' back. It ain't nothin' serious, I don't think, but it's gettin' old. Happens every few weeks, just outta nowhere. Mostly just feel tired and achy with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a recurring fever… every few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. Sometimes it lasts a day, sometimes two. Hard to say exactly. It just... shows up. Then it's gone. Like a bad dream. I just want to figure out why it keeps happenin'.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And when it happens, do you notice anything else?
PATIENT: Not really, nothin' I can put my finger on. Maybe a little bit of a headache sometimes, but I get those anyway. Appetite's usually okay. No cough, no… you know, nothin' like that. Just tired and warm. It's weird, doc. Really weird.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how high would you say the fever gets, generally?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven't been keepin' track with a thermometer. My wife usually checks when I look real flushed, and she says around 101, 102 maybe. Not sky high, but enough to knock me down for a bit. I mostly just try to sleep it off.
DOCTOR: Okay, 101, 102… That's good to know. Have you had any changes in your life recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Not really. Same old, same old. Workin' at the clinic, comin' home to my wife, watchin' the ballgame. No big trips, no new hobbies… nothin' like that. I wish there was a change, somethin' to point to, y'know? Makes it easier to figure things out.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope, no medications. Never been much of a pill-taker. And allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to nothin'. I eat pretty much anything, honestly. My wife always jokes I got a cast-iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let's talk a little about your past health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Nope. Doc, I've been lucky. A few sprains here and there workin' as a chiropractor, but nothin' serious. High blood pressure, the doc told me years ago, but I watch my salt, and it’s been okay. Otherwise, pretty healthy for a sixty-five year old, if I do say so myself. My wife always says I’m a tough old bird.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to hear. And has anyone in your family had any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had some trouble with his heart when he got older, but that was a long time ago. And my mother, she had arthritis, mostly in her hands. Other than that, nothin' jumps to mind. We're a pretty healthy bunch, all things considered. Though, my cousin, she had some… I think it was lupus? A long time ago, when we were kids. But that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your daily life, just to get a better picture of things. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never touched 'em. Not my thing. Always been a straight arrow. My wife would kill me if I even thought about it. She's a good woman, keeps me on the straight and narrow. Besides, I gotta be sharp for work, y'know? Can't be messin' with that.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your throat, and feel your abdomen. Just relax and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright, doc. Whatever you need to do. Just get it over with quick, if you don't mind. I got patients waitin' back at the clinic, and I'm already runnin' a bit late.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I don't feel any masses or enlargement. Your throat looks clear as well, no redness or swelling. Temperature is 101.3 Fahrenheit. Your lymph nodes feel slightly enlarged, but not significantly. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any infection or underlying cause. It’ll give us a better idea of what's going on.
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Alright, doc. Sounds good. I just hope it ain't nothin' serious. I really don't have time for a long illness. Where do I go to get that done? And how long will it take to get the results? I need to know if I gotta call in sick or somethin'.
DOCTOR: Okay. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. They'll draw a standard panel - complete blood count, metabolic panel, and a few inflammatory markers. It usually takes about 24-48 hours for the results to come back. I'll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as we have them. For now, I recommend you take it easy, drink plenty of fluids, and get some rest. We'll go from there once we have the blood work results. In the meantime, if your fever spikes above 103, or if you develop any new symptoms like a rash, shortness of breath, or severe headache, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, I understand. Down the hall, 24-48 hours, nurse will call. Fluids and rest. And emergency room if it gets worse. Got it. Alright, doc. Thank you. I appreciate it. Hopefully, it's just a bug. Let me get this blood work done and get back to work.
