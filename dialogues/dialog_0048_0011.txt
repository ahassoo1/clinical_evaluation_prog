DOCTOR: Right. Armando Honcoop, 64. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Sink, if I may be frank, I haven’t got all day. I need a… a permission slip. For a little… improvement. A cosmetic thing. You know, to look presentable. Is that what you need to know? Just want it done and over with.
DOCTOR: A "permission slip"?
PATIENT: Yes, a permission slip! The… the place said I need a doctor to say it’s okay. Before they… do anything. It’s a simple procedure. Not asking for a life extension, just a little… touch-up. Honestly, all this paperwork… I haven’t the time.
DOCTOR: Right. And what exactly is this “touch-up” you’re referring to?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it's rather personal. But… well, it's about my face. Some… sagging. You know, age. I want it… tightened. It’s not a big deal. Is that enough information for your… permission slip? I really don’t understand why I need to explain all this.
DOCTOR: Sagging, you say. And where, precisely, is this sagging occurring?
PATIENT: Everywhere, Doctor! All over. The cheeks, the… the jowls. It’s… noticeable. Look, I’m not a plastic surgery expert, I just want it fixed! Is that alright? I don't have time to point at every little wrinkle. Honestly, the youth of today… always needing details.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you had any… medical evaluations for this “sagging”?
PATIENT: Medical evaluations? For sagging? Doctor, are you serious? I haven't gone to a hospital for a little bit of drooping! I just want it… pulled. It's a simple request. I am a perfectly healthy man, as far as I know. I haven’t been sick a day in my life, practically. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No prior evaluation… of course not. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I recall. Maybe to dust? Or… pollen. It’s been years since I had a proper allergy attack. Honestly, Doctor, I don't keep a running list of everything that makes me sneeze. Is this really necessary for a little… cosmetic thing? I'm wasting valuable time here.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Nothing regular, no. I might take an aspirin now and then for a… ache. But that’s it. Just the occasional aspirin. I try to stay away from those pills. They just make you feel worse, if you ask me. I am a simple man, Doctor. Simple needs.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just… confirm a few things. You’re 64, African American, and you want… facial tightening. No known allergies, no regular medications, and you’ve had no prior medical evaluation for this issue. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s all perfectly correct. Finally! Can we get this… permission slip sorted? I have places to be, you know. This is taking far too long. And frankly, I'm not sure why I even need to be here explaining all this. It’s a cosmetic procedure, not open-heart surgery!
DOCTOR: Here. This is a basic consent form. It states you understand the potential risks of… cosmetic procedures. It’s rather generic, as I haven't performed any examination. Read it carefully. I strongly advise you consult with a qualified plastic surgeon before proceeding. I’m not comfortable providing a detailed medical opinion without a thorough assessment.
PATIENT: Risks? Honestly, everything has risks! This is ridiculous. There. Happy now? Can I go? I haven't got all day, you know. This has been a complete waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You may leave. And do consider my advice regarding a specialist. .
