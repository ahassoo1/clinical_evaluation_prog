DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… painful. My back, mostly. I want to get this over with quickly, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. “Painful” is a bit broad, though. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It… it’s a sharp ache. Lower back. Feels like something is stuck, maybe? I do a lot of heavy lifting with my job… fences. Been doing that for years. It started a few weeks ago, but it's getting worse, not better.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharp ache in the lower back, worsening over a few weeks, and you do heavy lifting as a fence installer. That gives me a starting point. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly when I move. Lifting, bending… even just twisting to look behind me. When I’m sitting still, it’s… duller. But doesn’t go away completely. I notice it most first thing in the morning.
DOCTOR: Alright. So it’s aggravated by movement, especially lifting and twisting, and a bit better when you’re still, but still present. Does the pain radiate anywhere – down your legs, for instance?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Down my left leg. Not all the way to my foot, but… to the knee. Sometimes feels… numb, a little, in my calf. Doesn’t happen all the time. It's worse when I’ve been working.
DOCTOR: Okay, radiating pain down the left leg to the knee, with some numbness in the calf. That’s helpful to know. Before we do a physical exam, let me ask a few more questions. Have you had any previous back problems, like injuries or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never broken anything, never had surgery. Just… always been strong. Always worked hard. This… this is new. My husband… he passed away five years ago. I had to take over the fence business. So, I kept working.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m sorry to hear about your husband. Taking over the business must have been a lot, especially on your body. Okay, no prior back problems. Any family history of back problems, arthritis, or anything like that?
PATIENT: My mother… she had arthritis in her hands. Real bad, towards the end. But not her back. My father… he was a rancher. Strong as an ox, never complained about much. I don’t… I don’t really know beyond that, to be honest. They’re both gone now.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with arthritis, father without known back problems. And you said this started a few weeks ago… were you doing anything differently when it began?
PATIENT: No… not really. Same work, same fences. Maybe a particularly heavy post… but I’ve lifted heavier before. That’s why I don’t understand it. It just… started. A little ache at first. Now… well, now it’s this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's take a look and see what's going on. I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart first, just for a general check. Then I'll need you to lie down on the exam table so I can check your back's range of motion and do a few neurological tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Fine. Let’s just get it done. The sooner I know, the sooner I can figure out how to fix it. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. Let's get started then. If you could just have a seat here for a moment, and we'll take a listen to your heart and lungs first. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Okay, Ms. Reihner, if you could lie down on the examination table, please. I'll gently examine your back.
PATIENT: Alright. Just tell me what you need me to do. And… be quick, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just gently feeling along your spine… any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Yes. Right… there. That’s where it hurts. Always hurts when you press there. And… it feels tighter on this side.
DOCTOR: Alright, and now I’m going to have you lift each leg, just to see if that aggravates the pain. Just let me know if you feel any shooting pain down your leg as you do so. And I'm going to check your reflexes now... Okay. Your range of motion is limited, particularly with bending forward. You have some tenderness and muscle spasm on the left side of your lower back. Your reflexes are normal, but sensation is slightly diminished in the left calf.
PATIENT: Diminished sensation… that explains the numbness. What does it mean? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It suggests there may be some compression of a nerve in your lower back, likely the sciatic nerve. It doesn't necessarily mean it's serious in the sense of needing immediate surgery, but it is something we need to investigate further to determine the exact cause and best course of treatment. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, it’s most likely a lumbar radiculopathy, commonly referred to as sciatica. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some imaging – an MRI of your lower back would be the most helpful. It will show us if there’s a herniated disc, spinal stenosis, or any other structural issues causing the nerve compression. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: MRI… will that take long? And… how much will it cost? I don’t have… a lot of money. I’m on Medicare.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question. The MRI itself usually takes about 30-45 minutes. As for the cost, with Medicare, you would likely have a copay and potentially a deductible depending on your plan. I can have our billing department contact you with the exact amount beforehand, so you know what to expect. They are very good about working with Medicare patients. In the meantime, we can start with some conservative treatment options to help manage your pain while we wait for the MRI results. These include pain medication, muscle relaxants, and physical therapy. Would you be open to trying those?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… I suppose. As long as it doesn’t make it worse. And pain medication… I don’t want anything too strong. I need to be able to work. Can I still do my job with physical therapy and… milder medication?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The goal isn't to completely immobilize you. We can tailor the physical therapy program to your specific needs and limitations. It will likely involve exercises to strengthen your back and core muscles, improve your flexibility, and learn proper lifting techniques. As for medication, we can start with something mild like ibuprofen or naproxen for the inflammation and potentially a muscle relaxant for short-term relief if needed. We can always adjust the dosage or try a different medication if it's not effective or if you experience any side effects. I’ll write you a prescription for ibuprofen and a referral to a physical therapist. I’ll also schedule you for the MRI as soon as possible. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… acceptable. Just get me the paperwork and the referral. And please, have billing call me. I need to know the cost. I have work to do, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll have the nurse bring you the paperwork and the referral information. And I’ve already made a note to have our billing department contact you as soon as possible regarding the cost. It was nice meeting you, Ms. Reihner. I hope you find some relief soon. If your pain worsens or you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office.
PATIENT: .
