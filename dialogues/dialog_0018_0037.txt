DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Thank you. I… I have been having trouble breathing. A whistling sound, when I breathe. Especially when I walk. It worries me a little. It's like… like a teapot, almost. Is that… is that making sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Kilton, that makes perfect sense. A whistling sound, like a teapot, is a very helpful description. It sounds as though you may be experiencing some wheezing. To understand this better, could you tell me a little more about when this trouble breathing started?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It started maybe… two weeks ago? At first, it was just when I was doing my exercises. I like to walk, you see. Keeps me strong. But then it started happening even when I wasn’t doing much. Just walking to the garden. It is getting… more often, I think. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Mrs. Kilton. It sounds like it’s gradually worsening, which is important to note. And it began with exertion, then progressed to occur with less activity. Could you describe the sensation of the whistling sound?
PATIENT: It feels… tight in my chest. Like something is squeezing. And the whistling… it’s mostly when I breathe out. Not so much when I breathe in. It’s not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. And it makes me feel a little… scared, to be honest. I don’t like not being able to breathe easily. Is this… is this serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mrs. Kilton, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel scared when you’re experiencing difficulty breathing. We need to determine the cause, and I want to assure you we will do that together. The fact that it's primarily on exhalation is a helpful detail. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me if anything specifically seems to trigger these episodes, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific. Sometimes it seems worse when it is hot and humid outside. But other times, it happens on a nice day. I did notice… it was a little worse when I was helping my grandson with his gardening yesterday. Lots of dust, maybe? But I do not think that is it, because it happened before then. I try to stay away from smoke, I always have. I do not think it is the dust, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Kilton. It’s good that you’ve been mindful of avoiding smoke, that’s very helpful information. The humidity being a factor is also noted. Now, let’s talk about other health concerns. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as asthma, COPD, heart problems, or allergies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not. I have been very lucky, I think. I have always been strong and healthy. I had a little trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but the doctor gave me a little pill and it has been fine ever since. Other than that… no. No asthma, no heart trouble, no allergies. I do not take many medicines. Just the pill for my blood pressure and sometimes something for my knees if they bother me.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Mrs. Kilton. Managing your blood pressure is excellent. And just the occasional medication for your knees is good as well. Now, to be thorough, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including the name and dosage of the blood pressure pill and the knee medication?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. The blood pressure pill… it is called Lisinopril. I take 10 milligrams, once a day, in the morning. And the knee medicine… it is Ibuprofen. Only when I need it, you see. 200 milligrams, two tablets, if my knees are really bothering me. But not every day. Maybe once or twice a week, sometimes less. I do not like to take too many pills, Doctor. They make me feel… funny sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Kilton. That’s very helpful. Lisinopril 10mg daily and Ibuprofen as needed. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder out many years ago. A long time ago. Maybe 30 years? And… I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my wrist when I was younger. Just to set it, you see. Other than that… no. No other surgeries. No other hospital stays. I try to stay out of hospitals if I can! They aren't very nice places, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mrs. Kilton. Hospitals aren’t the most pleasant places. Now, regarding your family history, are there any health conditions that run in your family, such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, or allergies?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a difficult question. My family… we didn't talk much about health. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. But she didn't go to the doctor much. And my father… he was strong, but he died young. Something with his lungs, I think. But I don’t know much about it. My brother… he has high blood pressure, like me. But that’s about it, I think. We are not a very healthy family, you see. We keep to ourselves. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mrs. Kilton. Knowing about your mother’s weak heart and your brother’s high blood pressure is good information. The information about your father is noted as well, even though it’s unclear. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I like to stay busy. I have a small garden, I like to walk, as I said. I help my grandson with his schoolwork sometimes. I used to volunteer at the library, but I haven't been going lately. Too much trouble with my breathing, you see. I do not smoke, never have. And I do not drink alcohol very much. Maybe a little wine with dinner once in a while. I eat healthy, mostly vegetables and fruit from my garden. I try to stay active, but it is getting harder with this breathing. Is that what you mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Kilton, that’s exactly what I meant. It sounds like you lead a very active and healthy lifestyle, which is wonderful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not. I have never had any allergies. I can eat anything, take most medicines. I have always been very lucky that way. I have never had a rash, never had trouble breathing from food. I can eat shellfish, peanuts, everything. I think I am very lucky. Is that… is that unusual, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is somewhat unusual, Mrs. Kilton, but certainly a good thing! Now, before we proceed, are you experiencing any other symptoms besides the trouble breathing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the breathing. No cough, no fever, no chest pain. No swelling in my ankles, no dizziness. Just the whistling sound when I breathe. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but that is just because I am getting older, you see. I sleep okay, eat okay. I am not losing weight. Just the breathing. That is all. I am glad it isn’t anything else. Is it possible it will just go away, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mrs. Kilton. It’s helpful that you aren’t experiencing any other symptoms. Now, to get a better understanding of your breathing, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I want to know what is happening, you see. If listening will help, then please do. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Mrs. Kilton, take a deep breath… and exhale… again… and exhale. I am hearing some wheezing in your lungs, which correlates with the whistling sound you described. Your oxygen saturation is currently 92%, which is a little on the lower side of normal. Given your history and the findings of my exam, it is possible you are experiencing some form of airway obstruction, which could be due to several factors. We need to investigate further to determine the cause and the best course of treatment. I want to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If you think that will help, then please do. A picture of my chest and a test… I trust your judgment. Whatever you need, I will do. I just want to feel better, you see. When can we do these tests? And will they hurt?
DOCTOR: That's very good, Mrs. Kilton. I understand your concern, and I’ll explain everything as we go. The chest X-ray will involve standing in front of a machine for a few seconds while it takes a picture of your lungs. It doesn’t hurt at all. The pulmonary function test involves breathing into a tube connected to a machine, and it will measure how much air you can breathe in and out. This may feel a little tiring, but it won't cause any pain. The radiology department is just down the hall, and we can get the X-ray done immediately. Then, the pulmonary function test can be done in the lab, which is next to the radiology department. We’ll need to schedule that for later today or tomorrow. Do you have any questions about the tests before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I understand. A picture and some breathing… It sounds alright. I trust you. Let’s do the picture first, you see. I want to get this over with. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Should I remove my jewelry?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mrs. Kilton. You've got a good attitude. Yes, it would be best to remove any metal jewelry, particularly necklaces, as it can interfere with the X-ray image. If you could remove those for me now, that would be great. Once you are done with the X-ray, they will let me know the results. Then we can discuss the next steps. Is there anyone you would like to have with you during the tests or when we discuss the results?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I think… I think my grandson, David, could come. He worries about me sometimes. He is a good boy. He drives me to the appointments, you see. He could come when you have the picture results. Is that alright? He is at work right now, though. I will call him.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly alright, Mrs. Kilton. Having someone for support is always a good idea. David is welcome to join us when we have the X-ray results. For now, let's get you down to radiology. The technician is expecting you. I'll be right here when you return. Do you have any difficulties walking, or would you like me to call someone to assist you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I can walk. I am a little slow, but I can manage. I do not need any help. Thank you, though. I will go now, then. I trust you, Doctor. And I hope it is nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mrs. Kilton. Take your time, and please don’t hesitate to ask the technician if you have any questions. I will be right here when you get back. We'll get to the bottom of this together.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor.
