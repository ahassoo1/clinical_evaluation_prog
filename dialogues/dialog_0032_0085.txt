DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s…fine. Though, honestly, I wouldn't be here if this hadn’t started bothering me. It’s this discoloration on my skin. It’s…well, it’s quite noticeable, and frankly, it's not a good look.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Not a good look” is certainly a valid concern, Ms. Bartock. However, we need to determine the cause of the discoloration before we discuss aesthetics. Could you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Oh, believe me, I have been observing it. It’s…patches, really. Sort of a brownish hue, but not like a tan. More…muddy. It’s mostly on my arms and a bit on my chest. And it feels normal, if that makes sense. Not itchy, not painful, just…there. It started, oh, maybe a month ago? It’s definitely gotten bigger. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, mind you. Same soaps, same lotions, same everything.
DOCTOR: A month ago, you say. And no changes in your soaps or lotions. That’s helpful. Is it localized to those areas, or has it appeared anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Just the arms and chest. Though, I did notice a tiny spot on my…inner elbow, just this morning. It’s very small, barely there, really. I almost didn’t see it. But yes, that's all. Honestly, I suspect it’s just stress. My husband, you see, has been…difficult lately. But I wouldn’t expect stress to change the color of my skin, would I?
DOCTOR: While stress can manifest in various ways, a change in skin pigmentation is less common, Ms. Bartock. It’s important to rule out other possibilities. Let’s perform a quick examination. If you don’t mind, please roll up your sleeves and loosen your neckline a bit so I can get a proper look.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Though I still think it’s probably nothing. People worry too much these days. There. Be careful, you'll wrinkle my silk. Honestly, the things one has to endure…
DOCTOR: Hmm. The patches are irregularly shaped, and the color is indeed uneven. They appear slightly raised, but the texture is otherwise normal. Your skin is quite dry, Ms. Bartock, despite your…concern about wrinkles. I’m going to document these findings. I'd also like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any skin conditions, like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not. I have always had lovely skin. A little dry, perhaps, in the winter, but nothing a good moisturizer couldn't handle. And no, I’ve never had any of those…those conditions you mentioned. Honestly, it sounds…common. I lead a very clean life. I eat well, I don’t smoke, and I certainly don’t associate with people who do. It's probably just a vitamin deficiency, isn’t it? Something simple like that.
DOCTOR: It could be a vitamin deficiency, though it’s less likely to present in this manner. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? I feel perfectly fine, thank you. No itching, no pain, no fever, no…strange rashes anywhere else. Just this…unsightly discoloration. Honestly, it’s quite embarrassing. My book club is next week and… well, one has to make a good impression, doesn't one? Are you sure it isn't just a lack of sunshine? I haven't been on vacation this year.
DOCTOR: While a lack of sun exposure can contribute to changes in skin tone, it wouldn’t typically present as these irregularly shaped patches. To be thorough, Ms. Bartock, let's review your family history. Have any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – experienced similar skin issues?
PATIENT: Oh, family history…well, my mother always had very fair skin, very sensitive to the sun. She always wore hats and gloves. And my grandmother…she had a mole, a very large one on her back. She had it removed, of course. Is that relevant? Honestly, it was decades ago. I barely remember. And no one else…not that I recall. My family is very…refined. We don’t usually have skin problems. It's just…this is so inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Bartock. Given the appearance of the patches, their progression over the past month, and the lack of a clear family history, I’d like to order a skin biopsy to determine the underlying cause. It's a simple procedure, and it will help us rule out several possibilities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Oh, good heavens. You mean…cutting into my skin? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds…dramatic. Is it absolutely necessary? Couldn’t we just try a stronger moisturizer? Or perhaps some sort of cream? I really don't like the sound of that, not one bit. I'm quite delicate, you see.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, while I appreciate your concerns, a proper diagnosis is crucial. A cream or moisturizer will only address the symptom – the discoloration – and will not reveal the cause. Without knowing the cause, we cannot effectively treat the condition, and we risk it worsening. The biopsy is a small procedure, performed under local anesthesia, and will provide us with the information we need to determine the best course of action. It's standard practice in cases like this. I strongly recommend we proceed with it. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. But I expect it to be quick and painless. And I absolutely do not want a visible scar. My husband would be… displeased. Explain it to me, then. But do try to be concise, Doctor. I have a luncheon reservation.
DOCTOR: Very well. The biopsy involves taking a small sample of skin from one of the affected areas. We will first clean and numb the area with a local anesthetic—a simple injection, similar to what you receive at the dentist. Then, using a small instrument, we will remove a tiny piece of skin—about the size of a pencil eraser. There will be minimal bleeding, which we will control immediately. We will then send the sample to a lab for analysis, and the results will typically be available within a week. A small bandage will be applied, and you will receive aftercare instructions to ensure proper healing. The risk of scarring is minimal, and we take every precaution to minimize any cosmetic impact. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: A week? A week without knowing? Honestly, that’s unacceptable. What if it’s…contagious? What if my book club avoids me? And you say minimal bleeding…will it stain my blouse? This is all very unsettling. Will you be the one performing the procedure? I trust you have extensive experience with…delicate skin? And please, be gentle. I’m not used to this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, the patches are not contagious. The bleeding will be minimal and easily contained with a bandage. I assure you, it will not stain your blouse. And yes, I will be performing the procedure. I have been practicing dermatology for seven years, and I am well-versed in handling sensitive skin. Now, if you are willing, we can proceed. We have a sterile room prepared, and the sooner we obtain the sample, the sooner we can determine the cause of this discoloration and address your concerns. Is it agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, seven years, you say? That’s…reassuring, I suppose. Very well. But if there’s any discomfort, I expect you to stop immediately. And please, be mindful of my silk blouse. It’s Italian, you see. Lead the way, Doctor. But do hurry. I have a very important hair appointment afterward.
DOCTOR: This way. And please, try to relax. The procedure will be quick and efficient. .
