DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding, good to see you. I’m Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's good to meet you too. Well, it's this itching, really. Everywhere, it seems. Been going on for a little while now, and it's... just annoying, to be honest. Not painful, exactly, but constantly bothersome.
DOCTOR: Annoying is… a good way to put it. Itching all over, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. Arms, legs, back… even my chest a little. It doesn’t seem to be getting worse, thankfully, but it’s not going away either. It’s just… there. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like a rash, you see. No bumps or anything. Just… the feeling. I keep scratching, and then I worry about making it worse!
DOCTOR: Right, no visible rash… just the itch itself. Hmm. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started, I’d say, maybe six weeks ago? Around the end of June, I think. It was just a little thing at first, I barely noticed it. Thought it was just dry skin or something. But then it just… stayed. And slowly got more noticeable, you know? I figured eventually I should come in and see about it.
DOCTOR: Six weeks… alright. And have you tried anything to help it so far?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few things. I used some lotion, you know, the regular kind. Didn’t really do much. Then I tried one of those anti-itch creams you can get at the drugstore. Helped for maybe ten minutes, and then it was back. I figured if drugstore stuff didn’t work, I should probably see a professional.
DOCTOR: Good idea. Alright, let's do a quick exam, just to rule things out. I'm going to take a look at your skin, and maybe listen to your breathing, just to be thorough. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get to the bottom of this itch! It’s driving me a little crazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take a look. I'm just feeling for anything unusual… skin feels generally normal, no visible lesions or anything like that. No swelling… Breathing sounds clear. Okay, good. Now, any new soaps, detergents, or anything like that recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, nothing new on the soap front. I’ve been using the same stuff for years. Laundry detergent, same deal. I haven’t changed anything like that. I did start taking a new vitamin supplement, a multivitamin, about a month ago… Could that be it? I didn’t really think about that.
DOCTOR: A new multivitamin… that's potentially something. Some vitamins can cause skin reactions. Now, are you taking any other medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Let's see… Just a little something for my blood pressure, a very low dose. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Been on that for a few years now, though. Never caused any problems before. Other than that… nothing. Just the multivitamin and the blood pressure medication.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril… been stable for years. Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I don’t love cats, but I wouldn’t say I’m allergic to them! Seriously though, no known allergies. Never had a bad reaction to anything, that I know of. My wife, God rest her soul, always did the remembering of things like that… I’m not always the best at keeping track of those details.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay. Now, one last question for now. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the itch?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. No fever, no fatigue, no weight loss. Nothing like that. My appetite is fine. I sleep okay. I suppose… maybe a little bit more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn’t a little tired these days? I can’t really say it’s anything related to the itching, though. Just… the normal aches and pains of getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Itching with no rash, no other systemic symptoms, no recent changes in soaps or detergents, a new multivitamin, stable Lisinopril… Could be a few things. It’s possible the multivitamin is the culprit, or it could be a mild skin irritation we haven't identified yet. To rule out anything more serious, I’d like to do a basic blood test, just to check your liver function and rule out any underlying causes. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A blood test sounds perfectly fine. Anything to get this figured out. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I'd really appreciate it if we could just get to the bottom of this annoying itch.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'll order the blood work now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll take care of you. Once we have those results back, we can discuss next steps. In the meantime, I'd recommend stopping the multivitamin for now, just to see if that makes a difference. And try to avoid scratching as much as possible, as that can worsen the irritation. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. I'll stop the multivitamin right away, and I'll try my best not to scratch. It's easier said than done, but I'll definitely work on it. Thank you for your help, I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll get the lab order sent over to them now. If you don't get the results within a week, give the office a call. We'll take it from there. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. That's everything for now. You've been very helpful. I'll head down to the lab and get that done. Thank you again for taking the time to see me, and for your help with this.
