DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's... hard to explain exactly. I just... can't seem to empty my bladder like I used to. It feels like there's always some left in there, even after I try. It's been going on for a little while now, maybe a few weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay. A few weeks, you say. And you feel like you're not fully emptying?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. That's right. Not fully. It's… uncomfortable, mostly. Not painful, but just… full. And I have to go often, you know? More than I used to, for sure. It wakes me up sometimes at night, too.
DOCTOR: Right. Frequent urination, feeling of incomplete emptying, and waking you up at night. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm... not that I can think of. No, things haven't really changed much around here. Same routine, same foods... maybe a little colder weather lately, but we always get cold weather. My wife… she passed last year. That was a big change, but that wasn't… this problem. It started after that, maybe, but I don't know if they're connected. Sorry, I'm probably not making much sense.
DOCTOR: It's…common for things to feel jumbled after a significant loss, Mr. Hilber. But let's focus on the physical symptoms. You mentioned it started after your wife's passing. And you’re experiencing frequent urination, and a sensation of not fully emptying. Any straining to urinate?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. Not every time, but I have to push a little. Like it takes a bit of effort to get it going and to get everything out. It's not a hard push, but... I used to just go, you know? Now it feels like I have to try.
DOCTOR: Okay. Straining. And any changes in the stream itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the… stream? What do you mean, Doctor? Is that… like, is it weaker? It feels normal when it’s going, but sometimes it starts and stops, kind of. Not a strong, steady flow all the time. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, I don’t know all the medical words.
DOCTOR: Intermittent stream, you’re describing. Alright. Before we proceed with a physical exam, let’s go through some general health questions. Do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, ma'am. Not that I know of. My wife, she had a little bit of trouble with her sugar sometimes, but I never did. I’ve always been pretty healthy, mostly. Just… getting old now, I guess.
DOCTOR: And what about any past surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, when I was fishing. But that was a long time ago, too. No major surgeries or hospital stays in… well, decades. Just the usual bumps and bruises. Nothing serious, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay. No recent surgeries or hospitalizations. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I can take most things without any trouble. I don’t take much medicine these days, though. Just a little something for my joints when they ache. But that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you taking for your joints?
PATIENT: Uh… let me see… I think it’s called… naproxen? Is that right? A little white pill. I get it from the pharmacy down the street. It helps a little, but not much. I take one sometimes when my knees bother me, or my back. Not every day, though. Just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen as needed. Now, let's talk about your family history. Any history of prostate problems, bladder issues, or kidney disease in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's a tough one. My father… he didn’t talk much about his health. I know my uncle, on my mother’s side, he had some trouble going to the bathroom when he got older. But I don’t know what it was exactly. Nothing serious that I remember. Mostly, we just kept to ourselves. We didn’t share much about… that stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it's helpful to know what you do recall. Now, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with listening to your abdomen, and I'll also need to perform a digital rectal exam. It’s necessary to assess your prostate. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Oh. A… a rectal exam? I… I've never had one of those before. Is it… is it going to hurt? I don’t mean to be difficult, Doctor, but that sounds… unpleasant. What will it tell you that listening to my tummy won’t?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hilber, I understand your discomfort, but this is a standard procedure to evaluate the size and condition of your prostate gland. It’s crucial in determining the cause of your urinary symptoms. I will ensure it is as quick and gentle as possible. It may be mildly uncomfortable, but I will explain everything as I go. If it is too painful, you can tell me to stop immediately. Listening to your abdomen will not provide the information I need. Are you willing to proceed, or would you prefer a referral to a urologist?
PATIENT: …Well. I don’t want to bother a… a urologist if I don't have to. And you said it might be quick. If you promise to be gentle, and explain what you’re doing… okay. Okay, I’ll try. But you have to tell me before you do anything. And I want to know what you find, afterwards. Promise?
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on your back, with your knees bent. I'll use a lubricant and a gloved, lubricated finger to gently examine your rectum. It will feel like… a brief pressure. I'll be palpating your prostate to assess its size, shape, and texture. I’ll let you know what I feel as I go. Take deep breaths, and try to relax.
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breaths… Just tell me if it’s something bad. Please. And… and hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to insert the finger now. This will feel like some pressure. Breathe deeply. Hmm… Okay. I’m finished. I did feel some enlargement of the prostate gland. It's not dramatically enlarged, but it is definitely palpable. It also feels… slightly firm. I’ll need to order a urine sample to check for infection, and a PSA test, which is a blood test that can help assess prostate health. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Urine sample and… a PSA test? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… is it cancer? You said it felt firm. That doesn’t sound good. I… I don't understand. What’s going to happen now?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hilber, please try to remain calm. An enlarged and slightly firm prostate does not automatically mean cancer. It could be benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is a common condition in men your age. It can cause the urinary symptoms you’ve been experiencing. The PSA test will help us determine if further investigation is needed. We'll need to rule out other possibilities. I'm ordering the tests now. The lab results usually take a few days. Once we have those, we’ll discuss the next steps. I’m not going to speculate until we have the results. Do you have any other questions, at this time?
PATIENT: …No. Not right now, I guess. Just… when will I hear back? And… is this going to be expensive? Medicare… it doesn’t cover everything, you know. My wife… she always took care of the paperwork. I’m not good at this stuff.
DOCTOR: The lab will bill Medicare directly. They can advise you of any potential out-of-pocket expenses. As for hearing back, the results should be available within 5-7 business days. My nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they have them. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids, and avoid caffeine and alcohol. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: …No. I think… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate you taking the time. I’ll try to drink more water. Thank you. .
