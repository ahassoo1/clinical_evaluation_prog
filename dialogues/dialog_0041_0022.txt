DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. Can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor...Pol-chin-ski? Yes, that's a nice name. Hmm... what brings me in? Well, my tummy... it feels big. Bigger than usual, I think. And I don't want to eat much. Not like I used to. It just… doesn’t feel right. It’s been going on… a little while now, maybe? I forget.
DOCTOR: Okay, "tummy feels big" and not feeling very hungry. "A little while now"... Alright. That’s helpful. Just to clarify, when you say "big," do you mean it feels swollen, or is it more like… uncomfortable fullness?
PATIENT: Swollen, I think. Yes, swollen. Like… when you blow up a balloon, almost. But… softer. And it feels different than when I just eat too much. You know? I used to eat big dinners with my husband… but this isn't like that. It's… inside. Deeper. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Soila. You’re explaining it very well. "Swollen, softer" and deeper discomfort than just a full stomach… Okay. And has this swelling been getting bigger gradually, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… gradually, I think. Yes, slowly. I didn’t wake up one morning and poof – big belly! It just… got bigger and bigger over… weeks? Maybe months. I really can’t remember exactly. Time… it goes so fast when you’re old. It’s silly, isn’t it? I used to be very good with dates… studying people and all. But now… everything is a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Soila. Memory can definitely become tricky as we get older. We'll take our time. So, gradually getting bigger over weeks or months… And besides the swelling and not wanting to eat, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… other changes… let me think. I feel… tired. More tired than usual, maybe? And a little bit… weak. Not strong like I used to be. I used to walk to the market every day! Now… now I mostly sit. And… oh! Sometimes my tummy feels… bubbly. Like little bubbles inside. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Okay, more tired, feeling weaker, and those bubbly sensations in your tummy… Yes, those things are definitely important for me to know. Have you had any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… what now? Oh! You mean… going to the bathroom? Well… not really. Everything is… normal, I guess. Or as normal as it gets when you're… my age! It's not that different. Just… less. I don't need to go as often. Is that bad? I always drank a lot of water… maybe that’s why?
DOCTOR: No, not at all bad, Soila. It's good you're thinking about these things. Less frequent bowel movements… okay. And have you noticed any pain anywhere, besides the discomfort in your tummy?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not really pain. It’s not sharp, like when I fell and broke my wrist years ago. It's more… a dull ache. Sometimes. Not all the time. Mostly… just uncomfortable. And… sometimes I feel a little bit… breathless. Like I can't get enough air. Does that make sense? I used to sing in the choir… but now I get tired too quickly. It’s all just… getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you're telling me everything, Soila. "Dull ache," sometimes breathless, and feeling tired quickly… I want to do a quick exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your tummy to see what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam? Yes, alright. That's… that's fine. Just… be gentle, please? My bones… they aren’t as strong as they used to be. And… what are you looking for, exactly? Just so I know… I like to understand things. When I was a sociologist… we always had to understand everything! It’s a habit, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll be very gentle, Soila. And you're right to ask! I'm listening to your heart and lungs to make sure everything is working properly. Then, I'll gently feel your tummy to see if I can feel any tenderness or anything unusual. I’m checking for anything that might explain the swelling and discomfort you've been feeling. It’s a routine check, and I'll explain everything I find. If you could just lie back for me, that would be great.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. It's been a long time since I’ve been on one of these things! Just… be careful with my tummy, please. It feels… fragile. I used to be so strong… carrying my little boy when he was small. Now… now I just sit. And worry. Do you think it’s something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Just breathe normally, Soila. Nice and easy. Your heart sounds a bit… quiet, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Your lungs sound clear, thankfully. Now, I'm going to gently feel your tummy. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Is there any particular spot that feels more tender than others?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. It's… a little tender all over, really. But… Ooh! There. That’s a little bit more sore. Not painful, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. And… There too, a little bit. It’s hard to say… everything feels a bit… jumbled up inside. I used to have such a strong stomach… I could eat anything! Now… everything feels fragile.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the lower and right sides of your tummy… That’s helpful information, Soila. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it could be a few things. It could be something simple like constipation or a bit of trapped gas, but given your age and the gradual onset of symptoms, we need to rule out anything more serious. I’d like to order a blood test and a scan of your abdomen, if that’s alright with you. The blood test will help us check your overall health and look for any signs of infection. The scan will give us a better look at your tummy and see what’s going on inside. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a blood test and a scan? That sounds… complicated. Will it hurt? And… what if something is wrong? I don’t want to be a bother… I’m just an old woman. I haven’t had a scan… oh, it must be fifty years! When my boy was little… but that was different. What are you looking for, exactly? Just so I know… I like to understand things. Is it… is it something bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's okay, Soila. It’s perfectly normal to feel worried. The blood test is a very simple procedure—just a small sample of blood taken from your arm. It shouldn’t hurt much more than a little pinch. And the scan is painless—you just lie still while the machine takes pictures of your tummy. We're looking for anything that might be causing your discomfort—like a blockage, inflammation, or something else. It doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong, but it's important to check. It’s better to be safe and find out what's going on. We need to rule out things like a potential bowel obstruction or something affecting your liver or gallbladder, just to be thorough. I understand you're worried about being a bother, but that's my job—to take care of you and make sure you're healthy. I will explain everything to you every step of the way. And if it turns out to be something serious, we will discuss all of your options and make a plan together. Would you be comfortable with me ordering these tests, Soila?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s best… then alright. I just… I don’t want to cause any trouble. I’ve always been a bit of a worrier. My husband used to say… oh, never mind. Pinch… and pictures. Alright. As long as you explain everything. And… and you promise you won’t just leave me to worry? I like to know what’s going on… even if it’s bad news. What happens next, Doctor? Will I have to come back again? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Soila. I promise I won’t leave you to worry. I will explain everything to you every step of the way, and we will discuss the results together. First, the nurse will take a small blood sample. It will take just a few minutes. Then, we will schedule you for an abdominal scan. It will likely be at the imaging center down the street—it’s a very modern facility. The scan itself should take about 30-45 minutes. The results usually take a few days to come back—I’d estimate about 3-5 business days. Once I have them, I’ll call you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms—like severe pain, vomiting, or fever—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now, Soila?
PATIENT: Oh… 3-5 days. That seems like a long time. But alright. And the imaging center… is it far? My legs… they aren’t what they used to be. Severe pain… and vomiting. Oh dear. I hope it doesn’t come to that. Alright. I think… I think that’s all for now. Just… please don’t forget about me. And… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I used to be so strong… but now… now I just worry. I think I just want to go home and sit down.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Soila. And I absolutely won’t forget about you. I will personally follow up with you once the results are in. The imaging center is just a few blocks away—about a 10-minute drive. We can arrange for a taxi or have someone from our office drive you if that would be easier. Let me have the nurse come in and draw your blood, and then we can discuss transportation options. I want you to feel as comfortable as possible. Just try to relax and take it easy until we hear back. And if anything changes, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We are here for you. Now, let’s get you home so you can rest. Is there anyone who can help you get settled in once you return?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A taxi… that would be nice. I don’t want to bother anyone. My son… he lives far away. He’s very busy. I mostly manage on my own. Just… please don't forget to call me. I worry easily, you know. And… thank you again, Doctor. You've been very kind. I think… I think that's all for now. Let's get the blood test done, and then… then I can go home and sit down. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I will personally call you as soon as the results are in – I promise. We'll get the nurse in right away to take your blood, and then we'll arrange for a taxi to take you home. “Nurse, could you please come in and draw some blood for Soila?
