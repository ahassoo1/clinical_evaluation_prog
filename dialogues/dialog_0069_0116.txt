DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. My name is Dr. Andraca. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Oh dear, what does bring me in… Let me see. It’s my legs, mostly. They ache something awful at night. Just… ache and tighten up. It’s been going on for a little while now, I think. I can’t quite recall how long.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Leg aches, especially at night, can be quite bothersome. It's not uncommon, but we want to figure out what's causing it. You mentioned it’s been going on for a little while – can you try to give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, my. A rough estimate… That’s difficult. Well, I suppose since the warmer weather started? Maybe a couple of months? Before that, I don't rightly remember being bothered by it. It could be longer… I do have a habit of forgetting things these days, you see. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Bilstein. It's common for memory to change as we get older. A couple of months is a good starting point. And you've noticed it’s worse at night?
PATIENT: Yes, at night. It wakes me up sometimes. It’s a tightening, like… like a band around my calf, I suppose. Not always the same leg, but mostly my left one. It feels better if I… if I stretch it, I think. Or maybe just move around a bit. It doesn't last terribly long, thankfully, but it's enough to disturb my sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tightening sensation, like a band around your calf, primarily in your left leg, that’s relieved somewhat by stretching or movement and occurs at night. That gives us some good information. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the aches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me see… No, I don’t think so. Not that I recall. Sometimes my feet feel a bit… cold, perhaps? But that’s just generally, you know? Not necessarily when the cramping happens. And I don’t believe there's any swelling or redness. Just the ache, mostly. And the waking up.
DOCTOR: Alright, no swelling, redness, or other associated symptoms besides the nighttime ache and occasional cold feet. And it’s primarily in your left leg, though it can happen in both?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly my left. But it’s happened in the right one a time or two. Not as often, though. And it's not always the left one. It just... comes and goes. Is this something serious, Doctor? I do worry about these things.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re bringing this to my attention, Ms. Bilstein, and it's perfectly normal to be worried. Based on what you've described, it could be a few things, ranging from simple muscle cramps to something that needs a little more investigation. To get a better idea, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see… Well, I had a bit of trouble with my heart a long time ago, but that was… many years back. The doctor said it was under control with… with pills, I believe. I don't take any now, though. And my arthritis, of course. It's in my hands mostly, and it gets a bit stiff sometimes. Other than that… No, I don’t think so. Nothing that I’m aware of. It’s been a long time since I had any major health problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of heart trouble managed with medication in the past, and arthritis in your hands. Do you remember what medication you were taking for your heart?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was so long ago… I really don't recall the name. A little white pill, I think. The doctor just told me to take it every day. I was seeing Dr. Reynolds back then, but he… he retired years ago. I don’t have any records from that time, I’m afraid. It was just… something he prescribed. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. My memory just isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Bilstein, don’t worry about it. We can work with what we have. And it’s understandable that you don’t recall the specific medication name. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, let me see… I had my gallbladder taken out, many years ago. And… and I had a hysterectomy, a long time back. That’s all I can recall, I think. Nothing else. They were both… quite a while ago. And I healed up just fine from both of them.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a hysterectomy, both in the past. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never really had any bad reactions to anything. I can eat most foods, thankfully. And I’ve never had any trouble with pollen or dust or anything like that. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t take any pills regularly. Just… a little something for my arthritis when it flares up, and that’s just ibuprofen, I suppose. But not very often. Mostly I just try to rest it when it bothers me. No, I don't take anything regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ibuprofen for arthritis. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there a history of heart problems, blood clots, or diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… That’s a difficult one. My mother had a bit of trouble with her heart when she got older, I believe. And my brother, he had… something with his legs, when he was a young man. The doctor said it was something with the blood, but I don’t recall exactly what. As for diabetes… I don't think so. Not that I recall anyone having it, but it was a long time ago, and family records weren't really kept. I wish I could be more precise, but my memory… it just isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Bilstein, you've given me a lot of useful information. And it's understandable that you don’t remember all the details. Finally, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never have, never will. My husband… he smoked a bit, when he was younger, but I always made sure he did it outside. I always thought it was a dreadful habit. No, I’ve never smoked. And I don’t drink much alcohol either. Just a little wine with dinner sometimes, if I’m feeling fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, you don't smoke and drink only a little wine occasionally. Alright, Ms. Bilstein, I'm looking at your record here. It confirms what you’ve told me – no recent significant medical changes. Now, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I suppose I should just sit up then? Whatever you need me to do, just let me know. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Bilstein. Yes, a quick exam will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Okay, I’m going to feel for the pulses in your legs. Your pulses are a little weak, but present in both legs. That’s not necessarily cause for alarm, but it’s something we’ll keep an eye on. No swelling or redness visible. Skin looks normal. A little tenderness in your left calf when I press here. Does that bother you?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, that’s… a bit tender, actually. That’s where I feel the cramping most often. It doesn’t hurt all the time, just when you press on it. It’s a dull ache, really. Is that bad, Doctor? I do hope it isn't something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, your range of motion seems good in both ankles and feet. No pain with movement. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Alright, Ms. Bilstein, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found in the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing peripheral artery disease, or PAD. It’s a common condition where the arteries that supply blood to your legs become narrowed or blocked, often due to plaque buildup. The tenderness in your left calf and the weaker pulses support that possibility. However, it could also be something else, like muscle cramping or nerve issues. Do you have any history of walking pain?
PATIENT: Walking pain… Oh dear. That's a good question. I do find myself getting a bit tired when I walk long distances, but I always just assumed that was my age. I don't know that I'd call it pain, exactly. More of a… heaviness in my legs, and then I need to sit down. I haven’t been walking as much lately, either. I suppose it’s been a little while since I went for a proper stroll.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some fatigue with walking, but not necessarily pain. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. First, an ankle-brachial index, or ABI. It’s a simple, non-invasive test that compares the blood pressure in your ankles to the blood pressure in your arms. It can help us see how well blood is flowing in your legs. I also recommend a basic blood panel to check your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and kidney function. This will help rule out other potential causes. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh my. Tests… Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I suppose I can’t argue with that. I do hope they won’t be too uncomfortable. As long as it helps us figure out what’s going on, I’m willing to do whatever you recommend. An ABI and a blood panel… Yes, that sounds alright. Do I need to make a separate appointment for those?
DOCTOR: No, no separate appointment needed. We can do the ABI right here in the office today, it only takes a few minutes. I’ll give you a lab order for the blood panel, and you can go to the lab at your convenience. They don't require an appointment, and it's usually a quick visit. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend gentle exercise, like walking for short distances, when you're able. Avoid prolonged sitting and try to keep your legs elevated when you're resting. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Gentle exercise and elevating my legs… Yes, I can do that. Oh, actually, yes I do have a question. If it is this PAD, what does that mean? Is it serious? Will I have to… have surgery? I do hope it won’t come to that.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Bilstein, and it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned. PAD can range in severity. In mild cases, it can be managed with lifestyle changes – like the exercise and leg elevation we discussed – and medication to improve blood flow and lower cholesterol. Surgery is not always necessary. It's typically reserved for more severe cases where blood flow is significantly blocked and causing pain at rest or ulcers on your legs. We’ll know more once we have the results of the tests. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests done. We can discuss all of your treatment options in detail once we have a clearer understanding of your condition. I’ll print out the lab order now. Do you have any trouble getting to the lab?
PATIENT: Oh, good. That’s… reassuring to hear. Lifestyle changes and medication… I can certainly manage that. No, I don't have any trouble getting to the lab. My daughter lives nearby, and she usually gives me a ride when I need it. She’s a good girl. No, I don’t think I’ll need any help with transportation. Thank you for asking, though. I suppose I should just get this lab order and then go when I have a chance?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here's the lab order. It has the address and phone number of the lab. They're open Monday through Friday, 8 am to 5 pm. I’ll have my nurse give you a printed sheet with instructions on how to prepare for the ABI test as well. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor, and I appreciate your patience with my… forgetfulness. I suppose I’ll just go get these tests done and then we’ll see what happens. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns while you're waiting for the results. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and take care. We’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. Goodbye.
