DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. It’s… well, it’s a bit silly, really. I just thought… a little encouragement from a doctor would be nice. You know, a card. A “Get Well” card. I’m perfectly fine, don’t misunderstand. But my daughter, she says I worry too much. And a card from you… well, it would show her I’m being sensible. Does that make any sense? I just thought… a professional opinion on my worrying, written down, would be… helpful.
DOCTOR: That's… certainly a unique request, Janeth. And it’s perfectly alright to come in to discuss concerns that are affecting your well-being, even if they aren't a typical medical complaint. I understand your daughter is concerned about your worrying, and you're hoping a bit of professional reassurance might help. Let's approach this systematically. While I can certainly document a note stating our conversation and my assessment, to give you the most helpful reassurance – and to be thorough – could you tell me a little bit more about what you worry about?
PATIENT: Well, everything, really. Though, lately it’s been the pipes. The pipes in the house. They’re old, you see. Very old. And they make noises. Creaking noises. And I just know they’re going to burst. Flood the whole kitchen! Ruin everything. My husband says I’m being ridiculous, but he doesn’t hear them like I do. And then there’s the neighbourhood… so many strange people walking about these days. Not like it used to be. Honestly, it’s a constant worry. A constant, nagging thing. It’s not like I’m ill, you understand. Just… anxious. Very anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pipes and some concerns about changes in the neighbourhood are currently the primary sources of your anxiety. And you feel your husband doesn't fully understand the extent of your worry. You mentioned this has been a "constant, nagging thing" - has this anxiety been a long-term issue, or is it more recent?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Always been a worrier, I suppose. My mother was the same. Always anticipating the worst. Though, it’s gotten… sharper lately. Since the new family moved in down the street. They’re… different. Keep themselves to themselves, mostly. Don't wave hello. Don’t keep their garden tidy. It’s just… unsettling. And the pipes, of course. They’re always louder when they’re home. I don't know… it feels connected. Everything feels connected.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of worrying, and a recent increase in anxiety coinciding with the arrival of new neighbours. You feel a connection between the new neighbours and the increased pipe noises. That’s helpful to know. To get a better understanding of how this is affecting you, could you describe what you experience when you’re feeling particularly anxious?
PATIENT: Well… my stomach gets upset. Very upset. And I can't sleep. Just lie there, listening. Listening for the pipes, listening for… well, anything. My heart races, too. And I get… irritable. Snappy with my husband. He doesn’t understand. He just says I need to “relax”. As if it’s that simple! It’s exhausting, honestly. Just… completely exhausting. And I find myself checking things. Constantly checking. The taps, the windows, the doors. Making sure everything’s locked, everything’s secure. It’s… it’s a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we’re seeing physical symptoms like stomach upset and difficulty sleeping, along with behaviours like checking, and irritability. It sounds very distressing, and I can certainly understand why you’re feeling exhausted. To help me rule out any underlying medical issues that could be contributing to these symptoms – even though it sounds primarily anxiety-related – could you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: Oh, perfectly fine, generally. I eat alright, though not much of an appetite lately. No major illnesses. A little arthritis in my hands, but nothing serious. I used to walk a lot, but… well, I haven’t been out much lately. Too worried to leave the house, to be honest. Husband takes me to the shops, but that’s about it. Blood pressure’s usually alright. I had it checked at the chemist’s last year. Didn’t say anything unusual. I don’t smoke, and I only have a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. A very small glass.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally good health, with a bit of arthritis and some reduced activity levels due to your anxiety. No other major medical concerns. Have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety or depression before, or have you ever received any treatment for your worries?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. In my day, you just… dealt with it. Didn’t go running to the doctor for every little thing. Mother was the same. She just kept busy. Knitting, gardening, keeping the house spotless. That’s what you did. Though… I did read a book once, a friend lent me. About calming your mind. Didn’t really help. Too many fancy words, if you ask me. It didn’t understand real worrying, you see? It was all… theoretical.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve always managed your worries independently, and that traditional approaches haven't felt helpful. It's good that you've tried to find solutions on your own. Now, in terms of a professional opinion to share with your daughter… I’m happy to document our conversation and my assessment, stating that you are experiencing significant anxiety related to concerns about your home and neighbourhood. I can also write a brief note outlining how this anxiety is impacting your sleep, appetite, and daily activities. However, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like your anxiety is causing you distress and impacting your quality of life. While I can write a note for your daughter, I would also like to discuss some options that might help you manage your anxiety more effectively. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Options? Like… what kind of options? I don’t really want to take pills. Mother never took pills. And I don’t want to talk to a… a shrinker. That sounds dreadful. I just want a card, really. A nice card saying I’m sensible to worry. That’s all. But… if you're going to write a note anyway… maybe you could mention the pipes? And the unsettling feeling about the neighbours? Perhaps that will convince my daughter I'm not just being silly.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your reluctance to consider medication or therapy, and I respect your preferences. We absolutely don't have to discuss those options if you're not comfortable. And of course, I can write a note focusing on the specific concerns about the pipes and the unsettling feeling about the neighbours. In addition to those points, I can document that you're experiencing increased anxiety, which is impacting your sleep and appetite, and that you're seeking reassurance regarding your concerns. Before I write the note, I want to quickly clarify something: when you say "unsettling feeling," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. They just… don’t engage. You say hello, they look right through you. They never smile. And they’re always… watching. Not at you, exactly. Just… observing. And their garden… it’s overgrown. Very overgrown. It feels… neglected. Like they don’t care about anything. And the curtains are always drawn. It just feels… off. Not threatening, exactly. Just… peculiar. It makes me nervous. And it’s making the pipe noises seem worse, if you can believe that. It all feels connected, you see? Like they’re… waiting for something.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like their lack of engagement, the neglected garden, and the drawn curtains are contributing to a feeling of unease and anxiety. It's perfectly reasonable to feel nervous in that situation. Okay. So, to summarize, I will document that you're experiencing increased anxiety related to concerns about the pipes in your home and your unsettling feelings about the new neighbours, specifically their lack of engagement, the neglected garden, and the drawn curtains. I'll also note that this anxiety is impacting your sleep and appetite. I can write a note stating that you’re seeking reassurance and support regarding these concerns. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that sounds perfect. Just… make it sound official, you know? Make it sound like I’m not just being… frivolous. That my worries are valid. And mention the pipes! Don’t forget the pipes. They really are worrying. And… thank you. It's nice to finally be taken seriously.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely welcome, Janeth. Of course, your worries are valid, and I’m happy to document them thoroughly and professionally. Okay, I'm writing a note detailing your concerns about the pipes, your observations regarding the new neighbours – including their lack of engagement, the neglected garden, and drawn curtains – and the resulting anxiety impacting your sleep and appetite. I'm also stating that you're seeking reassurance and support regarding these concerns. I’ll print this out for you to share with your daughter. Here you are. Please read it over and let me know if I've missed anything. I hope this provides the reassurance you're looking for. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… that’s perfect. Really. It sounds very… official. She’ll definitely take notice now. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. No, I think that’s all. Just… thank you.
