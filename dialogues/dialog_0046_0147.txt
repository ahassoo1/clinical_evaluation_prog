DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I’ve noticed a lump, a mass, in my lower abdomen and… honestly, it’s a bit worrying me. It’s been there for a few weeks now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A new lump is certainly something we want to investigate. “A few weeks now,” you said. Can you tell me more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it was probably around the beginning of July, maybe the second week. I was just… getting ready in the morning, and I felt it then. It wasn’t very noticeable at first, just a slight firmness. But it's definitely grown since then, even if it's not a huge amount.
DOCTOR: Alright, beginning of July. And you've noticed gradual growth since then. Can you describe the lump to me?
PATIENT: Yes, gradual. It’s… well, it feels fairly firm, not squishy. About the size of a plum, I’d say. Maybe a little smaller. It doesn’t really move around when I touch it, it feels… fixed in place. And it doesn’t seem to be particularly painful, just… present.
DOCTOR: Okay, a firm, fixed lump about the size of a plum, not particularly painful. Thank you for that detailed description. Has anything made it feel larger or smaller?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. No, not that I’ve noticed. It doesn’t seem to change with… anything. Eating, exercising, sitting, lying down… it feels the same all the time. That's what's a little unsettling, I suppose – the consistency.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the consistency. Let's talk about any other symptoms you've been experiencing. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, like constipation or diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no changes there. Everything’s been… regular, if you know what I mean. No pain when I go to the bathroom either. No blood, no nothing. I haven’t noticed any weight loss, or feeling more tired than usual either. Just… the lump.
DOCTOR: Good. No changes in bowel habits, weight, or energy levels. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I haven't felt unwell in any other way, really. No fever, no chills, no sweating at night. It’s… just this one thing. It's almost frustrating because I feel perfectly fine otherwise.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no systemic symptoms like fever, chills, or night sweats. That’s reassuring. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. Nothing major. I’ve had the standard vaccinations, kept up to date with those. No serious injuries, no surgeries. My family… my mother has high blood pressure, but that’s about it. Otherwise, we’re a fairly healthy bunch, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, typical childhood illnesses, up to date on vaccinations, no major medical history or surgeries. Mother with high blood pressure. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I don't take any prescription medications. Just a multivitamin occasionally, but that's it. Nothing regular, nothing for any specific condition. I try to eat a fairly balanced diet, get enough sleep… the usual healthy things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. No food allergies, no medication allergies, no seasonal allergies even. I’m pretty lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if that’s alright with you. This will involve me palpating your abdomen to get a better feel for the lump and checking for any other abnormalities. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Amy. I appreciate your trust. I’m going to start by gently pressing on your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels painful or uncomfortable. Okay, I’m feeling a firm mass in your lower abdomen, approximately the size of a plum, as you described. It's not particularly tender to the touch, which is good. It does feel fixed in place, meaning it doesn’t move easily under my hand. I’m also listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and it sounds normal. I don’t feel any other masses or abnormalities. Based on my initial examination, the mass is concerning enough that we need to investigate further to determine its nature. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. The blood work will help rule out any infection or inflammation, and the CT scan will give us a much clearer picture of the mass and its surrounding structures. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I appreciate you being thorough, Doctor. Blood work and a CT scan… I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best to find out what this is, I’m happy to do. I just want to know what’s going on. Will the CT scan involve any… radiation? I’ve heard things about that.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it’s wise to ask. Yes, a CT scan does use a small amount of radiation, but it’s within acceptable safety limits. We always weigh the benefits of the scan against the potential risks, and in your case, the benefits of getting a clear diagnosis far outweigh the small risk from the radiation exposure. The radiologist will be using the lowest dose of radiation necessary to obtain the images. We'll also take precautions to minimize your exposure. Do you have any history of allergies to contrast dye, which is sometimes used in CT scans?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to contrast dye that I know of. I’ve never had a scan before, so I haven’t been exposed to it. I… appreciate you explaining the radiation thing so clearly, Doctor. It does put my mind at ease a bit. So, blood work and a CT scan then. How long will it take to get the results back? And… will I need to do anything to prepare for the scan? Fasting, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could clarify that for you. For the CT scan, you will need to fast for four to six hours beforehand to ensure a clear image. You can drink water, but no food or anything else other than water. I’ll give you a written order for the blood work and the CT scan with specific instructions. The results usually take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once I have them, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, fever, or bleeding, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, that’s all very clear. Fast for four to six hours, drink water, and come back in 24 to 48 hours. And emergency room if anything changes. I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor Glowka. I really appreciate your patience and thoroughness. I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. I’m glad I could ease your mind. I understand it’s unsettling to find a new lump, and we’re going to get to the bottom of this. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly with the orders for the blood work and CT scan, along with the written instructions. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any further questions or concerns. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We'll have a better understanding of what's going on soon. Have a good day, and I'll be in touch.
