DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor…Stilaire, was it? Yes, a pleasure. Though, to be honest, I don't remember making an appointment. My wife, bless her heart, probably set it up. Something about… needing to go more often. To the bathroom, that is. It's just… frequent, you know? Very frequent. Not a big deal, really. Happens when you get old.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Segretto, I understand. It's common for things to change as we age. However, even changes that seem minor can sometimes indicate something we should investigate. And it’s good your wife is proactive about your health. So, if I understand correctly, the main reason for your visit today is increased urinary frequency?
PATIENT: Increased… urinary frequency? Is that what you call it? Sounds awfully fancy. Yes, that's it. I just… go more often. Especially at night. Wakes me up, you know? Used to sleep like a log. Now it's just… up, down, up, down. It's a nuisance, mostly. And it's not like it's painful, you understand. Just… there. Constantly.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Segretto. "Increased urinary frequency" is the medical term, but you've described it very clearly. And it is disruptive to your sleep, which is important. It’s good you’ve brought this to my attention. Could you tell me, approximately how many times do you find yourself getting up to urinate during the night?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers… I’m not good with numbers. Let me think… It feels like… a lot. More than I used to, obviously. Maybe… two, three times? Sometimes four? Honestly, it all blurs together. My wife would know. She keeps track of everything. I just know it's enough to make me tired in the mornings. Not like it matters much anymore, anyway. I don't do a lot of heavy lifting these days.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Segretto. Even an approximation gives me a starting point. And it's good to know you're not experiencing any pain or discomfort with urination. Now, aside from the increased frequency, have you noticed any other changes in your urinary habits?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. Well, now that you mention it… sometimes it feels like I don’t completely empty the bladder. Like there’s still a little left in there. Not much, but enough to notice. And sometimes… the stream isn’t as strong as it used to be. It’s just… slower, you know? Like trying to water the garden with a leaky hose. Does that make sense? I don’t pay much attention to these things, usually. My wife is the one who notices everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Segretto, that makes perfect sense. Thank you for sharing those details. It's good you’re bringing these things to my attention. These symptoms, along with the increased frequency, could indicate a few different possibilities. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history…? Goodness. Where do I even begin? I’ve lived a long life, you know? I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. Had my appendix out when I was young. Years ago. And I had a bit of trouble with my prostate a while back, but they gave me some pills, and it seemed to clear up. I don't remember the name of the pills. My wife handles all the medication. I just take what she gives me. And I've got a touch of arthritis, mostly in my knees. Nothing they can really do about it. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. Though, getting old isn’t for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. That’s very helpful. The history of prostate issues is particularly relevant, given your current symptoms. Do you recall when you were treated for the prostate problem?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, when was it? That was… a long time ago. Maybe… twenty years ago? Or maybe more? I really couldn't say for sure. It was before we moved to this farm, definitely. Before my wife started growing roses. She's a wonderful gardener, you know. Anyway, I went to a doctor, he gave me pills, and it seemed to fix the problem. I don't recall having any issues with it since then, until recently. Honestly, I've got a terrible memory. My wife is always telling me I forget things. Which is probably true.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. It’s alright about the difficulty remembering. We can work with what we have. And I appreciate your wife helping to keep track of things. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the pills you mentioned for your prostate?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I take something for my arthritis, a little white pill. And a red one for my blood pressure, I think. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take ibuprofen. But that's only when I need to. And… oh, yes! My wife gives me a vitamin every morning. Something about keeping my bones strong. She's very health-conscious. Honestly, I just take what she gives me. I don’t keep track of it all. She has a list, I’m sure. A very long list, probably. She’s very organized, my wife.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. It sounds like you have several medications, and it’s good your wife is assisting with your health management. We will definitely obtain a complete list from her. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, such as food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I recall. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle when the pollen is bad in the spring, but that's just a seasonal thing. Nothing serious. My wife always makes sure I don’t eat anything I'm allergic to. She reads all the labels carefully. She's very cautious. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to these things. I just eat what she gives me. She's a wonderful cook, my wife. Though, sometimes her roses smell a bit too strong. That's my only complaint.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. That's good to know. And it sounds like your wife is very attentive to your health needs. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmmm. That's a tough one. My father lived to be a good age, I think. Maybe in his eighties. He was a farmer, like me. My mother passed away when I was young. I don't remember much about her health. My brother… he had some trouble with his heart, I think. But that was a long time ago. Honestly, I don't know much about my family's medical history. We didn't talk about these things much when I was growing up. It wasn't considered important. My wife might know more. She's very interested in genealogy. She's always researching our family tree. She’s a remarkable woman, my wife. She knows everything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. That's helpful. We may be able to gather more information from your wife regarding your family's medical history. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father always said it was a waste of money. Drink alcohol? I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, years ago. But I haven’t had a drink in… well, a long time. Maybe twenty years? My wife doesn’t approve. And recreational drugs? Goodness, no! I’m a farmer, not a… well, not that. I just work on my farm and tend to my garden. My wife and I live a quiet life. Very quiet. And very healthy, thanks to her. She’s always making sure I eat right and get enough exercise. She's a wonderful woman, my wife. She’s everything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. That’s very helpful information. Now, finally, could you tell me a little about your social life?
PATIENT: Social life? Oh. Well, that's… limited. We don’t go out much anymore. My wife and I mostly keep to ourselves on the farm. We have a few friends from church, but we don't see them often. Mostly, we just enjoy each other’s company. We watch television sometimes, and we like to listen to music. And I spend a lot of time in the garden. It's very peaceful. My wife, she has her rose society meetings. She's very active in that. Honestly, we're pretty content just being at home. It's a quiet life, but it's a good life. My wife makes it good. She's a remarkable woman, really. Everything revolves around her, you know? She takes care of everything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. That gives me a good understanding of your lifestyle. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam to get a better assessment of your condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam…? Well, alright, I suppose. If you think it’s necessary. But don't expect much. I’m not in the best of shape, you know. I haven't been as active since my knees started bothering me. My wife will be upset if I overdo it. She worries about me. She’s very protective. Just… be gentle, alright? And don’t keep me up too late. I need my sleep. And… oh, yes! Make sure to wash your hands first. My wife is very particular about hygiene. She’s a remarkable woman, really. Everything has to be just so.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I will be as gentle as possible, and we’ll take things at your pace. And of course, I always wash my hands thoroughly before and after examining each patient. First, I’d like to check your vital signs - your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Your blood pressure is 142/88. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Your temperature is 98.6, and your respiratory rate is 16. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Finally, I’ll perform a quick neurological exam. Neurological exam is grossly intact. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Overall, your physical exam is largely unremarkable. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Do you have any questions about the exam?
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure, you say…? Oh, goodness. My wife has been telling me I need to watch my salt intake. She’s always right, you know? Always. I suppose I’ve been enjoying a bit more pickled herring lately. It reminds me of my childhood. But she’ll be upset about that. No, I don’t suppose I have any questions. You said “largely unremarkable”? That’s good, isn’t it? It means I’m not falling apart just yet. But my wife will want to know everything, of course. She’ll want to know all the details. She’s a remarkable woman, really. Always looking out for me. What happens now? Are you going to give me some pills? I hope they don’t have any side effects. My wife is very particular about medications. She reads all the labels carefully.
DOCTOR: Yes, “largely unremarkable” is a good sign, Mr. Segretto. It means there are no obvious immediate concerns. And yes, we'll discuss options for managing your slightly elevated blood pressure. We don't necessarily need to start you on medication right away. Often, lifestyle modifications can make a significant difference. Reducing salt intake, as your wife has mentioned, is a great first step. We can also discuss increasing your physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and managing stress. Before we decide on a plan, I'd like to order a few simple laboratory tests, including a basic metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. These tests will help us get a more complete picture of your overall health and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Laboratory tests…? Oh, goodness. More tests. My wife will be happy I’m finally taking this seriously. She’s always telling me I need to get checked out. She’s very proactive about my health, you know? Always making appointments and reminding me to take my pills. Urinalysis… that’s the one where they check my urine, isn’t it? Yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. But please tell the lab technician to be gentle. I don't like having to… well, you know. And make sure they wash their hands first. My wife is very particular about hygiene. She’s a remarkable woman, really. Everything has to be just so. Will these tests take long? I don’t want to be away from the farm for too long. My wife needs my help with the roses. She’s very busy these days, preparing for the rose society show. She’s a remarkable woman, really. I should probably get back and help her.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Segretto, I understand your concerns. The urinalysis is a simple test, and the technician will be very careful. And yes, I’ll make sure they wash their hands thoroughly. The laboratory tests shouldn't take long – perhaps 30 minutes to an hour. We can schedule them for first thing tomorrow morning so you can return to the farm as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a handout with information about lifestyle modifications for managing high blood pressure. It includes tips on diet, exercise, and stress management. And I’ll write you a prescription for a blood pressure monitor so you can check your blood pressure at home. Once we have the results of the laboratory tests, we can discuss a more specific plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A blood pressure monitor… that’s a good idea. My wife will be happy I’m taking this seriously. She’s always telling me I need to keep a closer eye on my health. She’s very proactive, you know? Always making appointments and reminding me to take my pills. Yes, alright. That sounds… good. Handouts and monitors… it's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. You seem to know what you're doing. Will this cost a lot of money? My wife manages all the finances. She’s very careful with our money. She’s a remarkable woman, really. Always thinking ahead. She’s a remarkable woman.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Segretto. We'll do our best to keep the costs as low as possible. Medicare typically covers the blood pressure monitor if you meet certain criteria, and we can help you with the paperwork. As for the laboratory tests, your insurance should cover a significant portion of the cost. We have a billing specialist who can answer any specific questions you or your wife may have. Before you leave, do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: No, I… I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything, Doctor. Mostly, I’m just relieved to finally have a plan. My wife will be happy. She’s been worried about me. She’s very intuitive, you know? Always knows when something is wrong. Thank you, Doctor Stilaire. You’ve been very kind and patient. And thank you for understanding my… forgetfulness. It’s just… getting old isn’t easy. But I’m lucky to have my wife. She takes care of everything. She’s a remarkable woman, really. Everything revolves around her. I suppose I should go help her with the roses. She's probably wondering where I am. She’s a remarkable woman.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Mr. Segretto. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. I’m glad we could come up with a plan together. And please give your wife my regards. It sounds like she is a wonderful woman, and I commend her for her dedication to your health. Have a good day, Mr. Segretto. And enjoy your time with your wife and the roses.
