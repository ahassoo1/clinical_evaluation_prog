DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doc, no offense, but I don’t have all day. Just… tired. Really tired. And I been… eating dirt. Not like on purpose, but I crave it. Clay, mostly. Is that what you need to know? Just get on with it, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy, I understand you're feeling very tired and have been experiencing cravings for clay. It's alright, we'll get to the bottom of this. No offense taken at all. Just to clarify, when you say "tired," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean? I’m… sleepy. All the time. Like, even after I sleep. And weak. Everything feels… heavy. Like walking through mud. It's just… exhausting. Is that good enough? Honestly, I don't remember when it started, probably a while ago. It just keeps getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, sleepy even after sleeping, and a general weakness and heaviness. That gives me a better idea. And you said it’s been gradually worsening… roughly how long would you estimate this has been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't ask me dates! I told you, I don’t remember. Months, I guess? Maybe longer. It’s hard to say. Things just… blur together. It started small, just a little bit of clay here and there. Now… well, now I find myself looking for it. It's stupid, I know. I just… feel better when I eat it. Don't judge me.
DOCTOR: I’m not judging you at all, Hedy. It's important to be honest about everything you’re experiencing, and you’re doing that. And it's actually quite helpful to understand why you feel better after eating the clay, even if it seems unusual. This craving for clay is something we should definitely investigate. It's a condition called pica, and it can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency. Before we go further, let me ask a few more questions about your overall health. Do you have any other unusual cravings besides clay?
PATIENT: Unusual cravings? Look, I barely have the energy to eat regular food, let alone think about cravings. No. Just the dirt. And honestly, Doc, I don't eat much of anything these days. My appetite's gone. Used to love cooking, now it's just… a chore. My husband, God rest his soul, he did all the cooking. I just… haven't bothered since.
DOCTOR: I understand, Hedy. That must be very difficult, and a significant change in your life. Losing your husband is a huge loss, and it’s understandable that your appetite has been affected. We'll take that into consideration. Now, aside from the tiredness and the clay cravings, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… Everything hurts, mostly. My bones ache, and I get headaches. A lot of headaches. And I'm… forgetful. Like, really forgetful. I told you, I can't remember dates, but it's more than that. I forget what I was saying mid-sentence. It's embarrassing. And I feel… cold. All the time. Even when it's hot.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have bone aches, frequent headaches, increasing forgetfulness, and a constant feeling of coldness, even when it's warm. That's quite a bit to work with. Have you noticed any changes in your skin or nails?
PATIENT: Skin and nails… Honestly, Doc, I don’t pay much attention to that stuff. I haven’t looked at my nails in… well, I don't even remember. My skin feels dry, I guess. And kinda… pale. I haven’t been getting out much, so probably just from being indoors. I don't bother with makeup or anything like that anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry skin and paleness. Thank you. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, history… Let me think. The usual old lady stuff, I guess. High blood pressure, the doctor said. And arthritis, in my hands. But nothing serious. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. My husband handled all that. I just took the pills he gave me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications for those conditions, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not anymore. After my husband… well, things got messy. I just… stopped taking them. I didn't bother refilling the prescriptions. Honestly, Doc, I just… stopped caring, for a while. Everything felt pointless. I might have some old pills somewhere, but I have no idea what they were for. And I'm not going digging through boxes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're not currently taking any medications. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I mean, I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat whatever, take whatever the doctor gives me. I don't fuss. This is all… a waste of time, isn’t it? I'm just an old lady who's tired and eats dirt.
DOCTOR: It's not a waste of time at all, Hedy. It’s important to understand what’s going on, and we're working through everything step-by-step. You're right, you're an old lady who’s tired and eats dirt, and we're going to figure out why. Now, I’m going to need to do a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. The sooner I’m out of here, the better. Don’t poke around too much, okay? I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 140/90. Your pulse is 78 and regular. I'm listening to your heart and lungs now… I notice a slightly diminished breath sound on the lower lobes, bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. I'm checking your reflexes now… they are a little sluggish. Your skin is pale and dry, as you mentioned. I also notice some mild swelling in your hands and feet. I’m going to check your nails now… they appear brittle and slightly spoon-shaped. I’m also going to order some blood tests to check for any nutritional deficiencies, anemia, and kidney and liver function. We'll need to rule out some potential causes for your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… great. More poking and prodding. Look, Doc, just tell me what's wrong. I don't need a fancy diagnosis. Am I dying or not? Because if I am, I don't want to waste my time on tests.
DOCTOR: Hedy, I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you, you don’t seem to be in immediate danger. However, I can't give you a definitive answer without the results of these tests. Your symptoms – the fatigue, the clay cravings, the paleness, the brittle nails, the forgetfulness – they point to a few possibilities, but it’s too early to say for sure. We need to rule out things like iron deficiency anemia, vitamin deficiencies, and kidney or liver problems. It’s important to be thorough. These tests will give us the information we need to make an accurate diagnosis and develop a treatment plan. It’s not about wasting your time, it’s about getting you the right care. Would you like me to explain what the tests will involve?
PATIENT: Ugh, explain it, then get it over with. I guess. Just make it quick. I have… things to do. Well, I would have, if I wasn't wasting my whole day here.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll start with a complete blood count, or CBC, which checks the different types of cells in your blood, like red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This will help us look for anemia and infections. Then we'll do a basic metabolic panel, which checks your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte levels. We’ll also check your iron levels, vitamin B12, and vitamin D levels. I'll also order a thyroid stimulating hormone or TSH test. That checks your thyroid function. It will involve a simple blood draw. The phlebotomist will just need to insert a needle into a vein in your arm to collect a few vials of blood. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Needles… Great. Just what I needed. Okay, fine. As long as it doesn't take all day. And don’t stick me too many times. I bruise easily, remember? So, I get the blood drawn, then what? Do I have to come back? Because I really don't want to come back.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I'll make sure to let the phlebotomist know to be extra careful. The blood draw shouldn't take long at all. After the blood draw, the lab will analyze the samples. It usually takes 2-3 business days to get the results back. Once I have them, I’ll review them and call you with the findings. If everything is normal, we'll discuss that and possibly explore other potential causes. If anything is abnormal, we’ll discuss a treatment plan. You may need to come back for follow-up appointments, depending on the results, but we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a prescription for a multivitamin with iron. It won't solve the underlying problem, but it can help support your energy levels while we wait for the test results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, alright. A multivitamin. Just what I need, another pill to take. Fine. Just get it over with. Call me, don't make me come back. And make it quick. I have… things. Okay, I’m done now, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Hedy, you're all done for today. I’ll have the nurse give you the prescription and instructions for the blood draw. The nurse can also answer any other questions you may have. I understand you have things to do, and I’ll do my best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. I will call you as soon as I have them. Thank you for coming in today, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before my call. Have a good day, Hedy.
