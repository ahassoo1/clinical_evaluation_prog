DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I just… I want to have a baby, okay? And I don’t want any trouble doing it. My sister, she had such a hard time, and I just… I don’t want that. I’m not getting any younger, you know? I want to get this done. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. It's good you're planning ahead. "Not wanting any trouble" is… vague, though. Let’s try to be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean specific? I want to get pregnant. Easily. Without… you know… complications. Is that not enough? Honestly, I don’t have time to sit here listing every possible thing that could go wrong. It’s just… make it happen, and make sure it’s not a nightmare. Is that so hard to understand?
DOCTOR: It’s not that it’s hard to understand, dear, it’s that “easily” and “without complications” aren’t medical terms. We need to figure out what could potentially cause complications for you. Have you been trying for a while?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not really. I… well, my husband passed away a little over a year ago. I just… I remarried recently, and now we’re thinking about it. That's why I'm here! Before it’s too late, you understand? I don’t want to spend years going through… things. I just want a healthy baby. Is that too much to ask? Honestly, I don't even remember when my last period was, if that matters. Everything's been a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Recent remarriage, and wanting to start a family. That certainly changes things. And it’s good you’re thinking ahead, especially given the… recent loss. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about this. Knowing when your last menstrual period was does matter, quite a lot actually. But since you don't recall, we'll need to do some basic tests. Have you had a general check-up recently?
PATIENT: Tests? Ugh. Look, I have private insurance, so I guess that’s okay. But I really don’t have time for a million different things. I had a check-up… sometime after the wedding, I think. The new husband… he insisted. It was all very… thorough. But honestly, I don’t remember what they even looked at. It was just… a lot of poking and prodding. Are you going to poke and prod me now? I really don't like that.
DOCTOR: "Thorough" is good, but we need specifics to ensure everything is optimal now. And yes, a basic physical exam is necessary. It’s not about “poking and prodding,” it’s about gathering information. We’ll check your blood pressure, weight, listen to your heart and lungs… standard things. It helps us establish a baseline. And it’s important to know your medical history, allergies, any medications you’re taking… Do you have any known allergies or are you currently on any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I mean, I get a little sniffly sometimes with dust, but everyone does, right? Medications… let me think. Oh! I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor after the wedding suggested that too. He said a lot of people are deficient. And… I sometimes take something for my sinuses, when they act up. It’s… a decongestant, I think. Orange bottle. Honestly, I just grab whatever’s on the shelf at the pharmacy. Is that important? I just want to get this done and over with. It's all so tedious.
DOCTOR: It is important. Knowing exactly what you take, and the dosage, is crucial. “Something for your sinuses” and “orange bottle” aren’t sufficient. It could interact with other medications, or even affect fertility. Do you have the bottles with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You want me to bring bottles to a doctor’s appointment? That’s ridiculous! No, I don't have them with me! I told you, I just grab whatever’s there. Look, I have a good immune system, okay? I rarely get sick. I don’t need a detailed inventory of every little thing I’ve ever taken. I just want you to tell me I’m healthy enough to have a baby, and let me get on with my life. This is all so… unnecessarily complicated. And frankly, a little insulting. Do you really think I'm that irresponsible? I’m a food science technician, you know. I understand hygiene and health!
DOCTOR: Alright. While your profession is… noted, it doesn't negate the need for a thorough medical evaluation. It's not about implying irresponsibility, it’s about responsible healthcare. Given your reluctance to provide specifics and your recent loss, I'm going to recommend a comprehensive blood panel, including a complete fertility workup. We'll also need a pelvic exam and Pap smear. I understand this is tedious, but it's necessary to ensure a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby. I'll also need a detailed family history on both sides. Do you have that readily available?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, for goodness sake. That’s going to take days to gather! My mother passed away years ago, and I barely knew my father. And my husband's side… well, it’s complicated. Look, I came here for a quick assessment, not a genealogical research project! I really think you’re overdoing it. Can’t you just… give me something to take, or something? Like a vitamin or something? And be done with it? I have things to do, you know. I really don't have time for all this… fuss. I'm starting to think I should have just stayed home.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, I cannot provide treatment based on vague requests and incomplete information. While I understand your frustration, responsible medical care requires a thorough assessment. Given your resistance to providing necessary details and your expectation of a “quick fix,” I don’t believe I’m the right physician to meet your needs. I'm happy to provide you with a referral to another practice. However, they will likely require the same information. Perhaps a consultation with a reproductive endocrinologist would be most suitable, given your desire for a comprehensive fertility workup. Would you like me to provide that referral?
