DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s… well, it’s my stomach. It’s just been awful. Like, really awful. Everything I eat goes right through me. And I’ve tried things, you know? I’m not an idiot. It just…won’t stop.
DOCTOR: Right. “Awful” is… not particularly helpful, Ms. Woodring. Could you elaborate?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What more is there to elaborate on? I have diarrhea. Constant diarrhea. For… honestly, I’ve lost track. Weeks, probably. It's ruining my life. And the stuff the pharmacy gave me? Didn’t do a thing. Waste of money, honestly.
DOCTOR: Weeks of diarrhea… and over-the-counter remedies haven’t provided relief. I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. However, simply stating "constant diarrhea" doesn’t allow me to assess the severity or potential cause. To begin, can you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Oh, now you need details? Fine. It’s… watery. Very watery. And frequent. Like, several times a day. It’s not… bloody or anything, if that’s what you’re getting at. Just… a lot of water. And it cramps me up something fierce. Honestly, it’s embarrassing to even talk about.
DOCTOR: Watery, frequent, with cramping. No blood, good. And when you say "several times a day," could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? You need a number? Fine. At least… six times. Maybe more. It’s hard to keep track when you're constantly running to the… well, you get the idea. It’s been bad enough that I’ve had to cancel work several times. And I don’t like missing work.
DOCTOR: Six or more times a day… Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Honestly, I just feel weak. And tired. Really tired. It’s probably from… well, you know. Losing everything. I haven’t really felt hungry, but I've been trying to eat something, because I know I need to keep my strength up. It doesn’t stay in long enough to really do anything.
DOCTOR: Weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite… and minimal retention of food. Has there been any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain besides the cramping?
PATIENT: No fever. No vomiting. Just…the cramping. And the pain is mostly with the… the diarrhea. It doesn’t hurt constantly. And I haven’t really been nauseous, no. Just…completely miserable. Is this going to take much longer? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any changes to your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes to my diet? No! I eat the same things, pretty much, all the time. I’m a painter, not a chef. It’s not like I go out to fancy restaurants. Sandwiches, soup, sometimes a salad. Nothing exotic. Honestly, I haven't changed a thing. It just… started. Out of nowhere.
DOCTOR: You’re currently not taking any medications and have no known allergies, correct?
PATIENT: That’s right. No medications. And no allergies. I'm pretty healthy, usually. This is just… a really bad stomach bug, or something. Though, frankly, a bug that lasts for weeks is a bit much, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Woodring, given the duration and frequency, “just a stomach bug” seems unlikely. We need to investigate further. I'd like to order a stool sample to rule out any bacterial or parasitic infections. I also want to check your electrolytes, as prolonged diarrhea can lead to dehydration and imbalance. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Tests? Seriously? Look, I just want something to stop it. I don’t need a bunch of tests. I just want to be able to… function again. But, fine. If you insist. Just tell me how to do this stool sample thing, and let’s get it over with. I have work to do, and I’m losing money every day I'm stuck in here.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall. You’ll need to collect a small sample—about the size of a walnut—in this container. There are specific instructions on the form, but essentially, you collect the sample after your next bowel movement. It’s best to bring it in within 24 hours. I will also order some oral rehydration salts to help with the dehydration. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of clear fluids, such as water or broth. Once we have the lab results, we can determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Clear fluids, stool sample… just get me out of here so I can do it. Honestly, this whole thing is a waste of my time. I hope this “course of treatment” actually works.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab results should be available within a few days. If your symptoms worsen, or if you develop a fever, please contact the clinic immediately. I’ll have the nurse provide you with discharge instructions. Have a good day, Ms. Woodring. And please, try to stay hydrated. .
PATIENT: Yeah, whatever. "Hydrated…right."
