DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Rannells. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s about time someone offered a sensible solution. I understand you’re the one to see about… the cannabis. My daughter suggested it, bless her heart, though I still think it’s rather… unconventional. I’m hoping to get a certification, if that’s the proper term, for medical marijuana. It’s for the aches, you see. Old age, mostly. Though I keep myself quite active, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Rannells. We are able to discuss medical cannabis certification here at the clinic. It’s becoming increasingly recognized as a helpful option for managing chronic pain. To ensure it’s appropriate for you, I'll need to gather some information. First, can you tell me more about these aches?
PATIENT: Oh, where to begin? It’s mostly my joints, you see. My knees, particularly. And my lower back. It’s not a constant pain, not debilitating, but it flares up. Damp weather is the worst. And after gardening, naturally. I do enjoy my roses, you understand, but it does leave me rather stiff the next day. It's just… inconvenient. I’ve tried creams, you know, the over-the-counter sort. And my daughter insists on these… yoga stretches. But honestly, Doctor, a bit of relief would be a blessing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Rannells. So the pain is primarily in your knees and lower back, and it’s aggravated by damp weather and activity like gardening. You've tried topical creams and some yoga stretches, with limited relief. Could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Hmm. It's not a sharp pain, not like a broken bone or anything. More of a… dull ache. And sometimes a stiffness, like my joints are full of sand. When it flares up, it's a throbbing, you see? Not terribly intense, but… persistent. It keeps me from my usual activities. I don't like to complain, Doctor, but it’s… limiting. And I certainly don't want to become one of those people who can't get around without assistance. Heavens, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache with stiffness, and sometimes a throbbing sensation when it flares up. It doesn’t sound like a sharp, acute pain. You mentioned it’s limiting your activities, and you’re concerned about maintaining your independence – that’s very important. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Nothing of the sort! I may be getting on in years, Doctor, but I assure you, my limbs are functioning perfectly well. Perfectly. I walk every morning, you know. And I tend to my garden. I may need a bit of assistance with the heavier lifting, but certainly no numbness or tingling. I'm not falling apart, Doctor. I simply want a little relief from some aches and pains. It's quite frustrating to have to explain this.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Rannells. I apologize if my questions seemed to imply otherwise. I simply want to rule out any other potential causes. It's good to know you haven't experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness. Let’s move on to your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I had a touch of bronchitis a few years back. A nasty cough, it was. But that cleared up on its own, thank heavens. And I've always had slightly high blood pressure, but it's managed with a small dose of medication. Nothing serious. Honestly, Doctor, I've been remarkably healthy for my age. That's why I find all this… fuss… rather unnecessary. My daughter, again, is the one pushing for this cannabis. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of bronchitis that resolved, and currently managed high blood pressure. That's helpful to know. And you’re taking medication for your blood pressure - could you tell me what medication you’re currently taking and the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking me specifics, Doctor. I don't recall the name, precisely. It's a little white pill. I believe my daughter handles the refills, so she would know. Honestly, I simply take it as prescribed. A small dose, the doctor said. It begins with a 'V', perhaps? Or maybe a 'B'? I truly couldn't say. It's not something I concern myself with. It keeps my blood pressure in check, and that's all that matters. This whole exercise is becoming rather… tedious.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Rannells. It can be difficult to remember specific details. Let me check our system to see if we have a record of your current medications. Ah, here we are. It looks like you are currently taking Valsartan 80mg daily. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Valsartan… yes, that sounds right. Yes, that must be it. 80 milligrams… yes. My daughter likely told me. She's very good with those sorts of details. Though, really, Doctor, must we delve into every single minute detail? It's rather… intrusive, don’t you think? I came here for a simple certification, not a full medical interrogation.
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels intrusive, Ms. Rannells. I assure you, I’m only gathering this information to ensure the medical cannabis is a safe and appropriate option for you. It's important to know all your medications, as they can interact with cannabis. Now, besides the Valsartan, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no. Just the Valsartan. Perhaps a multivitamin now and then, but nothing regular. My daughter keeps trying to get me to take all sorts of things – fish oil, turmeric, something called "ashwagandha" – but I simply don't bother. I believe in a sensible diet and a good night’s sleep. That’s always been my philosophy. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a very simple woman. I don't need a pharmacy full of pills and potions. I just want a little relief from these aches and pains, if that’s at all possible. Is this cannabis something that will even work? That’s what I’m truly wondering.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Ms. Rannells. Medical cannabis can be effective for managing chronic pain, particularly joint pain, for many people. However, it doesn’t work the same way for everyone. Now, before we discuss whether it might be a good fit for you, I’d like to briefly ask about your past medical and surgical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, really, Doctor? Now we're going back through my entire life story? Honestly. Well… let me see. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child. A very common procedure, back then. And… I had a hysterectomy in my early thirties. That was… unpleasant. And I was hospitalized briefly for a bad bout of the flu a few years ago, but that was nothing serious. Beyond that… I can’t recall anything significant. I’ve been remarkably fortunate, all things considered. And truly, Doctor, I don't see how any of this is relevant to a simple certification for medical cannabis. It's becoming increasingly frustrating. I’m starting to wonder if I should have just stayed home.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Rannells, and I apologize for taking so much time. I'm just trying to get a complete picture of your health to ensure the cannabis certification is safe and appropriate for you. Knowing your surgical history can help us anticipate any potential interactions or contraindications. Now, let’s move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, or cancer?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, my family history is quite unremarkable. My mother lived to be 92, and she was perfectly healthy until the very end. My father had some heart trouble in his later years, but that’s about it. No diabetes, no cancer, no arthritis… just good, strong Dominican genes. We're a resilient bunch, you see. And frankly, I think all these questions are a waste of my time. I came here for a simple certification, not a genealogical investigation. I’m starting to regret this entire ordeal. Is there any chance we can just get this over with? I have a garden to tend to, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Rannells, and I apologize for the extensive questioning. It’s important to me to be thorough. It sounds like you have a strong family history of good health, which is excellent. Now, one last set of questions, if you don’t mind, and then we can discuss if medical cannabis is right for you. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I've never had any allergies in my life. Not to medications, not to foods, not to pollen, not to dust… nothing! I’m a remarkably sturdy individual, you see. Perhaps it’s the Dominican air, or my sensible diet, or simply good luck. Whatever it is, I’ve never had any allergic reactions. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel as though you’re simply trying to find something wrong with me. I came here for a simple certification, and I'm beginning to suspect you’re making this unnecessarily difficult. Is this how you treat all your patients?
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Rannells, I am not trying to find something wrong with you. I simply want to be as thorough as possible, and it’s standard procedure to ask about allergies. Now, just to be absolutely sure, have you ever experienced any reactions – such as hives, itching, swelling, or difficulty breathing – after taking a medication or eating a particular food?
PATIENT: Doctor, honestly. No. I have never experienced any allergic reactions. Not in my life. Not even a minor rash. I eat everything. I take medications when I need to. And I have never, ever, had a problem. I am perfectly healthy. Perfectly. I find your skepticism quite insulting, frankly. I came here seeking a simple certification, and I feel as though I’m being subjected to a medical inquisition. Is this something you routinely do to your patients? Because, quite frankly, I’m on the verge of walking out of here.
DOCTOR: Ms. Rannells, I sincerely apologize if I’ve made you feel as though I’m being skeptical or intrusive. That is absolutely not my intention. I understand your frustration, and I assure you, I am not routinely subjecting my patients to a medical inquisition. I ask these questions because medical cannabis can interact with other medications or underlying conditions, and it's important to ensure your safety. I am simply trying to be thorough. Since you’ve confirmed you have no allergies, no significant medical conditions, and no family history of anything relevant, and you're currently taking Valsartan 80mg daily, let’s discuss whether medical cannabis might be a good option for you. Given your aches and pains in your knees and lower back, aggravated by damp weather and activity, do you have any concerns about potential side effects or interactions with your medication?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, frankly, my biggest concern is whether this entire process has been a waste of my time. But to answer your question… I suppose I worry about feeling… strange. My daughter mentioned something about feeling “relaxed” or “euphoric,” and frankly, I have no desire to feel either of those things. I simply want relief from my aches and pains, not a trip to the moon. And I certainly don’t want to become dependent on anything. Is this cannabis something that will affect my ability to think clearly? Or drive? Those are my main concerns. And honestly, Doctor, if this is going to involve a lot of unpleasant side effects or complicated procedures, I think I’ll just stick to my creams and yoga stretches. It’s far less trouble.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ms. Rannells. It’s important to address them. You’re right to be cautious about potential side effects and interactions. Medical cannabis can cause some side effects, such as dizziness, drowsiness, and dry mouth. However, these are usually mild and can be managed. It’s also important to start with a low dose and gradually increase it until you find the right amount for you. Regarding your ability to think clearly or drive, it’s important to avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how cannabis affects you. We can discuss different strains and delivery methods that are less likely to cause those effects. One thing to understand is that the psychoactive effects of cannabis come from a compound called THC. There are also other compounds, such as CBD, that don’t have those effects. Many people find that CBD is helpful for pain relief without causing any psychoactive effects. Given your concerns about feeling strange or dependent, I would recommend starting with a CBD-dominant product, such as a tincture or topical cream. We can also discuss strains with a lower THC content if you decide to try something with some THC. Do you have any questions about CBD or the different strains of cannabis?
PATIENT: CBD… you say? So this wouldn't… make me feel… altered? My daughter mentioned something about “getting high,” and frankly, the thought is rather unpleasant. I have responsibilities, you see. I tend to my garden, I volunteer at the church, I have friends to visit. I certainly don't need to be feeling… giddy. And what about this “tincture”? Is that something I swallow? Or rub on? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure I understand all these technical terms. And how would I even obtain this… cannabis? Is it legal? I don’t want to get into any trouble with the law. This is all rather complicated, and frankly, I’m starting to regret even asking about it. It's far less trouble just dealing with my aches and pains, I suppose.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask all those questions, Ms. Rannells, and it’s perfectly understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. Let me clarify. CBD, or cannabidiol, is a compound found in cannabis that doesn’t have the psychoactive effects associated with THC. It won’t make you feel “high” or altered in any way. Many people use CBD for its anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties. A tincture is a liquid extract made from cannabis. It’s typically taken under the tongue, where it’s absorbed into the bloodstream. You can also find topical creams and lotions that contain CBD, which you rub on your skin. Regarding legality, medical cannabis is legal in this state with a certification from a physician. I can provide you with a certification if we determine that it’s appropriate for you. Once you have a certification, you can purchase cannabis from licensed dispensaries. I can provide you with a list of dispensaries in your area. We can start with a low-dose CBD tincture and see how it works for you. If that doesn’t provide enough relief, we can explore other options with a lower THC content. Does that make more sense?
PATIENT: Well… it sounds slightly less alarming, I suppose. But I still have reservations. A dispensary… that sounds rather… dubious. And frankly, I’m not entirely comfortable purchasing anything from a place with such a… questionable reputation. And what about the dosage? How much of this… tincture… would I need to take? And what if it doesn’t work? Or what if I have an adverse reaction? I don’t want to end up in the emergency room. This is all rather stressful, you see. I simply want a little relief from my aches and pains, not a medical crisis. Perhaps I should just stick to my creams and yoga stretches. It’s far less trouble, I suppose. But… if you truly believe this CBD tincture might help, and it won’t make me feel… altered… perhaps I could try a small amount. But I want everything explained in simple terms, and I want to know exactly what to expect. And I want your contact information, in case I have any problems. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Ms. Rannells. That is not too much to ask at all. I completely understand your concerns, and I’m happy to explain everything in simple terms and address any questions you may have. A low dose of CBD tincture would be around 5-10 milligrams, taken under the tongue once or twice a day. You can start with 5 milligrams and gradually increase it until you find the right amount for you. It's important to be patient, as it may take a few days or weeks to feel the full effects. Possible side effects are usually mild and can include dizziness, drowsiness, or dry mouth. If you experience any adverse reactions, such as severe dizziness, nausea, or allergic reactions, stop taking the tincture and contact me immediately. My contact information is on the card I'll give you. I can provide you with a list of reputable dispensaries in your area that are known for their high-quality products and knowledgeable staff. I recommend starting with a dispensary that has a good reputation and positive reviews. If the tincture doesn’t provide enough relief, we can explore other options, such as different strains with a lower THC content. We can also discuss other pain management techniques, such as physical therapy or acupuncture. Would you like me to provide you with the list of dispensaries and a card with my contact information?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that would be very helpful. The list of dispensaries and your card, please. And perhaps a simple explanation of the different strains… just a brief overview. I still have reservations, you understand. But… I suppose it’s worth a try. And Doctor… thank you. For your patience. I know I’ve been… difficult. But I simply want to make sure I’m making the right decision. And I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything in simple terms. It’s not easy for an old woman like me to understand all these… modern things. But… I suppose I’m willing to give it a try. Just… don’t expect miracles. And please, remind me to take it slowly. I don't want to end up regretting this.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Rannells. I understand your hesitation, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. I've also included a brief overview of common cannabis strains, highlighting those with lower THC content. Remember, start slowly, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. We can always adjust the dosage or explore other options if needed. I'm glad you're willing to give it a try. I hope it provides you with some relief from your aches and pains. Here's my card again, with my direct line. Please don’t hesitate to call, even if it’s just to ask a question. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Rannells. Take care. .
