DOCTOR: Hi Early, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… a simple thing, really. I just need a card. A “Get Well” card, or maybe one with… encouragement. My daughter, she thinks I should have one. After… things. You know? It's just good to have, for appearances.
DOCTOR: Okay… I understand. So, you're requesting a note, essentially, for… emotional support?
PATIENT: Emotional… support. That’s a fancy way of putting it, Doctor. It’s more… a matter of politeness. And frankly, some people are just being… difficult. My daughter is a good girl, but she worries too much. It would just be easier if I had the card. To show her I am… handling things. You understand? It's not like I need encouragement.
DOCTOR: Right, I see. So, just to clarify, you're not experiencing any specific medical issues that prompted this visit?
PATIENT: Medical issues? No, Doctor. Nothing you need to worry about. I'm a strong man. Been working with boilers my whole life. A little… upset is all. It's just… a card. Are you going to write it, or do I need to go somewhere else? I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Early, with all due respect, our clinic is a medical facility. We provide care for illnesses and injuries. While I certainly understand your daughter's concern, and I appreciate you coming in, a note for… reassurance isn’t really within the scope of our practice. I can, however, offer to do a quick check-up, just to rule out any underlying issues contributing to your feeling upset. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A… check-up? For being… bothered? Doctor, with all due respect, are you suggesting I’m… sick? Because my daughter thinks I'm sad? That’s… ridiculous. I came here for a card, and now you’re telling me I need to be examined? I think I’ll just… go then. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Early, I understand your frustration. I didn’t mean to imply you were “sick.” It’s standard practice to briefly assess a patient's overall well-being, especially if there's been a recent change in their emotional state. But if you're not interested in that, that's perfectly fine. I can't fulfill your request for a note, but I can provide you with a list of local resources for emotional support if you'd like. Perhaps a social worker or counselor would be a better fit?
PATIENT: A social worker? Doctor, are you listening to yourself? I just want a card. A simple piece of paper with some nice words. I don’t need… resources. I’ve handled things on my own for 56 years, I think I can manage this. Thank you for your… time. But I’ll find someone else who understands a simple request.
DOCTOR: Very well, Early. I wish you all the best. If you do happen to experience any unexpected physical or emotional symptoms, please don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. Here’s a brochure with some local mental health services, just in case. .
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Thank you. .
