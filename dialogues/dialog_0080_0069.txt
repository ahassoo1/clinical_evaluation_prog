DOCTOR: Hi Nathaiel, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good to meet you too, Dr. Rosanova. I'm here for a vaccination, I think? It's… well, it's a bit of a check-up and to make sure I'm all up-to-date on my shots. Medicare sent a notice, and I figured it was best to get it sorted.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly reasonable. Medicare is good about sending those reminders. Let me just pull up your file here… Nathaiel Paguiio, age 47… Okay, I see here you’re due for a Tdap booster – that’s tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – and also a flu shot is recommended. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. Tdap… I remember getting something like that a long time ago. And the flu shot, definitely. I try to get that every year. Is the flu shot the one that protects against all the different strains they're talking about on the news? I always get a little confused about which one is the best.
DOCTOR: That’s a smart question! There are different types, but we typically offer the quadrivalent flu vaccine, which protects against four different strains of the flu virus. It’s the most comprehensive one available and what the CDC recommends. Before we proceed with those, though, I like to get a quick overview of your general health. Have you had any significant medical issues in the past – anything that a family doctor should know about?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major, no. I had a bout of really bad bronchitis a few years back, but that cleared up with antibiotics. And I broke my wrist when I was a kid, but it healed fine. Other than that… honestly, I'm pretty healthy. I try to eat well, and I walk every day. I don't really have any ongoing conditions or anything. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I just don't want to leave anything out.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! No, nothing specific, just making sure I have a complete picture. Okay, and any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries at all. Never needed any, thankfully. Just the broken wrist when I was little, but that didn't require surgery, just a cast. It healed up perfectly straight, if that matters. I’m a little nervous about needles, if I'm being honest, but I know they're important.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly okay – a lot of people feel that way! We can make it as quick and comfortable as possible. Alright, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, things like that?
PATIENT: Oh, family history... let me see. My mother had high blood pressure when she got older, and my grandfather on my father’s side had… I think it was type 2 diabetes. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, had breast cancer, but she was quite a bit older when she was diagnosed. Nothing else immediately springs to mind. Is that the sort of thing you need to know? I’m trying to remember everything my parents used to talk about.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. High blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and a history of breast cancer… I’m noting all of that. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. Always thought it was a terrible habit. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe a couple of times a week, but that’s it. Is that a problem? I've heard even a little bit can have an effect.
DOCTOR: No, a couple of glasses of wine a week is generally not a problem. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, I just answered that, didn’t I? A couple of glasses of wine a week. Sorry, I’m a little distracted. I get nervous at the doctor's office, I think my brain stops working properly. I meant to say that to explain why I’m repeating myself. Is that okay? I can try and focus better.
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Nathaiel. It’s perfectly understandable to be a little nervous. I apologize if my questions seem repetitive, I'm just trying to be thorough. Let's move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, pollen, anything like that?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, take most medications without issue, and I don’t have hay fever or anything like that. My skin gets a little itchy sometimes if I'm in a lot of pollen, but that’s just a seasonal thing, I don’t think it’s a proper allergy. I hope that makes sense. It’s just a mild irritation.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't take any prescription medications, and I try to avoid over-the-counter stuff if I can. I believe in letting my body heal itself, if possible. I do take a multivitamin every now and then, but that's about it. Just a basic one, nothing fancy. Is there a particular medication I should be mentioning? I just want to make sure I'm not forgetting anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin occasionally. Alright, Nathaiel. That gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do, Dr. Rosanova. I trust your judgment. I'm a little worried about the blood pressure thing, I always get a bit anxious at the doctor’s, so it might be a little high. But go ahead, I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 142/90, but that's not unexpected with a bit of anxiety. We’ll keep an eye on it. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Ears look clear. And finally, I'll take a quick look at your throat. Throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Overall, everything sounds and looks good.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear. I’m glad everything sounds okay. It’s always a relief to know things are normal. So, what does this mean for the shots? Should we go ahead with the Tdap and the flu shot today? And do I need to do anything afterwards? I always worry about side effects, even if I know they’re usually mild.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything sounds good to proceed with the Tdap booster and the flu shot today. As for side effects, the most common ones are mild – soreness at the injection site, maybe a little fatigue or a low-grade fever. It usually resolves within a day or two. We'll have you stay here for about 15 minutes after the shots to monitor you, just in case. Do you have any allergies to latex?
PATIENT: No, no latex allergy. I've handled rubber gloves and things like that without any problems. I think my mother might have been a little sensitive, but I don't seem to have inherited that. So, that's okay. Should we get it done now? I’m ready when you are, even though I'm still a little nervous about the needles. Perhaps you could just be quick about it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as quick as possible. Okay, this will just sting for a moment. Deep breath... There you go. Both done. See?
PATIENT: Okay… that wasn’t too bad. A little pinch, but I think I survived. Thank you, Dr. Rosanova. It’s good to get it over with. Now, we wait 15 minutes, right? Just to make sure everything’s okay? And then I can go home? Is there anything I need to avoid doing afterwards? Like strenuous exercise or something? I tend to overthink things.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. We’ll have you sit here for 15 minutes just to monitor for any reaction. And after that, you're free to go home. Try to avoid strenuous exercise for the rest of the day just to be on the safe side. And if you notice any severe redness, swelling, or difficulty breathing, please head to the emergency room immediately, though that’s very unlikely. Otherwise, just rest and stay hydrated. I’ll check on you in a few minutes. Do you have any questions for me before I do that?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good for now. Just waiting, I suppose. Thank you again, Dr. Rosanova. You were very kind and patient with me. It really helped to calm my nerves. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It’s… well, it’s nice to have a doctor I can trust.
