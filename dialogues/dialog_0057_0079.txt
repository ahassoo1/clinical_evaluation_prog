DOCTOR: Good morning, Courtnye. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… bruising. I’ve been getting bruises really easily lately, and it’s a bit worrying. I’m on a blood thinner, so I figured I should get it checked out. It’s just… more than usual, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising easily, and you're on a blood thinner, so it's good you came in to get it checked out. "More than usual" is helpful – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Usually, if I bump into something, maybe a little one will show up. But now? Like, I just brushed against the doorframe yesterday, and I got a huge one on my arm. And another one popped up on my leg for no reason at all, I think. It’s… kinda scary, honestly. I don’t remember doing anything to cause them.
DOCTOR: I understand. That does sound concerning, especially when you're not recalling any specific injuries. So, these bruises are appearing with minimal trauma, or sometimes even without any trauma that you can recall. And you said they seem larger than what you'd typically experience?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. Larger, and… they seem to last longer too. Usually a bump fades pretty quick, but these… they’re sticking around for a good week, maybe even longer. It’s just… not right. I'm usually pretty good at remembering how I got a bruise, you know? But not these ones.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful information. So, increased size, longer duration, and appearing without a clear cause. Let's get a bit more detail. Are these bruises all over your body, or are they concentrated in certain areas?
PATIENT: Mostly on my arms and legs, I think. I haven’t really noticed any on my stomach or back or anything. Definitely more on my limbs, though. And… …they don’t really hurt, which is weird, right? Usually a good knock leaves me sore, but these are just… there. It’s more the look of them that's worrying me.
DOCTOR: That's good to know – mostly on the limbs, and not particularly painful. The lack of pain is a little unusual. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, if that's alright. Have you noticed any bleeding in other places, like your gums when you brush your teeth, or any nosebleeds recently?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Hmm… no nosebleeds, thankfully. But… …you know, now that you mention it, my gums have been a bit sensitive. I noticed a little bit of bleeding when I flossed last night. Not a ton, but enough to make me stop. I just figured it was because I hadn't flossed in a couple of days, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's important information – the gum bleeding, even if it was minor, is something we need to consider. And you're on a blood thinner, so it's good we're being thorough. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just… high blood pressure, I guess? I take medication for that. And… …I had a blood clot in my leg a few years ago, which is why I’m on the blood thinner in the first place. That's why I'm taking warfarin, I think. Doctor put me on it after the clot. I’ve been on it for about three years now, maybe four. I try to keep up with my appointments.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and a history of a blood clot in your leg, treated with warfarin for the past three or four years. That’s very helpful to know. Have you had any recent changes to your medications, or have you started taking any new supplements or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: No, nothing new. Same medications for blood pressure, same dose of warfarin. I haven’t even taken a pain reliever in weeks, honestly. Just my regular stuff. I'm pretty careful about what I put in my body. I don't really like taking pills unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. No recent changes to your medication list. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you have any family members with bleeding disorders, or a history of easy bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… …not that I know of. My grandma on my mom’s side had… something with her blood, maybe anemia? But I don’t really remember the details. She passed away a long time ago. Nobody else really… easy bruising wasn’t really a thing in my family, as far as I know. We’re all pretty sturdy people.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of bleeding disorders, possibly some anemia on your maternal grandmother’s side. And finally, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Sure. I live alone, pretty quiet life. Retired a few years back, so mostly just… gardening, visiting with friends sometimes. I don’t drink a lot, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while. And I don't smoke. Just a pretty normal life, really. Is this important? Are the bruises because of something I'm doing?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Quiet life, retired, no smoking, minimal alcohol. That information is always good to have. It doesn't sound like anything in your lifestyle is contributing to this. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a closer look at these bruises. It'll just be a brief exam to help me get a better understanding of what's going on.
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… hurry it up a bit, if you don’t mind? I have a lunch appointment I need to get to. Not trying to rush you, just… a busy day.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart and lungs sound good. The bruises… they do appear larger than I'd expect, and they are relatively flat. No swelling or warmth. I'm noting the location and size in your chart. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like we need to investigate this further. It could be a number of things, from a slight adjustment needed in your warfarin dosage to something less common. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order some blood tests. A complete blood count, a PT/INR to check your warfarin level, and a basic metabolic panel. These will give us a good baseline to work with. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Blood tests are fine. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And will I need another appointment to talk about them? I really don't have a lot of free time, you know? I just want to make sure everything is okay and get back to my life.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time. The lab results should be back within 24-48 hours. I'll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they are available. We can discuss them over the phone, and if we need to adjust your medication or do further testing, we can schedule a follow-up appointment then. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend avoiding any strenuous activity, and if you experience any new bleeding – nosebleeds, blood in your stool, excessive bruising – please come back to see me immediately, or go to the emergency room. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. No strenuous activity, watch for bleeding, call if anything changes. I can do that. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. Hopefully it's nothing serious. I really need to get going now, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll have the nurse give you the lab order and instructions on where to go. I understand your anxiety, and we'll get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before we get the results. Have a good day, Courtnye.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. You too.
