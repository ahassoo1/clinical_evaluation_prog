DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It's nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… a bit embarrassing, honestly. I just… my legs feel like jelly. Started a few days ago, right after I got over a nasty cold. Not the cold itself, after it was gone. It’s just… weak. Hard to explain. I’m Sharifa Firestone, by the way. You can call me Sharifa.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Sharifa. It's perfectly alright – many things can cause weakness, and we'll figure out what's going on. It’s helpful you mention it started after your cold. Could you describe this weakness a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it’s… both legs, equally. Not like one is worse than the other. And it's not a pain, exactly. More like… trying to wade through thick mud? Especially when I first stand up. It gets a little better if I walk around for a bit, but it never really goes completely away. It’s just… unsettling. I’m a tour guide, you know? I need to be on my feet all day. I can’t exactly take people sightseeing if I’m wobbling around like a newborn giraffe.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Sharifa. Being a tour guide requires a lot of stamina and stability. "Wading through thick mud" is a very helpful description, thank you. And it's good to know it's both legs, and improves somewhat with walking. When you say it started a few days ago, can you recall approximately when your cold fully resolved?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… the cold itself, the sneezing and the stuffy nose, that was gone… last Tuesday, I believe. Yes, definitely Tuesday. I remember because I had a tour booked that afternoon and I had to take some extra decongestant so I wouldn’t sound like a foghorn. And the leg weakness… it started Thursday. So, two days later. I have a very good memory, you see. Dates, times, little details… it all sticks with me.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Sharifa. Knowing the timing is important. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… no fever, no numbness or tingling. Not really any pain, as I said. I've been a little tired, perhaps, but honestly, who isn't tired these days? I suppose I haven’t had much of an appetite, but that could just be the stress of… well, not being able to work properly. And I've been going to the bathroom a bit more often, maybe? Not diarrhea, just… more frequent trips. Is that important? It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: No, it’s good you mention everything, Sharifa. Increased urinary frequency is worth noting. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major. I had my gallbladder out about fifteen years ago. That was… unpleasant. And I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years back, but it’s usually well-controlled with medication. I’ve been on lisinopril for it, I think it is. And… oh, I had a bout of shingles a couple of years ago, but that's all. Otherwise, I’m remarkably healthy, if I do say so myself. I always take care of myself.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Sharifa. And it sounds like you do take good care of yourself. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the lisinopril?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. And sometimes, if I’m feeling particularly achy, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that’s it. I try to avoid medications whenever possible. I believe in letting my body heal itself. And a little aloe vera juice for my skin. Does that count? Honestly, that's probably not important. I just… I don't like filling my body with unnecessary things.
DOCTOR: No, that's all helpful information, Sharifa. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Let me think… I’m allergic to penicillin, discovered that rather dramatically as a child. Hives and everything. And I get a bit of a rash if I touch poison ivy, but that’s hardly a life-threatening allergy. Otherwise… no, I don’t have any significant allergies. I can eat anything, drink anything, breathe anything. Generally speaking, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. She was diagnosed when she was quite old, though. And my father… he had heart problems. High blood pressure, like me, and eventually needed a stent. And… oh, my aunt on my father’s side had arthritis. Bad arthritis, couldn't walk without a cane. That’s about all I can think of, really. We weren't a very close family, so I don't know a lot about their medical histories. It’s sad, really. But that’s another story.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Sharifa. That’s helpful. And I understand that families aren't always close. Finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Well, I'm divorced. Been divorced for… oh, fifteen years now. No children. I live alone. And, as I mentioned, I'm a tour guide. It keeps me busy. I enjoy it, when my legs cooperate, of course. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. I try to eat healthy, mostly. I walk as much as I can, when I’m not wobbling around like a newborn giraffe, of course. I suppose that’s everything. I'm not a very exciting person, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Sharifa. That gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. I just… I’m hoping you can figure out what’s going on. I have a tour booked next week, and I really don’t want to have to cancel it. It’s a very important tour. A private group, very discerning clients. You understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, and I’ll do my best to figure this out. Let’s start with your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiratory rate is 16. That's all within normal limits. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I just… I’m a little worried, I must admit. I've never experienced anything like this before. It’s unsettling, as I said. And I rely on my legs, you see? It's my livelihood. I suppose I’m being dramatic. But it's true.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds normal, and your lungs are clear. Your pulses are present and equal in both legs. Your reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical, which is normal. However, I do notice some slight weakness in your legs, particularly when you extend your feet against resistance. It's not dramatic, but it's present. Now, could you try standing up from a seated position?
PATIENT: There. See? It's… not graceful. It feels like my legs are made of jelly. I have to really concentrate to keep my balance. It's not like this normally, Doctor. Not at all. I feel… quite foolish, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Sharifa. That was helpful to see. It confirms what I was suspecting. You have some weakness in your legs, and it’s more pronounced when you first stand. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, the most likely causes are either a lingering effect from the recent viral illness, or possibly some nerve involvement. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some blood work. This will help us check your electrolytes, kidney function, and rule out any inflammatory conditions. I also think it would be beneficial to get a Vitamin D level. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. Blood work is fine. Vitamin D, whatever. I just… I want to know what’s going on. And I want to be able to walk again. I have a tour next week, you know. A very important tour. Private group. Discerning clients. You’ve heard me mention it. Is that going to take long? The blood work, I mean. I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Sharifa. And yes, I have heard about your tour. We’ll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. The blood work shouldn’t take long—just a few minutes. And the results usually come back within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay hydrated, and avoiding any strenuous activity that exacerbates the weakness. If the weakness worsens significantly, or you develop any new symptoms—such as numbness, tingling, or difficulty controlling your bladder or bowels—please contact the clinic immediately. Here’s the lab order. You can go to the lab right down the hall, and they'll take care of you. Once you’ve had the blood work done, please let me know, and we'll discuss the results as soon as they come back. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I suppose I’m a bit of a worrier. And I do have a schedule to keep. That tour… well, you’ve heard enough about it. I’ll go get the blood work done right away. And I’ll let you know as soon as the results are in. Hopefully, it's nothing serious. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sharifa. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. And yes, let’s hope it’s nothing serious. .
