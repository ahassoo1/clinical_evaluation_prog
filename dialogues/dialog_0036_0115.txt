DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s about my coloring, really. I seem to be… yellowing. Not a good yellow, mind you. It’s a bit concerning, and a friend suggested I come see someone right away. It’s something to do with my liver, I believe they said. Though, honestly, I don’t recall all the details. It’s been a long time since I was truly unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowing… that’s a good place to start. And it's good your friend encouraged you to come in. It is always better to check these things out. When you say yellowing, where are you noticing it?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, I suppose. My face, certainly. And… and my eyes, I think. It's hard to tell. I haven’t been looking at myself closely, truthfully. It just… appeared, gradually. And I do seem rather tired lately, but that could be anything, couldn’t it? Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: It is frustrating when memory isn’t cooperating, and that’s perfectly understandable. We’ll take our time. So, yellowing of the skin and eyes… that suggests a possible issue with your liver, as your friend mentioned. It's called jaundice. Have you noticed any other changes along with the yellowing?
PATIENT: Jaundice… yes, that’s the word my friend used. Other changes… hmm. Well, my appetite hasn’t been very good, I suppose. Just not hungry. And… My stomach has been a bit upset lately. Not terribly painful, just… uncomfortable. And very dark urine, I noticed. That was… alarming. But everything seems to blend together after a while, you understand? I’m not sure what came first, or what’s causing what.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It can be very confusing when multiple things are happening at once. Dark urine is definitely something to take note of. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills that I’ve noticed. I do get a bit warm sometimes, but that’s just the weather, isn’t it? It’s rather warm these days. And I haven’t been feeling poorly enough to truly feel feverish, if you understand. Just… tired. And uncomfortable, as I said. Oh, and a bit itchy, now that I think about it. My skin feels… prickly. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, the itching is important. Itching, fatigue, dark urine, jaundice, loss of appetite… these things are all pieces of the puzzle. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or liver disease?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a difficult question. It was so long ago. I believe I had something with my gallbladder, many years ago. They… they removed it, I think. And I had a touch of hepatitis when I was younger, traveling. But it cleared up on its own, or so the doctor said at the time. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve seen so many doctors over the years, it’s all a bit muddled. I’m afraid I can’t be much help with specifics. My friend is the one with the good memory, always remembering dates and names. I wish I were more like her.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Annelle. We have access to your records, and we can look things up. Knowing something happened is a good start. And it’s okay if you don’t remember all the details. Let’s see if we can get a better picture. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… no, not regularly. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off of it years ago. Said I was fine. And… sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. Just ibuprofen, over the counter. Nothing else, I think. Oh! Wait. I do take a vitamin D supplement, my daughter told me to. Something about getting enough sunshine. But that’s all, I assure you. Mostly just tea and a little bit of honey. Do you think that could be the cause?
DOCTOR: Tea and honey are unlikely to be the cause, Annelle. It's good you're thinking about these things, though. Alright, let's move on to family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had liver problems, gallbladder issues, or any other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s another difficult one. My mother… she was unwell for a long time. Something with her stomach, I think. But it was a very long time ago, and we didn't talk about these things much. My brother… he had heart problems, but that was after he retired. And my father… he was a very healthy man, if I recall correctly. Honestly, Doctor, I wish I knew more. My family wasn’t one for keeping records or discussing ailments. It was all rather… private. I'm truly not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Annelle. It's perfectly normal not to have all the answers. We work with what we have. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, or have you in the past?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Oh, no, not really. Never been much of a drinker, to be honest. A little sip of wine at Christmas sometimes, with dinner. But nothing regular. My husband… he enjoyed a glass or two, but he's been gone a long time now. I just never developed a taste for it, I suppose. I prefer tea, as I mentioned. Much healthier, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Now, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. My mother didn’t approve of smoking, and I never started. Always thought it was a dreadful habit. It smells awful, too. No, never touched a cigarette in my life. Thank goodness. My friend… she used to smoke, but she quit years ago. A very strong woman, my friend.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Alright, Annelle, we've covered a lot of ground. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check a few other things. It will only take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose it’s best to be thorough. Just… please be gentle. I’m not as strong as I used to be. And… try not to take too long? I have a bit of an appointment later this afternoon. I do apologize for being such a bother.
DOCTOR: Of course, Annelle. We'll take our time, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. And it’s no bother at all; this is what I'm here for. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breath… and again… Good. Your heart sounds regular, though a bit faint. Lungs are clear, but a little diminished breath sounds, which can be normal with age. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels painful. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. A little. Right there. It's not terribly painful, just… tender. Like a dull ache. And… it feels a bit swollen, doesn't it? Though, perhaps that's just my imagination. It's been bothering me for a few days now. Not enough to go to the doctor immediately, but… it's definitely there. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness in the upper right quadrant is something we need to investigate further. There is some mild fullness there as well. Your abdomen is otherwise soft, no masses that I detect. Now, I’m going to check your skin color more closely. Yes, as you mentioned, there is noticeable jaundice present – a yellowish discoloration of your skin and sclera . Your skin also feels a bit dry and there is some mild itching as you described. Alright, Annelle. Based on what you’ve told me and what I've found during the exam, I'm concerned about possible liver issues. Your symptoms and findings are suggestive of cholestasis, which means there's a blockage in the flow of bile. This could be caused by a number of things, including gallstones, blocked bile ducts, or certain medications. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'm going to order some blood tests. These tests will help me assess your liver function and rule out other potential causes. I also want to order an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and an ultrasound… Yes, alright. If that’s what you think is necessary. It sounds… serious. Is it something very bad, Doctor? I mean… will I need surgery? I’m not sure I’m strong enough for surgery. I just want to know what's wrong and… and get it fixed, if possible. I'm not looking for a miracle, just… answers. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be anxious, Annelle, and you're not alone in feeling that way. It's not necessarily something very bad yet; we need to figure out the cause first. Many liver issues are treatable, and sometimes they even resolve on their own. We're not talking about surgery at this point. We're just gathering information to make an accurate diagnosis. The blood tests and ultrasound will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. I'm going to order these tests right away, and the lab should be able to draw your blood today. The ultrasound will likely be scheduled within the next few days. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them thoroughly and come up with a plan together. I will also give you a referral to a gastroenterologist. They are specialists in digestive health and can provide further evaluation and treatment if needed. In the meantime, I want you to avoid alcohol completely and eat a healthy diet. Also, let me know if your symptoms worsen or if you develop any new ones, such as fever, severe abdominal pain, or changes in your stool or urine color. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Alright. No alcohol… healthy diet… and let you know if anything changes. I can do that. A gastroenterologist… that sounds… thorough. I appreciate you taking this seriously, Doctor. Will the results be sent to me, or do I need to call you? And… how long will it typically take to get them back? I just… I don't want to wait too long, if possible. The uncertainty is… unsettling. I apologize for being so anxious.
DOCTOR: You're not being anxious at all, Annelle. It's perfectly natural to want answers quickly. The results will be sent directly to me, and my office will contact you as soon as they’re available. Typically, blood test results come back within 2-3 business days, and the ultrasound results usually take a bit longer – about 3-5 business days. I understand the uncertainty is unsettling, and I will do everything I can to expedite the process. I’ll also have my nurse, Maria, contact you tomorrow to schedule your ultrasound appointment and answer any questions you may have. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, yellowing of the skin spreading rapidly, or significant changes in your stool or urine color, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now, or is there anything else I can do for you?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I appreciate your kindness. I suppose… I’ll just wait to hear from Maria tomorrow, then. And try not to worry too much. Though, that’s easier said than done. Thank you again for everything, Doctor Bacy. I truly appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Annelle. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns before then. And remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Take care, and I’ll see you soon. .
