DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I'm Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're with us today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it's about this…letter. For a pet, you see. A nice little thing, really. Not causing any trouble, I assure you. Honestly, all this paperwork… it’s just a formality, isn’t it? Some building or other needs it. I can't quite recall which building, now. It's… important though. For the pet.
DOCTOR: A…pet?
PATIENT: Yes, a pet. A small one. Look, is this really necessary? I mean, it's a perfectly healthy… creature. Not a bother to anyone. I just need the doctor to sign something to say so. It’s really quite simple, isn’t it? I don't understand why there's so much fuss. It’s not like I’m asking for a miracle, just a little piece of paper. Honestly, people these days…
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, with all due respect, this is a medical practice. We address human health concerns. Could you clarify what sort of documentation you are attempting to obtain, and why you believe a physician’s signature is required?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, isn’t that what doctors do these days? Sign things? For… animals? I thought that was standard. It’s for my… well, it’s a lizard. A lovely little gecko. And the apartment building… they require a vet’s note saying he's not a… hazard, I suppose. Something about exotic pets. Honestly, I don’t keep up with these things. They just handed me the form and said “Get it signed by a doctor.” It's a green one, if that helps. Very well-behaved.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I am a practitioner of family medicine. I treat people. Not reptiles. You require a veterinarian. Do you have a regular vet for your gecko?
PATIENT: A… a what? Oh, you mean like a doctor for animals? No, I don’t. Honestly, he seemed perfectly fine. I just got him last month, and he’s been eating and… well, gecko things. I didn't think he needed a doctor. He’s a lizard! Is it really necessary? I mean, I just need a signature. It can't be that complicated.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand you’re frustrated, but I cannot ethically or legally sign a document stating the health of an animal. That is outside of my scope of practice. I can, however, provide you with the contact information for several reputable veterinary practices in the area. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. All this trouble for a little gecko. Fine, yes, give me the numbers. But I still think it’s ridiculous. I mean, who needs a doctor for a lizard? Just… hurry up about it, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Here you are. Several local veterinary clinics. I suggest you contact them and schedule an appointment. They will be able to properly assess your gecko's health and provide the necessary documentation. Is there anything else I can assist you with today – pertaining to your health, of course?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Thank you. No, that's all. Honestly, all this fuss. I just wanted a simple signature. Don't bother calling me, I'll figure it out. .
