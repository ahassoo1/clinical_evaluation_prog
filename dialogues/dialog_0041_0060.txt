DOCTOR: Hi Blain, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Polczynski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thanks. It’s… nice to meet you too, I guess. Look, my family… they have a history. Lots of things, you know? My grandmother, then my aunt… it's always something. I just want to make sure I’m okay. I want reassurance, really. I don’t want to end up like them.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's smart to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history you're concerned about. Could you tell me a little more about what “something” was with your grandmother and aunt?
PATIENT: Ugh. It's complicated. My grandmother… she had heart problems, I think. Lots of chest pain, then… well, she just stopped. Suddenly. My aunt… that was cancer. Lung cancer. She smoked, obviously. Terrible habit. But still, it makes you worry. And honestly, I don't even know what kind of heart problems my grandmother had. No one really talked about it much. They just said "heart." It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. It's common for these things to not be discussed in detail, unfortunately. So, just to be clear, you're coming in because of concern about your family history and wanting to make sure you're healthy?
PATIENT: Exactly. I mean, I feel fine now. Perfectly fine. But that’s what they all say, right? Before… before things happen. I just want some tests, I suppose. Something to show me I’m not… doomed. Is that so much to ask? And honestly, I'd like to know if there's anything preventative I should be doing. I try to eat well, but you know, life gets in the way.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Blain. It’s very responsible of you to think about prevention. We can definitely run some tests to get a baseline and see how things are looking. And we can absolutely talk about preventative measures. Before we order anything, could you tell me a bit more about your current health?
PATIENT: Right. Okay. Well, I don’t really go to the doctor, to be honest. Not unless I’m actively sick. I had a physical a few years ago – for a job, I think – and everything was normal then. I exercise a little – mostly just walking. I used to be more active, but… divorce kind of took the wind out of my sails. I don’t smoke, never have. Drink occasionally – a glass of wine with dinner, maybe a beer on the weekend. Does that help? I'm pretty sure I'm up to date on all my shots, but… I honestly can’t remember.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. And you mentioned a divorce. I know that can be a really stressful time, and stress can impact your health. Have you been feeling particularly anxious or depressed since the divorce?
PATIENT: Look, I'm not here to talk about my personal life, okay? I just want to know if I’m going to drop dead of a heart attack like my grandmother. I can handle the divorce, I’m fine. It’s just… a thing that happened. I'm just being proactive about my health, like you said. Can we just get to the tests? I have things to do, you know? My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Of course, Blain. I apologize if I overstepped. You're right to set boundaries, and we can absolutely focus on your health concerns. I just ask those questions because mental and physical health are connected, but it’s your choice to share that information. Let's talk about the tests. Given your family history, a basic blood panel to check cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function would be a good starting point. We could also do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… reasonable, I guess. Blood work and… the heart thing. Is it painful? Honestly, I hate needles. And I don't like being stuck in a room with machines. I get claustrophobic. Just… make it quick, okay? I’m not thrilled about this whole process. Will the results take long? I need to know if I should be… worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns. The blood work is just a small prick, and we can get it done quickly. As for the EKG, it’s completely painless. It involves placing some sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs – no needles involved at all. It doesn’t take long, maybe 5-10 minutes, and you’ll be lying down comfortably. We’ll make sure you’re comfortable. The results usually take a few days to come back, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they’re available. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. A few days is… acceptable. No needles, you said? And I can lie down? Alright. Just… let’s get it over with. Where do we start? And can I have a glass of water afterwards? I always get a little lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll start with the blood work, then move on to the EKG. The phlebotomist is just down the hall, and she's very good. After the blood work, we'll come back here for the EKG. And yes, absolutely, I’ll make sure you have a glass of water afterwards. Come with me, and I'll introduce you to her.
PATIENT: Honestly, the hassle… I just want to know if I’m going to be okay. Is that too much to ask? .
