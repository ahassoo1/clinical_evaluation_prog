DOCTOR: Good afternoon. I’m Dr. Memmolo. So, Ms. Pitzel, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to put it simply, I’m hoping for a bit of a… a fresh start, really. I feel like I need to jumpstart my health. I’m not sure exactly how to do that, but that’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: A "fresh start," alright. And how long have you been feeling this… need for a "jumpstart," Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It hasn’t been sudden. Probably… the last six months, maybe? It’s not that I feel terribly ill, you understand. Just… sluggish. Less energy than I used to have, and not really enjoying things as much. It’s hard to explain. It’s like a dimmer switch on my overall… vitality, and it’s been turned down a bit.
DOCTOR: Sluggish, you say. And you haven’t noticed any specific symptoms accompanying this… lack of vitality?
PATIENT: Specific symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Not really anything major. Sometimes a bit of trouble sleeping, waking up feeling not quite rested. And I’ve noticed my appetite isn’t what it used to be, though I haven’t lost any weight, not that I’ve noticed. I do get a little achy sometimes, mostly in my lower back, but I always attributed that to my work. I’m a molder, you see, so I’m on my feet a lot. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: A molder... right. And this back pain – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Doctor. It’s worse after a long day at the workshop, naturally. When I’m sitting for too long, it’ll bother me. But it’s not a sharp pain, it’s more of a dull ache, a stiffness, really. It’s manageable, usually with a warm bath or a bit of stretching. It hasn’t kept me from working, I should clarify. I just… thought it was part of the job.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, just to get a fuller picture, have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh… my. Well, that's a bit personal, isn't it? Let me see… not really, no. Everything seems… regular, if you’ll excuse me for saying so. No major changes there. I apologize for the bluntness, but I’m not one for dwelling on such things. Is that the sort of thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: It is important. Alright, good. Now, what about any fever, chills, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: No fever, chills, or night sweats. And as I mentioned before, no weight loss that I'm aware of. I haven't been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. I'm… fairly consistent in size. I eat when I'm hungry, I sleep when I'm tired. It’s just that I don’t feel… thriving, if you understand. More like… existing. And I want more than just existing, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I haven't had any major illnesses, thankfully. No serious surgeries. I had the usual childhood vaccinations, of course. My blood pressure is usually a little high, but my doctor back home kept it managed with a small medication, though I haven’t been to see a doctor regularly since moving here six months ago. And my husband, bless his heart, keeps telling me I should be more diligent. He worries. I have Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: And what medication were you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it was a small white pill. I’m so sorry, I’m really not good with names. I believe it started with an “A”? Amlodipine, perhaps? Yes, that sounds right. Amlodipine. A small dose, five milligrams, I think. I stopped taking it when I moved and didn't immediately find a new doctor. I didn't want to run out mid-course and then be unable to get a refill. Perhaps that wasn’t the wisest decision.
DOCTOR: Perhaps not. Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've always been able to eat whatever I want, thankfully. No reactions to any medications in the past. I can wear gold jewelry without any issue, if that's helpful. No rashes, no swelling, nothing like that. I really haven’t had any trouble along those lines, Doctor. I'm quite fortunate, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And lastly, regarding your family history – any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had some trouble with her heart when she was older, but she lived to be eighty-seven, so it wasn’t too bad. My father… he had diabetes, I believe. Type 2, I think. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had arthritis. That’s about all I can recall, truthfully. My family wasn't really one for discussing illnesses. It was considered… impolite, perhaps. Is that helpful? I apologize if it's not much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's do a quick physical exam, then we can discuss some potential next steps. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, go right ahead. I’m ready whenever you are. I trust your judgment completely.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please sit back and relax… First, I’m going to listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Not overly concerning at this point, but we will need to keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Take a deep breath for me… and again… Good. Blood pressure is elevated - 148 over 92. Ears are clear, throat is normal. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Alright, well that's all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Oh dear. That doesn't surprise me, unfortunately. I’ve always been a bit anxious, and I suspect that contributes. A murmur… that is a little concerning, isn't it? I appreciate you being thorough, Doctor. What does all this mean? And what would you suggest as next steps? I’m really hoping we can get this sorted out, and get me feeling like myself again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel, your blood pressure is elevated, and the murmur, while likely benign, does warrant further investigation. Given your history of hypertension and the new murmur, I recommend an EKG to assess your heart rhythm and rule out any underlying cardiac issues. We should also order a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte balance, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. Additionally, given your fatigue and lack of energy, a complete blood count would be prudent to rule out any anemia or infection. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. Those all sound… sensible. If you think those tests are necessary, then I’m perfectly comfortable with them. I want to understand what’s going on, and I trust your expertise. An EKG, a metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a blood count… you've certainly thought of everything. Where would I go to have these tests done? And… will they be covered by Medicare? I apologize for asking about the insurance, but it’s always in the back of my mind.
DOCTOR: They will be covered by Medicare, yes. You can have them done at the lab just down the hall – room 102. They’re open until 5 PM today. They’ll send the results directly to me. Once I have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I'd suggest trying to incorporate some light exercise into your daily routine, if you're able, and focusing on a healthy diet. Also, consider monitoring your blood pressure at home, if you have access to a monitor. That can give us a better understanding of how it fluctuates throughout the day. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A home monitor… that might be a good idea. My husband has one, I believe. I’ll have to ask him. Light exercise… yes, I suppose I could manage that. I do enjoy gardening, though it’s been rather hot lately. I suppose my only question is… how long will it take to get the results back? And should I be worried? I know you can’t give me a diagnosis without seeing the results, but is this something I should be very concerned about? I apologize for pressing, Doctor, but my imagination tends to run wild.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pitzel, I understand your anxiety, and it’s perfectly normal to be worried. The results should be back within 3-5 business days. As for whether you should be concerned, it’s important to remain calm. Elevated blood pressure and a murmur can have various causes, and many are easily managed. We’re simply being thorough to rule out anything serious. I wouldn’t want you to worry unnecessarily, but it is best to address these issues promptly. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… reassuring, thank you, Doctor. Chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness… I’ll remember that. 3-5 business days… I can wait that long. It’s good to have a plan, and to know what to look out for. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly, and for not dismissing my concerns. I feel much better now, knowing we’re taking this seriously. Thank you again, Doctor Memmolo. I’ll go down to the lab right away.
