DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s been… persistent enough that I thought it best to get it checked out. It’s mostly in my left leg, though sometimes it seems to creep into my foot.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in the left leg, sometimes extending to the foot. I see. And how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, I believe, around the beginning of June. So, roughly two months now, give or take a few days. It wasn’t constant at first, just… occasional tingling. But it’s become more frequent and, well, more noticeable as time’s gone on.
DOCTOR: Right, starting in early June, intermittent tingling that’s progressed to more frequent and noticeable numbness. And would you describe the numbness as constant now, or does it still come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly constant now, yes. There are brief periods – perhaps when I’m actively focusing on something, or if I’m walking – where I don’t notice it as much. But generally, there’s a dullness, a sort of… absence of feeling, especially if I’m sitting or lying down for a while. It's not painful, though. Just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly constant, worse with sitting or lying down, not painful, just unsettling. Do you notice anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Movement, I think, helps. Walking, stretching… even just shifting my weight around in my chair. It doesn’t eliminate the numbness, but it seems to lessen it temporarily. And… being distracted, perhaps? When I’m really engaged in my work – animating, or working on special effects – I tend to forget about it for a while. It’s not a cure, of course, but it does provide some relief.
DOCTOR: Alright. Movement and distraction seem to offer some temporary relief. Now, can you describe the type of numbness?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. It’s not like a complete loss of feeling, if that makes sense. It’s more like… a dulling. And sometimes, there’s a tingling sensation mixed in, like pins and needles. Not sharp, but… present. And occasionally, it feels… cold? Even though my leg isn’t actually cold to the touch. It's a strange combination of sensations, really. Hard to put into words. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. Dullness, tingling like pins and needles, and occasionally a sensation of coldness. Now, have you noticed any weakness in your left leg?
PATIENT: Weakness… that’s something I have been wondering about, actually. It’s subtle. I haven't tripped or anything, and I can walk normally. But I do find myself… consciously thinking about lifting my left leg when I climb stairs, or getting out of a chair. Like I need to make a bit more of an effort than I do with my right leg. It’s not a dramatic difference, but I've noticed it. Perhaps that’s just me being overly aware of things now, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, subtle weakness noted – more effort needed for stairs or getting out of a chair. We'll look into that further. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you had any prior injuries to your back, hip, or leg?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I was fairly active growing up – some minor sports injuries, sprained ankles and such – but nothing significant. And I haven’t had any major falls or accidents. I’ve always been quite careful, to be honest. I do spend a lot of time sitting while working, of course, but I try to take breaks and stretch regularly. I haven’t had any surgeries or anything of that nature, either. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: No, just ruling things out. And how about your past medical history – any other conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing that I'm aware of. I haven't been diagnosed with anything. I get annual check-ups with my primary care physician, and everything has always come back normal. I do have slightly high cholesterol, which I'm monitoring with diet and exercise, but that’s it. And no allergies that I know of. I’m generally quite healthy, I believe. Or, was generally healthy, before this leg issue started, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly elevated cholesterol, managed with diet and exercise, otherwise healthy. No allergies. I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright. Just to assess your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I'm hoping we can figure out what’s causing this.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit here for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Is there anything specific I need to do?
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your legs, and I’ll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are… slightly diminished on your left side, compared to your right. Not significantly, but noticeable. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you press your legs down against my hands?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just let me know if you need me to adjust anything. I’m doing my best to push as hard as I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your strength is… slightly weaker in your left leg, as you mentioned. It’s subtle, but present. And now, I'm going to check your sensation. Can you close your eyes for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know what you’d like me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m going to lightly touch different spots on your legs. Just say “yes” when you feel the sensation. Alright. Your sensation seems… slightly decreased in your left leg, particularly in the outer aspect. It's not a complete loss of feeling, but definitely less sensitive than your right. Okay, thank you. That was helpful.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you for the thorough examination, Doctor. That all sounds… concerning, though not entirely surprising, given what I’ve been experiencing. What are your initial thoughts? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some nerve compression or irritation in your lower back or leg. The diminished reflexes, slight weakness, and decreased sensation are consistent with that. It could be something like sciatica, or potentially another nerve issue. However, it’s too early to say definitively without further investigation. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some imaging – an MRI of your lower back would be the most helpful. This will allow us to visualize the nerves and see if there’s any compression or inflammation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. An MRI sounds like a good idea. I'd like to know what’s going on, and if there’s something causing this, I’d like to address it as soon as possible. So, yes, please, let’s proceed with the MRI. What do I need to do to schedule that? And is there anything I should do in the meantime – anything I should avoid doing, or anything I should be doing?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'll write you a referral for an MRI at the imaging center across the street - they have availability next week. The receptionist will schedule that for you. In the meantime, avoid any activities that significantly worsen your symptoms. Gentle stretching and walking are okay, as long as they don’t cause increased pain or numbness. You can continue to take over-the-counter pain relievers if needed, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, but please follow the dosage instructions on the label. I'm also going to order some blood work, just to rule out any other potential causes. We'll check your vitamin B12 levels, as a deficiency can sometimes cause nerve symptoms. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds very clear, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. Blood work and the MRI… avoiding activities that worsen the symptoms, and continuing gentle stretching. I think I have that covered. I do have one question, though. What are the chances this could be… something serious? Is it possible it’s something more than just nerve compression? I don’t want to alarm you, but I’m a little anxious about the uncertainty.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, and it’s good you're asking. While it could be something more serious, it’s less likely based on your history and the physical exam. Most cases of nerve compression are due to a herniated disc or spinal stenosis, and are treatable with conservative measures – physical therapy, pain management, and sometimes injections. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities, which is why we're doing the MRI and blood work. We need to be thorough. Less common, but we’ll rule it out, are things like tumors or infections. But, as I said, those are less common, and we're taking all the necessary steps to get you a definitive diagnosis. The MRI will provide a much clearer picture, and we can discuss the results and develop a treatment plan once we have them. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: That’s… very reassuring, Doctor. Thank you. Knowing we’re ruling things out and that most cases are treatable does ease my mind considerably. No, I believe that answers all my questions for now. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly and thoroughly. So, I should follow up with the receptionist to schedule the MRI and blood work?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. The receptionist will schedule those for you before you leave. Once the results are back, they will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss them. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – if you experience any severe pain, weakness, or changes in bowel or bladder function – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so, Doctor. You've covered everything very thoroughly. Thank you again for your time and attention. I appreciate your reassurance and your clear explanation of the next steps. I’ll follow up with the receptionist now. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: .
