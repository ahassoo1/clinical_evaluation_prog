DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. Or… is it Percell?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor Fazzina. Percell is fine, please. It’s good to meet you. I appreciate you seeing me.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Percell. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve been getting these headaches. Right in the back of my head, at the base of my skull. They come and go, but they’ve been… more frequent lately, if that makes sense. Not terrible pain, just… annoying. And a little worrying, you know? Being my age and all.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Frequent headaches are certainly something we should look into, especially with a change in pattern. Annoying is a good way to put it… and it's always wise to be proactive. Can you tell me a little more about these headaches?
PATIENT: Sure. Hmm… they don't usually come on with anything specific. Not after a lot of work or stress, not after eating something… just there. Sometimes they're a dull ache, like a tight band around my head. Other times it's more of a sharp, quick pain, but it doesn't last long. They seem worse in the evenings, if I’m sitting for a long time. Does that make sense? I try to remember the details, you see. It’s important to be precise.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Percell, thank you. It sounds like there’s some variation there, which is good to know. And it’s perfectly alright if recalling specifics isn't easy. We'll get there. You mentioned they seem worse in the evenings when sitting for a long time. Does anything relieve them?
PATIENT: Well, honestly? Not much. Sometimes, if I get up and walk around, it helps a little. Or if I just… move my neck, you know? Stretch it out. But it's temporary. And I’ve tried those over-the-counter pain relievers, the ibuprofen and stuff, but they don’t seem to do much either. I don't like taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it. My wife… my ex-wife, actually… always said I was too stubborn to take medicine.
DOCTOR: I understand. Avoiding medication when possible is sensible. Alright, Percell. Just to get a better picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no dizziness. No problems with my vision, thankfully. Sometimes… sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, especially in the mornings. But I figured that’s just old age catching up with me. And no numbness or tingling anywhere. I have been a little more tired lately, but I chalked that up to… well, to getting older, too. It’s hard to say what’s normal at my age, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It can be difficult to sort things out. Alright, Percell, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your reflexes, your range of motion, and things like that. It’ll help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. I’ve had plenty of that in my life. Just let me know if it's going to be… unpleasant. Old bones aren't as forgiving as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I’ll be gentle. Alright, let’s start by checking your blood pressure. And then we’ll do a quick neurological exam… just some simple tests to check your reflexes and coordination. Then I'll take a look at your neck. If you could just relax your arm for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. No problem. I always get a little nervous around medical equipment. Not that I don’t trust you, Doctor. It’s just… bad memories, I suppose. Being in the service, you know? Lots of strange machines and hurried people. But go ahead, I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m just listening to the blood flow in your head and neck. Everything sounds… normal so far. Now, if you could just follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head. Look to the left… look to the right… look up… look down. Good. And let me just check your pupils. Everything appears symmetrical. Now, I’m just gently feeling your neck. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little… creaky, I guess. Like an old door hinge. But no sharp pain or anything. It feels… normal for an old man. I used to be a farmer, you know. Lots of bending and twisting. Probably did a number on my neck. Is everything alright so far, Doctor? You’re not looking too worried, are you?
DOCTOR: No, everything appears normal so far, Percell. But I do notice some mild stiffness in your neck, as you mentioned. And given your age and the recent increase in headaches, I'd like to order a few simple tests just to rule out anything serious. I’m thinking a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an X-ray of your cervical spine. The X-ray will help us see if there's any arthritis or other structural issues in your neck that could be contributing to your headaches. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will help figure things out, I'm all for it. I don’t want to worry needlessly, but I also don't want to ignore anything. X-rays, blood tests… whatever you think is best, Doctor. Will the blood tests take a lot of blood? I’ve always been a little squeamish around needles, you see. And where will I get the X-ray done? Is it here at the clinic?
DOCTOR: No, it won’t be a lot of blood, Percell. Just a few vials. And we have a very gentle phlebotomist here at the clinic. She’s excellent at minimizing discomfort. And for the X-ray, we’ll send you over to the imaging center across the street. It’s just a short walk. We'll give you a requisition form. They’re very efficient over there, and the technician will explain everything to you. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and then I'll give you the X-ray requisition. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I’m always a little nervous coming to the doctor, but you’ve made this much easier. Lead the way, I suppose. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Of course, Percell. That's what I'm here for. Let me just call the nurse, and she’ll get you set up for the blood draw. It will just take a few minutes. Yes, could you please come in and draw some blood for Mr. Gibbel?
PATIENT: Okay, perfect. I'll just sit here and… try not to think about needles. You have a nice office, Doctor. Very… calming. It helps with the nerves.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Percell. I try to make it as comfortable as possible. It's important to create a relaxing environment. Sometimes, the simplest things can make a difference. Nurse Anya, this is Mr. Gibbel. He’s here for a blood draw. Nurse Anya is very skilled, Percell. She'll take good care of you.
PATIENT: Alright. Well, let's get it over with then. The sooner it's done, the better, right? Just try to be gentle. And tell me if I look pale. I've been known to faint around medical instruments.
