DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Marquie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Yeah, it's nice to meet you too. It’s… my breathing. It's been kinda short lately. Like, I get winded really easily. Honestly, it's hard to explain. It just is short of breath, you know? It's been going on for a bit, but it feels worse now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Short of breath” is a good way to put it. And you said it’s been going on for a bit, but has gotten worse recently. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start exactly? That’s tough. A few weeks, maybe? It was just a little bit at first, like after climbing stairs. But now... now it's happening when I'm just walking around, even. Like, doing normal stuff. It's kinda scary, to be honest. My wife keeps telling me to come in, and… well, here I am. I don’t really remember anything specific starting it, it just… gradually got worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been a gradual onset over a few weeks, and it’s progressing – happening with less exertion now. That's good information. When you say “normal stuff”, can you give me some examples of activities that now bring on the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. Okay… walking from the kitchen to the living room, definitely. Even talking sometimes, if I get a little excited or… stressed. Just yesterday, I was trying to help my son with his bike, and I had to stop like three times to catch my breath. It’s… embarrassing, honestly. I used to be able to do all that stuff without even thinking about it. And... gardening. I love gardening, but I can’t do it for long anymore. It's just too much. Little things, you know? That's what's weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like even minimal exertion is causing shortness of breath now. And it’s impacting your daily activities - things you enjoy like gardening and playing with your son. Have you noticed anything else along with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really… I guess… sometimes my chest feels a little tight. Not all the time, but when I'm really short of breath. And… I’ve been coughing a little more, maybe? It's not a bad cough, just… a tickle in my throat. I haven’t really paid much attention to it, to be honest. I don’t know if that’s important or not.
DOCTOR: That is important, Marquie. The chest tightness and increased cough are definitely things we need to consider. Can you describe the cough for me?
PATIENT: Okay… it’s not a… a hacking cough, you know? More like… dry. Just a little tickle that makes me wanna clear my throat. It happens mostly when I’m lying down, I think. And… sometimes it brings up a little bit of… something. Clear stuff, mostly. Not much, though. Like I said, it's not a big cough. I haven’t really been keeping track of it, I'm sorry. I don't really pay attention to these things. My wife is the one who notices everything.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Marquie. It's perfectly normal to not keep track of these things. It's helpful that you're telling me about it now. Okay, a dry cough, mostly when lying down, with a little bit of clear mucus. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. Definitely no night sweats. I get hot sometimes, but that’s just… Florida weather, you know? It’s always hot here. I haven't felt sick, just… tired. And short of breath. Like I'm always trying to catch up. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or night sweats. Just fatigue and shortness of breath. Now, let's go through some other things to get a better picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, COPD, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don’t think so. I've never been to a lung doctor or anything. I mean, I’ve had colds and stuff, like everyone, but nothing serious. No asthma as a kid, no COPD… I don’t even know what that is, to be honest. I’ve always been pretty healthy, I thought. Or at least, I haven't had any problems with my lungs before this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior lung problems. What about heart problems?
PATIENT: Uh… my father… he had some heart trouble when he was older. Something with his valves, I think. He had surgery for it, a long time ago. But… I've never had any problems myself. I’ve had my blood pressure checked, and it's always been okay. I think. I don’t really pay attention to those things. My wife handles all the doctor stuff. Does that mean I could have something wrong with my heart?
DOCTOR: Okay, your father had valve issues – that's good to know. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have something wrong with your heart, but it's something we should consider. Now, have you ever had any blood clots, like in your legs or lungs?
PATIENT: No, no blood clots. Never. I haven’t been in the hospital for anything serious, ever. I mean, I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was it. Nothing like blood clots. I’m pretty active, you know? I work outside a lot, checking on the water systems. I feel like if I had a blood clot, I’d know about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of blood clots. And you work outdoors, which is good. Now, let's talk about smoking. Have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah. I used to. Not a lot, but… I smoked for about ten years, when I was younger. I quit about fifteen years ago, though. Haven't touched a cigarette since. It was a bad habit. I’m glad I stopped. Does that matter? I thought it was so long ago, it wouldn’t make a difference.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Marquie, thank you for being honest. Even if it was a long time ago, smoking can still have effects on your lungs. Okay, so you smoked for ten years, and you quit fifteen years ago. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Yeah, I drink a little. Mostly beer, on the weekends. A couple of beers with my friends, or with dinner sometimes. Nothing crazy, you know? I don’t drink every day, and I don’t get drunk. Just… a little bit to relax. My wife doesn't really drink, so it's not like I'm drinking a lot. A couple on Saturday, maybe. Is that… bad? I don’t think so, but I don’t really know much about this stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of beers on weekends – that's good to know. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. I don’t take anything regularly. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, if I get one. And I take a multivitamin, sometimes. But that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, nothing for a long-term condition. I try to stay healthy, you know? I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. That’s about it. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, just ibuprofen occasionally and a multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. No bee stings, no rashes… My wife always asks me that, and I always say no. I think I’d know if I was allergic to something, right? No allergies, as far as I’m aware. Nothing serious, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright Marquie, that was a lot of information, thank you. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and maybe take your temperature. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? The sooner the better. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not drastically so. I’m listening to your heart now… I hear a slight murmur, which we’ll need to investigate further. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Okay, your breath sounds are a little diminished, and I’m hearing some mild wheezing in both lungs. Finally, I’ll check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low. So, to summarise, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, I hear a faint murmur, your breath sounds are diminished with some wheezing, and your oxygen saturation is a little low. These findings warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Wheezing? Low oxygen? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? Is it my heart? You said murmur… I don’t understand. Is something really wrong? Is this bad? I just want to be able to breathe again.
DOCTOR: Okay, Marquie, let's take a deep breath. It's good that we're getting some information now, and it doesn’t necessarily mean it's something terrible. The wheezing suggests there might be some narrowing in your airways, potentially due to inflammation or some obstruction. The low oxygen saturation means your body isn't getting enough oxygen, which could be related to the wheezing, or other factors. The murmur I heard could be a harmless “innocent” murmur, but we need to investigate it further to be sure. It's too early to say definitively what's going on. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to look at your lungs, and an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity. We'll also do a blood test to check your oxygen levels and rule out any infections. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… EKG… blood tests… okay. Yeah, yeah, that sounds… okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s happening. Will the tests tell me what’s wrong? Will they tell me if it’s serious? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have work… and my wife… she’s probably worried sick already.
DOCTOR: The tests will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on, yes. The chest X-ray will help us identify any abnormalities in your lungs, like inflammation, fluid, or obstruction. The EKG will assess your heart's rhythm and look for any signs of problems. The blood tests will give us information about your oxygen levels, and rule out any infections. The results usually take a few hours to come back, and I'll review them as soon as they’re available. Once I have the results, I’ll call you immediately to discuss them and explain everything in detail. In the meantime, I’ll write you a prescription for a bronchodilator inhaler. This will help to open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. It's not a long-term solution, but it should provide some relief while we wait for the test results. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Inhaler… okay, that sounds good. Anything to help me breathe. So, I just need to go get the inhaler, and then wait for you to call? And you’ll explain everything when I get the results? My wife… can she come with me when I get the results? I think… I think I’m going to need someone with me.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. You just need to get the inhaler from the pharmacy, and then we’ll wait for the test results. Once they’re back, I’ll call you immediately. And absolutely, your wife is more than welcome to come with you when you get the results. Having someone with you for support is a great idea. I encourage it. I'll also give you a note for work, explaining that you're undergoing some medical evaluation and may need to take some time off. Here's the prescription for the inhaler, and here's the note for your employer. Do you have any questions for me right now before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. Really. Thank you for listening, and for… not making me feel like I’m crazy. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And… I’ll wait for your call. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marquie. Don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms before I get a chance to call you. Take care, and I'll be in touch soon.
