DOCTOR: Good morning, Darl. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Dr. Bombara, you say? Lovely name. Hmm… what brought me in… now let me think. It’s about… the blood. Yes, the blood! I need to know… what kind it is. Something about needing to know for… well, I can’t quite recall why exactly. It's important, though. My… my husband used to say so.
DOCTOR: Alright, understanding your blood type is certainly important. It’s good you’re thinking about this. Just to be clear, are you needing to know this for a specific upcoming procedure, or is this more of a general health question?
PATIENT: Oh, no procedure, dear, not that I know of. It’s just… a good thing to have on file, isn't it? Like knowing your address, or… or your favorite color. Important information. I suppose it's for… emergencies. Yes, that must be it. Emergencies. Though I can't remember what kind of emergency. Old age, you know? It fogs things up. Is that alright? Am I explaining myself properly?
DOCTOR: You’re explaining yourself perfectly, Darl. It is good to have that information available, absolutely. And it's very common for memories to be a little hazy as we get older. No need to worry about that at all. So, to confirm, you'd like to have your blood type determined, primarily as a precaution for potential emergencies?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely! That's it exactly. A precaution. For… things. You know. It's just sensible, isn’t it? My husband, bless his soul, he was always very sensible. He’d have a list for everything. I wish I could remember… what was on those lists. But the blood type… that’s the important part right now. Will it hurt? I don't like needles much, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s very sensible to be prepared, and I understand your concern about needles. The blood draw itself is quite quick – just a little pinch, really. We’ll use a small needle, and I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is very gentle. I’m checking your chart now to see if we have any recent blood type results on file… Hmm, it appears we don’t have a record of your blood type here. So, we'll need to do a simple blood test. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, well, that's perfectly alright. No records, you say? I wouldn't be surprised. I’ve moved about a bit in my life, you see. Spain, mostly. Wonderful country. But yes, a blood test is fine. As long as it's quick, and… not too deep. And the phlebotomist is gentle, you said? That’s good. Very good. Tell me, will I need to fast beforehand? I had a lovely breakfast this morning. Manchego cheese, mostly.
DOCTOR: Manchego cheese sounds lovely! No, you don't need to fast for a basic blood type test. You can eat as usual. And yes, I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is very gentle. Let's get you set up. I’ll just step out and ask Maria to come in and draw your blood. It will only take a few minutes. Afterwards, we can discuss the results and ensure they are documented in your file. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good indeed. Maria, you say? A good name. I do hope she’s gentle with the needle. I always feel a bit faint, you know. But a few minutes, you say? That's not so bad. Yes, let's get it done. Thank you, dear. You're very kind. And tell Maria… thank you in advance. For being gentle, of course.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Darl. I'll make sure Maria knows. She’s excellent. I’ll let her know to be extra careful. I’ll be right back in a few moments. Just relax, and we’ll get this taken care of quickly. “Maria, could you please come to exam room three for a blood type determination?
PATIENT: Alright, I shall. I'll just sit here, then. And… try to think of my husband’s name. It's on the tip of my tongue! He always knew what to do in these situations. Such a practical man. Though… I can't quite remember what he did. Oh dear. This getting old is a terrible business. But the blood test is a good idea, yes? A very good idea. I'm glad you suggested it.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s a very good idea, and you’re doing a wonderful thing by taking care of your health. Don’t worry about remembering names right now. We’ll focus on getting the blood test done, and we can take things one step at a time. Maria will be with you in just a moment.
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Are you Maria? Lovely to meet you. I do hope you have a steady hand. I'm not terribly fond of needles, you see. But I understand it’s necessary. Yes, necessary. Just… be gentle, won’t you? And… perhaps tell me a story while you work? Anything to take my mind off it. Though I can’t promise I’ll remember it afterward. Old age, you know. It’s a terrible thing. But you seem very competent. Yes, very competent indeed.
DOCTOR: “She’s a little anxious about needles, and her memory isn’t the best, so gentle technique is especially important.” Maria is excellent, and I’m sure she’ll take wonderful care of you. She’s very skilled at making people comfortable. Perhaps you two can chat while she draws the blood. It will help take your mind off things. I’ll just be nearby if you need anything. “Go ahead whenever you’re ready.”
PATIENT: Oh, lovely. A chat would be nice. What do people chat about these days? I used to love discussing politics with my husband. He was very opinionated, you see. And gardening. He grew the most beautiful roses. Though I can't remember what color they were. Red, perhaps? Or maybe yellow. Oh dear, this memory… it's like trying to catch smoke. But yes, chatting is a good idea. It distracts. Distracts from… the pinch. Do you like roses, dear? The one drawing the blood, I mean. Do you like roses?
DOCTOR: “I do love roses, actually! My grandmother had a beautiful rose garden. She taught me all about pruning and caring for them. What about you, Darl?
PATIENT: Oh! A grandmother! That’s lovely. My grandmother… she was a seamstress, you see. She made the most beautiful dresses. Silk and lace. And… and ribbons. Yes, ribbons! I remember the ribbons. Though I can't recall what color they were. Perhaps blue? Or maybe… no, that can't be right. My husband always said I had a terrible memory for colors. He used to tease me about it, bless his soul. What was his name, now…? Oh dear. It's right on the tip of my tongue. He was… a good man. A very good man. Did your grandmother make anything special? Anything you remember fondly? It's nice to talk about grandmothers. They always have the best stories, don't they?
DOCTOR: “She made me a quilt when I was a little girl. It was patchwork, with all sorts of colorful squares. I still have it, and I use it all the time. It reminds me of her whenever I see it. And you said your husband teased you about your memory?
PATIENT: A quilt! How lovely. Patchwork… yes, I think my grandmother made a patchwork cushion once. Or maybe it was a tablecloth. Oh dear, this memory… it’s like trying to hold water in my hands. He did tease me, you see. About everything, really. But it was a loving tease. He used to say I lived in a dream. That I wasn't paying attention. And… and he was right, wasn't he? I do have a tendency to… drift off. But it wasn’t a bad thing, really. It just… meant I saw the world differently. He said I was a romantic. What did your grandmother say about you? Did she have any special sayings? Oh, this is nice. Talking about grandmothers. It’s much nicer than thinking about needles. Are we nearly finished now? I do hope I haven't been too much trouble.
DOCTOR: "You haven’t been any trouble at all, Darl. And my grandmother used to say, ‘A kind heart is the most beautiful thing a person can possess.’ She was a very wise woman. And… almost finished! Just a few more seconds." “All done! Just apply a little pressure for a few minutes, and you should be all set.”
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! All finished. That wasn't so bad, was it? Though I don’t think I’ll be volunteering for any more needle pricks anytime soon. A kind heart, you say? Yes, that’s a lovely saying. My husband always said… well, I can’t quite recall what he said. But it was something nice, I’m sure of it. He always had a way with words. Just applying pressure… yes, I’m doing that. It feels a little… pinpricky. But not too bad. Thank you, dear. You were very gentle. And you remind me of my niece. She’s a lovely girl. Though I can’t remember her name right now. Old age, you know. It’s a terrible business. Is the blood… is it going to be alright? Will they be able to tell what kind it is? It's important, you see. For… emergencies. But what emergencies… oh dear. I do hope I’m not rambling. I tend to do that.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Darl. And you did wonderfully. The blood will be just fine. The lab will analyze it and determine your blood type. It’s a routine test, and it shouldn’t take long to get the results. We’ll have them documented in your file shortly. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little pinpricky afterward, and you did a fantastic job holding still. Maria and I are just glad we could help. Do you feel steady on your feet?
PATIENT: Steady… yes, I think so. A little… wobbly, perhaps. But not too bad. It’s just… all this talk about memories… it’s exhausting, you know? Like trying to chase butterflies. But thank you. For being patient with me. And for the kind words. I do appreciate it. It’s nice to feel… cared for. Though I can't recall why I needed to know my blood type in the first place. But never mind. It’s probably something important. My husband would have remembered. He always remembered everything. Do you have a husband, dear? If you do, you must tell him… tell him to cherish every moment. Because… because you never know when… well, you never know. And… is there anything I need to do now? Any special instructions? Or can I just… go home? I do hope I haven't taken up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: You haven't taken up any time at all, Darl. And you’re absolutely right – cherishing every moment is so important. I do have a husband, and I will certainly take your advice to heart. For now, just relax and take it easy for the rest of the day. Drink plenty of fluids, and if you feel any dizziness or unusual symptoms, please don't hesitate to call us. We’ll get the results back to you as soon as possible. I'll have the nurse print you a discharge sheet with these instructions. Do you have someone driving you home today?
PATIENT: Yes, my niece is driving me. The lovely one. Though I can't recall her name right now. She’s very good. Very responsible. She always makes sure I take my… my pills. Yes, my pills. For… well, never mind. It’s something important, I’m sure of it. Relax and take it easy… yes, that sounds nice. But I do have so much to do! So many things I need to… to remember. Oh dear. It’s like trying to untangle a ball of yarn. But thank you, dear. For everything. You've been very kind. And… please, tell your husband… tell him I said hello. Even though I don’t know him. It’s just… a nice gesture, isn’t it? A nice gesture. And… is there anything else? Any questions? Or can I just… go? I do hope I haven’t been too much trouble. Truly.
DOCTOR: You haven’t been any trouble at all, Darl. Not at all. And I will certainly tell my husband you said hello. That's a very kind gesture, and I appreciate it. No, there’s nothing else for now. Just relax and take care of yourself. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I'll have the nurse escort you to the front, and your niece is waiting. It was lovely meeting you, Darl. “Could you please escort Darl to the front?
