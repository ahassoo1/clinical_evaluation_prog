DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Ruocco. Welcome. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just… pain. When I breathe deep. It’s been… a little while now. Not sure how long, exactly. Things aren’t so clear these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain when you breathe deep. I understand. It’s alright if you’re not sure exactly how long it’s been. We'll figure it out together. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm. It's…sharp. Like a little poke, but inside. Not all the time, just when I really… fill up my lungs. It doesn’t go all the way around, more on this side. And it kinda makes me not want to take a big breath, you know? I try to just… take smaller ones.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Sharp pain on your left side when you take a deep breath, and you’ve been taking smaller breaths to avoid it. Okay. Does anything make the pain worse?
PATIENT: Worse…let me think. Walking uphill, maybe? Or… when I have to lift something heavy. Doing work, you know? I used to be a construction manager. Not so much anymore. It hurts more then. Not sure if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Ruocco. Pain with exertion is good information. And it sounds like it's affecting your ability to do things you used to do. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Other…symptoms? Let me see… I get a little…winded. Easier than it used to be, for sure. And sometimes…a little cough. Not a bad cough, just… a tickle. Mostly just when it's cold. I don’t think that’s related, though. Old man stuff, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some shortness of breath and a cough, especially when it's cold. It’s good you’re thinking about whether things are connected or not. We’ll look at everything. Now, have you ever had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital… Oh dear. That’s a long time ago. I think… when I was a boy, I had a bad fever. Very sick. But… after that? Not really. Maybe for my knee, once. Old work injury. Nothing… serious. I don't recall being in the hospital as an adult.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fever as a child and a knee injury. That's helpful. And, just to be thorough, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think… yes. My knee. When I hurt it at work. They fixed it up. That was… a long time ago. That’s the only one I can remember, for sure. Might have had something else when I was younger, but… it’s all a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. Knee surgery a long time ago. Now, thinking about your family – are there any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… That’s… difficult. I didn’t see much of my family growing up. Lots of… changes. My wife… she had… problems with her heart, I think. But that was a long time ago, before we… divorced. Not sure what else. I don't really know much about my parents’ health.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your wife had heart problems. That's good to know. And it's alright if you don't have a lot of information about your family history. We'll proceed with what we have. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Not really. I tried some pills for my knee a while back, but they didn’t help much, so I stopped. Mostly just… try to take it easy. Don't take much of anything, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Sometimes a little itchy when I’m around dust, but that’s just… dust. Nothing serious. I don't think I'm allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your lungs, heart, and check your breathing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. My back isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, Mr. Ruocco, your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the left side. I also hear some mild crackling sounds when you take a deep breath. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit faint. Your breathing rate is 22 breaths per minute, which is a little elevated. I'm going to gently palpate your chest to check for any tenderness. You are a little tender to the touch on the left side of your chest.
PATIENT: Tender… yes, that’s right. It hurts a little when you press there. Not bad, but… noticeable. Diminished…what does that mean, Doctor? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Diminished means the sound of your breathing is a little quieter on that side, Mr. Ruocco. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad, but it does tell me we need to investigate further. Given your history of pain when breathing, the tenderness, and the diminished sounds, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be something simple like a muscle strain, but it could also be something more like pneumonia, pleurisy, or even a small collapsed lung. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray. Would you be able to go to the imaging center today?
PATIENT: An X-ray… Oh dear. Is it… serious, Doctor? Collapsed lung… that sounds bad. I don’t… I don’t have insurance, you know. Will it be expensive? I’m on a fixed income.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Ruocco. A collapsed lung can be serious, but it’s not always the case, and we need the X-ray to know for sure what’s going on. We're just gathering information at this point. Regarding the cost, I know you don’t have insurance. Let me see what options are available. The clinic has a financial assistance program for patients who qualify, and I can also help you explore options for low-cost imaging centers in the area. We can also see if the imaging center offers a payment plan. I'll have my assistant, Sarah, look into that for you after this visit. For now, let’s focus on getting the X-ray done. It’s the best way to determine the cause of your pain and get you the right treatment. Would you be willing to go to the imaging center today, and we can sort out the financial details afterwards?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. I want to know what’s wrong, that’s for sure. But… please, Doctor, just try to keep the costs down, if you can. I don’t want to get into debt over this. And… tell Sarah to be as helpful as she can. I'm not good with all this paperwork.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I will do everything I can to minimize the costs and will work with Sarah to make the process as smooth as possible. I'll write you a referral for the X-ray now. The imaging center is located at 123 Main Street, and their phone number is 555-1212. They usually can accommodate patients quickly. I recommend going today if possible. Once you’ve had the X-ray, you can bring the results back to me, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity that worsens your pain. If the pain becomes severe, or you experience shortness of breath, fever, or any other concerning symptoms, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… thank you. For explaining things, and for trying to help with the costs. I appreciate it. I hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. I understand your anxiety, and we will do everything we can to figure out what's going on and get you feeling better. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Sarah will be in touch to discuss the financial assistance options. I’ll see you again once you have the X-ray results. Take care, and please, don’t hesitate to seek immediate medical attention if things worsen. .
