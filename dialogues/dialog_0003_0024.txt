DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I'm Dr. Yackey. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I need a letter, actually. A letter saying I’m able to fly. It’s for… well, for an airline. They need confirmation from a doctor before they’ll let me on a flight. It’s a bit frustrating, honestly, but here we are.
DOCTOR: A “fit to fly” letter. Right. While I understand your frustration, Ms. Sayar, these requests do require some medical basis. Simply stating you are able to fly isn’t… sufficient. Do you have any underlying medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. I understand. Sorry, I just… I just want to get this sorted. Um, let’s see. I lost my husband a little over a year ago, and it was… sudden. Heart condition. That’s why they’re asking, I think. I’m perfectly healthy myself, though. No conditions, no regular medication. Just… grieving, really. Does that make sense? Medicare covered everything after… after he passed, and they didn't find anything wrong with me during any of the check-ups.
DOCTOR: I see. A recent bereavement. And you’re requesting this letter solely because of the airline’s requirements following your husband’s cardiac event?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. They sent a form… a very official-looking form. It asks about pre-existing conditions, and I suppose because of my husband, they just need a doctor to sign off. I don’t have any conditions, but they won't take my word for it, apparently. It’s for a trip… a memorial trip, actually. To a place we always wanted to go. It’s… important.
DOCTOR: Hmm. While I appreciate the context, Ms. Sayar, a simple statement of health isn’t acceptable practice. I would need to perform a basic physical examination to document your current status. Blood pressure, pulse, auscultation of the heart and lungs… standard procedure. It's for your own wellbeing, naturally.
PATIENT: Oh. I… see. I was really hoping to avoid that, honestly. Is it absolutely necessary? I feel fine, truly. I’ve been walking every day, eating well… I just thought a signed letter saying I’m cleared would be enough. I'm not trying to be difficult, it's just… a bit stressful to think about tests and things. Is there anything else I can provide? Maybe records from Medicare?
DOCTOR: While I understand your apprehension, Ms. Sayar, performing a brief examination is a matter of due diligence, and frankly, professional responsibility. It’s not about doubting your self-assessment, it’s about ensuring there are no unforeseen complications during air travel. We can review your Medicare records, but that won’t negate the need for a current physical assessment. It will take only a few minutes. I need to hear your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure and pulse. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Okay… okay, fine. If it's really necessary. I just… I’m a little anxious about being poked and prodded. But if you say it’s the responsible thing to do… let’s get it over with. Where do I need to go? And roughly how long will it take? I have an appointment later this afternoon, and I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat on the table. It will be quite brief, perhaps five to ten minutes. We’ll start with your blood pressure, then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Afterwards, I’ll need to briefly examine your throat and ears, standard procedure. Nurse will be in shortly with the cuff. Do you smoke or use any recreational drugs, Ms. Sayar?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never have. And I rarely drink, honestly. Just… not my thing. I’m trying to be as healthy as possible, especially after everything. Five to ten minutes, you said? That’s… good. I appreciate you keeping it brief.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Nurse, please obtain Ms. Sayar's blood pressure. While the nurse does that, can you describe any recent changes in your energy levels, appetite, or sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Right. Well, my sleep… it’s still not great. I wake up a lot. Lots of dreams. And my appetite comes and goes, you know? Some days I eat everything in sight, other days I can barely manage a bite. Energy levels… they’re okay. I walk every morning, like I said, and that helps, but I do get tired easily. It's... a bit all over the place, to be honest. I'm trying, though. Really trying to get back to normal.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not concerning at this time. Now, if you’ll just take a deep breath for me… Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Please open your mouth, and say “ah.” Throat appears normal. No obvious signs of infection. Now, let me just check your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Overall, physical examination is unremarkable.
PATIENT: Okay… good. That’s… good to hear. So… does that mean I can get the letter? I really appreciate you not making a big fuss about it. It’s just… getting on that plane is important to me.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Sayar. I’ve documented my findings. This letter states you are cleared for air travel as of today’s date, August 2, 2025. However, please be aware that this is based on the examination performed today. Should your condition change, you should consult with your physician. I strongly recommend maintaining a healthy lifestyle – adequate sleep, regular exercise, and a balanced diet. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, thank you so much! That's perfect. Absolutely perfect. No, no, that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. I really appreciate your time and… and your patience. I think I’m all set. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a pleasant trip, Ms. Sayar. .
