DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Rowbottom, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Arbie Rowbottom. Though most folks just call me Arbie. And it’s pronounced Row-bottom, not Row-buttom. It’s a family name, you know. Been around a long time.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Family names. Look, I have several patients waiting, so if we could just get straight to why you’re here today, that would be helpful. What's been bothering you?
PATIENT: Well, alright then. Don’t need to be so rushed, do we? It’s… well, it’s my stool. Been seeing blood in it. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to make a fella concerned. And frankly, at my age, you don’t want to be seeing any blood where there shouldn't be.
DOCTOR: Blood in the stool. Right. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started, oh, maybe a month ago? Give or take. It comes and goes, you see. Not every time, thankfully. But enough to worry an old pilot, let me tell you. A man needs to know what’s going on with his insides, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: A month. And is it bright red blood, dark blood, or something else?
PATIENT: Bright red, mostly. Sometimes it’s just a streak, other times… well, a bit more noticeable. Not like a waterfall, mind you, but enough to change the color of the water, if you catch my drift. And it’s not like I've been eating beets or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, now, that’s a loaded question. An old man’s bowels are always changing, aren’t they? But… I suppose they have been a bit looser than usual lately. And I’ve had to go more often, yes. A bit of a nuisance, really. Always have to know where the nearest… facilities are, you understand.
DOCTOR: And any abdominal pain, cramping, or discomfort?
PATIENT: A little bit of cramping now and then. Nothing unbearable, mind you. Just a bit of a twinge, mostly after… well, after using the facilities. Not constant, though. I’ve flown through worse turbulence, let me tell you. But it’s there. And it's probably nothing, just getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever had a colonoscopy or any other screening tests for colon cancer?
PATIENT: Colonoscopy? Goodness, no. Never had much use for poking around in there. Doctors always wanting to stick things where they don't belong. Back in my day, we just toughed things out. Though, I suppose times change. And I'm not getting any younger, are I? But no, never had one of those… scopys, as you call 'em.
DOCTOR: Right. And any family history of colon cancer or other gastrointestinal issues?
PATIENT: Well, my Uncle Cecil... he had something. I can't rightly recall what it was, but it involved a lot of visits to the hospital and a rather unfortunate outcome. My mother always said it was “something to do with his insides”, which wasn’t very helpful. Didn’t pay much attention to it then, truth be told. I was too busy flying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Been taking a few things over the years, for this and that, but never had a reaction. Tough as nails, I always was. Though, I did have a bit of a rash once after eating some shellfish, but that was years ago and it wasn't that bad. Mostly just itched.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam then. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen and do a rectal exam. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Good heavens. Must you? Really? I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary… but I’m not a fan of doctors poking around down there. Still, if you insist… just try to be quick about it, would you? And perhaps warn me beforehand? A gentleman deserves a little preparation, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Please lie down on the table, face down. And yes, I will warn you before I proceed. But I assure you, it’s necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. I'm going to listen to your abdomen first. Please relax.
PATIENT: Relax, she says! Easy for you to say. Always poking and prodding. A man should be able to go through life without being examined like a… a specimen. Though, I suppose I’m getting old and everything falls apart eventually. Fine, fine. Do what you have to do. Just...be gentle.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant. No masses are palpable. Now, I’m going to need to perform a rectal exam. Please bend over. I'll let you know before I begin.
PATIENT: Tenderness, is it? Well, no wonder. A man’s insides aren’t meant to be poked and prodded! And now this. Very well. Get it over with, then. Quickly, if you please. This is… undignified. And do warn me, like you said. Don’t just… surprise me. Honestly, what is the point of all this fuss?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m going to gently insert my finger now. It may be slightly uncomfortable. Take a deep breath. I do detect some stool in the rectum, and I note a small amount of bright red blood on my finger. No palpable masses were felt. It's consistent with what you've described.
PATIENT: Blood, you say? Well, there you have it. What did I tell you? A man knows his own body. Though, I hardly needed you to tell me that, frankly. A small amount, you say? And no masses? That's… somewhat reassuring, I suppose. Still, what does it mean? Is it something serious? Are you going to give me a lecture about my diet now? I eat a perfectly good breakfast every morning, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Rowbottom, bright red blood in the stool can be caused by several things, from hemorrhoids to diverticulosis or even something more serious like colorectal cancer. At your age, we need to rule out the more serious possibilities. I’m going to recommend a colonoscopy. It’s the best way to visualize the entire colon and determine the source of the bleeding. And yes, we’ll discuss your diet. It’s important to maintain a healthy lifestyle, regardless of age. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy, you say? More poking and prodding? Honestly, what will they think of next? I suppose if you insist… but I still think it’s unnecessary fuss. And discussing my diet? I've lived to be 88 years old, haven't I? My diet clearly isn’t killing me. What will this colonoscopy involve? Will I need to… prepare? And how long will I be laid up for? I have things to do, you know. A man can't just spend his days lying around having procedures. And will it be… painful?
DOCTOR: Yes, there is preparation involved. You’ll need to clear your bowels completely the day before the procedure with a special laxative solution. It’s not pleasant, I’ll admit, but it’s essential for a clear visualization. The procedure itself is performed under sedation, so you shouldn’t feel any pain. You’ll be monitored closely throughout the entire process. It typically takes about 30-60 minutes. You’ll likely feel some cramping and bloating afterward, but it usually subsides within a few hours. You’ll need someone to drive you home and monitor you for the rest of the day. I’ll give you detailed instructions on how to prepare for the procedure. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Sedation, you say? Well, that’s something, I suppose. Though, I don’t particularly enjoy being… out of it. And a laxative solution? Good heavens. You're asking a lot, you know. And I’ll need someone to drive me? Well, that complicates things. My granddaughter is busy, and… honestly, I don't have many friends left who are able to drive. What are the risks of this procedure? Are there any complications I should be aware of? And what if you don’t find anything? Will I have gone through all this trouble for nothing?
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, while colonoscopies are generally safe, there are some risks, as with any medical procedure. These include bleeding, perforation of the colon, and infection. However, these complications are rare. I’m giving you a document outlining the risks and benefits of the procedure. Please read it carefully. As for finding nothing, it’s possible. If that happens, we can discuss other potential causes for your symptoms. But it’s important to rule out the more serious possibilities first. I can help you arrange transportation if needed. And I’ll be happy to answer any other questions you may have. But frankly, Mr. Rowbottom, delaying this procedure is not in your best interest. It's better to be safe than sorry. Do you want me to schedule the colonoscopy?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead and schedule it, then. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And make sure it’s with someone… gentle. And try to get it done as soon as possible. I haven't got all day, you know. And if anything goes wrong… I’m blaming you. What’s the next step? Do I need to do anything before I come in, besides… the laxative?
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve scheduled you for a colonoscopy on August 16th at 8:00 AM at County General Hospital. You’ll need to arrange transportation and have a responsible adult accompany you. Before the procedure, you’ll need to stop taking certain medications, such as blood thinners, as instructed on the pre-operative instructions I’m giving you now. You'll also need to follow the bowel preparation instructions carefully. Do you have any questions about the instructions or the procedure itself?
PATIENT: August 16th… a long way off. And all these medications to stop… honestly, it’s a nuisance. I suppose I’ll manage. What about after the procedure? Can I eat normally? Will I be able to… resume my usual activities? And will I be… gassy? That's a rather important question, you know.
DOCTOR: After the procedure, you can resume your normal diet gradually, starting with clear liquids and progressing to solid foods as tolerated. You may experience some bloating and gas, which is normal. Walking around can help relieve that. You should avoid strenuous activities for the rest of the day. And we’ll discuss the results of the colonoscopy with you after the procedure. It will take a few days for the pathology report to come back. Do you have any other questions, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Bloating and gas, you say? Well, that's hardly reassuring. I suppose I'll manage. I've survived worse, you know. I think that's all my questions, for now. Just… try to be gentle, alright? And don't keep me waiting. I haven’t got all day. Alright then. I suppose I’ll see you on August 16th. Don’t expect me to be cheerful.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Rowbottom. We’ll do our best. And please, read the pre-operative instructions carefully. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Hmph. Good day to you too. A colonoscopy… honestly, what will they think of next? .
