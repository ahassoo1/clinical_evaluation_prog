DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Dashevsky, huh? Sounds…foreign. Anyway, I’m here 'cause I can't…breathe right. Not like I used to. Feels like sandpaper in my throat all the time, and my eyes feel like they’re gonna fall out. Dry. Everything’s just…dry. Don't even ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, sandpaper in your throat and dry eyes… I understand. And you said this isn’t like it used to be?
PATIENT: No, no. It just…started. A few weeks maybe? Hard to say. Time…it just goes, you know? Used to be, I could work all day out in the sun, fixing those lights…traffic lights. Now? I get winded walking to the mailbox. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s a relatively recent change, a few weeks, and it's impacting your ability to do things you used to manage easily. Okay. When you say “sandpaper,” is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, mostly. Gets worse when I…well, when it’s hot. Or when I try to do something. Like, yesterday I was trying to fix a little thing on my TV and…oof. Had to sit down. Feels like a desert in my mouth, too. Like I haven’t had a drop of water in days.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant dryness, worse with heat and exertion. And a dry cough, it sounds like. Do you have any other symptoms along with that—any fever, chills, body aches, or a runny nose?
PATIENT: Fever? Nah. Don't get sick much. Body aches…old age aches, maybe? That’s just how it is when you’re my age. No runny nose. Just…dry. Everything is dry. It's driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, or runny nose. Primarily just the dryness. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions like asthma, COPD, or allergies?
PATIENT: Asthma? COPD? What are those even? Look, I worked on traffic lights for fifty years. You know, the flashing ones, the circles...the whole thing. Hot sun, cold rain, never really bothered me. I had a little trouble with my heart a few years back, but they gave me some pills and I was okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some heart issues in the past, treated with medication. Do you remember what medication you were on for your heart?
PATIENT: Uh…pills. Little white pills, I think. Maybe pink ones too? Honestly, doc, it was a long time ago. The wife – she handled all that. She’s…gone now. Didn't pay much attention to the names, just took 'em when she told me to. It's all a blur, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you don't remember the specifics. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees. They ache, you know? Arthritis, I think the doctor said. Small blue pill. Takes the edge off. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, a little…something. But nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. I eat anything. Used to love Cuban sandwiches, you know, with the mustard and everything. Real mustard, not that weak stuff they got now.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Alright, Mr. Guilds, before we do a quick exam, let’s talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Bad for you, you know. My wife…she always said so. A waste of money, too.
DOCTOR: Good. And how much alcohol do you typically drink?
PATIENT: Alcohol? A little beer sometimes. With dinner. Maybe a couple of cans. Nothing fancy. Not like those young folks, partying all the time. I'm a simple man, doc.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of beers with dinner occasionally. Do you live alone or do you have support at home?
PATIENT: Live alone. Wife’s gone, like I said. Got a daughter, lives a few towns over, but she’s busy with her kids. Comes by sometimes. Mostly, it's just me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. Thank you for sharing all of that. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your lungs, check your throat, and take your vital signs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you gotta do. Just get it over with, doc. This dryness is driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It won’t take long. First, let’s take your blood pressure and pulse. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/85, and your pulse is 78, regular. Listening to your lungs, I hear some…slightly diminished breath sounds, especially towards the lower lobes. It’s subtle, but noticeable. Your throat looks a little dry and irritated, some mild redness, but no significant swelling or any obvious source of infection. I'd also like to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. Your oxygen is 92%, which is a little low. Normal is usually above 95%.
PATIENT: Ninety-two? Low? What does that even mean? I’m breathing, aren't I? And what's 'diminished'? Sounds bad. Look, doc, are you saying there’s something seriously wrong with me? This dryness…it's just getting worse. I feel like I’m breathing through sand paper.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I understand your concern. Ninety-two percent oxygen saturation is a bit lower than ideal, and diminished breath sounds mean I’m hearing less air moving in your lungs than I’d expect. It doesn't necessarily mean something serious is going on, but it does warrant further investigation. The dryness you’re experiencing, along with the low oxygen and diminished sounds, is concerning enough that I want to run a few tests to get a clearer picture of what's happening. We’ll start with a chest X-ray to see if there’s anything going on in your lungs, like fluid or inflammation. I also want to order a blood test to check your oxygen levels more accurately and rule out any other possible causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood test? Look, doc, I don't like needles. And I don’t want to be poked and prodded. Is this gonna be expensive? I'm on Medicare, you know. Just tell me what’s wrong. Is it my heart? Is it something…serious? I just want to be able to breathe again.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I completely understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you we’ll take things one step at a time. The X-ray is a quick and painless procedure – you’ll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. As for the blood test, it’s just a small prick, and we'll minimize any discomfort. Medicare should cover these tests, but we'll verify that with your insurance beforehand so you don’t have any unexpected bills. Right now, it's too early to say definitively what’s causing your symptoms. It could be related to your heart, but it could also be something else entirely, like a lung infection or chronic bronchitis. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and get you the right treatment. I want to rule out anything serious, and these tests are the best way to do that. We’ll get the results as quickly as possible, and then we can discuss a plan to get you breathing easier. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do your tests. But I want to know what they're for, exactly. And I want a clear explanation of what everything means. No doctor talk, understand? Simple English. And make it quick. This dryness…it's awful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Guilds. I promise I’ll explain everything in plain English, no medical jargon. The chest X-ray will give us a picture of your lungs, so we can see if there’s any fluid buildup, inflammation, or other abnormalities. It can help rule out things like pneumonia or chronic bronchitis. The blood test will check your oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, and it can also help us look for signs of infection or other underlying conditions. We’ll get those tests ordered right away, and the lab will let us know when they’re ready. I’ll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just get it done. And no waiting around. I don't have all day, you know. And tell your nurse…gentle with the needle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Guilds. I’ll make sure to let the nurse know. I'll get the orders sent to the lab right away, and someone will come in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you?
