DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. It's a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Schneer, yes, that’s me. Seems like… well, things ain’t as clear as they used to be, sound-wise. I dunno, I just… don’t hear things like I used to. It’s been gettin’ worse, I reckon. Not sure when it started, exactly. Time kinda… slips away, ya know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. It's very common for hearing to change as we get older. So, it sounds like you’ve been noticing some difficulty with your hearing, and it’s been gradually worsening. You said you’re not sure when it started… roughly, would you say it's been a few weeks, months, or longer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Longer, I think. Months, definitely. Maybe even… a year? It's hard to say. I mostly notice it when folks are talkin’ from another room. And the television’s gotta be up pretty loud for me to hear it. My neighbor, Mrs. Gable, she says I shout sometimes when I’m talkin’ to her, but I don’t mean to!
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Schneer. So, difficulty hearing conversations, needing the TV louder, and perhaps speaking a bit louder than you realize… all signs that point to a possible change in your hearing. Have you noticed it being worse in certain situations – like a noisy room, or when there's a lot of background sound?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Definitely noisy rooms. Forget about it! It all just… mumbles together. And when the wind’s blowin’… or if the radio's on… it's just a mess. Makes it hard to follow what anyone's sayin’. It’s not always bad, mind ya. Quiet rooms are alright, mostly. But then again, there ain’t much quiet these days, is there?
DOCTOR: You're right, quiet rooms can be harder and harder to find. And that makes it tougher to distinguish things. Now, have you ever had any ringing, buzzing, or other sounds in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Now that you mention it… sometimes. Not all the time, and it's not loud ringin’. More like… a faint whistle, maybe? Comes and goes. I just figured it was… somethin’ old, ya know? Like creaky bones. I didn’t think much of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a faint whistling sound in your ears that comes and goes. That's good information. Now, let's go through a quick medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever had any serious illnesses, like pneumonia, or a bad ear infection?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had the flu pretty bad when I was a young fella. And pneumonia, yes, once. A long time ago. That was… oh, must have been fifty years ago. Ear infections… I had a couple as a kid, but nothin’ serious. Mostly just a bad cold here and there. I worked in the shoe factory for years, so I was around a lot of dust. That’s about it, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, flu, pneumonia a long time ago, some ear infections as a child, and worked in a shoe factory with dust exposure. That’s helpful. And have you ever had any operations or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an operation in my life. And I haven’t been in the hospital since… well, since I was born, I suppose! Now, my mother… she had her gallbladder taken out. But that was a long time ago, and that was her. I've been pretty lucky, I guess. A few aches and pains, but nothin' a good nap couldn’t fix.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Schneer. Now, just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis, now and then. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. When my knuckles get real bad. And… sometimes I take a little vitamin D, in the winter. The doctor told me to, said I wasn't gettin' enough sunshine. That's about it. Nothing fancy. I mostly just try to get a good night's sleep and eat my vegetables.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen for arthritis as needed and vitamin D in the winter. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergy in my life. Not to penicillin, not to bee stings, not to nothin’. My mother always said I was a sturdy boy. I used to eat dirt as a child, but I don’t think that counts! I’ve been pretty lucky in that department, too.
DOCTOR: Well, that's certainly good news, Mr. Schneer. Now, before we move on to a quick exam, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Has anyone else in your family had problems with their hearing?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father… he was a bit hard of hearin’ when he got older, I think. But he never wore a hearin’ aid or nothin’. Just turned up the television real loud, like me. And my mother… I don’t really remember. She passed away a long time ago. I don’t think anyone else in the family had trouble, but… honestly, we didn't really talk about things like that back then. Things were different, ya know?
DOCTOR: Yes, things were certainly different. That’s still helpful to know. Alright, Mr. Schneer, now I’d like to do a quick examination of your ears and do a few simple hearing tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Go right ahead, Doctor. I ain’t afraid. Just tell me what ya need me to do. Hopefully, it won't take too long. My knees aren't what they used to be, ya know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, we'll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. First, I’m just going to take a look inside your ears with this little instrument. It’s called an otoscope. It doesn’t go in very far, and it shouldn’t hurt. Okay, the ear canal looks clear. There's a little bit of earwax, but nothing significant. And the left ear also looks clear with some earwax. Now, I’m going to do a quick hearing test with this tuning fork. I’m going to tap it gently and place it on your forehead, and I want you to tell me when you can no longer hear the sound. Alright?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Just let me know what to do. I'll try my best. Never had one of them fancy things done before. Just tap it gently, ya say? Don't want to scare me!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I'll be very gentle. Here we go. Okay, tell me when you can no longer hear the sound. And just wave your hand when it fades away. Alright, thank you. And now we’ll do the same thing on this side. Okay, that’s helpful. Now, I'm going to do a quick whisper test. I'll stand behind you and whisper some numbers in each ear, and you just tell me what you hear. Alright?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whisper numbers, ya say? I'll listen real close. My ears ain’t what they used to be, but I’ll do my best. Just don't whisper too fast! Go ahead when you're ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m going to whisper three numbers. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, ready! Go ahead!
DOCTOR: What did you hear?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… Four… and… two. I didn’t quite catch the middle number. Sounded like a… seven, maybe? But I'm not sure. It’s kinda fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, four and two, thought you heard a seven. Now let’s try the other ear. What did you hear in this ear?
PATIENT: Let me see… Eight… one… and… nine! Yes, I think I got that one! Eight, one, nine. Clear as a bell on that side! Though… maybe a little echoey? But I definitely heard it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer, thank you for your patience. Based on the exam and the tests, it sounds like you have some degree of hearing loss, likely more pronounced in your right ear. It’s very common at your age, and often gradual. The whisper test and tuning fork results confirm that it’s more difficult to hear softer sounds. Now, it's unlikely to be a sudden problem, and given your history, there are no signs of an acute infection. It sounds like it's been developing slowly over time. The earwax is not enough to cause this level of hearing loss, but we can remove it if you’d like, which sometimes helps. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that ain't too surprising, I reckon. I kinda figured as much. Slow, ya say? That's what I thought. No sudden stuff, that's good to hear. And… earwax, huh? Might as well get rid of it if it'll help, I suppose. Doesn't hurt to try. What happens next, Doctor? Is there somethin' ya can do about it? A magic potion, maybe?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, no magic potion, Mr. Schneer. But there are definitely things we can do. The most common and effective solution is a hearing aid. They’ve come a long way in recent years and are much smaller and more sophisticated than they used to be. They amplify sounds, making it easier to hear conversations and other noises. Before we discuss hearing aids, I'd recommend an audiological evaluation by a hearing specialist—an audiologist. They'll conduct more comprehensive hearing tests and determine the best course of action. They can also fit you with a hearing aid if that's the route you decide to take. We can also discuss communication strategies to help you cope with the hearing loss, like asking people to speak clearly and facing you when they talk. Would you like me to give you a referral to a local audiologist?
PATIENT: A hearin’ aid, huh? I’ve heard about them. Always thought they were for old people. I guess I am old now. Comprehensive tests, ya say? That sounds good, better to know for sure. And communication strategies… that’s a good idea, too. I do have to ask folks to repeat themselves a lot. Yes, a referral to an audiologist would be great, Doctor. If you don't mind. And… what does an audiologist do, exactly? Besides testin’ ears, I mean.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Schneer. An audiologist is a healthcare professional specializing in hearing and balance disorders. They do a lot more than just test your ears. They evaluate the type and severity of your hearing loss, which helps determine the best treatment options. They can fit and program hearing aids, teach you how to use and maintain them, and provide counseling to help you adjust to using them. They can also provide ear molds and manage conditions like tinnitus – ringing in the ears. They work closely with doctors like myself to ensure you receive the best possible care. I have a list of excellent audiologists in the area. I’ll print out a referral for you now, with their contact information and a brief description of their services. And we can also discuss some communication strategies before you go, if you’d like. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know. More than just fiddlin’ with hearin’ aids, then. Good. I like that. Sounds like they're a useful bunch. Yes, that referral would be wonderful, thank you. And a few communication strategies wouldn’t hurt, either. Maybe tellin’ folks to slow down a bit? I do have trouble when people mumble. No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you for takin’ the time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I’m glad I could help. As for communication strategies, you’re absolutely right—asking people to speak clearly and slowly is a great start. Also, try to reduce background noise whenever possible, and let people know if you’re having trouble hearing them. Don’t be afraid to ask them to repeat themselves if you need to—it’s better to clarify than to miss important information. Facing them directly when they speak also makes a big difference. Here’s the referral. The audiologist's office will schedule a comprehensive hearing evaluation for you. If you have any questions or concerns after the evaluation, please don’t hesitate to call my office. I wish you all the best, Mr. Schneer. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: Well, thank you kindly, Doctor. I appreciate all your help. I will give them a call, I reckon. Facing folks… that makes sense. Yes, it was a pleasure meetin’ you too. You’re a good doctor. A patient fella, that's what I like to see. I'll be seein' ya. .
DOCTOR: You have a wonderful day, Mr. Schneer. Take care. .
