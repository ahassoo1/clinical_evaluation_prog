DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s August 2nd. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is fine. Look, I don’t usually do doctors. Waste of time, mostly. But the army... they want me to get checked out first. Some sort of exam. Pre-exam. Something about making sure I’m not falling apart before they let me build things for them.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this is a requirement for your work with the army. That’s perfectly alright – we'll make this as efficient as possible. So, this is a pre-employment physical, essentially. To get started, can you tell me a little about what’s been going on with your health recently?
PATIENT: Health? What's to tell you? I work with engines all day. Grease, metal, loud noises. It's... work. Nothing happens. I haven't been sick, not properly. A bit of a cough now and then, when the dust gets bad. Old back aches a bit after a long day, but that’s just getting old, right? Everyone gets that. I eat what my wife makes, sleep when I can. Simple. I don't need a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So, generally you feel well, just some expected aches and a cough with dust exposure. We’ll definitely want to document those. When you say “cough,” is it a dry cough, or do you bring anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: Bring something up? Like… phlegm? Ugh, don't ask me to describe it. It's a cough. Sometimes it's wet, sometimes it's not. Depends on the dust, doesn’t it? More dust, more… stuff. It's not constant. Just when I’m at the workshop. Honestly, I haven’t thought much about it. It’s just a cough. You’re making a big deal out of nothing. It’s not like I’m hacking up my lungs.
DOCTOR: I understand it feels like a small thing, Mr. Hartness, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It’s important for us to have a complete picture, even with seemingly minor symptoms. We want to ensure you are in the best possible condition for your work. Just to clarify, you only experience this cough when you’re at the workshop, and it varies depending on the dust levels?
PATIENT: Yes. Exactly. Workshop dust. More dust, worse cough. Less dust, no cough. It's simple logic, really. You’re asking me to explain breathing. I’ve been doing this for fifty years, you know. I know what makes me cough. It's not a mystery illness. Look, is this getting us anywhere? Or am I just wasting my time explaining how dust works to a doctor? Honestly, I’ve got things to do. My wife made lunch.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to point that out, Mr. Hartness. I apologize if my questions seem basic – I want to be thorough, especially given your upcoming work with the army. You’ve explained it very clearly. It sounds like this cough is directly related to dust exposure at the workshop. To make sure we cover all bases, let me ask a few quick questions about other symptoms. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest pain at any time, even when you're not at the workshop?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. I lift engines all day. It takes effort, obviously. Chest pain? No. I mean, my back aches, like I said. But that’s not pain. It's old age. Wheezing... I don't know what that even sounds like. Look, I'm a mechanic, not a… a body expert. I fix engines. You're supposed to be the one asking sensible questions. This feels like a waste of time. Are you going to poke me now? Because if you are, just get it over with.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be frustrated, Mr. Hartness. I apologize again for the unnecessary questions. It’s my job to gather information, and I should be more mindful of your time and experience. Given your description, it does sound like the cough is likely related to dust exposure, and I appreciate you clarifying that. Let's move on to a quick physical exam, then. I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your vital signs – just a routine check. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But make it quick. My wife makes a good potato salad. And it doesn't keep. Just... don't poke me too much. And don't ask me to explain how an engine works, alright? I haven't got the patience for that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Hartness. No engine explanations, I promise. And I’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Alright, Mr. Hartness, take a deep breath in... and out... again... and out... Good. Your heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but I do hear some mild wheezing on exhalation. It's subtle, but it's there. It could be related to the dust exposure and irritation. No tenderness to palpation. Overall, you appear to be in good health, despite the mild wheezing. Your weight is also quite low at 53 kilograms, given your height of 187 centimeters. Have you experienced any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Fifty-three? That’s… low? I haven’t weighed myself in years. I work hard, alright? I burn a lot of calories. Always have. Weight loss? No. I eat what my wife gives me. She feeds me well. Always has. She worries, you know? Thinks I don't eat enough. But I'm fine. Always have been. Look, is this wheezing important? Is it going to stop me from… you know? Building things for the army? That’s what this is about, right? Not my weight. Not a cough. Not my wife's cooking. The army.
DOCTOR: You're right to focus on what's important, Mr. Hartness. This is about ensuring you're fit for duty. And yes, the wheezing warrants further attention. While mild now, it could indicate some airway irritation or underlying reactivity. The low weight is also a concern, as it can affect your overall strength and endurance. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. The X-ray will help rule out any underlying lung conditions, and the pulmonary function test will assess your lung capacity and airflow. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Honestly, this is ridiculous. X-rays… tests… It's just a cough! And I eat enough, alright? My wife will hear about this. She worries enough as it is. Look, can't you just… tell me if I'm fit enough or not? Yes or no. That’s all I need. I haven't got time for this. I’ve got things to do. And lunch is getting cold. I need to get back. Is the army going to reject me because of a bit of dust and a cough? Tell me straight. And then I'm leaving. No more tests. No more questions. Just a yes or no.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration and respect your desire for a straightforward answer. However, I cannot provide a definitive “yes” or “no” without further information. It would be unethical and irresponsible of me to clear you for duty without a proper assessment, especially given the potential risks involved in your work with the army. While your cough may be related to dust exposure, it’s important to rule out any underlying conditions that could worsen with physical exertion or exposure to irritants. I strongly recommend the chest X-ray and pulmonary function test. If you are hesitant, we can discuss a compromise. We can start with just the chest X-ray to rule out any structural abnormalities, and then proceed with the pulmonary function test if the X-ray reveals any concerns. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just the X-ray. One X-ray. And then you tell me what it says. No tests after that. I'm not doing any breathing tests. And if it says everything's fine, you write me a note saying I'm fit for duty. A simple note. Is that so hard? Honestly, I've dealt with more complicated engine manuals than this. Just get it over with. Where do I go for this X-ray? And how long will it take? My wife is going to kill me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Hartness. One chest X-ray, and then we’ll review the results together. I'll write a note stating your fitness for duty if the X-ray is clear. Here's the referral slip for the radiology department. They are located at 123 Main Street – it's about a five-minute drive from here. They take walk-ins, but it’s best to call ahead to confirm their availability, the number is 555-1234. The X-ray itself should only take about 10-15 minutes. Once you’ve had the X-ray, you can bring the report back to me, and we’ll review it together. I will be here every weekday morning, or you can schedule an appointment with my office. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That's it. Just… the X-ray. And then I want a note. Don't forget the note. Tell your receptionist I want a note. A simple note. I need to get back. And my lunch is definitely cold by now. Honestly, this whole thing has been a waste of time. Thank you. I think.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. I’ve made a note to ensure you receive a fitness-for-duty note upon review of your X-ray results. I’ll also inform the receptionist. Thank you for coming in. I hope you have a pleasant afternoon, and I wish you well with your work with the army. .
