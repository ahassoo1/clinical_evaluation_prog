DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Pavlovic… yes, that’s right. Hmm. What brings me in… Oh, it’s this cough. Been… a long time now. Just a dry cough, mostly. Feels like something stuck in my throat, but there’s nothing there. It’s… bothersome, I guess you could say. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. A while.
DOCTOR: Alright, a cough for a while now. It sounds frustrating, especially when it’s dry and persistent. And you feel like something is stuck, but can’t quite pinpoint it?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. That’s it. Not a bad cough, not like… whooping or anything. Just… scratchy. And it doesn't really come with anything else. No fever, no… stuffiness. Just the cough. Honestly, I mostly just ignore it when I can. Old man problems, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s easy to dismiss things when they become… a constant companion. But even a bothersome cough deserves a look, just to make sure everything is alright. You said it hasn't been accompanied by fever or congestion, that's good to know. Now, can you tell me a little more about when you notice the cough is worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. That's a good question. I don't really… notice a difference, to be honest. It’s there when I wake up, it’s there when I sit down. Maybe… a little more when I’ve been doing something? Like, if I’m out in the garden, pulling weeds. But even then, it’s not much more. It's just… always there. I don’t really go do much these days, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it seems fairly constant, and isn’t significantly worsened by activity. That's helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms at all, even something seemingly small?
PATIENT: Oh, hmm… small things… Let me think. I get… a little short of breath sometimes. But that could just be… being old. I used to be able to walk for miles, but… not anymore. And I’ve lost my appetite a bit, but that’s probably just… not wanting to cook for one anymore. My wife… she always did the cooking. No, nothing really with the cough, I don’t think. Just… getting old.
DOCTOR: I see. A little shortness of breath and decreased appetite. It’s good you’re sharing all of this with me, even if you feel they might be unrelated. It's important to paint a full picture. Now, just to cover some basics, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like asthma, COPD, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… diagnoses… Oh dear. That was a long time ago. I remember being sick as a kid, like everyone, but… not anything serious. My wife… she took care of all the doctor visits. She always remembered everything. I don’t think I’ve ever been told I had… asthma or COPD, whatever that is. And my heart… I don’t think so. Maybe high blood pressure once, a long time ago, but I don’t remember taking anything for it. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s all a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s very common for memories to fade, especially regarding medical history. We'll do our best to piece things together. Do you recall ever having any surgeries or being hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Oh, yes. Once. A long time ago. When I was… young. Working on a car, and… something went wrong. Broke my arm, I think. Had to have… something put in it. A plate, maybe? And… I think I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but… that was a very long time ago. That's all I really remember. Nothing else. It was all a very long time ago, Doctor. Everything feels… distant.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm requiring surgery and an appendectomy as a child. That’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Not really. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just… a little aspirin sometimes, for my knees. But that's it. Nothing regularly. My wife always said too many pills are worse than not enough, and… well, I tend to agree with her. No vitamins, no… herbal things. Just the aspirin, when I really need it.
DOCTOR: Alright, just occasional aspirin for knee pain. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... allergies. Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I'm around cats, but that's just… cats, you know? No, I don't think I have any serious allergies, Doctor. My wife used to make everything from scratch, so I always knew what I was eating. She was very careful about those things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you for sharing all of this with me, Mr. Pavlovic. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listening to your lungs and heart, and taking a look in your throat. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go ahead. I don’t mind. Just… don’t be too rough, eh? Old bones, you know. And… if you hear anything funny, just let me know. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pavlovic. I'll be as gentle as possible. Alright, I'm listening to your lungs now. I hear some mild crackling sounds in the lower parts of both lungs. This can sometimes indicate fluid buildup, but it’s not necessarily cause for alarm. It could be from a number of things. Your heart rhythm is regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Again, this is something we'll want to investigate further, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a problem. And your throat looks a little red, but no signs of a major infection. So, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, I’m hearing some things that warrant further investigation. Do you mind if I order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better look at your lungs and heart?
PATIENT: X-ray and… EKG? Oh dear. Sounds… serious. Is something wrong, Doctor? I just thought it was a cough… And my knees. What does all that… mean? Will it hurt? I don’t like hospitals, you know. They always smell funny. And… my wife always took care of these things…
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Mr. Pavlovic. I want to assure you that ordering these tests doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. It simply allows us to gather more information to understand what's going on and ensure we provide you with the best possible care. The chest X-ray will give us a clear picture of your lungs, and the EKG will check the electrical activity of your heart. Both are non-invasive, meaning they don’t involve needles or surgery. The X-ray requires you to stand still for a few moments while the machine takes a picture, and the EKG involves placing a few small stickers on your chest to record your heart's activity. Neither should be painful, though the stickers for the EKG might feel a little cool. I understand you're not fond of hospitals, and we can arrange these tests to be done at the clinic if possible. I will check with the staff to see if that is an option. I know your wife always took care of these things, and it’s completely normal to feel a bit lost without her. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll explain everything clearly along the way. Would you like me to go ahead and order those tests for you?
PATIENT: Alright… yes. Go ahead. If it will… help. And if it can be done here… that would be good. I don't want to go to the hospital if I can avoid it. Just… explain everything to me, like you said. And… don’t tell me anything too scary, eh? I’m an old man. My heart can’t take too much excitement. Thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. I know I’m not the easiest patient.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pavlovic. You’re not difficult at all. I’m happy to take things at your pace and explain everything as clearly as possible. I promise to be upfront and honest, but I’ll also be mindful of keeping things manageable. I'm ordering a chest X-ray and an EKG now. Let me see… the clinic can accommodate both tests this afternoon. You’ll need to sign a consent form for each one, and the technician will explain the procedures to you in detail. They will be right in to get you set up. In the meantime, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any questions you have for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, I think that’s everything for now. Just… getting those tests done. And… thank you again, Doctor. For being so kind. It’s… nice to have someone listen. My wife… she always knew what to do. I guess… I miss her. No, that's all for now. Just… let me know when they're ready for me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pavlovic. I understand. Take your time, and please don’t hesitate to let me know if anything changes or if you have any questions. The technician will be in shortly.
PATIENT: .
