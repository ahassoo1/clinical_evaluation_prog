DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. Welcome. I'm Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It’s…difficult to explain. I suppose I’m just feeling very low. Not enjoying things like I used to. I’d like to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling low and not enjoying things – that’s certainly something we can look into. And I appreciate you wanting to get this sorted efficiently. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when these feelings started?
PATIENT: Hmm…when did they start? That’s a good question. It’s been…gradual, I think. Perhaps six months ago? Maybe a little longer. It's hard to pinpoint. Things just…lost their shine, slowly. I was hoping it would pass, but it hasn't. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. Gradual onset over six months is important information. So, things just started feeling less enjoyable, and it's persisted. Can you describe what “feeling low” means for you specifically?
PATIENT: It's…a heaviness, Doctor. A weight in my chest, really. Not necessarily sadness, though there’s some of that too. Just…a lack of motivation. Everything feels like an effort. I used to be very active – lifeguarding keeps you busy, you know – and now…I struggle to even get through the day. I don’t want to do things, even things I used to love. And I sleep…too much, I think. Though I still feel tired. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A heaviness, lack of motivation, struggling to get through the day, and changes in sleep – those are all important details. And it's significant that this is affecting your activity level, especially given your history with lifeguarding. Now, have you experienced any other changes alongside these feelings?
PATIENT: Changes…let me think. My appetite hasn’t been great, no. I’m not eating nearly as much as I used to. And I've found myself…irritable. Snapping at people, which isn’t like me at all. My ex-husband called last week, and I practically yelled at him for saying good morning! I felt terrible afterwards, but I just…lost my patience so quickly. Is that the sort of thing you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly the sort of thing I mean. Changes in appetite and increased irritability are both relevant. Now, let’s talk a bit about your past. Have you ever experienced anything like this before – feeling low, losing interest in things, sleeping too much, or feeling irritable?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I’ve had my share of disappointments, of course – a difficult divorce, losing my mother a few years back – but I always managed. I picked myself up, kept busy. This is…different. It’s a persistent, draining feeling. I don't have any history of…anything like this, if that’s what you’re asking. I’ve always been a strong, independent woman. It’s just…frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know there's no prior history of this. And I understand your frustration – it sounds very unlike your usual self. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my usual blood pressure medication, Doctor. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And a daily multivitamin. Nothing else. I don’t really believe in all those fancy supplements. Just the basics, really. I’ve always been healthy, generally. Aside from this, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and a multivitamin. Thank you. And no allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. I’m quite fortunate in that regard, I suppose. Is there anything else you need to know? I really would like to get to the bottom of this and, if possible, get things back to normal. This is…wearing me down.
DOCTOR: No, that's helpful. Okay, Ms. Derasmo, I’m going to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment. It’s just to rule out any other potential causes for how you're feeling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Anything to speed things along, frankly. I appreciate you being so efficient, Doctor. Please, proceed. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Derasmo, your heart and lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90, but that’s not unusual given the stress you’re under and the fact you mentioned taking Lisinopril. Your neurological exam is normal – good balance and coordination. Based on what you’ve told me and this brief exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. It’s important to remember that depression isn’t a sign of weakness, and it’s very treatable. However, it’s also important to rule out other potential causes, such as thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Anything to rule things out. Blood tests are fine. I just want to get this sorted. And please, don't worry about explaining things to me in too much detail. I’m not a medical professional, and all the terminology goes over my head. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll do it. Is there anything else?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I will have the lab draw those blood tests for you today. It's a standard procedure. In the meantime, I want to recommend a questionnaire called the PHQ-9. It's a simple set of questions that helps to quantify your symptoms of depression. It'll give me a clearer picture of how you're feeling and help me to determine the best course of treatment. It will take about five minutes. Would you be willing to fill that out?
PATIENT: Five minutes? Yes, I can manage that. A questionnaire sounds perfectly reasonable. As long as it doesn't involve too much writing, I’m happy to fill it out. Where do I find it?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I have a copy here for you. Take your time. There are no right or wrong answers. Just answer honestly based on how you’ve been feeling over the past two weeks. I'll be right here if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Right, I think I’ve finished. It was a bit…depressing, actually, reading those questions. But I answered them as truthfully as I could. Here you are. Now what?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. Okay, the results of the questionnaire confirm that you are experiencing moderate depression. Based on your symptoms, the blood test results when they come back, and your history, I recommend starting you on a trial of an antidepressant medication, specifically Sertraline, starting at a low dose of 25mg daily. We’ll monitor your response closely and adjust the dosage as needed. It’s important to understand that it can take several weeks to feel the full benefits of the medication. I also recommend considering talk therapy alongside medication. Would you be open to a referral to a therapist?
PATIENT: Medication…and therapy. Hmm. I’m not sure about all of that, Doctor. I’ve never taken antidepressants before. Are there…side effects? And I don't know about talking about my feelings to a stranger. It feels…rather invasive. Is medication absolutely necessary? Perhaps I could just…try to pull myself together? I’ve always managed on my own before.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Derasmo. It’s perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about starting medication or talking to a therapist. Regarding side effects, Sertraline can sometimes cause nausea, insomnia, or sexual dysfunction, but these are often mild and temporary. We can discuss strategies to manage them if they occur. Importantly, many people experience no side effects at all. As for whether medication is absolutely necessary, no, it isn’t. But given the severity of your symptoms and the fact that they’ve persisted for six months, it’s the most effective treatment option. Trying to “pull yourself together” is admirable, but depression isn’t simply a matter of willpower. It’s a medical condition that often requires treatment. However, we can start with a low dose of medication and see how you respond. If you're still hesitant about therapy, we can focus on the medication for now. Would you like me to write you a prescription for Sertraline 25mg daily?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you think it’s the best course of action, then…yes, please write me a prescription. 25mg, you said? I’m still not thrilled about it, but I suppose I can try. Just…please make sure it doesn’t interact with my blood pressure medication. And…explain clearly how often I need to take it. I don’t want to mess this up. And then, perhaps, after a few weeks, we can reassess. Is that acceptable?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely acceptable. Here is your prescription for Sertraline 25mg. It is safe to take with Lisinopril, but it's important to monitor your blood pressure regularly, especially when you first start the medication. Take one tablet every morning with or without food. Consistency is key. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in four weeks to assess your response and discuss any side effects. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms, such as suicidal thoughts or severe anxiety, please contact me immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. I’m also going to provide you with a handout that contains information about Sertraline, potential side effects, and resources for mental health support. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you for your patience. I’m still a bit…worried, to be honest, but I’m willing to give it a try. I do hope this works. I just want to feel like myself again. I believe that’s all. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Derasmo. I understand your apprehension, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, it often takes a few weeks to see results, so please be patient with yourself. If you don’t mind, I will call you in a week to make sure you got the prescription filled, and see how you are doing. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
