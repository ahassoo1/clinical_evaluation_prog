DOCTOR: Hi Ebony, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Ranjan, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, but I’ve been having trouble with my memory lately. It’s… worrying me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re bringing it up – it’s definitely worth looking into, and there’s no shame in being worried when something feels off. Can you tell me a bit more about what you mean by "trouble with your memory?
PATIENT: Hmm, where to start? It’s not like… forgetting where I put my keys every now and then. It's more… important things. Like, I had to ask my sister twice yesterday about what we talked about on the phone – something about a birthday party, and I usually remember these things. And a couple of times I’ve struggled to recall the names of patients at the practice. It's just… little things, but they’re adding up.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds concerning, especially with it impacting recalling conversations and names at work. So it’s not just misplacing things, but more difficulty remembering things that happened recently?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Remembering. Not just where I left something, but what happened, or what someone told me… even just a few hours ago. It feels… foggy, sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense – “foggy” is a good way to describe it. And it sounds like this is relatively new, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. It started… maybe three or four months ago? It was very gradual at first, so I kind of brushed it off. But it's definitely gotten worse over the last month or so. I'm a dentist, you know? I need to remember things! I’m starting to feel… anxious about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, especially with your profession requiring a sharp memory. Okay, so it's been progressively worsening over the last month, after starting about three or four months ago. Have you noticed any other changes – anything else going on with your health or mood?
PATIENT: Let me think… I’ve been a little more tired than usual, I guess. Just generally feeling run down. But I work long hours, so I just thought it was that. And… maybe a little bit more irritable, but honestly, everyone's a bit grumpy these days, right? I haven’t really noticed anything else, no. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some increased irritability. Those could be related to a lot of things, and it's good you’re noticing them. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, had the usual childhood illnesses… nothing major. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. No big surgeries or anything like that. I do have slightly high blood pressure, the doctor’s been monitoring that for a couple of years, but it’s controlled with medication. And…oh, I had a bout of really bad flu last winter, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. High blood pressure, controlled with medication, and a case of the flu last winter. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I have it right here… Okay, here we go. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, if I need it. Nothing else, regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily, and ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My sister is allergic to peanuts, but that’s not me. No medication allergies, no food allergies, no environmental allergies… I think I’m good. Honestly, I’m usually the healthy one in the family. This whole memory thing is really throwing me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had… dementia, I think it was. She was diagnosed when she was in her late seventies, early eighties. It was… a long process. My father was healthy as a horse, though. Never had any major health issues. And my sister is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. That’s about it, really. It was my mother… that’s why I’m so worried, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, especially given your mother’s diagnosis. It’s good you’re aware of that family history. Okay, and finally, just a couple of social history questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. I don't smoke, I very rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a month, if that. And I've never touched drugs in my life. I’m a pretty straight-laced person, really. Long hours at the practice don't leave much time for anything else, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No smoking, minimal alcohol, no drugs. So, just to recap, you’ve been experiencing progressive memory issues for about three to four months, impacting recent recall. You're also feeling more fatigued and irritable. You have a history of controlled high blood pressure and a family history of dementia. And you have a healthy lifestyle overall. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a brief physical and neurological exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A physical exam… that makes sense. I just want to figure out what’s going on, and if there’s anything I can do. Please, go ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breath in… and out… Again… Good. Everything sounds normal there. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Okay, those are normal as well. Let’s do a quick balance test. Can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes for 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Thirty seconds… This is harder than it looks! There! Thirty seconds, I think. A little wobbly, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little wobbly is noted. Now, I’m going to do a very simple memory test. I'm going to say three unrelated words, and I'd like you to repeat them back to me, and then I’ll ask you to recall them again in about five minutes. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I’m ready. Go ahead. This is… slightly nerve-wracking, but I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Um… apple, table, penny. Got it. That was easy enough. Hopefully I can remember them in five minutes.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, we’ll move on to a brief cognitive assessment. I'm going to ask you a few questions to assess your orientation and general cognitive function. First, can you tell me what the date is today?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… Today is… August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I think so. I had a birthday party to go to last week and I feel like I have been keeping track of the days.
DOCTOR: Okay, August 2nd, 2025 is correct. And do you know what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s easy! We are in… Willow Creek. Yes, definitely Willow Creek. It’s a small town, you can’t forget that! I’ve lived here my whole life.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, can you spell the word “world” backwards?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. That's… tricky. Let me think… D-L-R-O-W. Is that right? I'm usually good at spelling, but my brain feels a little… foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s close. It’s W-O-R-L-D. Don’t worry, these tests can be challenging. Okay, it’s been about five minutes. Can you tell me the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Um… oh… this is not good. Let me think… There was an… apple, I think? And something about… furniture? And… a color? I can't… I can't remember the third word. I’m so sorry. I knew I was going to be terrible at this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ebony. It’s alright. You remembered one word, and that's a start. It sounds like there is some difficulty with recent recall, which is what you’ve been describing. Given your history, your family history of dementia, and the results of this brief examination, I think it's important to investigate this further. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your memory issues, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also want to order an MRI of your brain to get a more detailed look at what’s going on. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Anything to figure out what’s going on. MRI, blood work… whatever it takes. I'm just… scared, to be honest. It sounds serious. But I need to know, you know? And if there's something I can do… I want to do it.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, and I want to assure you that we'll take this one step at a time. These tests will give us more information to work with. I’m also going to refer you to a neurologist, Dr. Ramirez, who specializes in memory disorders. She can perform a more comprehensive evaluation and help us develop a treatment plan. Would you like me to help you schedule those appointments?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful. I… I don't think I could manage it all on my own right now. Thank you, Dr. Ranjan. I really appreciate it. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let me just pull up Dr. Ramirez’s contact information… … Okay, I’ve scheduled you an appointment with Dr. Ramirez for August 16th at 2:00 PM. I’ll also have the lab requisitions printed for you now. They need a fasting blood sample, so try to refrain from eating or drinking anything after midnight tonight. I’m also going to give you a handout with some resources about memory loss and support groups in the area. And I want you to know that if you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms, like confusion or weakness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that covers everything. Thank you so much, Dr. Ranjan. You've put my mind at ease a little, knowing that we’re taking steps to figure this out. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I'll see you then, on the 16th.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ebony. You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care of yourself, and try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out together. Have a good day.
