DOCTOR: Right. Nicoletta McNabb, 87 years old. Yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Memmolo, is it? Yes, that’s right. Well, to be frank, I feel… a little worn out. Not sick, you understand. Just… not quite myself. Like I need a good reset, or a jumpstart. I’ve been thinking about it for a little while now. It’s just… getting older, I suppose. But I want to feel good again, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: “A little worn out.” Right. And how long has this “worn out” feeling been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. Not a sudden thing, no. More… gradual. Perhaps… six months or so? It started with just feeling tired more easily, and now… well, things just don't feel as sharp, you know? I used to be so quick with my hands, doing crafts with the children at school… now it takes me a bit longer. And I forget little things. Not important things, mind you. Just… where I put my glasses, or a name sometimes. It’s silly, really.
DOCTOR: Six months. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this fatigue and… diminished sharpness?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. Diminished sharpness… yes, that’s a good way to put it. Hmm. Well, my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don’t lack for wanting to eat, it's just… smaller portions feel enough. And sometimes, my knees ache a little, especially if I’ve been on my feet too long. Nothing terrible, just a little… reminder that I'm not twenty anymore! I haven’t been running marathons, if that’s what you’re thinking. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Smaller portions… and knee pain. Any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no fever or chills. Definitely not. And weight loss? No, if anything I think I’ve… maintained my weight. Maybe even gained a little, if I’m being honest! I do enjoy my sweets, you see. My daughter always tells me I should watch it, but… well, a little bit of joy doesn’t hurt, does it? I haven’t had any night sweats either, thankfully. Just… normal old lady things, I suppose. Is that… is that enough information? I hope I'm not rambling.
DOCTOR: "Normal old lady things." Right. Let's move on. Any past medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Well, I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, probably… forty years now? And I had a bit of a scare with my heart a long time back, but they said it was just some irregular heartbeat. They put me on a little pill for it for a while, but I haven’t needed it in years. No diabetes, no cancer, thank goodness. Just the usual aches and pains that come with a long life, I suppose. I was always very healthy, very active. I taught special education for… oh, goodness, almost fifty years! So I’ve been around a bit. I always said keeping busy was the best medicine.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, arrhythmia… Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me think… no, I don't believe so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve taken a few pills over the years, of course, but nothing serious. Just things for the aches and pains, and the heart medication for a while, as I mentioned. No rashes, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. I always made sure to tell the doctors if I felt anything strange, so I think I'd remember if I had an allergy. I’m usually very careful about those things. It's important to be, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, let me see. Well, I take a little something for my blood pressure, just a small dose. The doctor prescribed it a few years back. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I’ll take some ibuprofen. Just the regular kind you can get at the store. Nothing fancy. And… oh, I take a daily vitamin, just a general multivitamin. I figure it can’t hurt, right? My daughter keeps reminding me to take it. She worries about me, you see. Is that everything?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication, ibuprofen, multivitamin… Fine. Let's do a quick physical exam. Please step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, yes, of course. Here we go. I haven’t weighed myself in a while, I confess. My daughter has one at home, but I prefer not to dwell on those numbers, you see. It’s a little wobbly, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: 149 pounds. Height is listed as 199 centimeters. Blood pressure is 140/85. Pulse is 72. Respiration is 16. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is audible. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Everything seems… within normal limits for your age.
PATIENT: Oh, that's… reassuring, I suppose. A slight murmur, you say? Is that something to be worried about, Doctor? I always worry about my heart, you see. It’s been a little sensitive ever since that scare many years ago. And “within normal limits” is good, of course. But I came in feeling… less than normal, if you know what I mean. I just want to feel like myself again. Is there anything we can do about that? Perhaps some tests? Or… something?
DOCTOR: The murmur is likely benign, given your history. As for feeling "less than normal"... at your age, some fatigue is expected. However, to rule things out, we can order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. That will give us a baseline. And I’ll send you to a cardiologist for an echocardiogram, just to be thorough about the murmur. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, that… sounds very thorough, Doctor. Yes, I appreciate that. A complete blood count and… a basic metabolic panel? And the thyroid test… yes, that sounds sensible. And the cardiologist… alright, yes, if you think it’s best. An echocardiogram… is that a painful test? And will the cardiologist want a lot of information from me? I always get nervous trying to remember all the details. I just want to make sure I’m prepared. It’s good of you to be so thorough, though. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: The echocardiogram is non-invasive – it's just an ultrasound of your heart. No pain involved. The cardiologist will want your medical history, a list of medications, and details about your symptoms. I will forward my findings to them. I’ll order the blood tests now. You can schedule the echocardiogram with the cardiologist’s office. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… manageable, yes. Non-invasive is good. And I'll try to gather all my information for the cardiologist. It's just… my memory isn't what it used to be, you see. Perhaps my daughter can help me with that. No, I don't think that's all for now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening, and for being so thorough. I feel a little better just knowing we're doing something about it. When should I expect to hear back about the blood test results? And is there anything I should do in the meantime? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: The lab results should be available in 3-5 business days. I’ll have the nurse contact you with the results. In the meantime, continue taking your medications as prescribed. Maintain a healthy diet and get regular, moderate exercise if you are able. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. 3-5 business days. Yes, that's good. And I will continue taking my medications, of course. And I'll try to eat healthier… and get a little more exercise, if my knees allow. It's just… hard sometimes, you know? No, I don't think that's all. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I appreciate your time. I suppose I’ll go wait for the nurse to call. .
DOCTOR: Fine. Goodbye. .
