DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t have a lot of time. My throat… it hurts. Been hurting for a few days now. Not sure what it is, and frankly, I don't have time to sit around figuring it out. Just… hurts when I swallow. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s plenty to start with. A sore throat that’s worse when you swallow… alright. It sounds uncomfortable, certainly. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More? Really? I told you it hurts. It’s… a regular throat hurt. Like when you get sick, I suppose. I don’t know what else to tell you. I haven’t been sleeping well, if that matters. But that’s probably just… things. Is this going to be a long process? I have a lot to do today.
DOCTOR: No, no, I understand. You’re right, a “regular throat hurt” is a good way to put it. And it's perfectly alright to feel frustrated when you're busy. We'll try to be as quick as possible. The sleep issue does matter, it can sometimes be related. Just a few quick questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever… I don’t check for fevers. Honestly, I don’t bother with all that. I just… push through. Chills? Maybe? It gets cold here at night, so… yes, I get cold. Body aches… well, I work with machines all day. Everything aches, Doctor. Is this going anywhere? I really don't have time for a whole list of questions.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're able to push through, but it's also important to check these things, even if it feels like a bother. Okay. Have you noticed any cough, runny nose, or any white spots in the back of your throat?
PATIENT: A cough? Sometimes. A little one. Nothing major. Just… a tickle. Runny nose… not particularly. And white spots? Doctor, I haven't been looking in my throat! How would I even know about white spots? This is… a bit ridiculous, don't you think? Are we getting anywhere? I need to get back to work soon.
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out. It's not helpful to ask you to look for things you wouldn't normally check. Alright. Let's do a quick look in your throat, just to get a visual. It won't take long, and it might give us a better idea of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I truly do not have the time for this. Just… get it over with. I hope you know what you’re doing.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax. Deep breath… open wide for me. Hmm… okay. A little redness and some swelling. Nothing too alarming, but it does look irritated. I'm going to listen to your lungs quickly, just to be sure everything sounds clear. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: There. Done. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit lightheaded. Is this necessary? I've never had to do all of this before for a simple sore throat. I just want something to make it stop hurting. Are you going to give me something, or are we just going to keep… poking around?
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound clear, which is good. I apologize if this feels like a lot, Tammie, but it's important to rule things out, even for a simple sore throat. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds most likely like a viral pharyngitis – a common sore throat caused by a virus. Unfortunately, antibiotics won't help with a virus. The best thing to do is rest, drink plenty of fluids, and manage the pain with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Would you like me to recommend a specific dosage for those?
PATIENT: Rest? Fluids? Pain relievers? Honestly, Doctor, I could have figured that out myself. I've had a sore throat before. This has been a complete waste of my time. And frankly, I don't take advice from doctors very seriously. Are you sure it’s not something serious? Because I really don't have time to be sick. And no, I don't need a dosage recommendation. I'll figure it out. Just… write something down so I can leave. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie. I want to assure you, based on the examination, it doesn't seem like anything serious. However, I always want to be thorough. I'm going to document “Acute Viral Pharyngitis, likely course. Advised symptomatic treatment with rest, fluids, and over-the-counter analgesics as needed.” Here you go. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain – please don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. It’s always better to be safe. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. That’s all. Just… thank you, I suppose. But honestly, I could have just stayed home and taken some tea. A complete waste of time. Good day, Doctor.
