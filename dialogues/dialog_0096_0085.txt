DOCTOR: Right. Well, good morning, Ms. Bartock. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. It’s… this patch on my skin. It's just… not right. It’s been there a few weeks now, and honestly, it’s rather unsightly. I noticed it after our trip to the lake, but I doubt it’s from the lake. People just don’t take care of themselves anymore, you know?
DOCTOR: Hm. A patch of skin, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It's on my left forearm. It’s…well, it’s a bit darker than the rest of my skin. Not a rash, exactly. More like…a discoloration. And it doesn’t itch or anything, which is…odd, isn’t it? Things should itch if something is wrong, shouldn't they?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily, dear. Everything doesn't follow neat little rules. It’s good it isn't itchy, but that doesn't rule things out. And you said you noticed it after a trip to the lake?
PATIENT: Yes, about two weeks ago. We were at Lake Serenity. Although, I was very careful with sunscreen. I always am. My husband, bless his heart, forgets every five minutes. He'll be red as a lobster, and I'm perfectly fine. It’s just… frustrating. I can't imagine it’s related to the sun, though. I'm very diligent.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, sunscreen is good, of course. But sometimes things can still happen. Let's have a look at it, shall we?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I assure you, you won’t find anything interesting. It’s just…there. It's rather distracting, honestly. I prefer a clear complexion. I’ve always taken pride in my appearance, you know. It's a shame to have this blemish.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It is a bit unusual. It’s flat, and the borders are well-defined. The color is… a brownish-grey, wouldn't you say?
PATIENT: Brownish-grey is…accurate, yes. It’s not raised, thankfully. I wouldn’t want something protuberant. It’s just…flat and…unpleasant. And it hasn't changed size, as far as I can tell. I check it every day, naturally. One has to be vigilant, doesn’t one? It’s just…there. Stubbornly.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. It's good you're keeping an eye on it. Flat and unchanging is…reassuring, to a degree. But it’s still worth investigating. I'm going to use my dermatoscope to get a closer look, just to be sure. It won't hurt a bit. Have you ever had anything like this checked before?
PATIENT: A dermatoscope? No, I haven't. Is that one of those…magnifying things? Honestly, I thought a simple visual inspection would suffice. It seems rather excessive for such a…minor imperfection. But, fine. If you insist. Just…be gentle, please. I have sensitive skin. And don't expect anything alarming; I truly doubt it's anything serious. People panic over the smallest things these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. It is a bit difficult to see clearly, but… there are some irregular patterns within the pigment. It's not something I'd dismiss outright, even if it isn't bothering you. I'm going to recommend a biopsy, just to be safe. It’s a very small procedure, and it will give us a definitive answer. It’s better to be cautious, wouldn't you agree?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Really? That seems… drastic. I mean, it’s just a discoloration. A small patch. You're going to… cut into my skin? For something that’s barely noticeable? I’ve never had a biopsy before, and frankly, the idea is quite unsettling. Are you certain it’s necessary? Perhaps another doctor would agree it’s nothing to worry about. I don’t like this one bit. It sounds…invasive.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, I understand your concern. It is a small procedure, and we only take a tiny sample. But these things can change, and it's important to rule out anything serious. I’m not suggesting it is anything alarming, but we need to know for certain. It’s a standard precaution, and frankly, a responsible course of action. I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn't think it was worthwhile. We can discuss the procedure in detail, and you can always get a second opinion, of course. But to simply ignore it would be… unwise. It's better to be safe than sorry, wouldn't you say?
PATIENT: Fine. But I expect a very thorough explanation. And I want to know exactly what you're looking for. And how much of my skin you intend to remove. I’ve always had very delicate skin, you understand. My grandmother had a similar complexion, and she was always so careful. I don't want any scarring, or… or anything unsightly. And please, no unnecessary poking and prodding. I have a luncheon next week, and I need my arm to look presentable. Honestly, the whole thing is rather inconvenient. Is there…a local anesthetic? A very strong one?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Bartock, we absolutely use a local anesthetic. A very strong one, as you requested. It will numb the area completely, so you won’t feel a thing. We only take a very small sample – about the size of a pencil eraser. And yes, I will explain everything in detail. It involves a small incision, and then we send the sample to the lab for analysis. It’s a routine procedure, and the risk of scarring is minimal. We'll close the incision with a few stitches, and I'll give you detailed instructions on wound care to minimize any potential scarring. Now, let’s discuss the details of the procedure itself, and I can answer any and all of your questions. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment to remove the stitches and discuss the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Very well. Explain it to me, then. And be thorough. I need to know exactly what I’m getting myself into. And what the results will mean, should…should anything alarming be discovered. I suppose it’s better to be prepared. But honestly, I still think this is all rather excessive. But… proceed. I’ll need a very comfortable chair, and perhaps a glass of water. This is all rather…stressful.
DOCTOR: Alright. As you can see here, the biopsy involves using a small blade to remove a cylindrical sample of skin. We'll start by cleaning and numbing the area with a local anesthetic - lidocaine, usually. It will sting for a moment, but after a few minutes, the area will be completely numb. Then, using a small blade – it’s very quick – we'll take a sample about the size of a pencil eraser. You might feel a slight pressure, but no pain. We'll then apply pressure to stop any bleeding and close the incision with a few stitches. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes total. As for the results, the pathologist will examine the sample under a microscope to look for any abnormal cells. If everything looks normal, that’s excellent, and we’ll simply remove the stitches in a week or two. If they do find anything abnormal, we'll discuss the next steps, which could involve further testing or treatment. But let's not jump to conclusions. The vast majority of biopsies are benign. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Benign, you say? That's reassuring, I suppose. But what exactly are we looking for? What sort of…abnormal cells? And what if they do find something? Will I need… surgery? Chemotherapy? I’ve read terrible things about skin cancer. My neighbor, bless her heart, had a rather nasty experience. And what about scarring? I repeat, I have very delicate skin. Will I need…special creams? Expensive ones, I presume? And what if the anesthetic wears off during the procedure? Honestly, this sounds increasingly unpleasant. Is there…any alternative? Perhaps a very powerful ointment? Or a cream that can simply…dissolve the discoloration?
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, let me assure you, we’ll do everything we can to minimize any discomfort or risk. We are looking for abnormal cells that could indicate skin cancer – specifically, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma. While those sound frightening, they are often very treatable, especially when caught early – which is why we're doing this biopsy. If we do find something, the treatment options depend on the type and stage of the cancer. It could involve a wider excision, or other procedures like Mohs surgery, radiation therapy, or topical creams. Chemotherapy is rarely needed for skin cancer. We will, of course, use a local anesthetic to completely numb the area, and we will monitor you closely during the procedure. The local anesthetic typically lasts for several hours. As for scarring, we will use fine sutures to minimize it, and I can prescribe a special scar cream to help fade any discoloration. There is no cream or ointment that can simply dissolve the discoloration. That’s why a biopsy is necessary – to get a definitive answer and determine the best course of action. Now, I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that this is a standard procedure. We’ll take excellent care of you. Do you want me to explain the biopsy process one more time?
PATIENT: Fine. Explain it again. But slowly. And emphasize the part about the minimal scarring. And the anesthetic. I need to be absolutely certain I won't feel a thing. And what if… what if it hurts afterward? Will you prescribe something for the pain? Something strong? I have a very low tolerance, you see. Honestly, this whole thing is rather… distressing. And what about the stitches? Will they be noticeable? I have a charity gala next month, and I certainly don't want anyone staring at my arm. Explain everything. From start to finish. And be thorough. Very thorough.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's go through it step-by-step. First, you'll lie comfortably on the examination table. I'll clean the area on your forearm with an antiseptic solution. Then, I'll inject a local anesthetic – lidocaine – around the area to be biopsied. This will numb the skin completely. It might feel a slight sting for a moment, but after a few minutes, you won’t feel anything at all. We'll wait a few minutes to ensure it’s fully effective. Then, using a small blade – it's very precise – I'll remove a small, cylindrical sample of skin – about the size of a pencil eraser. You will not feel any pain during this process. You might feel a slight pressure, but that’s all. Once the sample is removed, I'll apply pressure to stop any bleeding. Then, I'll close the incision with a few fine sutures – typically, three or four. These sutures are very small and discreet. We’ll cover the area with a sterile bandage. As for the pain afterward, most patients experience only mild discomfort – a slight stinging or soreness. I can absolutely prescribe a pain reliever – a non-narcotic pain reliever like acetaminophen or ibuprofen – if you need it. I can also prescribe a stronger pain reliever if the discomfort is more significant. Regarding the stitches, they will be noticeable, but they are very small and discreet. They will be hidden under the bandage for the first few days. We'll remove them in about a week or two, and I can recommend a scar cream – a silicone gel – to help minimize any scarring. The scar will likely be faint and barely noticeable. We’ll do everything we can to ensure a smooth recovery and minimize any discomfort or scarring. Do you have any further questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Very well. Silicone gel, you say? Is that…expensive? And what if it doesn't work? What if I'm left with a hideous scar? Honestly, this is all rather…overwhelming. And what if the sample is… mishandled? What if they lose it? I’ve heard terrible stories about laboratories. And what if… what if it’s something serious? I don't think I'm prepared for bad news. Honestly, I think I need a moment. Perhaps a cup of tea? Before we proceed any further. This is all too much. Much too much.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Bartock. That’s perfectly understandable. Let me get you a cup of tea. And I want to assure you, the silicone gel is relatively inexpensive. We can also discuss other scar treatment options if you prefer. Regarding the sample, our laboratory is fully accredited and follows strict protocols to ensure the safe handling of all specimens. The risk of losing a sample is extremely low. As for the possibility of bad news, I understand your concerns. But let’s not jump to conclusions. The vast majority of skin biopsies are benign. And if we do find something, we’ll discuss all of your treatment options and provide you with the best possible care. Let's take a moment. We don’t have to rush into anything. The nurse will be right here with your tea. And we can discuss everything again when you’re feeling more comfortable. Do you want me to explain the different types of skin cancer, just so you have a better understanding?
PATIENT: No. No, thank you. I don't think I want to know about the different types of skin cancer. That would only make me more anxious. Just… bring the tea. And then, perhaps… perhaps we can schedule the biopsy for as far in the future as possible. I need time to… prepare myself. And I want to make sure you have all of my insurance information. Medicare, you see. It can be… complicated. Honestly, this is all quite dreadful. Just… the tea, please. And then we’ll talk about insurance. Very slowly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. The nurse will be right here with your tea. And I have all the necessary Medicare forms right here. We can go through them together, very slowly, when you're ready. There’s absolutely no rush. We can schedule the biopsy for any date that suits you. And I want to assure you, we’ll take excellent care of you every step of the way. Let's just focus on getting you comfortable for now. Here's the insurance paperwork; perhaps you can start filling it out while you enjoy your tea.
PATIENT: Very well. But honestly, these forms are rather… complicated. And the print is so small! I’ll need my reading glasses. And a pen, of course. I suppose there’s no avoiding this, is there? .
