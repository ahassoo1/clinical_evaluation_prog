DOCTOR: Right. Annelle Durig, 77. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, it’s…it’s my coloring, you see. A bit yellow, the doctor said. Something about my liver, I believe. It’s been…troubling me. Not terribly, but enough to warrant a visit. I don’t recall all the specifics, to be honest. Perhaps you could remind me?
DOCTOR: “The doctor said…” Right. Well, I’m the doctor now. And honestly, "a bit yellow" isn't a diagnosis. It could be liver related, yes. But it could be a dozen other things. Look, I need you to try and remember what was said about this yellowing, if you can. Was it a general practitioner who mentioned it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, you’re right. My apologies. It was…Dr. Miller, I think? A younger man. He said something about…hepatitis, perhaps? And my liver not working properly. It was a few weeks ago, and honestly, things just…blur together these days. I don’t remember much beyond that, truly. I just know he suggested I come see someone…someone specialized in these things. Is that you?
DOCTOR: “Specialized.” Yes, I suppose. Hepatitis is… concerning. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We need to figure out what kind, if it even is hepatitis. And there are other causes of liver issues, of course. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I have been feeling rather tired lately. More so than usual, perhaps. And…a bit of discomfort, a dull ache, under my ribs on the right side. But honestly, Doctor, I have aches and pains everywhere these days. It's hard to pinpoint anything specific. I suppose my appetite hasn’t been very good either. Not a large one, anyway.
DOCTOR: Right. Fatigue, right upper quadrant discomfort, decreased appetite. All…vague. Have you noticed any changes in your stool color?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s…a rather personal question. Let me see… I suppose it has been a bit paler than usual. Not terribly, but…yes, paler. Is that important? I haven't paid it much mind, to be frank. I really don’t enjoy discussing these sorts of things. Is that a sign of something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, everything is a sign of something, Mrs. Durig. Pale stools, combined with the yellowing and discomfort… it points towards a bile duct issue. We need to run some tests. I'll order a complete blood count, a liver panel, and a bilirubin level. Also, we’ll need to do a physical exam. Let's start with that. Can you lie down on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes, alright. Though I do hope it won’t take too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon. A complete blood count and…a liver panel, you said? Very well. Is this going to be uncomfortable, Doctor? I’m rather frail, you see.
DOCTOR: It won’t be painful. Just a standard examination. I need to listen to your abdomen, feel your liver size, and check for any tenderness. Please lie flat on your back with your arms at your sides. And try to relax. It’ll be quicker if you do.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just…please be gentle. My ribs are quite sensitive, you know. And do let me know if you need me to do anything. This is all rather… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm listening to your bowel sounds, they seem… normal. Now, I'm feeling your abdomen. There's some mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant, as you mentioned. Your liver… appears slightly enlarged. Not dramatically, but noticeable. No obvious masses or distension. But we need those lab results to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Enlarged, you say? Oh dear. Is that…bad? I don't mean to be difficult, Doctor, but I really don't understand all of this medical talk. What does “noticesble” mean? Is it something serious? Perhaps I should have just stayed home. I'm getting rather anxious now.
DOCTOR: “Noticeable” means it’s larger than it should be. It doesn't automatically mean it's serious, Mrs. Durig. It could be inflammation, fatty liver, a blockage… a multitude of things. That’s why we need the blood tests. They will tell us a lot more. Look, I'll order those now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the samples. Try to remain calm. It's just a precaution, alright?
PATIENT: A precaution… yes, I suppose. But all this talk of blockages and…inflammation. It sounds dreadful. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should eat or not eat? Or is there a medication I should avoid? Just tell me something, Doctor, anything, to ease my mind. I feel so helpless.
DOCTOR: For now, avoid alcohol. And fatty foods. Stick to a light diet – fruits, vegetables, lean protein. Don’t take any over-the-counter medications without checking with a pharmacist first. And frankly, Mrs. Durig, I don't want to spend the entire consultation listing every single thing you shouldn't do. We need to get these tests back. The nurse will be in shortly.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. No alcohol, fatty foods, and…light diet. And no medications. I can manage that, I suppose. Though I do find a small glass of sherry helps me sleep. But I won’t, of course. Not if you advise against it, Doctor. I suppose I’ll just wait for the nurse then. Thank you, Doctor. I do hope everything will be alright.
DOCTOR: We’ll see. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
