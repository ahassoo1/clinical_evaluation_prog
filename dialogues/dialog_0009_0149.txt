DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. My name is Dr. Kaelyn Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor...Petri-something, was it? Yes, yes. Well, honestly, it's all this fuss. People keep telling me I need this and that. Tests, procedures… Honestly, at my age, I just want to be left alone. I'm Wynell Gunasekera, by the way. I was married, a long time ago, but… well, that's another story. I’m a podiatrist, you know. Used to fixing other people’s feet. Now everyone wants to fix mine! It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Yes, Wynell Gunasekera. It’s very nice to meet you too. And it sounds like you've been getting a lot of attention lately about your health. That can be…overwhelming, even if well-intentioned. It's good you're a podiatrist, that gives you a unique perspective. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me specifically what tests or procedures people are recommending?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just a whole mess of things, really. Something about…blood work, I think? And a scan of my…bones. My feet, mostly. Though why they need to scan my feet, I don’t know! I’ve been looking at feet for forty years, I think I'd know if something was wrong! And then there was talk about…well, I don’t even remember what else. It all just blurs together. My daughter, bless her heart, is the one pushing for all of it. She worries too much. Honestly, at my age, what's the point?
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood work and a scan of your feet are the main things you remember at the moment. It sounds like your daughter is particularly concerned, and that's understandable – it’s natural for children to worry about their parents’ health. Just to clarify, has anyone specifically told you why they are recommending these tests?
PATIENT: Oh, she says something about my…circulation. And that I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be. Which is true! But who isn’t unsteady at 83? It’s called getting old! I used to be able to run a marathon, nearly! Okay, maybe not a marathon… but I was very active. Now, I just…potter about. Honestly, it's all a waste of time and money. And frankly, poking and prodding at my age is just…undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Wynell. It sounds like the concerns revolve around potential circulation issues and some changes in your stability, and you feel these tests aren't necessarily helpful given your age and previous activity level. It’s also perfectly valid to feel that undergoing a lot of testing is undignified. Just to get a clearer picture, have you noticed any specific symptoms yourself?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well…my feet get cold, sometimes. Especially at night. And I do get a bit of…a tingling. Not pain, exactly, just…a strange feeling. And my ankles do swell up a bit, if I've been sitting for too long. But that's just normal, isn't it? I used to tell my patients that all the time! Sitting is bad for your circulation! It's ironic, really. Now I’m the one with the swollen ankles. Honestly, I don't think it's anything serious. It's just old age creeping up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so cold feet, tingling sensation, and ankle swelling, especially after prolonged sitting. Those are all helpful details. And you’re right to point out that prolonged sitting can certainly contribute to swelling. Now, you mentioned your feet getting cold, is that in both feet, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, both, I think. Yes, both. Though sometimes one feels colder than the other. It’s hard to say, really. They're just…always cold. Even in the summer. I have to wear thick socks, even with slippers. My late husband used to tease me about it. “Always cold, Wynell, always cold!” He was a good man, though. A bit…simple, perhaps, but good. Honestly, I don’t think my cold feet are anything to worry about. It’s just…me.
DOCTOR: It sounds like this has been a long-standing issue, then. And it’s good to know it’s consistent. Now, when you say tingling, can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s hard to explain. It’s not like pins and needles, not exactly. More like…a little buzz. A very faint buzz, deep inside my feet. Sometimes it goes up my ankles a bit. It doesn't hurt, it’s just…there. Annoying, more than anything. And it comes and goes. Some days I don’t notice it at all, and other days it's…more prominent. Honestly, I think it’s just nerves. Old age and nerves. It’s a terrible combination.
DOCTOR: Okay, a faint, buzzing sensation that comes and goes and extends up to your ankles. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color or texture of your skin on your feet or ankles?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... skin color… well, I suppose it’s a bit paler than it used to be. Though I don’t go out in the sun much, so it’s hard to say. And the skin is a bit…dry, I suppose. And thin. It's hard to see, I can’t bend over that easily anymore. My daughter does my pedicures, she’d probably notice more than I would. Honestly, I think it’s just…old skin. It’s going to change, isn’t it? It’s a fact of life.
DOCTOR: You’re right, skin changes are a natural part of aging. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam if that's alright with you. I'd like to check your pulses in your feet, assess the temperature of your skin, and take a look at your feet more closely. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, more poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t know… I really don’t want to make a fuss. But I suppose if you think it’s necessary… All right, go ahead. But be gentle, will you? My skin is very thin, you know. And please don’t tell me everything is wrong. I just want to be left alone.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be very gentle. And I promise to only share what’s necessary, and to explain things clearly. I just want to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Okay. I’m checking your pulses now… they are a little bit weaker than I’d expect, but present. Your skin feels cool, and I see some dryness. Your ankles have a bit of limited movement, but nothing concerning at this point. And lastly, I'm checking sensation in your feet… it’s a little bit reduced, but you can still feel light touch. Okay. Based on the exam and what you've told me, it sounds like you may have some mild peripheral artery disease and some neuropathy, likely related to age and potentially some decreased circulation. The diminished pulses, cool skin temperature, and reduced sensation all point to that.
PATIENT: Peripheral…what-now? Honestly, Doctor, you’re losing me. All these fancy words… Is that serious? Is it going to make me…sick? And neuropathy? Is that like arthritis? My mother had terrible arthritis. Honestly, I just want to know if I need to take a lot of pills. Because I really don't want to take a lot of pills. And if it's just…old age, can't I just leave it alone?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask me to explain it more clearly. Let's forget the fancy words for a moment. Peripheral artery disease simply means that the blood vessels in your legs and feet are a little bit narrowed, so blood flow isn’t as good as it should be. That’s why your feet feel cool and your pulses are weaker. Neuropathy is a bit of nerve damage, also common with age and decreased circulation. It’s not arthritis, though it can cause some similar sensations, like tingling or numbness. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need to take a lot of pills, and it doesn’t mean you’re going to get sick. In your case, it seems mild. The main concern with decreased circulation is preventing more serious problems down the road, like sores that don’t heal easily. For now, I'd recommend a few simple things. First, we should focus on managing your circulation. I'd like to recommend regular, gentle exercise, like walking, if you’re able. And it's very important to protect your feet from injury – wear comfortable shoes, avoid walking barefoot, and inspect your feet daily for any cuts or blisters. And of course, avoid smoking if you smoke. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Walking…well, I potter about a bit. But I don’t really walk anymore. And I haven’t smoked in forty years. My husband hated smoking. He was very particular, you know. And inspecting my feet…well, I can barely bend over! Honestly, it all sounds like a lot of fuss. I suppose…I suppose if it prevents sores, that's good. But pills? You're not going to make me take pills, are you? I hate pills. They make me feel sick. And what about my daughter? She’s always telling me I need to do everything “by the book.” Is she going to agree with all this? Honestly, I just want a simple answer. Can I just leave it alone?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about pills. I completely understand your aversion to medication, and I wouldn’t prescribe anything unless it was absolutely necessary. At this point, I don’t recommend any medication. The focus is on protecting your feet and gentle lifestyle adjustments. And to answer your question about leaving it alone…you can continue to do what you’re doing, but it’s important to be aware of the potential risks. If you notice any cuts, blisters, sores, or changes in color or sensation in your feet, you need to see me immediately. As for your daughter, I'm happy to talk to her directly and explain my recommendations. It's good that she's involved in your care, and I can help her understand what we’re trying to achieve. We can work together to find a plan that you're comfortable with. Ultimately, the decision is yours. I'm here to provide you with information and support, but I want you to feel empowered and in control of your health. Does that sound fair?
PATIENT: Fair… yes, that sounds fair. I don’t like being told what to do. My daughter… well, she means well, but she does worry too much. Talking to her might be helpful, yes. She’ll probably want me to have all sorts of tests and scans. Honestly, she’ll probably insist. Very well. Tell her…tell her to worry less. And tell her I don't want any pills. And tell her I’ll try to…potter about a bit more. And maybe look at my feet. But no promises. Honestly, I just want to be left alone. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Wynell, that is not too much to ask at all. We will absolutely respect your wishes. I will make a note to discuss this with your daughter and emphasize your preferences. To recap, we've discussed potential mild peripheral artery disease and neuropathy, and we’ve agreed to focus on simple foot care and gentle exercise. I’ll recommend she does not insist on further testing at this time. I’m going to give you a handout with some basic foot care tips, just to have on hand. It includes things like keeping your feet clean and dry, wearing comfortable shoes, and checking your feet daily. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Foot care…well, I used to tell my patients all about foot care. For forty years! It’s ironic, isn’t it? Having to receive foot care advice. No… I think that’s all. Just…try not to bother me too much. And tell my daughter I said hello. Honestly, I’m tired now. All this talking… it’s exhausting. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Wynell. I understand. And I promise not to bother you unnecessarily. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for three months from now, just to check in and see how things are going. And I'll be sure to talk to your daughter. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then. And please, take care of yourself.
