DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's my throat. It… hurts. Been hurting for a bit now. Honestly, I don't have much time for this, so if we could just… get on with it, that would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Ms. Ottaviani. However, a thorough understanding of your symptoms is crucial for appropriate care. “A bit now” is rather vague, I'm afraid. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t remember exactly. A week? Maybe more? It just… started hurting. It's not like it was a sudden thing, Doctor. It's just… there. And it’s uncomfortable. Is that specific enough for you? I separate things for a living, you know. Details matter. This… this is just a throat.
DOCTOR: Indeed, details do matter, Ms. Ottaviani. And I appreciate you clarifying. A week or more of discomfort. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I suppose. Mostly when I… swallow. And when I talk for too long. Which is… often, at work. Everything’s a process, you see? Constant monitoring, adjustments… It’s a very… vocal job. Does that make sense? Look, I’m not a doctor, I just tell you what it feels like.
DOCTOR: So the discomfort is exacerbated by swallowing and prolonged speech. I see. And on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the most severe pain imaginable, what number would you assign to this discomfort at its worst?
PATIENT: A scale? Honestly, Doctor, I separate parts, I don't measure pain. But… alright. If I had to… maybe a six? When it's really bad. But usually it's… lower. A four, perhaps? It’s not like I’m dying. It’s just… annoying. Can we please move this along? I have a shift starting soon.
DOCTOR: Very well. A six at its worst, typically a four. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this throat discomfort?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think. I… I haven’t been sleeping well. But that’s just… life, you know? It's always something. And I think I had a bit of a cough last week, but honestly, it was so mild I barely noticed. It’s probably just… dust. Everything’s dusty at work. Is that what you’re asking?
DOCTOR: A mild cough and some difficulty sleeping. Have you experienced any fever, chills, body aches, or nasal congestion?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? Definitely not. I don't do chills. Body aches… well, I’m a woman of a certain age, Doctor. Things ache. But that’s just… normal. And nasal congestion? No. Just… a normal amount of… stuffiness, perhaps. Really, I’m not one for complaining. I just want this sorted out so I can get back to work. This is all very… time-consuming.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, while I appreciate your stoicism, it’s important to gather a complete picture. Now, have you taken any medications – over-the-counter or prescription – to alleviate this discomfort?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I don't believe in all that… stuff. I tried some… tea, maybe? Last week. Lemon and honey. But it didn’t really do anything. I just… deal with it. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very practical woman. I don’t have time for… remedies. Can we just… look at my throat now? I’m sure it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you’ll just open wide and say “Ah…” We’ll take a look. Alright… your throat is mildly erythematous, some slight swelling of the tonsils, but no visible exudate. No obvious lesions. Lymph nodes are palpable, but not significantly enlarged or tender. Let me listen to your lungs, just to be thorough. Lungs are clear.
PATIENT: Erythema…? What does that even mean? And tonsils? I separate parts, Doctor, not examine them! Is it serious? Just tell me straight. I don’t need a lecture on… medical things. This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Erythema simply means redness, Ms. Ottaviani. Your throat is inflamed. Based on my examination, it appears you likely have a viral pharyngitis – a common sore throat. It’s not, in and of itself, serious. However, it is contagious. We'll need to discuss how to manage the symptoms and prevent its spread.
PATIENT: Contagious? Ridiculous. I've been working every day, Doctor. Everyone at the plant is perfectly fine. And manage symptoms? You mean… take some tea? Look, I told you, I deal with it. I don’t have time for… precautions. Honestly, this is all very unnecessary. I need to get back to work. Is there anything else you need to tell me, or can I leave now?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, while you may feel capable, dismissing the potential for contagion is irresponsible, both to your coworkers and yourself. While a viral infection is often self-limiting, it’s important to take appropriate steps. I strongly recommend you take at least three days of rest, increase your fluid intake, and consider using a saline gargle to soothe your throat. I will write a brief note for your employer explaining your illness, but I cannot condone you returning to work while symptomatic. Furthermore, given your lack of insurance, I can recommend a local urgent care clinic for a low-cost follow-up if your symptoms worsen. Here is the note and the clinic information. I urge you to take this seriously. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Three days? Absolutely not. That's… unacceptable. I have responsibilities. And I don't need a note. I'm perfectly capable of judging my own health. Honestly, Doctor, this has been a complete waste of my time. I suppose I'll take this… information. But don't expect me to follow any of your… recommendations. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Ottaviani. I have documented our conversation and your refusal of recommended care. I wish you a swift recovery. .
