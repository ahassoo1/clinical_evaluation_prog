DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Aldine Popova. Good morning to you too, Doctor… Osga, is it? Lovely clinic you have here, very peaceful. I was hopin’ to get this headache sorted, it’s been botherin’ me something fierce.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, Osga. Look, eighty-seven years old, headaches are… common. What exactly do you mean by "fierce"?
PATIENT: Well now, don't rush me, Doctor! "Fierce" means it's not just a little tap-tap-tap, you see? It’s a proper throbbing, right at the back of my head, kinda feels like someone’s tightened a band around it. Been happenin’ on and off for…oh, must be a week now, maybe a little longer. Mostly in the evenings, but it woke me up last night, sharp as a tack.
DOCTOR: Right, right. And you said evenings… anything bring it on?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s the funny thing, Doctor. Not really. I do my usual things in the evening – a little TV, sometimes a bit of dominoes with my wife, read the paper. Nothin’ strenuous, y’know? It just… comes on. Maybe after I’ve been sittin’ for a while? But honestly, I can’t put my finger on it. It's just a nuisance, really, but a persistent one. Do you think it could be somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: Serious?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn't want to be dramatic, Doctor, but an old man like me, things can get serious quick, can’t they? I just… I like to know what I’m dealin’ with. My wife, bless her, she’s startin’ to worry too, seein’ me clutchin’ my head. She makes a lovely ginger tea, helps a bit, but it keeps comin’ back. Is it somethin’ I should be concerned about, or is it just…old age catchin' up with me?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Popova, you're eighty-seven. Of course things are catching up with you. Now, have you had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… No fever, no dizziness, nothin’ like that. I’ve been eatin’ alright, maybe a little less appetite lately, but that could just be the heat, you know? And my eyesight ain't what it used to be, but that’s been goin’ on for years. Oh! Sometimes when the headache’s bad, my neck feels a little stiff, like I’ve been sleepin’ in a bad position. But that don’t happen every time. Does that make any sense, Doctor? I’m tryin’ to think of everything.
DOCTOR: Neck stiffness… alright. And any changes in your vision specifically with the headaches?
PATIENT: Now that’s a good question, Doctor. Let me think... Sometimes, when the pain is at its worst, things do seem a bit blurry, like lookin’ through a fog. Not a complete blackout, mind you, just…muddied around the edges. It goes away once the headache eases off, though. I haven’t noticed any flashes or spots, just a general blurriness. My wife says I should really get my eyes checked, but I keep puttin’ it off. She’s probably right.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s have a quick look. Lie back, if you would. I'll need to check your reflexes and…yes, your eyes. Don't fuss if I shine a light in them.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I always feel a bit silly lyin’ down like this, but I’ll do whatever you need. Go ahead, when you’re ready. I trust your expertise, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Pupils react normally, though slightly sluggish. Reflexes are… diminished, but not unexpected at your age. There's some tenderness here, yes. And some mild muscle rigidity. Alright. Any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had any trouble with foods or anything. Sometimes a bit of a sniffle in the spring, but that's just the pollen, I reckon. Nothing serious enough to worry about, no rashes or hives or anything like that. My wife always says I'm as tough as old boots. Perhaps she exaggerates a little. But truly, no allergies to speak of.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my blood pressure, Doctor. Lisinopril, it’s called. Been takin’ it for…oh, must be five years now, maybe longer. Helps keep things steady. Other than that, nothin’ at all. Just the occasional ginger tea when I’m feelin’ poorly, like I said. Is that somethin’ that could be related, do you think?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril… yes. Possible side effect, though unlikely with a headache alone. Now, let's get this over with. Based on your description and the limited physical findings… this is likely a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by mild hypertension. I'm going to recommend over-the-counter pain relief – ibuprofen or acetaminophen – and to monitor your blood pressure at home. And do try to get your eyes checked. Any questions?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter pain relief… that sounds alright, Doctor. Ibuprofen, you say? My wife usually has some of that in the cupboard. And I will try to get my eyes checked, I promise. But… is that all it is, Doctor? Just a tension headache? It just feels like… somethin' more, y’know? I’ve lived a long life, and I usually know when somethin’s not right. Are you sure it’s not somethin' serious? Is there anything else I should be lookin’ out for?
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, you are eighty-seven. You're going to have aches and pains. It’s called aging. If you develop a fever, stiff neck with a rash, or any neurological symptoms like weakness or difficulty speaking, then you come back. Otherwise, take the ibuprofen, monitor your blood pressure, and get your eyes checked. I have other patients waiting. Do you have any further questions, or can we consider this closed?
PATIENT: Well, alright, Doctor. I suppose I just worry sometimes. It's hard getting old, you know? Alright. Ibuprofen it is, and a check-up with the eye doctor. Thank you for your time, Doctor Osga. I appreciate you seein' me. .
