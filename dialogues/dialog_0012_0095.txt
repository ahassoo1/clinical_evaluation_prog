DOCTOR: Hi Stephane, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have time for pleasantries. It's my ear. It just…stopped working. On one side. And my face feels kind of droopy, if you must know. I woke up this morning like this. It’s incredibly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That is concerning, and you’re right to get it checked out quickly. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are definitely things we need to investigate promptly. Just to be clear – it happened overnight, while you were sleeping?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. I went to bed perfectly fine. Woke up, and…nothing. Like someone flipped a switch. And looking in the mirror…well, it’s not a good look. Do you have any idea what caused this? I have a very important conference next week, and I simply cannot be dealing with this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially with the conference coming up. While I can’t tell you definitively what’s causing it without an exam, sudden hearing loss and facial drooping raises a few possibilities, one of which is quite time-sensitive. It could be something like Bell’s Palsy, but we need to rule out other causes first, including something more serious. Let's start with your medical history. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness. Let me think. No, not really. A mild reaction to shellfish years ago, but nothing serious. I don't go near the stuff anyway. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I don’t have all day, you know. I was hoping for a quick diagnosis and a solution. Frankly, I’m rather disappointed in the pace of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies beyond a mild shellfish reaction – good to know. I understand your frustration, and I am trying to move as quickly as possible. It’s important to gather all the information before jumping to conclusions, though. Do you have any past medical conditions – anything you’ve been treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Honestly, not much. High blood pressure, controlled with medication, for the last…oh, fifteen years, maybe? And a hysterectomy when I was younger, but that was decades ago. Otherwise, perfectly healthy. I eat well, I exercise…well, used to exercise more, before this whole ear situation. It's hardly a comprehensive list, is it? Are we going to spend all day on this?
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, controlled with medication, and a hysterectomy. Thank you. And you said controlled – do you know what medication you're currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams daily. I've been on it for years. It's always been perfectly stable. And again, I need to stress - I don't have time for a lengthy medical history lesson. This is an ear problem. A sudden ear problem. And a face that won't cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Good. Alright, let's focus on the ear and facial drooping. Can you describe the hearing loss a little more?
PATIENT: It’s…complete. On the left side. Like someone turned off the volume. No ringing, no muffled sounds, just…nothing. And the left side of my face feels…heavy. Like it's drooping. It's subtle, perhaps, but noticeable. Especially when I smile. I suppose I should add that I’m feeling a little bit of dizziness, too. A mild unsteadiness, nothing dramatic. Are you writing all of this down? I expect a thorough examination.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. Complete hearing loss on the left side, facial drooping – specifically noticed when smiling, and some mild dizziness. Okay. Now, do you have any family history of hearing loss, neurological problems, or facial paralysis?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, I haven't a clue. My mother died young, my father…well, he wasn’t around much. And I don't keep up with distant relatives. It’s not something I’ve ever paid attention to. Look, I’m a radiologist, not a genealogist. I diagnose other people's problems, I don't dwell on family medical histories. Is this really necessary? I'm starting to feel quite impatient. And a little bit more dizzy, if you must know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the delay. It's helpful information if we have it, but we can proceed without it. Okay. Let's move on to a physical exam. I'm going to take a look in your ears, check your facial nerves, and do a quick neurological assessment. It will give me a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get on with it. I have a conference to prepare for, you know. And frankly, the longer this takes, the less likely I am to make it. Please be quick and efficient. I don't need a lengthy explanation of every step, just a diagnosis and a solution. Now, what exactly are you going to do to me?
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm just going to look in your ears to rule out any obvious blockage or infection. Then, I'll have you follow my finger as I move it around to check your eye movements. This helps assess the nerves that control facial movement. Finally, I’ll ask you to smile, raise your eyebrows, and close your eyes tightly to check for weakness on either side of your face. I'll also do a quick check of your reflexes and balance. Okay, your ear canal looks clear and the eardrum looks normal. Now, could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: There. Done. Is that sufficient? I’m trying to be cooperative, but this is tedious. And honestly, I’m starting to feel a little bit nauseous now, on top of everything else. I really do need to get to the bottom of this quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, eye movements are…slightly jerky, but within normal limits. Now, could you smile for me?
PATIENT: Happy now? It’s not exactly a glamorous look, is it? As you can see, it’s rather…lopsided. I trust you’ve noticed? Honestly, this is deeply unsettling. I have an important presentation next week. A very important presentation. And I look like this.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the asymmetry. The left side of your face is definitely weaker. Okay. Now, could you please close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that satisfactory? It feels…strange. Like I can’t fully control my left eye. Honestly, this is quite alarming. I feel like half my face is paralyzed. Are you sure you know what you're doing? I've read about doctors misdiagnosing things. I’d prefer a second opinion if this isn’t resolved quickly.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that your left eyelid isn't closing completely. Okay. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Please sit still. Your reflexes are normal, and your balance is a little unsteady, but not significantly so. Based on the exam – the sudden hearing loss, the facial drooping, the incomplete eye closure – the most likely diagnosis is Bell's Palsy. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, such as a stroke or a tumor. To do that, I recommend an MRI of your brain. It’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. I don't have time for extensive testing. I have a conference! And an MRI…that takes hours. And it’s incredibly unpleasant. Is there absolutely no other way? Perhaps some medication? A strong steroid? Something to at least temporarily alleviate the symptoms? I simply cannot attend this conference looking like this. I’d be a laughingstock. Are you absolutely certain this MRI is necessary? I'm starting to question your competence.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and your concerns about the MRI, and I wish there was a simpler solution. However, given the sudden onset of your symptoms – the hearing loss and facial weakness – it's crucial to rule out other, more serious causes before starting treatment. While Bell’s Palsy is the most likely diagnosis, we need to be certain it isn’t something else, like a stroke or a tumor compressing the facial nerve. Steroids can be helpful in treating Bell's Palsy, but they’re most effective when started within 72 hours of symptom onset. That's why it's important to get an accurate diagnosis quickly. The MRI is the best way to do that. It’s a non-invasive test, and it will give us a clear picture of your brain and facial nerve. It usually takes about 30-60 minutes, and we can arrange for you to have it done as soon as possible. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule that for you?
PATIENT: Fine. Schedule the wretched MRI. But I expect it to be done immediately. And I expect a full explanation of the results as soon as they’re available. And frankly, I expect some sort of compensation for this inconvenience. This is disrupting my entire schedule. I have a very important presentation to prepare for. And make sure it doesn’t interfere with my conference. I’m leaving on Thursday. This entire situation is utterly unacceptable. I'm a radiologist, you understand. I don’t have time for this. Just…get it done. Quickly.
