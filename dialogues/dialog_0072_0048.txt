DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're 66 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, 66. Though I feel younger, most days. It's this…fogginess. I just get confused sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. It's like… things aren't quite there. My wife, she says I repeat myself. I don’t recall doing that, but she’s the one who notices these things. It's worrying her, and frankly, it's starting to worry me a bit now that she keeps bringing it up.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Fogginess" and repetition…those are certainly things we should investigate. To get a better picture, can you describe when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. It wasn't sudden, not like a switch flipped. More…gradual. Maybe six months ago? It started with forgetting where I put my tools, then the names of people I see regularly, but not important people, you understand? Just the delivery guy, or the cashier at the market. Now it’s…more than that, I suppose. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it became this bad. My memory’s always been good, so it’s unsettling. It’s not like I'm losing everything, just…slipping.
DOCTOR: Slipping, alright. And has this affected your daily routine at all?
PATIENT: Affected it? Well, yes. I'm a tile setter, Doctor. Been doing it for forty years. Forty years! You need to be precise, remember measurements, know what order things go in… all of that. Now, I have to double-check everything. My son helps me with the bigger jobs, which… I don't like needing help. It slows things down, and frankly, he doesn’t always do it right. It’s frustrating. I also stopped driving at night. Not comfortable with it anymore. It just doesn’t feel safe. Used to drive anywhere, anytime. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this memory difficulty?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No headaches, thankfully. I get enough aches and pains from the work. No dizziness. I sleep alright, though maybe not as soundly as I used to. My appetite's good, still enjoy a good Khmer meal. My wife mentions I get a bit…quiet sometimes. Just stare off into space. I don’t feel sad, just… distant. Oh, and sometimes I get mixed up with dates. Like, what day it is. Small things, really. Though my wife makes a bigger deal out of them than I do. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Let’s see. I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago. Took some pills for it, but I stopped a few years back. Doctor said it was under control with diet and exercise, and it has been, mostly. Had my gallbladder out when I was fifty, and a bad knee from falling off a roof twenty years ago. Other than that… nothing major. I’m a strong man, Doctor. Always have been. I don’t get sick often. Though I did have a touch of the flu last winter. Nothing a little rest didn't fix. I try to stay healthy. It's important when you work with your hands.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. And a few stitches here and there over the years from work accidents, but nothing that required a proper operation. You know, tile work is dangerous. Sharp edges, heavy materials… You gotta be careful. My wife always tells me I'm too reckless, but a man’s gotta get the job done. I've always been good at fixing things, even myself. A little tape and a bandage, that's usually all I need. I don’t like going to the hospital unless absolutely necessary. Too many germs. And waiting rooms are awful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My father, he lived to be 88. Healthy as a horse, mostly. He was a farmer. My mother… she had some problems with her heart when she got older. Needed a pacemaker. And my older sister, she had some… well, my wife is the one who knows the details. She had some trouble remembering things towards the end. Not as bad as this, I don’t think, but… she got confused a lot. They said it was “old age,” but my wife thinks it was something more. She always worries about these things. It's probably nothing, honestly. People forget things when they get old. It's natural.
DOCTOR: “Something more” is precisely what we need to determine, Mr. Lason. And it’s important we have a complete picture. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: Like I said, I stopped taking the blood pressure pills a while back. Doctor said they weren't necessary anymore. I take a multivitamin every day, and sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knee when it flares up, but that’s it. I don’t like taking a lot of pills. They make me feel sluggish. I prefer to deal with things myself, if I can. A little heat and a good rest usually does the trick. I’m a strong man, remember? I don’t need a lot of fancy medicine. Though I do use a liniment rub on my back. My son brings it for me. Smells terrible, but it helps.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've eaten everything there is to eat, trust me. Khmer food is very diverse, you know. Lots of spices, lots of different ingredients. Never had a reaction to anything. I've been stung by a few bees when I was a boy, working on my father’s farm, but that just hurt for a bit. No swelling, no trouble breathing. Nothing like that. I'm a hardy man, Doctor. I don't get sick easily. Though I avoid shellfish. Doesn't agree with my stomach. But that’s not an allergy, just a preference.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason. We've covered a lot. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical and neurological exam. Just to get a better baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Well… I suppose so. I haven't been to a doctor in years, except for my checkups. I’m not a fan of poking and prodding, but if it's necessary… alright. Just try to be gentle, alright? My body isn't what it used to be, even if I am a strong man. And don’t take too long. I have a job to get back to. My son can handle things for a bit, but he doesn’t know everything.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 142/88. Pulse is 78 and regular. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, within normal limits. I'm going to test your cranial nerves. Follow my finger with your eyes, but don't move your head. Eye movements are intact. Can you smile for me?
PATIENT: There. See? Everything's working fine. Always have been. I told you I was a strong man. Though my face feels a bit… tight. Maybe I’m just tired. All this talking… and now this poking and prodding. Can we get this over with soon? My son's probably messing something up as we speak. I just want to know if everything’s alright, and if I can get back to work. Honestly, this whole thing feels unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and cognitive function. Don’t worry, it’s just a quick test. What is today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. That’s… August… the second? No, wait. Is it the third? My wife always keeps track of these things. It’s… August second, yes. Definitely August second. It’s just… hard to keep track sometimes. Lots on my mind. The job, the house… things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me the name of the current president?
PATIENT: The president… Now, that’s a tricky one. Is it… Biden? Yes, I think it’s Biden. Though I don’t pay much attention to politics. It’s all the same to me, honestly. Lots of talk, not much action. My wife watches the news, she’d know for sure. I just want to focus on my work, you understand? Politics don’t build houses.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Based on this brief examination and your history, I'm concerned about possible mild cognitive impairment. Your memory recall is somewhat impaired, and you had some difficulty with some basic recall questions. It's important to rule out any underlying causes. I recommend further testing, including blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies and thyroid function, and a more comprehensive cognitive assessment. We can also consider a referral to a neurologist for a more in-depth evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Now hold on just a minute. Mild cognitive… what did you say? Impairment? I'm perfectly fine! I'm a strong man, I told you that. I build houses for a living, that takes a good memory and clear thinking. Just because I forgot the date and the president doesn’t mean something is wrong with me. My wife worries too much, she's always making a big deal out of nothing. I don't need blood work, and I certainly don’t need to see a neurologist. What would a neurologist even do? I'm telling you, I just need a good rest and maybe a change of pace. This is unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your reluctance, but dismissing these symptoms is not in your best interest. These tests are not about saying you are incapable; they are about identifying any potential issues early on and exploring treatment options if necessary. Early detection is crucial for managing cognitive decline. While you may be physically strong, cognitive function can decline independently of physical strength. I strongly recommend at least the blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes. It's a simple procedure and can provide valuable information. I can also provide you with resources on cognitive health and support options. If you refuse the blood work, I will document that in your chart. However, I urge you to reconsider. Perhaps we can discuss this further with your wife present?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, you win. Blood work. But just the blood work. No neurologists, no fancy tests, no… poking and prodding. Just the blood work. And I want the results sent to me directly, not just my wife. I can read, you know. I need to understand what’s going on, if anything is going on. And if it turns out to be nothing… then you owe me an apology for wasting my time. I have a job to get back to, Doctor. A house isn’t going to build itself. And don’t expect me to be happy about this. Honestly, this whole thing is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Lason. I’ll order the blood work now. It will include a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, vitamin B12 and D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. You’ll receive a lab order, and the results will be sent directly to you, as requested. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend continuing your normal activities, but pay attention to any changes in your cognitive function and report them to me immediately. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that's enough for now. Just… get it over with. The blood work. And don't bother calling me unless there's something… significant. I have a house to build, remember?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Lason. I’ll have my nurse provide you with the lab order and instructions. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. . Thank you for coming in today.
