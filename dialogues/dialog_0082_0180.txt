DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. IUZZOLINO. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time. Just… tired. Real tired. And… this is embarrassing, but I keep wanting to eat dirt. Not like on purpose, it just… happens. It's been worse lately, that's why I'm here, I guess. Don't ask me why, I have no clue.
DOCTOR: Tired, and… an unusual craving. Okay. We can certainly look into both of those things. When did this tiredness start?
PATIENT: Honestly? A long time ago. It comes and goes, you know? Like… years. But it's been pretty steady the last few months, and… worse. I just thought it was getting old. My husband… he passed a while back, and things haven't been the same. Does that make sense? I don't even know why I'm telling you this. It's not like that's why I'm eating dirt. It's just… a lot.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Hedy. Grief can manifest in many ways, and it’s important to consider all aspects of what’s going on. It's good you're sharing this with me. And we will figure this out. Now, about the tiredness… is it constant, or does it come and go during the day?
PATIENT: It's mostly… all the time. But worse in the afternoons. Like after lunch, I just… fall asleep. And even before that, just… sluggish. Can't think straight. Like my brain is full of cotton. It's not like a normal tired, you know? It’s… heavier. Is that even… a thing? I don't know medical words.
DOCTOR: It absolutely is a thing, Hedy. Fatigue can feel different for everyone, and what you’re describing – a heavy, sluggish feeling, difficulty concentrating – that's very helpful to know. We need to rule out some potential causes. Let’s talk about the… craving. How often would you say this happens?
PATIENT: Ugh, it's hard to say. A few times a week, maybe? Sometimes more. It’s not like I’m hunting for dirt, okay? It just… starts. I’ll be in the garden, weeding, and suddenly… I just want to taste it. I try not to, but… sometimes I do. It's embarrassing! My neighbors would think I’m crazy. And it’s not even good dirt, you know? Just… earth.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s distressing, Hedy, and I appreciate you being so open with me. It's good you're aware of it and trying to resist. This is a condition called pica, and it can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency, or… other underlying issues. Now, have you noticed any other unusual cravings besides dirt?
PATIENT: Pica? That sounds…fancy. No, just the dirt. I don't go around eating rocks or anything. And my appetite is…normal, I guess. I eat what I always eat. Not a big eater, never have been. Mostly just… bland things. Chicken, rice, vegetables. Nothing exciting. My husband was the cook, you know? I’m terrible in the kitchen. It’s just…everything's different now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's a big adjustment, and it's perfectly normal to feel things changing. Okay, so mostly bland foods, normal appetite, and this craving for dirt… Now, before we get too far, let’s go over some basics. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally getting somewhere? No allergies that I know of. I haven't taken much medication since…well, since my husband died. Just some pain relievers for my arthritis now and then. Doesn’t do much good, honestly. And I don’t eat anything weird. No shellfish, no nuts, just…regular food. Are you trying to figure out if I’m poisoning myself? Because I'm really not. It’s just dirt!
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Hedy. We're simply going through a standard review to get a complete picture. I believe you. And I’m not suggesting poisoning. It's just…pica can sometimes be related to nutrient deficiencies, like iron or zinc. Now, do you currently take any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? No! I don’t take anything. Vitamins are for…people who eat healthy, I think. I told you, I mostly eat chicken and rice. My doctor, the one before…he just told me to try and get more exercise. Which is hard when you’re tired all the time. This is taking forever. Can we just… figure out why I’m tired and why I want to eat dirt?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. We will figure it out, and I apologize if I’m taking too long with the questions. Just a few more to rule things out. Now, do you have any family history of anemia, unusual cravings, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… seriously? My family is…complicated. My mother had…something with her stomach. I don't remember what. She died a long time ago. And my father...he worked in a mine. Probably ate dirt his whole life, for all I know! Honestly, I don't know. We didn’t talk about that kind of stuff. Are you trying to find something wrong with my ancestors? Because that seems…rude. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Hedy. Family history can be difficult. We'll move on. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just checking your heart, lungs, and looking at your skin. It might give us some clues. Would that be alright?
