DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. Good afternoon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, it’s rather inconvenient having to come here. I’ve been… experiencing a bit of discomfort. It’s in my mouth. A white coating, if you must know. It’s quite unpleasant. And frankly, I haven’t the time for this.
DOCTOR: <stage>I tap a pen against the chart, a slight frown forming. A white coating… really?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, a white coating. Are you going to examine it, or simply question me about it? I have a business to run, you see. This isn't a social call. It's… bothersome, and my wife insisted I come. She worries over everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. I am going to examine it, eventually. But first, I need some information. When did you first notice this “coating,” as you call it?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t recall the precise date. Perhaps a week ago? Maybe a little longer. It’s… difficult to say. I wasn't actively looking for it, you understand. It just became… noticeable. It’s not as though I spend my days inspecting the inside of my mouth. Really, Doctor, must we delve into such specifics? It’s rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything changed in the last week or so?
PATIENT: Changed? How am I supposed to remember everything that's changed? I work. I eat. I sleep. It's a fairly standard existence, Doctor. Though, now that you mention it… my wife did make a new fruit salad. Perhaps it’s something in that. She insists on exotic fruits, you see. Always something different. It's… trying, frankly. But I doubt that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I understand you're busy. However, to properly assess your condition, I need you to try and be specific. Has this coating been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness, no. I don’t feel sick, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… this unpleasantness in my mouth. No fever, no aches, no… drama. Perfectly healthy, otherwise. It’s just… aesthetically displeasing. And my wife… well, you know. She amplifies everything. Is that sufficient, Doctor? Can we simply get this over with?
DOCTOR: Alright. Please open wide. And try to relax.
PATIENT: There. Quickly, if you please. I have appointments, you understand. This is quite a waste of my time. And don’t poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see it. It’s a bit more extensive than you let on, Mr. Schieber. And it doesn’t scrape off easily, which is… concerning. No visible sores or lesions, thankfully. Gums are slightly inflamed. Have you been experiencing any difficulty swallowing or changes in your sense of taste?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? No. I eat perfectly well, thank you very much. Steaks, mostly. And taste? No noticeable changes. I can taste my coffee just fine, and my wife’s… experimental cooking. Though whether that’s a good thing is debatable. Look, Doctor, is this serious? Because I really don't have time for anything complicated. Just tell me what it is and how to fix it. Preferably with a minimum of fuss.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, it’s difficult to say definitively without further testing. However, this could be oral thrush – a fungal infection. It’s not usually serious, but it needs treatment. It’s more common in people with weakened immune systems, or those taking certain medications. Have you recently taken any antibiotics or steroids?
PATIENT: Antibiotics? No. Steroids? Absolutely not. I maintain a perfectly healthy lifestyle. I don’t need those sorts of things. Are you suggesting I have a… weakened immune system? That’s rather insulting, Doctor. I work very hard, you know. I’m perfectly robust. Honestly, this is becoming quite tedious. Is it contagious? My wife is… rather particular about hygiene.
DOCTOR: While it's unlikely, oral thrush can be mildly contagious. But frankly, it's more likely this is something else, given your insistence on being in perfect health. Mr. Schieber, I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying issues. And I'd like to take a swab of the coating in your mouth to send to the lab for analysis. That will give us a definitive answer. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? A swab? Honestly, Doctor, is all of this necessary? It sounds… invasive. And time-consuming. I have a very busy schedule, you know. Can’t you just… prescribe something? An antifungal, perhaps? I’m sure that would clear it right up. And please, no more poking. This is quite enough. Just get this over with, quickly. My wife will be furious if I’m gone much longer. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schieber. I will write you a prescription for an oral antifungal medication. However, I strongly advise you to follow up with me if your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if they worsen. And, to be clear, I am documenting your refusal of the recommended blood work and swab. This will be a seven-day course. Rinse your mouth thoroughly after each dose, and avoid sugary foods and drinks, as they can worsen the infection. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
