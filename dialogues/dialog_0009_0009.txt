DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. AlCorta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a bit difficult to explain, frankly. I’ve noticed my vision isn’t what it used to be. It’s… fading, I suppose. Not suddenly, thankfully, but steadily. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I used to be able to read the paper without glasses, and now… well, now I need them just to see the television clearly. A man of my standing shouldn’t need glasses.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. AlCorta. It can be frustrating when changes happen with your vision, especially when it affects your daily life. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. “Fading” is a good way to describe it. To help me understand a bit better, can you tell me approximately how long you’ve been noticing this change?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It’s… hard to pinpoint precisely. Perhaps six months, give or take? It began subtly, a slight blurriness, and I simply attributed it to fatigue. One gets tired, you know. But it’s progressed since then. I suppose I should have come sooner, but… frankly, I didn’t think much of it at first. It just seemed like a natural… decline. A regrettable one, naturally.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. AlCorta. It’s common to dismiss early changes. Six months is helpful information. And you’re right, sometimes it is just a natural change. Now, is this blurriness consistent, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Consistent, I’d say. Though… on exceptionally bright days, it seems… worse. More pronounced. Not that we get many of those around here, thankfully. It's not as if I spend my days staring into the sun, you understand. I mostly read, or… used to read. Before it became such a strain. It’s rather bothersome, to be honest. One expects a certain clarity when one is a reader.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Clarity is important, especially for a reader. The fact that it seems worse on bright days is also useful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick eye exam, if that’s alright. It will just involve shining a light in your eyes and checking your peripheral vision. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: An… examination? Yes, I suppose. As long as it won't take too long. I have… commitments this afternoon. Important ones. Though, I daresay I can spare a few moments for… science. Just be gentle, Doctor. I have rather sensitive eyes. And please, no poking. I dislike poking.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. AlCorta. I'll be as gentle as possible, and absolutely no poking, I promise. It should only take a few minutes. Okay, Mr. AlCorta. Everything appears normal on initial examination, but I do notice your peripheral vision seems a little narrower than it should be. It’s subtle, but worth investigating further. Do you have any family history of eye problems, such as glaucoma or macular degeneration?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmm. My mother… she wore glasses, I believe. But she wasn’t particularly forthcoming about such things. A rather… private woman. My father… he was a coal miner. Didn’t have much use for eyesight, I suspect. Mostly darkness down there. As for glaucoma or… macular degeneration, I couldn’t say. We weren’t the sort to discuss such… ailments. It's not as though preventative care was a priority in my upbringing. We treated things when they became unbearable, not before.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Given the slight constriction in your peripheral vision and the fact that it’s been progressing over six months, I’d like to recommend a visual field test. It’s a non-invasive test that maps out your entire field of vision and can help us determine if there's any damage or narrowing. Would you be willing to schedule that?
PATIENT: A… test? More tests. Honestly, Doctor. Is this entirely necessary? I feel perfectly… adequate. Perhaps a bit strained, but adequate. I have a great deal on my plate, you understand. Commitments. Important ones. A visual field test sounds… time-consuming. And frankly, I’m not certain I have the time. Is there not a simpler solution? A stronger prescription for my glasses, perhaps? I assure you, I can manage. I always have.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. AlCorta. I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn’t think it was important. A stronger prescription for your glasses will only help with your current vision, it won’t address the potential cause of the narrowing in your peripheral vision. The visual field test is the best way to determine what’s going on. It's a relatively quick test, about 20-30 minutes. It's important to rule out anything serious, such as glaucoma, which can lead to permanent vision loss if left untreated. Early detection is key. Given your age and the progressive nature of your symptoms, I strongly recommend it. We can schedule it for as soon as possible. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Glaucoma, you say? Permanent vision…loss? Well. That… changes things. If it truly is a matter of preventing loss, then… yes. Yes, schedule the test. As soon as possible, you said? The sooner the better, I suppose. Though I still maintain this is an unnecessary inconvenience. A rather significant one, I might add. But… loss is unacceptable. Schedule it, Doctor. Please. And try to make it brief. I have… commitments, you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. AlCorta. I’ve scheduled you for a visual field test tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. It should take about 30 minutes, and we’ll get the results back quickly. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a referral to an ophthalmologist, just in case. They are the specialists in eye care and can provide a more comprehensive evaluation if needed. We'll discuss the results tomorrow and decide on the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: An ophthalmologist? More specialists. Very well. A referral, then. This is becoming quite the ordeal. No, I don't believe I have any… questions. Just… please, ensure the technician is gentle. And efficient. I truly haven't the time for protracted examinations. Is there anything I should… prepare for? Anything at all? Besides the inconvenience, naturally.
DOCTOR: I will certainly make a note to request a gentle technician, Mr. AlCorta. As for preparation, just ensure you are wearing your glasses or contacts, if you normally wear them. And it’s helpful to avoid caffeine before the test, as it can sometimes affect the results. Otherwise, just relax and try not to worry. We'll do our best to make it as quick and efficient as possible. I'll have the receptionist give you all the necessary paperwork and instructions before you leave. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is all. Paperwork… excellent. Thank you, Doctor. Though I still maintain this entire process is… excessive. But I appreciate your… thoroughness. And your promise of a gentle technician. I suppose one must endure inconveniences to avoid… loss. Good day to you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. AlCorta. I understand your concerns, and we’ll do everything we can to make this as smooth as possible. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before your appointment tomorrow. Have a good day as well, and drive safely.
