DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Ambris. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, please, tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's probably nothing, but my ex-husband keeps complaining. Says my breath smells...off. It's embarrassing, really. I work outside all day, it could be anything. I don’t have time for this, to be clear.
DOCTOR: "Off," you say. I see. While it may seem trivial, halitosis – or bad breath, as most people refer to it – can be indicative of underlying issues. Though, I agree, it’s often not serious. Still, we should explore the possibilities. You mentioned working outside. What sort of work do you do, specifically?
PATIENT: Highway maintenance. You know, picking up litter, fixing potholes, that sort of thing. It’s…physical. And dusty. Really dusty. I drink a lot of coffee to get through the day, if that matters. I really don't see what this has to do with anything, though. It’s not like I'm not used to hard work.
DOCTOR: Highway maintenance…yes, that certainly presents several potential contributors. The physical exertion, the dust...and, as you mentioned, the coffee. Coffee can contribute to dry mouth, which can exacerbate the issue. However, we need to rule out other causes. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I don’t usually pay attention to…details. Look, I’m a practical person. I just want to know if I need to worry, or if I should just tell him to get over it. It’s not like I can just…stop breathing. Is that a thing? Do people even get bad breath from, like, their lungs? I really don’t have time for a lecture on…body stuff.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Ambris, you do not get bad breath from your lungs, not typically. However, lung conditions can sometimes contribute, though it’s less common. What I'm attempting to ascertain is if there are other accompanying issues. Do you experience any frequent heartburn, indigestion, or a sour taste in your mouth?
PATIENT: Ugh, sometimes. I eat pretty badly, honestly. Fast food mostly. It's convenient when you're working 12-hour shifts. I take antacids sometimes, when it gets really bad. That's about it. Look, is this going to take long? I have a…situation I need to get back to. It's…personal. And frankly, this is a bit humiliating. I just want a quick fix.
DOCTOR: Antacids…yes, that’s helpful information. While a quick fix is ideal, we need to be thorough, even with what seems a minor complaint. Fast food and infrequent, irregular meals can contribute to gastroesophageal reflux, which, as you know, is acid reflux, and can contribute to halitosis. Let's perform a brief oral examination and check for any obvious signs of decay or infection. Also, I'll check your oxygen saturation levels just to be certain. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I'm being interrogated. It’s just bad breath. People get bad breath all the time. It’s not…a disease. Do you really need to check my oxygen? This is ridiculous. But fine, do whatever you need to do. Just…hurry.
DOCTOR: It’s a matter of due diligence, Ms. Ambris. We must rule out all possibilities. Now, please open your mouth for me. I'm simply assessing the condition of your oral mucosa and checking for any obvious sources of odor. Your oxygen saturation is 98%, which is within a normal range. Your gums appear slightly inflamed, and there is some visible plaque buildup. No obvious lesions. This suggests a potential issue with oral hygiene, which is common given your work schedule and dietary habits. However, to be absolutely certain, I recommend a referral to a dentist for a comprehensive cleaning and evaluation. They can assess for any underlying dental problems.
PATIENT: A dentist? Seriously? I haven't been to the dentist in…years. It’s expensive, and honestly, I have other priorities. Is there anything else I can do? Like…a really strong mouthwash? Look, I'm not made of money. And I don't have time for appointments. This is getting ridiculous. Can’t you just…give me something? Anything?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ambris, while I understand your concerns about cost and time, neglecting dental hygiene can lead to more serious health problems down the line. A comprehensive dental exam is the most prudent course of action. However, to address your immediate concerns, I can recommend a therapeutic mouthwash containing chlorhexidine gluconate. It's an antiseptic that can temporarily reduce the bacteria causing the odor. It is not a substitute for professional dental care, and prolonged use can cause staining. Also, maintaining adequate hydration and reducing coffee consumption may provide some temporary relief. I will write you a prescription for the mouthwash. I strongly urge you to schedule a dental appointment as soon as possible. If the halitosis persists despite these measures, or if you experience any other symptoms – such as a fever, difficulty swallowing, or changes in your taste – you must seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before I finalize this prescription?
PATIENT: No allergies. Just…a general dislike for doctors and dentists. Look, thanks, I guess. Can I go now? I really need to get back to things. And honestly, I'm not promising I'll go to the dentist. It's just…not a priority. I'll try the mouthwash. Hopefully, that’ll shut him up. Is there anything else? Please, tell me. I need to know if I’m free to go.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Ambris. I have documented our discussion and provided a prescription for a therapeutic mouthwash. As I stated, I strongly recommend a dental evaluation. However, I respect your autonomy. If you experience any fever, difficulty swallowing, chest pain, or changes in your taste, seek immediate medical attention. You are free to go now. I wish you well.
