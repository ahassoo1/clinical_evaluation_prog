DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepbro. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, um… well, it’s a bit awkward to talk about, truthfully. It’s… pain. Down there. Yes, in… that area. It’s been bothering me for a little while now, and… well, I thought it best to get it checked. I don’t really… recall exactly when it started, if I’m honest. It feels… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: “Down there,” you say. Alright. It’s perfectly alright to discuss these things with me; that’s what I’m here for. When you say “uncomfortable,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. I apologize. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Sometimes it feels… sharp, quickly, and then it’s gone. It’s not constant, thankfully. And… it seems to get worse after I've been… working. With the wood, you know? I do a lot of bending and lifting. I… don’t know if that has something to do with it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A dull ache with occasional sharp pains, worse after physical activity, specifically bending and lifting… yes, that's helpful. And you work with wood, so a physically demanding job. Now, could you tell me a little more about where exactly you're feeling this pain?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… difficult to explain precisely. It’s… in the… well, in the sack, I suppose? That sounds… crude, doesn’t it? It’s not inside the sack, exactly. More… around it. And… sometimes it radiates. Goes down… that way. I’m terribly sorry. I’m not very good at describing these things. It’s just… a general discomfort in that whole region.
DOCTOR: "The sack," as you put it, and radiating downwards... Alright. It sounds like we're focusing on the pelvic region, potentially including the labia. Is the pain on one side more than the other, or is it fairly equal?
PATIENT: Oh… labia. Yes, that’s the word. Thank you. And… hmm. Let me think. I believe it’s… more on the left side, yes. Definitely more noticeable on the left. It’s not a sharp difference, but… if I had to point to where it bothers me the most, it would be there. It feels… heavier on that side, sometimes. Does that make any sense at all? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, it's alright. You're describing things as best you can, and that’s what’s important. Heavier on the left… Okay. And has this sensation – the ache, the sharpness, the feeling of heaviness – been getting progressively worse, or has it stayed relatively constant over time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. It’s… difficult to say, honestly. I think it has been getting a little worse, slowly. Not suddenly, you understand. Just… a gradual increase in discomfort. It wasn't bothering me enough to seek help before, but lately it’s been… more insistent. And like I said, the work makes it worse. I'm beginning to worry it's something serious, but… I don’t know. I haven’t had any… changes, if you know what I mean. No… lumps or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepbro. And just to clarify – no noticeable lumps, no changes in discharge, no fever, no pain with urination?
PATIENT: No… no lumps, that’s correct. No changes in… discharge. And definitely no fever. And no pain when I… go to the bathroom. That hasn't happened. I’ve been trying to think very carefully about everything, to be helpful. It's just… the ache and the occasional sharp pain. And the heaviness on the left side. Oh, and it sometimes feels… warm. Not a fever warm, but… a little warmer than usual, in that area. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, no pain with urination, no changes in discharge. The warmth… yes, that’s something to note. Now, have you experienced any vaginal bleeding outside of your normal menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no bleeding. Definitely not. My… cycle is usually very regular. It’s been… a while since I had any issues. No bleeding at all, Doctor. I’m quite certain of that. This has been… mostly just the discomfort. And the worrying, if I’m honest. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepbro. Before we proceed, can you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… medical history. That’s… a bit complicated. I haven’t seen a doctor in… well, quite a long time. I've generally been very healthy, thankfully. I had… the usual childhood illnesses, you know? Chickenpox, measles… but nothing serious. I had a… difficult childbirth, many years ago. That required some… interventions. But I haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries since then. I take a daily vitamin, and… that’s about it. I don’t have any known allergies. Does that… suffice? I don’t remember much beyond that, truthfully. My memory… isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Difficult childbirth with interventions… and a daily vitamin. No known allergies, no major illnesses or surgeries. Now, regarding your family history – are there any instances of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or other gynecological cancers in your mother, sisters, or daughters?
PATIENT: Oh. Family history… That’s… a difficult question. My mother… she passed away many years ago, from… heart trouble, I believe. I don’t… recall anyone having cancer, specifically. My sister… she lives far away, and we don’t speak often. I believe she’s healthy, but I honestly couldn’t say for certain. She doesn’t share much about her life. And I… don’t have any daughters. I'm terribly sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. My family wasn’t very… open about health matters, if you understand. It was just… not discussed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll proceed with what information we have. I'm going to need to perform a pelvic exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh… a pelvic exam. Yes, I… suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I’m… a bit nervous, truthfully. It’s been a very long time since I’ve had one. Will it be… uncomfortable? I apologize for all the questions. I just… I don’t like surprises. And as I said, my memory… I’m afraid I’m not very good at remembering instructions.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be nervous, Ms. Stepbro. And you have every right to ask questions. We'll take things slowly, and I’ll explain everything as we go. It may be a little uncomfortable, yes, but we’ll do our best to minimize any discomfort. I’ll let you know when I’m starting, and you can tell me to stop at any time. First, I’ll just have you lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the table. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds alright. Knees bent and feet flat. I can do that. Just… please tell me what you’re doing as you go, Doctor. That would… ease my mind a bit. I… I’m ready, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to gently drape a sheet over you to maintain your privacy. Now, I’ll begin with a visual external examination of your vulva. I'm looking for any signs of inflammation, lesions, or abnormalities. I’ll then use a speculum to gently open the vaginal canal so I can visualize your cervix. This may cause some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort. I’m going to start now…
PATIENT: Oh… that's… a little uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, but… a bit… cold, perhaps? Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, the speculum can be cold, Ms. Stepbro. We can warm it up more if you'd like. I'm just taking a look now. I do note some mild redness on the left labia. It doesn't appear to be a severe inflammation, but it is present. I'm also palpating your uterus and ovaries to check for any abnormalities. This may cause some pressure as well. Does that feel alright?
PATIENT: It… feels… a bit heavy. On the left side, like I said before. And… a little tender. When you… press there. Not sharp pain, but… a dull ache. It’s… similar to the discomfort I’ve been feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stepbro. That’s good to know. I'm stopping the palpation for now. I do feel a slight fullness on the left side, and it seems to be the source of your discomfort. It’s difficult to determine the exact cause without further investigation. I'm going to remove the speculum now. Just take a few deep breaths. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… better. Thank you. I… I'm still a little tender. And a bit… anxious, truthfully. What do you think it is, Doctor? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepbro. It’s difficult to say definitively without some further testing. Based on the examination, it could be a number of things. It's possible you have a cyst or fibroma on the left side, causing the fullness and discomfort. There’s also a possibility of a mild infection or inflammation. To rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order a pelvic ultrasound and a complete blood count. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes… an ultrasound. That sounds… sensible. If it will help determine what’s going on. And a blood count… yes. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I just… I want to know. I'm… quite worried, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll write you a referral order for the ultrasound and the blood work. The lab is located just down the hall, and the imaging center is a few blocks from the clinic. You can schedule an appointment at your convenience. I’ll also prescribe a mild pain reliever in the meantime to help manage the discomfort. Now, while we’re waiting for the results, I’d like to discuss some lifestyle modifications that may help alleviate your symptoms. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications? Yes… that sounds… good. Perhaps. What sort of modifications, Doctor? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have… a few commitments coming up.
DOCTOR: Alright. I recommend avoiding strenuous activities, such as heavy lifting or prolonged bending, to minimize irritation to the pelvic area. Wear loose-fitting cotton underwear and avoid douching or using harsh soaps in that region. Maintaining good hygiene is important, but gentle cleansing is key. As for the results, the blood work usually comes back within 24-48 hours, and the ultrasound results typically take 1-2 business days. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. Now, do you have any allergies I should be aware of before prescribing the pain reliever?
PATIENT: No… no allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. I've never had a reaction to anything. Just… that’s good to know. No allergies. And thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so… patiently. It’s… quite a relief.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stepbro. It’s my job. The nurse will review the instructions for the pain reliever with you before you leave. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, severe pain, or unusual discharge, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you again. For everything. I feel… a bit less anxious now, knowing we’re taking steps to figure things out. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stepbro. We’ll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the paperwork and discharge instructions. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
