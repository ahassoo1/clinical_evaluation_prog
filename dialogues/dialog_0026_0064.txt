DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Latisia Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my chest… it's been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. It feels… tight, you know? Like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Tightness in the chest… that certainly is something to look into. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… it started maybe a week ago? I was walking up the hill to the market – it's a steep hill, you know, and I get a little breathless sometimes, but this was different. It wasn't just being out of breath. It hurt. Not a sharp pain, more like… a heavy feeling. And it stayed for a while after I stopped walking. It comes and goes now. Sometimes when I'm just sitting, even.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started about a week ago with the walk up the hill, and it's not consistently there – it comes and goes. And even happens when you're resting. Is the pain related to anything specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don't think so. I mean, sometimes if I bend over too quickly, it feels a little worse. But mostly… just comes out of nowhere. Oh! And maybe when I get really excited? My daughter is visiting next week, and I was making plans, and I felt it then, a little bit. But I was happy excited, not scared excited. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So it seems to be connected to activity, even emotional activity, and bending over can exacerbate it. Does the pain radiate anywhere – down your arm, for example, or to your back or jaw?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Sometimes… sometimes it feels in my left arm. Not all the way down, just… the shoulder, and a little bit in the upper part of the arm. It’s not bad, but I notice it when it happens. Never in my back or jaw, though. Just the arm. And it’s always the left arm, not the right. I remember that for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know – left arm, shoulder, upper part of the arm. And it's consistently on the left side. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms with this chest tightness?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I get a little short of breath sometimes, like I said. And I have been feeling tired, but I thought that was just getting older, you know? Not sure if that’s related. Oh! And sometimes my stomach feels a little upset. Not bad, just… not right. Like maybe I ate something funny. But that happens sometimes anyway, so I didn’t think much of it. I haven’t been coughing or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, so shortness of breath, some fatigue, and occasional stomach upset. No cough. Now, let’s go over some general health questions. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years ago. I take a pill for it every morning. And I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Other than that… I think I’m pretty healthy for my age. I go to the market every day, you know, keep moving. My husband says I never stop! I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare is good to know. And thank you for letting me know about the high blood pressure and gallbladder removal. What about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not really. I mean, I sneeze a little bit when the flowers bloom in the spring, but that’s just normal, right? Nothing serious. No reactions to any medicine that I know of. I haven’t changed any of my medicine lately. Just the pill for the blood pressure, same one for years. My husband helps me keep track of it all. He’s very organized!
DOCTOR: That's good to know. So, no known allergies, and consistent medication. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Has anyone in your family had heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father… he had a bad heart. He was sick for a long time, and he had a lot of tests. I think he had something called angina? And he had to have a surgery, a long time ago. My brother, he has high cholesterol, and he worries a lot about his heart. Other than that… I don’t really know much about my family history. My mother didn't talk about it much. She was more worried about cooking.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful to know – your father had angina and surgery, and your brother has high cholesterol. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I don’t like smoking. My husband used to, a long time ago, but he quit years and years ago. He says it was the best thing he ever did. We both like to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but not too much. Just a glass or two. And I don’t do any drugs, if that’s what you’re asking. I like a clean life, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. So no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no drug use. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. It’ll just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. I'm just glad you're listening to me. My chest has been worrying me. Please, go ahead. I’ll sit right here.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I appreciate that, Sherion. If you could just loosen your shirt a little bit, that would be helpful. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92, but that's not entirely unexpected given your history. Heart sounds… I'm hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, and there's a faint murmur, but it’s difficult to assess completely. Lungs are clear. Your pulse is a bit fast, but not alarmingly so. I’m also palpating your chest. Do you feel any pain or tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Hmm… a little bit. Right there, on the left side. It’s not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It feels the same as the pain in my chest sometimes, but not as bad. Oh! And when you press there, I feel a little bit of that feeling in my arm, like a tingling. Just a little bit, though. It goes away when you stop pressing. It's hard to explain. It's not bad bad, you know? Just… noticeable. Like something is… off.
DOCTOR: I understand. A little bit of discomfort on the left side, a dull ache, and some tingling in the left arm when I press there. That's helpful information, Sherion. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, I think we need to do a few more tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I'd like to order an EKG, which will measure your heart's electrical activity, and a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart. I’m also going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a cardiac enzyme test. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Tests are fine. I just want to know what's wrong, you know? And if it's something serious… well, I want to take care of it. My husband can help me with all of it. He’s good at making appointments. Just tell me what I need to do. And where do I go for these tests?
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I understand your concern. We'll get this sorted out. You’ll need to go to the lab downstairs for the blood work, and the radiology department on the third floor for the chest X-ray and EKG. I’m going to give you a lab requisition form and an order for the radiology tests. The radiology department will schedule the EKG for you. It's best to get these tests done as soon as possible, ideally within the next couple of days. And I’ll have my nurse, Maria, give you some written instructions before you leave. The results will take a little time to come back, so we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in about a week. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A week is fine. A lab downstairs, and radiology on the third floor… I can remember that. And Maria will give me instructions. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little bit better just knowing what's going on, and knowing what to do next. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Like, should I be resting? Or avoiding anything?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. I'm glad I could ease some of your worries. In the meantime, I wouldn't do any strenuous activity. Gentle walking is fine, but avoid any heavy lifting or exercise. If you experience any new or worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don't hesitate. It's better to be safe. Otherwise, just continue your normal routine, eat a healthy diet, and get plenty of rest. And don’t forget to keep hydrated. We’ll review the test results at your follow-up appointment next week and discuss the best course of action. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve explained everything so clearly, Doctor. Thank you again for listening to me, and for taking such good care of me. I appreciate it very much. I’ll go find Maria now.
