DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, it's…well, it's blood. Coming from, you know, down there. Not a little, either. Happened a couple times now. It's…unpleasant. Frankly, I haven’t been feeling right for a bit, and this just made it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Blood in the stool, or from the rectal area, can certainly be concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. And you said this has happened a couple of times now?
PATIENT: Yeah, a couple. Last week, once. Then again yesterday. Not a huge amount each time, but enough to…notice. And it’s not like a cut or anything, it’s just…in the stool, mixed in. It's dark, almost black, if that makes sense. It scared my wife, before…well, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, dark, almost black stool. That’s important information. That suggests it might be higher up in the digestive tract. Have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean? I mean, I go when I gotta go. It hasn’t been…stuck, or anything. Regular as rain, always has been. Maybe a little thinner than usual, now that I think about it, but I figured that was just…what with everything going on, my stomach's been upset.
DOCTOR: Okay, thinner stools, alongside the dark stool and bleeding… And you mentioned your stomach’s been upset?
PATIENT: Yeah, kinda. Not full-blown sick, just…off. Bloated, mostly. And gassy. I thought it was just something I ate, honestly. I had some…spicy lamb the other day. Maybe that did it. My wife always told me I’d ruin my gut with that stuff, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Alright. Spicy lamb could definitely contribute to some stomach upset. Do you have any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain, Doc. More like…discomfort. A dull ache, lower down, mostly. Comes and goes. I can usually ignore it. It's not like a sharp, stabbing thing, if that makes sense. More just…annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that comes and goes. And this has been happening alongside the changes in your bowel habits and the bleeding for how long now, approximately?
PATIENT: Let me think… the upset stomach's been on and off for a couple weeks, maybe. But the blood… that's only been the last week, like I said. The ache started around the same time as the blood, I think. I'm pretty sure, anyway. Hard to keep track sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a couple weeks of stomach upset, with the bleeding and dull ache starting about a week ago. Have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No fever. And no throwing up. Not even close. I get a little queasy sometimes, maybe, but that’s just…nerves, I think. I don't handle doctors well. Always been that way. But no actual vomiting. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no vomiting. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Pre-existing… Look, I mostly just get the usual old man stuff. A little arthritis in the knees, nothing serious. High blood pressure for a while, but I was managing it with pills. Stopped taking ‘em a couple years back, though. Didn’t see much point, the doctor just wanted me to take more and more. And…well, my wife, before she passed, she took care of all the medical stuff. I don’t really keep up with that kind of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis and past high blood pressure. And you were managing the blood pressure with medication previously. Okay. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just my appendix, when I was a kid. A long time ago. That's it. Nothing else. I’ve always been pretty lucky, health-wise. Until recently, anyway. This blood thing is… unsettling, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal as a child. Do you have a family history of any digestive issues, like colon cancer, polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My father… he had some trouble with his stomach, towards the end. Something with ulcers, I think. But he never went to the doctor much, either. Stubborn old man, just like me. And my mother… I don’t really remember. She passed when I was young. Nothing specific comes to mind, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ulcers in your father, nothing specific from your mother. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. They gave me some penicillin as a kid, I think, and I was fine. I haven’t taken much in the way of medicine since. Like I said, I mostly just avoid doctors whenever possible. It usually makes things worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing. Not even aspirin. I don’t like taking pills. Just…water. Lots of water. And maybe a little ginger ale when my stomach's acting up. That's it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mr. Gentz. I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Specifically, I'll need to listen to your abdomen and do a rectal exam. This will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I gotta be honest. I’m not thrilled about the rectal exam part. Not one bit. Is there…is there anything else we can do? I just… I don’t like anyone poking around down there. Is it absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Gentz. It's not a comfortable exam, and many patients feel the same way. However, given the bleeding you've described, it's important to rule out any obvious sources, like hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or feel for any masses. It provides crucial information and is a standard part of evaluating this type of symptom. It won't take long, and I will do everything I can to make you as comfortable as possible. Would you prefer I explain the process in more detail?
PATIENT: Fine. Explain it. Just…keep it quick, alright? And don’t poke around too much. I really don’t like this. What exactly are you going to do?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have you lie on your side with your knees bent. I’ll put on a glove and use a lubricant. I'll gently insert a finger into your rectum to feel for any abnormalities, like tenderness, masses, or signs of bleeding. It’s a quick exam, typically lasting just a minute or two. I’ll be looking for the source of the bleeding and checking for anything unusual. Throughout the exam, please let me know if you experience any pain or discomfort. I'll minimize any discomfort as much as possible, and we can stop at any time if you're uncomfortable. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds…thorough. Look, I'm trusting you, Doc. But really, quick, alright? And if it's gonna hurt, just… tell me. Don't mess around. Just get it over with. I’m not fond of this at all. Just…get a room ready, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the assistant prepare the examination room. I’ll need you to change into a gown, and then we can proceed. I’ll be as gentle and quick as possible. We’ll get this done. It’ll be a moment.
