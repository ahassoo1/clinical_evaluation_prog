DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's lovely to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to be quite honest… I feel like I need a bit of a… reset, I suppose. A jumpstart. I’m eighty-seven years old, you see, and things just aren’t… running as smoothly as they used to. I still get out and about, but I tire easily. It’s hard to explain… just a little… sluggish, maybe?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. McNabb. It’s perfectly normal to experience changes as we get older, and wanting a “reset” is a very reasonable goal. “Sluggish” is a good way to put it. Could you tell me a little more about that sluggishness?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. It’s not painful, not at all. It’s more… like wading through water, sometimes. Getting up from a chair takes a bit more effort than it used to. And I don’t have the… pep, for lack of a better word, to do the things I want to do. I used to love gardening, but I find myself needing to sit down every few minutes now. My daughter says I should take it easy, of course, but… I just want to feel like myself again, you know?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand. It sounds frustrating to have your energy levels affecting things you enjoy. And wanting to feel like yourself again is a very valid concern. When did you start noticing this change in energy and effort, Ms. McNabb?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a good question. It wasn’t sudden, you see. It’s been… gradual. Maybe six months or so? It started with just feeling a little more tired than usual, and then… it just sort of built up. I thought it was just part of getting older, honestly. And the weather's been so warm, that doesn't help. But it’s starting to bother me, so I figured it was time to see someone. Do you understand? It's hard to pinpoint, like I said.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A gradual onset makes it trickier to pinpoint, but six months is helpful information. And it’s wise to address it now rather than letting it continue. Now, besides the tiredness and difficulty with activities like gardening, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My appetite hasn't been the best lately. Not that I don’t eat, just… not as much as I used to. And I’ve been sleeping alright, maybe a little too much, actually. I used to be a sound sleeper, but now I wake up a couple of times during the night. Nothing major, just… restless, I suppose. And… oh! My hands sometimes feel a little stiff in the mornings. Not awful, but noticeable. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, all of that is important, Ms. McNabb. Thank you for sharing. Changes in appetite, sleep patterns, and stiffness are all pieces of the puzzle. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear, medical history… that’s a bit of a long story, I’m afraid. I had pneumonia about ten years ago, but recovered fully. And I had my gallbladder removed maybe twenty years before that. Otherwise… mostly just the usual aches and pains of getting older! I see a cardiologist for my blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. I take a small dose of Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And I've been taking vitamins – a multivitamin and calcium – for years. Does that help? I don't remember many details, I'm afraid. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. McNabb. Don’t worry about the details. Lisinopril for blood pressure and vitamins are helpful to know. Let me just confirm: no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My daughter always double-checks when I get new prescriptions, just in case, but I’ve never had any problems. She's very good that way. A worrier, bless her heart, but a good one. I suppose it’s her job, now that I’m getting older.
DOCTOR: It’s wonderful that you have such a supportive daughter. Knowing about the lack of allergies is good. Now, just a few more questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any major health problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s another tricky one. My mother lived to be ninety-two, and she was relatively healthy for most of her life. She had some arthritis in her hands towards the end, but that was about it. My father… he had heart trouble, I think. He died when I was quite young, so I don’t remember much about it. And my brother… he had diabetes, but he didn't take care of himself very well, if I’m honest. It’s hard to say what’s inherited and what’s just… bad habits, you know? It's a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Yes, it can be difficult to sort those things out. Heart trouble and diabetes are helpful to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never smoked a day in my life! My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and I just never started. And I… well, I used to enjoy a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I haven’t had any in… oh, maybe a year now. It just didn’t taste good anymore. And my daughter… she worries about it, you see. So I just stopped. I suppose it’s easier that way. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It sounds like you're very considerate of your health and your daughter’s concerns. Thank you for sharing that. Now, Ms. McNabb, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your hands and feet. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. I haven't been to a new doctor in a long time, so I'm glad you're being thorough. It's just… sometimes I feel like my body is betraying me, you know? So anything you can do to figure it out, I appreciate.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. McNabb. It can be frustrating when your body isn't cooperating. Let's start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me… good. 138 over 76. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart… breathe deeply for me. Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs detected. Now I'll listen to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths… good. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. I notice a little bit of swelling and stiffness in your knuckles. Any pain with movement?
PATIENT: Just a little ache sometimes, Doctor. Especially in the mornings. It’s not sharp, just… a dull ache. It’s worse after I’ve been gardening, or doing something with my hands for a while. I used to knit a lot, but I haven’t been able to lately. It’s just… too uncomfortable. It’s probably just old age, though, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It could be arthritis, Ms. McNabb, but we'll need to consider other possibilities. The stiffness and swelling are consistent with it, but it's important to rule out other causes. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs and feet. Could you please extend your legs out in front of you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Oh, dear… I don’t do this very often anymore. It’s a little stiff. I hope you don't mind! I used to be quite flexible, you know. I even did a little bit of hula when I was younger. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. McNabb. Flexibility decreases with age, it’s perfectly normal. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but your strength seems good. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. No unusual sounds detected. Everything seems normal there. Okay, Ms. McNabb, that was helpful. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, there are a few things we should investigate further. Your symptoms – the fatigue, loss of appetite, sleep disturbances, and stiffness – could be caused by several different factors, including vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or early signs of a more general decline in function. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests sound perfectly alright. I just want to figure out what's going on. I don't want to just sit around feeling sluggish and tired. I want to feel like myself again, you know? What kind of tests are you thinking of? Will they be painful?
DOCTOR: They won’t be painful at all, Ms. McNabb, just a little pinch. I’m going to order a complete blood count to check for anemia or infection, a thyroid panel to rule out thyroid issues, a vitamin D level, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. We’ll also check your inflammatory markers to see if there’s any sign of inflammation. I’ll also want to do a sedimentation rate to see if there is any inflammation in the body as well. It's a pretty standard set of tests, and it should give us a good starting point. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll be able to draw the blood quickly. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. It all sounds… sensible. I’m just glad we’re doing something. I suppose it's better to know, even if the news isn’t good. When will I get the results? And… will I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: It usually takes about three to five business days for the results to come back, Ms. McNabb. The lab will let me know as soon as they’re available. I'd like you to schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week after that, so we can discuss the results and decide on a plan. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. A week is good. I’ll have my daughter call and schedule it for me. She’s much better at these things than I am. She worries, of course, but she's very organized. Is there anything else I should do in the meantime? Any specific foods I should eat or avoid? Or any exercises I can try? I'm just trying to be proactive, you know.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Ms. McNabb. In the meantime, it's a good idea to continue eating a healthy, balanced diet, and stay as active as you comfortably can. Gentle exercises like walking or swimming are great, but don’t push yourself too hard. Staying hydrated is also important. And please, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, don’t hesitate to call my office. We are always here to help. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough and kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and not dismissing my concerns. It's reassuring to know that someone is finally taking a look at what's going on. Thank you again. I'll let my daughter schedule that follow-up appointment.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McNabb. I’m glad I could help. I understand how frustrating it can be when you don’t feel like yourself, and I’m committed to getting to the bottom of things. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a wonderful day, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I think I’ll just go home and rest for a bit. It’s been a long morning.
