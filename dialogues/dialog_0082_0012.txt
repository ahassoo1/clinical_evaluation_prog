DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Velda. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise next month, and the cruise line requires a medical form to be completed. They need some information about my health, and my regular doctor… well, he’s retired now, and I haven’t found a new one yet. I was hoping you could help me with the form.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Velda. Happy to help with that. A pre-cruise medical form is quite common. Let's gather some information then, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be lovely. I have the form here with me, actually. It mostly asks about past illnesses and any medications I’m taking. I do hope I can remember everything! Though, surprisingly, I usually have a good memory for details.
DOCTOR: Wonderful, having the form itself is very helpful. Don't worry too much about remembering everything perfectly. We'll take it one step at a time. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was a wee girl, I had a rather bad case of scarlet fever, but that was over forty years ago. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree – a very silly thing to do, I admit! Other than that… I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and such, but nothing serious as an adult. I did have a bout of very bad flu a few years back, but that didn’t require a hospital stay.
DOCTOR: Scarlet fever, a broken arm… and a bout of the flu. That’s good to know. And were there any complications with any of those illnesses, as far as you recall?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. The scarlet fever… well, I just remember being very poorly for a week or so. And the broken arm healed perfectly, the doctor said. No lingering problems with either, thankfully. The flu was just unpleasant for a few days; a lot of aches and a terrible cough. I do recall being rather weak for a short time after the flu, but that passed quickly enough.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Ah, yes! I had my appendix removed when I was twenty-two. It was quite sudden, actually. A lot of pain, and then suddenly I was in the hospital. It went well, thankfully, and I haven’t had any trouble with it since. That was… oh, goodness, over twenty years ago now. It’s funny the things you forget, and the things you don’t!
DOCTOR: Appendix removal at twenty-two, no complications. Excellent. And are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had… well, she had a bit of trouble with her heart in her later years. It wasn’t a sudden thing, more of a gradual weakening. My father was generally very healthy, though. He lived to be eighty-five, which is quite good, isn’t it? My brother… he’s got high blood pressure, I believe, but other than that, I don't recall any major illnesses on either side of the family. Is that the sort of thing you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Knowing about conditions like heart trouble or high blood pressure is very helpful. Alright, and do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. I don't believe so, no. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication I’ve taken, and I eat most things without any trouble. I’m not particularly fond of shellfish, but that’s a matter of taste, not allergy! I’m quite a hardy soul, generally. I've never had any issues with bee stings or anything like that either.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. A cup of tea usually does the trick! I used to take a vitamin D supplement in the winter months, but I stopped a while ago. I try to get enough sunshine when I can. No prescriptions, no regular pain relievers… nothing at all, really. I pride myself on being fairly healthy, you see.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Velda. Now, to finish up the history, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I live alone now, sadly. My husband passed away five years ago. I keep myself busy, though. I volunteer at the local library a couple of times a week, and I enjoy gardening – roses are my specialty. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with my dinner occasionally. I try to get a good walk in most days, weather permitting, of course. I wouldn’t say I’m overly active, but I certainly don't spend all day sitting! I enjoy a quiet life, generally.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Velda. Now, before we finish, would you mind if I took a quick look at your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and perhaps listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I always trust a good doctor, and you seem very thorough. Go ahead, please. I’m quite a good patient, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything sounds good. Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let's see… based on what you've told me and the quick exam, there don't appear to be any immediate health concerns that would prevent you from enjoying your cruise. I can sign this form, stating that you are medically cleared for travel. However, just as a precaution, given your mother's history of heart trouble, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness on the cruise, please seek medical attention immediately. It's always best to be safe.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful to hear, Doctor! Thank you so much for your time and your thoroughness. I was a little worried, to be honest, but that’s put my mind at ease. I will certainly be very careful, and I will keep an eye out for those symptoms. My mother always said I should listen to my body, and I always try to do so. Is there anything else you would recommend I take with me on the cruise, just in case? Perhaps something for seasickness, or a basic first-aid kit?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Velda. For seasickness, an over-the-counter medication like dimenhydrinate or meclizine can be helpful, but it can cause drowsiness, so it’s best to try it before the cruise to see how you react. As for a first-aid kit, definitely bring some adhesive bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers like ibuprofen, and any personal medications you might need. And don’t forget sunscreen! Here's a list of things I recommend. If you experience any sudden or severe symptoms while on the cruise, don't hesitate to seek medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor! That’s a perfect little list, thank you so much. No, I don’t think I have any further questions at the moment. You’ve been wonderfully helpful and have put my mind completely at ease. I suppose… just one small thing. Do you happen to know if the cruise ship has a doctor on board? Just for my peace of mind, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, most cruise ships do have a doctor and a small medical facility on board. The quality of care can vary, of course, but they are equipped to handle most common medical issues. It’s always a good idea to check with the cruise line directly to confirm the availability of medical services and to understand their procedures. Well, Velda, it’s been a pleasure meeting you. I’ve signed the form, and I wish you a wonderful and safe cruise! Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns before you depart.
PATIENT: That’s very reassuring to know, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. You’ve been a true professional, and I’m very grateful for your time and attention. I will certainly enjoy my cruise much more now, knowing I’m in good health and well-prepared. Have a lovely day, Doctor Iuzzolino. And thank you once more. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Velda. Enjoy your cruise! And you have a lovely day as well. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
