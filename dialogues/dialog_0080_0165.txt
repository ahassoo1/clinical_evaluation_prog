DOCTOR: Hi Clide, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. Honestly? This fever keeps comin' back. It's been… a nuisance, really. Feels like it goes away for a day or two, then bam, right back. I just want it to stop comin' back, you know?
DOCTOR: I do know, that sounds incredibly frustrating. A fever that keeps returning definitely needs looking into. Okay, let's try to get a better understanding of what's going on. When did this first start?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… around the beginning of July, I reckon. Maybe the 5th? Yeah, around July 5th. It wasn’t too bad then, just a little warm, but it’s been gettin' worse each time it comes back. I don’t remember doin’ anything special when it started, just woke up feelin' a bit off.
DOCTOR: Okay, July 5th. And you said it comes and goes – about how long does each episode of fever last when it is present?
PATIENT: Usually… a day, maybe a day and a half. I wake up feelin' kinda achy, then get warm. Not a real bad shiverin' fever, more like a warm flush. Then it breaks, and I feel alright for a bit. Like I said, a day or two, then it starts again. It's… weird. Like clockwork almost.
DOCTOR: Alright, a day or two each time, and you’ve noticed a pattern. That is helpful. Besides the fever and aches, have you had any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Let me see… Not really. No cough, no sniffles. I’ve been a little tired, I guess, but I’m 65, Doctor! I’m always a little tired. No headaches, no stomach trouble, nothin' like that. Just the warm feelin’ and the achiness. It's just...annoyin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms besides the fever and aches. That helps narrow things down. Have you traveled anywhere recently, or been around anyone who’s been sick?
PATIENT: Nope. Haven't left the town in…oh, must be six months now. And no, nobody I've been around has been sick that I know of. My wife, Maria, she's been fine. We mostly stay to ourselves. I go to the market a couple times a week, but I don’t really talk to anyone there. It's usually pretty quick in and out.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, let’s go over a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ older, you know? The wife always tells me to go to the doctor more, but I don’t bother much with it if I'm not feelin’ real bad. I take a little somethin’ for my back now and then, but that’s it. I’m a chiropractor, Doctor, I mostly fix people, I don’t go to doctors!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you've been generally healthy. And I understand completely about being on the fixing end of things! Just to be thorough, what is the name of the medication you take for your back?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… uh… let me see. It’s a muscle relaxer. The little white pills. Maria gets it for me. I don’t really pay attention to the name, just take ‘em when my back flares up. It’s… I think it starts with a “C”? Or maybe a “M”? Honestly, I have no idea, Doctor. She handles all that stuff. I just know it helps with the pain. I don't take it every day, maybe two or three times a week when I've been bendin' a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, a muscle relaxer, taken as needed for your back. We can definitely look that up later to get the exact name. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. Never had a reaction to nothin’. Maria always asks when she gets my prescriptions, and they always say “none.” I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. No food allergies, no pollen allergies, nothin’. Just a little sensitive to bein’ cold, if that counts! But that’s just bein’ old.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been cut open, thank goodness. My wife always wants me to get my knee looked at, says it's botherin' me when I walk, but I tell her I’ve been walkin’ on it for sixty-five years, it’ll be alright. Never needed surgery, never had anythin’ that serious. Just the usual bumps and bruises.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… my mother, she had a little bit of trouble with her heart when she got older, but she lived to be 88, so it wasn’t too bad. My father, he was healthy as a horse, worked on a farm his whole life. My brother, he's got high blood pressure, but other than that, we’re all pretty healthy. Not a lot of serious illnesses run in the family, thankfully. That I know of, anyway. My wife knows more about that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart trouble in your mother, high blood pressure in your brother, otherwise generally healthy. Let’s talk about your lifestyle a little bit. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Nope, never smoked a day in my life. The smell always bothered me. And I drink… maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week? Nothing serious. Maria likes her little glass too. We don’t go out much, so it's usually just a quiet evening at home. Quiet and boring, mostly. But that’s how we like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, a glass of wine occasionally. And finally, are you currently taking any other medications besides the muscle relaxer?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the muscle relaxer when my back gets bad. I take a multivitamin every now and then, but that's it. Honestly, Doctor, I don't take a lot of pills. I like to keep things natural if I can. I've always been a pretty active guy, even now. Just tryin' to stay movin'. This fever is really the only thing botherin' me, and it's drivin' me crazy!
DOCTOR: Alright, that's very helpful. So, no other medications, just the muscle relaxer and occasional multivitamin. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, take your temperature, and check your lymph nodes, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. Get it over with, you know? I got a couple appointments later this afternoon, so the quicker the better. I appreciate you lookin' at it, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's causin' this darn fever.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let's get started. First, I'll check your temperature. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm just going to gently palpate your lymph nodes... Your lymph nodes are a little bit enlarged, but not alarmingly so. No significant tenderness. Now, I'm going to check your throat… say “ahhh” for me. Throat looks clear. Alright, Clide, everything seems relatively normal on initial exam, besides the slightly elevated temperature and the mildly enlarged lymph nodes. Given the recurring nature of the fever, and the fact that it's been going on for a while, I'd like to order a few blood tests just to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? I was hopin' to avoid that. I don't like needles, Doctor. But... if you think it's necessary. Alright, go ahead. Just… try to be quick, okay? I don't handle this stuff too well. What exactly are you lookin' for? You know, just so I have an idea.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Nobody likes needles. We'll be as quick as possible. And you're right to ask what we’re looking for. I want to check a complete blood count to see if there’s any sign of infection, inflammation, or anemia. We’ll also check your electrolytes to make sure your body is properly hydrated. And finally, I'd like to do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what's going on and help rule out things like viral infections, bacterial infections, or any underlying medical conditions that could be causing the recurring fever. It’s just a precaution, but I think it’s important to get a baseline, given how persistent this has been. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. Electrolytes, kidneys, liver… alright. Sounds… thorough. I guess if you think it’s necessary. So, where do we do this? And how long does it take to get the results? I got appointments, you know. I need to know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We have a lab right here in the clinic, so we can do it immediately. The phlebotomist, Maria, is excellent; she's very gentle. It will only take a few minutes to draw the blood. As for the results, it usually takes about 24 to 48 hours for them to come back. We’ll give you a call as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest and drink plenty of fluids. If your fever spikes above 101°F, or if you develop any new symptoms like severe headache, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, 24 to 48 hours. Alright. Fine. Let’s get it over with. And I'll remember about the emergency room. Maria, you said? Good. Lead the way, Doctor. I'm ready to get poked. And hopefully, figure out what's wrong with me. This fever is just... annoyin'. And I'm tired of bein' annoyed.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s go. Maria is just down the hall. She’ll take good care of you. And I understand your frustration, Clide. We'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Just try to relax, and take a few deep breaths. It’ll be over before you know it.
