DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. I’m Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… alright. Honestly, it's nothing serious. I just thought… well, a little encouragement from a proper doctor might be nice. You know, a card? Like you get when someone’s a bit under the weather. My sister, she gets them all the time. It’s a silly thing, I suppose, but it cheers people up.
DOCTOR: I understand. While we don't typically hand out "get well" cards, I'm happy to address whatever's bothering you and help you feel better. It’s good you came in. Perhaps we can figure out what's going on and address it. So, can you tell me a little more about why you thought a visit might be helpful?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not that something is wrong, exactly. It’s just… everything feels a bit blah, you know? Like a grey cloud hanging over everything. My husband, he says I’m being dramatic, but he always says that. It’s just… life, I suppose. But a nice card… it would just be a little something. A little acknowledgement. Honestly, I don’t even know why I’m telling you all this. It’s probably nothing. You’re a doctor, you’re used to people complaining about nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to come in and talk about feeling "blah," even if there isn't a specific illness. Sometimes just talking about it can help. And it's good you’re advocating for yourself, even if your husband doesn’t see it the same way. So, when did this feeling start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… Let me think. It’s been… well, since my eldest daughter moved away, I suppose. That was… oh, last October, was it? Yes, October. And then the winter was so long and dreary, and then spring just sort of… happened. It wasn’t a good spring, if you know what I mean. Just grey and wet. And now it’s August… and it still feels… like October. Honestly, it’s probably just the time of year. It gets to people, doesn’t it? You get less sun… I don’t know. It's silly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like this feeling started around the time your daughter moved away, and has persisted through the winter and spring. Has anything specific changed since then, besides your daughter moving?
PATIENT: Well… not really. My husband, he retired. Which is nice, I suppose, but he just mostly sits and watches television now. And he complains about his knee. A lot. It’s always something with that knee. He used to be so active, but now… well, he’s just different. And I’m trying to keep busy, I am. I do my gardening, I help with the church bake sales… but it all feels a bit… pointless, lately. Honestly, it’s probably just old age creeping up on me.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound like "just old age," Janeth. It sounds like you're going through a lot of changes, and it's understandable that you're not feeling your best. Changes in family dynamics, retirement, and feeling a bit… disconnected. These things can definitely affect your mood. Let's talk about some of your symptoms a bit more specifically. When you say "blah," can you describe that feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, symptoms… honestly, I don’t think I have symptoms. I’m not sick, Doctor. I just… don’t feel like doing things. I used to love my gardening, you know? Really love it. Now I just… look at it. And I feel tired, all the time. But it’s not a physical tiredness, if that makes sense? It’s… a tiredness in my soul, I suppose. And I’ve been… a bit more irritable, maybe. Snapping at my husband, things like that. He says I’m being difficult, of course. He always does. It's probably just the heat. It does funny things to people, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're experiencing a loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, fatigue, and increased irritability. Those are symptoms, Janeth, and they’re important to address. It sounds like you might be experiencing some symptoms of depression, but we need to rule out any other potential causes first. Do you have any trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Oh, sleeping… yes, actually. I used to sleep like a log. Now I just… toss and turn. I wake up several times during the night. Mostly thinking. Thinking about everything. About my daughter, about my husband, about the garden… about everything being a bit… grey. And then I can’t get back to sleep. I just lie there, staring at the ceiling. It's very annoying, honestly. And then I just feel even more tired in the morning. It’s a vicious cycle, isn't it? My sister says I should try chamomile tea. But honestly, I don't think tea is going to solve everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty sleeping, waking during the night, and racing thoughts. That's helpful information. Do you have any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… no, not really. I still eat. My husband, he makes a lovely stew, you know? But I don’t really enjoy it, if that makes sense? It just… doesn’t taste the same. Everything tastes a bit… bland. I used to love baking, but even that doesn't appeal to me much lately. I make it for the bake sales, of course, but it’s just… going through the motions, really. Honestly, I think I'm just losing interest in everything. It’s a bit sad, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re experiencing a significant loss of enjoyment in things you previously loved, and that’s definitely something we need to address. Before we go any further, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical conditions… no, not really. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. But that was just a routine thing. And I get a bit of arthritis in my hands, but it’s nothing serious. My mother, she had high blood pressure, but I’ve always been very careful with my salt. Honestly, I’m a pretty healthy person. I always have been. That’s why this is so… baffling, really. I just don’t understand what’s happening to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, some arthritis, and a family history of high blood pressure. That’s helpful. And I understand your frustration. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. I don’t take anything. I don’t like taking pills. They always give me a stomach ache. My husband, he takes something for his knee, but I don’t know what it is. He just swallows a bunch of them every morning. Honestly, I think medication is just a way for doctors to make money. That’s what my sister says, anyway. She’s very skeptical of doctors, you know? Always says they just want to give you more pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, allergies. I don’t have any allergies. I eat everything. My husband, he’s allergic to shellfish, but I love it. Honestly, I don’t know what people do who can’t eat shellfish. It’s so delicious. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, ever. I always tell people I’m a very sturdy person. I can eat anything, do anything. Well, not anymore, perhaps. But I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no allergies. Janeth, based on what you’ve told me – the loss of interest in activities, fatigue, sleep disturbances, irritability, and changes in appetite – it’s possible you’re experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it’s important to rule out any other potential underlying medical causes first. I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to check your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam… honestly, I don't see what good that will do. It's not like anything is wrong with my body. It's just… my mind, you know? But alright, I suppose. If you think it's necessary. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. My husband is expecting me home to make dinner. He’s not a very good cook, you see. Though, honestly, nothing tastes very good these days anyway.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I’ll keep it as brief as possible. It’s just a routine check – I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your thyroid. It will help us rule out any other potential causes for how you’re feeling. First, let's check your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. But honestly, I'm sure it's just a phase. Everything goes in phases, doesn't it? I'm sure I'll snap out of it eventually. My sister always says I worry too much. She’s very practical, you see. Doesn’t believe in all this… feeling things so deeply. Just get it over with, Doctor. I have a stew to worry about.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. It’s not drastically high, but it’s something we should keep an eye on. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in... and out... Again...deep breath in... and out... Everything sounds clear, but I’ll also quickly palpate your thyroid gland. Your thyroid feels normal as well. Everything physically seems okay at first glance. However, given your symptoms, I recommend we get some blood work done to rule out any underlying medical causes, such as thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, blood work… honestly, I hate needles. But alright, if you think it’s necessary. I just hope it doesn’t take too much blood. My sister always says I’m a bit of anemic. Though, I don’t know what that means exactly. And she also says I worry too much, so… perhaps I shouldn't worry about it. Just get it over with, Doctor. And please be quick. I really need to get home and start the stew. It’s a long recipe, you know. Lots of chopping involved.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the needle, and we’ll only take a small amount of blood. It’s a standard panel – it will check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and some basic blood counts. It will help us get a better understanding of what’s going on. I'll write you a requisition for the lab. It's at the clinic across the street, and you don’t need an appointment. Once you’ve had the blood work done, you can either bring the results back here, or have them sent directly to me. In the meantime, I'd also like to discuss some potential coping strategies and resources that may be helpful. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Oh, coping strategies... honestly, I don't know about all that. I'm not one for… talking about my feelings. My husband says I bottle things up too much. But alright, I suppose I can listen. As long as it doesn't take too long. And no chamomile tea suggestions, please. I've tried that. It doesn't work. Just… tell me something practical. Something I can actually do. Because honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel like myself again. I miss my gardening. I miss baking. I miss… just feeling happy.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. You miss feeling like yourself, and that’s what we’re going to work towards. Practical steps… one thing that can be really helpful, especially when you're feeling low, is to re-introduce small activities back into your routine. Things you used to enjoy, even if you don't feel like doing them at first. Start small – maybe spend just 15 minutes in the garden, even if it's just weeding one pot. Or bake a small batch of cookies, even if you don’t eat them all. The goal isn’t to suddenly feel happy, it’s to just gently remind yourself of the things you enjoy. Another important thing is to try and maintain some level of social connection. Even if you don’t feel like it, spending time with loved ones, or engaging in a social activity, can be incredibly beneficial. We can also explore some gentle exercise options, as physical activity can have a significant impact on your mood. Would you be interested in discussing some of these options further, or perhaps referring you to a therapist who can provide more specialized support?
PATIENT: Oh, a therapist... honestly, I don't know about all that. That sounds… a bit much. I'm not one for sharing my problems with strangers. And as for the gardening and baking… I suppose I can try. But honestly, Doctor, it all feels so… pointless. What’s the point of baking cookies if I don’t even enjoy them? And what’s the point of gardening if I just end up feeling… sad? It's just… everything feels a bit grey, you know? Maybe it's just the summer. It’s been a strange summer. Too hot, too humid… everything feels… off. Just… tell me something simple. Something I can do right now. Something that will make me feel… a little bit better. Even if it’s just for five minutes.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask for something simple, something right now. Sometimes, focusing on the bigger picture can be overwhelming. Okay, here's something simple. Right now, take three deep breaths. In slowly through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Focus on the sensation of your breath – the rise and fall of your chest, the air entering and leaving your lungs. Just three deep breaths. That’s it. It won’t solve everything, but it can help calm your nervous system and bring you back to the present moment. And sometimes, that’s enough, just for five minutes. We’ve discussed some of the next steps – blood work, exploring small activities. I’m also going to give you a handout with some local resources, including some support groups. You don’t have to participate, but it’s there if you’re interested. I'll also write up a summary of our conversation and a plan for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Three breaths. It didn't… fix anything. But it's… quieter, maybe. Just a little bit. A handout… alright. I'll look at it. Eventually. Honestly, I doubt it will help. But… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for not telling me I'm just being dramatic. My sister always says that. Just… give me the handout. And let me get home to my stew. It's probably burning by now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janeth. And you’re right, it won't fix everything overnight. It's a process. And it's okay to feel however you're feeling. Here's the handout, and I've also written a summary of our conversation and a plan for the blood work. The lab is just across the street. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. And I hope the stew isn't too burnt. Take care of yourself, Janeth.
