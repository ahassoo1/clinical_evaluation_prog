DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I have… something coming from my ear. A liquid, you understand? It is… discharging, I think is the word. It started maybe three days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a discharge from your ear for the past three days. Can you describe the liquid for me?
PATIENT: It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little bit… yellow, but not much. Not thick, you understand? More like water. And… it does not smell, if that is important. I clean it with a tissue, but it comes back.
DOCTOR: No, that is important. No smell is good. And you said it's clear, mostly, with a little yellow sometimes. Is it happening constantly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. More when I lie down, I think. If I am sitting up, it is… less. Not always gone, but much smaller amount. And… sometimes a little bit of… a feeling. Not pain, exactly. Like pressure, maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s more noticeable when you’re lying down and you're experiencing a pressure sensation, not pain. Have you noticed any hearing changes – like muffled hearing, ringing in your ear, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My hearing… is not so good in that ear now. A little bit muffled, yes. And… sometimes I feel a little bit… unsteady. Not falling down unsteady, but… not quite right. Like… the room is moving a little. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Radillo. Thank you for being so clear. Have you had any fever, chills, or any other symptoms like a sore throat or cough?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No chills. My throat is fine, and I do not cough. I feel… normal, besides the ear. Just this… discharge and the hearing. I eat normally, sleep normally. No other problems.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any ear infections before, or any ear surgery?
PATIENT: Yes, when I was a boy. Maybe eight years old. My mother took me to the doctor. He gave me… drops for the ear. It went away. No surgery, never. I have not had any problems with my ears since then, until now. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Do you recall if there was any specific reason for the infection then?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not remember. I was very young. She just said I had an ear ache. It was very painful, she said. I remember being sick, but not… why. Perhaps a cold? It was a long time ago, as I said. I do not have good memory for things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. And what about any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu, even a mild one?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… maybe a small cold, two weeks ago? Just a little bit of… sniffles. Not a bad cold, I did not even take medicine. It went away quickly. It did not feel important. But… perhaps that is connected? It is possible, yes. I am not a doctor.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, Mr. Radillo. Let's take a look at your ear. I'm going to use an otoscope to examine your ear canal and eardrum. It doesn’t hurt, but please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I will sit when you are ready. Please tell me if you see anything… unusual. I trust your judgement. I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Radillo, just relax and let me take a look. I see some redness and swelling in your ear canal, and your eardrum appears to be slightly bulging. There's also some fluid visible behind the eardrum. It appears you have an outer ear infection, likely stemming from the recent mild cold. It’s called otitis externa, sometimes called swimmer’s ear, though you don’t need to be a swimmer to get it. It looks inflamed, which explains the pressure and discharge you're experiencing, and the muffled hearing.
PATIENT: Ah. So, it is… connected to the cold, as I suspected? And the redness… that is why you see the problem? I am glad we know what it is. Is it… serious? Will I need… stronger medicine? I do not want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: It's good we have a clear understanding of what's going on. The cold likely created an environment where bacteria could grow in your ear canal. It's not usually serious if treated promptly, but it can worsen and lead to more significant complications if left unattended. We’ll start with ear drops – antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drops to clear the infection and reduce the swelling. I'll also recommend a pain reliever, like ibuprofen, if you experience any discomfort. We don’t want this to become a chronic issue.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. Ear drops… and ibuprofen. I understand. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. How long… will I need to use the drops? And… are there any special instructions? For example, should I avoid water in my ear? I do not swim, but I shower.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. The ear drops are typically used for 7 to 10 days, depending on how quickly your symptoms improve. It's important to complete the full course, even if you start feeling better before then. And yes, you should absolutely avoid getting water in your ear during this time. I recommend using earplugs when you shower or bathe to keep the ear dry. Also, avoid cleaning your ear canal with cotton swabs, as that can irritate the infection. Just gently dry the outer ear with a soft towel. Do you have any questions about those instructions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is very clear. Seven to ten days… no water… no cotton swabs. I can remember that. Earplugs for the shower. Thank you again for your help. I am relieved to know what is wrong and how to fix it. Is there anything else… I should be aware of? For example, should I come back if the symptoms do not improve?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Yes, absolutely. If your symptoms don’t improve within 3 to 5 days, or if they worsen at any point – if you develop a fever, severe pain, or any drainage from your ear other than the discharge we discussed – please contact the clinic immediately. We may need to consider a different course of treatment. I'll also provide you with a written summary of these instructions and the prescription for the ear drops. Do you have any other concerns I can address before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. The written summary is very helpful. Thank you for your patience and your clear explanations. I appreciate your time. I will follow the instructions carefully. Have a good day, Doctor Annesley.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Get well soon, and have a good day to you as well.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
