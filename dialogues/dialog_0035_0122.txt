DOCTOR: Good morning, Venus. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Alzoubi. It is… pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because… well, my memory. It is not what it was. I am 53, and recently, things… slip. It worries me, you see. I manage many properties, and forgetting details is… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Memory concerns can be very unsettling, especially when your work depends on being sharp. You said this has been happening recently?
PATIENT: Yes, “recently.” Perhaps… six months, maybe a little more? It is difficult to say precisely. Before that, I could recall everything. Every name, every detail of a contract… now, I find myself… searching. It is not constant, but enough to cause worry. I do have high blood pressure, the doctor told me some time ago. Perhaps it is related? I do not know much about these things.
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned the high blood pressure. That can certainly play a role in cognitive function. Six months… and it’s affecting your ability to manage properties, specifically recalling names and contract details?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. Names… I will meet someone, speak with them for ten minutes, and then… the name is gone. It is most embarrassing! And the contracts… I review them carefully, I think, but then I question if I missed something important. I have not made a serious mistake yet, thankfully, but I fear it is only a matter of time. I must be… proactive.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no major errors so far, but a growing worry about potential mistakes. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the memory issues?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… Let me think. I… sleep well enough, I suppose. Perhaps a little restless sometimes, but nothing significant. I have no… dizziness, or headaches. My appetite is normal. No… difficulty speaking, or seeing. It is mostly the memory. And… sometimes, a slight… confusion, perhaps? Like I am searching for the correct word, but it escapes me. It is not frequent, but it is there. I do not understand if this is important.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no dizziness, headaches, vision changes, changes in sleep or appetite. Just the memory lapses and occasional difficulty finding the right word. And you said six months... has anything else been going on in your life during that time?
PATIENT: Six months… well, my husband passed away two years ago. I have been… managing on my own since then. The properties keep me busy, it is true, but it is… lonely. I have tried to maintain a routine, but it is difficult. There is a great deal of… paperwork. And the association meetings, they are… demanding. I do not know if this has an effect. It is just… a lot. I have not changed anything major in my life, other than learning to be… alone.
DOCTOR: That is a very significant change, Venus. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and adjusting to life on your own while managing everything else is a lot to handle. Grief can definitely impact cognitive function, and so can stress. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. Just the… high blood pressure. I see a doctor regularly for that, of course. He prescribes medication, I take it as directed. I have no allergies, to my knowledge. I had… the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, but nothing serious. I am not taking any other medications currently, only the pills for my blood pressure. I do not… drink alcohol, and I do not smoke. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly vegetables and fish. I hope this is… helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… perfectly alright. I want to find the cause of this, if possible. I am ready when you are. I hope it is not… too bothersome. I have a meeting this afternoon, but I have allotted the time. I wish to be… thorough.
DOCTOR: We'll be as efficient as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes, coordination, and do a brief cognitive assessment. This just involves some simple memory and attention tests. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Very well. I understand. Simple tests… that is… reassuring. I am ready when you are. I will… try my best. I hope I do not… embarrass myself. My memory is already… troublesome.
DOCTOR: No need to worry about embarrassing yourself, Venus. This is a safe space, and it’s just to help us understand what’s going on. Okay, I’m going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Then, I’ll ask you to remember them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes. I believe I can… recall them. Apple, table, penny. I hope I… remember. It is strange, sometimes I recall things from decades ago, but forget where I put my glasses! Is that… normal? It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to experience those kinds of inconsistencies, Venus. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. Now, I'm going to ask you to subtract 7 from 100, and then subtract 7 from that answer, and keep going. Just tell me each answer as you go.
PATIENT: Ninety-three… eighty-six… seventy-nine… seventy-two… sixty-five… fifty-eight… fifty-one… Forty-four… Thirty-seven… Twenty… No. Twenty-nine. Twenty-nine! I am… I apologize. It is… more difficult than it appears. I am losing my concentration. Is this… bad?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Venus. You're doing fine. It's a challenging task, and many people struggle with it. It's not a test of your intelligence, just an assessment of your attention and processing speed. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief assessment we've done, it sounds like you're experiencing some cognitive changes, likely related to a combination of factors: stress, grief, and potentially, some age-related changes. The high blood pressure could also be playing a role. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. I recommend some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any deficiencies. I also think an MRI of the brain would be beneficial to get a more detailed look and rule out any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: An MRI? That sounds… rather serious. Blood work, I understand. But an MRI… Is it… painful? And what if… what if something is wrong? I… I am not sure I like the sound of this. Perhaps it is just stress, as you say. Maybe I just need to… rest. I do not want to… put myself through unnecessary worry. What do you… advise?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Venus. An MRI is non-invasive—it doesn’t involve any needles or surgery. You simply lie still inside a large machine, and it uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It's not painful, though some people find it a bit claustrophobic. We can discuss options to help with that if needed, such as medication to help you relax. As for what if something is wrong, the earlier we identify any potential issues, the better we can manage them. Many things can cause cognitive changes, and not all of them are serious. We need to get a clear picture before we can make any definitive conclusions or develop a plan. I’m not suggesting you have anything serious, but it’s always best to be thorough, especially given your concerns. Would you be willing to discuss the possibility of the blood work and the MRI with me?
PATIENT: Very well… blood work, I suppose I can manage. It is… unpleasant, but necessary, perhaps. But the MRI… If you believe it is truly necessary, then… yes. But I would like… assurances. What are we looking for, specifically? And what if… what if they find something? Will you explain everything to me, in… simple terms? I do not understand medical jargon. I just want to… know what is happening, and what my options are. And if it is something… serious, I want to know… what to expect. Is that… unreasonable?
DOCTOR: That is not unreasonable at all, Venus. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to be fully informed and prepared. I promise to explain everything to you in simple terms, without any medical jargon. With the blood work, we’re looking for vitamin deficiencies—specifically B12—thyroid issues, and checking for any signs of inflammation. The MRI will give us a more detailed picture of your brain structure. We’re looking to rule out things like small strokes, tumors, or any areas of damage that could be contributing to your cognitive changes. If we do find something, I will explain it to you in detail, discuss all your options, and refer you to the appropriate specialist if needed. We’ll face it together, step by step. I’ll write you a referral for the blood work today, and we can schedule the MRI for next week. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Next week… yes, that is… acceptable. Perhaps I will… prepare myself mentally. I do not like… surprises. And you will explain everything… simply? No… confusing terms? Very well. Do that, and I will… comply. I trust your… expertise. But please… no surprises. And if I start to… forget what you said, I will ask you to… repeat it. I apologize in advance. It is… frustrating for both of us, I am sure.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will explain everything in simple terms, and I will be happy to repeat anything as many times as needed. Don't apologize—it's my job to make sure you understand everything. And it’s perfectly normal to forget things, especially when you're anxious. I'll write the referral now. I also want you to try to reduce your stress levels as much as possible. Have you considered any stress-reduction techniques, such as meditation or gentle exercise?
PATIENT: Meditation… No. I have… too many things on my mind. Exercise… I walk sometimes, to the properties. But it is more… work, than relaxation. Perhaps… if I had someone to help me with the properties… the stress would be less. But that is… expensive. And I do not… trust easily. No, I suppose not. I will… try to rest. And I will… focus on remembering the words you gave me earlier. Apple, table, penny. It is… a small thing, but perhaps it will help. Thank you, Doctor Alzoubi. I appreciate your… patience. And your… reassurance.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venus. It was my pleasure. Remember, taking care of yourself is just as important as taking care of your properties. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your blood work and MRI. Here's the referral for the blood work. It lists the lab address and phone number. And to recap, we’re going to do blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies and thyroid issues, and an MRI to get a more detailed look at your brain. We'll discuss the results together, and develop a plan from there. Now, do you have any other questions for me today before you go?
PATIENT: No… I believe that is… all. You have explained everything… clearly. And I appreciate your… kindness. It is… reassuring to speak with someone who… listens. Perhaps… after the tests… if everything is… alright… I will consider taking a vacation. Somewhere… peaceful. Thank you again, Doctor Alzoubi. I will… see you next week.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venus. I'm glad I could help. A vacation sounds like a wonderful idea—definitely something to look forward to. Please take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week. Don't hesitate to call the office if anything comes up. Have a good day, Venus. .
