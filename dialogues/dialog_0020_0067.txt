DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Beinborn, you said? Yes… well, it’s this pain. When I take a deep breath, it hurts. It’s… somewhere in my chest, I think. Honestly, it’s hard to say exactly where. Been going on for a little bit now. Not sure how long, exactly. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain that comes and goes with deep breaths. That's good information to start with. It’s alright if you’re not certain on the timing, we can figure it out. Just to clarify, Mr. Ruocco, is it a sharp pain, a dull ache, or something else?
PATIENT: Hmm… a dull ache, I think. Not sharp. Not like being stabbed, you know? Just… uncomfortable. Like a heavy feeling, maybe? It doesn't really stop me from breathing, but I don't want to take a deep breath if I can help it. Does that make sense? It's a… nagging pain, if that helps. I'm not good at describing these things.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Ruocco. You’re doing perfectly fine. A nagging, dull ache that worsens with deep breaths… alright. And does anything else seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. Not that I've noticed. Sometimes… if I've been doing a lot of work, you know, lifting things… it feels a little worse afterwards. But I do a lot of lifting, so it's hard to tell. I used to build houses, construction work. It's just… what I do. I don’t know if that’s related. Honestly, I get aches and pains all over, being my age.
DOCTOR: I understand. Construction work is very physically demanding. It's good to know that it seems to be aggravated by activity. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this chest pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me think again. I get a little short of breath sometimes, but like I said, I'm getting older. I just figured it was… old age. No coughing, no fever… I don't think so. Maybe a little tired, but… who isn’t? I haven't really paid much attention, to be honest. It's just this pain that's bothering me. I just wanted to make sure it wasn't something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cough, no fever, just some shortness of breath and tiredness alongside the chest pain. It’s good you brought this to our attention, Mr. Ruocco. Now, have you had any medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. That's a good question. Let me see... I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. Must be… thirty years, maybe more? And… I think I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder. Other than that… not much. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. I don’t go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal many years ago and a broken wrist. And you said you don’t typically visit the doctor often. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I take a little something for my blood pressure, sometimes, but… that’s about it. The doctor gave it to me a while back. I can’t even remember the name of it. I don’t really keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and you take medication for blood pressure, although you don't recall the name. We can look that up in the system, don't worry. Now, I'm just going to ask a few quick questions about your family history, if that’s alright. Has anyone in your family had heart problems, lung disease, or any other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Hmm… my father… he had some trouble with his heart later in life, I think. But he didn’t go to the doctor much either. And… my mother, she had… something with her lungs, maybe? I was pretty young when she got sick, I don’t remember much. Everyone in my family… they didn’t really talk about these things. It’s hard to say. Not much help, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Ruocco, you’ve told me what you remember and that’s helpful. Alright. Now, just a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind?
PATIENT: Go ahead, Doctor. Whatever you need. Let's get this over with, if you don't mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the lower right side. And I hear some mild crackles in that area as well. Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit faint. I’m also going to feel your chest to check for any tenderness or unusual movements. There’s some mild tenderness on the right side, near the base of your lungs. No masses or unusual movements felt. Your pulse is a little weak, but regular. Blood pressure is 140/90.
PATIENT: 140… that’s not good, is it? I told you I take something for that. Diminished breathing… crackles… that sounds serious. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it my lungs? Is it something bad? I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: It's good that you brought this to our attention, Mr. Ruocco. The diminished breathing sounds and crackles could indicate some fluid buildup in your lungs, possibly pneumonia or even a bit of congestive heart failure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, even with medication, which we need to address. I'm going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and rule out pneumonia. I'll also order an EKG to check your heart rhythm. And I'd like to get some blood work done to check your kidney function and rule out other possible causes for your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-rays… EKGs… blood work… It's a lot, isn't it? But… yes, okay. If that's what you think is best. I just want to get this figured out. I'm tired of feeling like this. Can I still go home after this? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, we’ll get those tests ordered right away. And yes, you can go home after we get the tests done, but we will need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Depending on what the tests show, we may need to make some changes to your medications or recommend further treatment. I’m going to have the nurse draw the blood now, and then we’ll send you over to radiology for the X-ray and EKG. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m good. Just… hurry it up, if you can. I really do have things to do. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you looking into this.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. I'll let the nurse know to get started right away. .
PATIENT: .
