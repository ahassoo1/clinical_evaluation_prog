DOCTOR: Hi Jeannemarie, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… I have been… coughing up a little blood. It scared me.
DOCTOR: Okay, coughing up blood is definitely something we want to look into. That must have been frightening. Just to clarify, when you say "a little," could you estimate how much?
PATIENT: It is… not a lot. Maybe… a teaspoon? Two teaspoons, sometimes. It is usually with the… mucus when I cough. Not just… pure blood. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that helps quite a bit, thank you. So, a teaspoon or two mixed with mucus. And how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe about one week? It started suddenly. I thought it was just a bad cough at first, but then… the blood. It has not stopped completely, but it is not… every time I cough. Mostly in the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, about a week, mostly in the morning. And is the cough constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. More in the morning, like I said. And when I… exert myself. Like climbing stairs. Usually not too bad during the day if I am resting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so exacerbated by exertion. Have you had any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Um… I have been a little tired. More tired than usual, perhaps. And… a small fever, I think. Not very high, but I felt warm yesterday. No chills, though. And no pain… in my chest, or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and a mild fever. No chills or chest pain, that's good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: My… my husband, he passed away last year. From… cancer. Lung cancer. I… I was his caregiver. I have been healthy, mostly. No surgeries. I had the flu once, a long time ago. That is… all I can think of right now. It has been a difficult year.
DOCTOR: I’m so sorry for your loss, Jeannemarie. That must have been incredibly difficult. It's understandable if things are a bit hazy right now. And it’s good to know you've generally been healthy otherwise. Do you happen to know if you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I do not. I have not taken many medicines. Just… over-the-counter things for colds, sometimes. Nothing serious. I do not think I am allergic to anything. But I… I cannot be certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. I stopped taking my vitamins after… after my husband passed. I have not felt like… taking care of myself very well. I am sorry. I know I should be, but… it has been hard to remember things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Jeannemarie. Please don’t apologize. Grief can affect so many things, and it’s okay to not be at your best right now. Now, a quick question about your family history – do you have any family members with lung problems, like asthma, COPD, or cancer?
PATIENT: My father… he smoked for many years. He had… a cough, sometimes. I do not know if it was anything serious. He passed away when I was young. My mother… she was healthy, I think. No one else… I do not remember anyone with lung problems. But I… my family is not very close. I am sorry. I wish I could tell you more.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jeannemarie. You’ve told me what you know, and that’s perfectly fine. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never. My husband smoked, but I never did. I did not like it. It smelled… unpleasant. And I always worried about his health.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: I… I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. But not anymore. Not since… my husband. It does not feel right. I do not drink alcohol now. Rarely, maybe… one sip at a special occasion, but that is very rare.
DOCTOR: Okay, very limited alcohol consumption. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Um… Is it… serious? The blood? Is it… cancer? I am very worried, Doctor. It reminds me… of my husband. That is why I am so anxious. I am sorry to ask.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable that you're worried, Jeannemarie, and it's good you're asking. It could be a number of things, and cancer is certainly one possibility we need to rule out, but it’s not the only one. There are many less serious causes of coughing up blood. That’s why we’ll do a thorough examination and some tests to figure out what’s going on. We're going to take things one step at a time. Right now, it's too early to say definitively, and jumping to conclusions won’t help. Would you be comfortable if I listened to your lungs and did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, please. I… I want to know what is happening. I just want it to be… not cancer. But I understand. Please, do the exam. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope, and I’ll also check your heart rate and blood pressure. I may also take a look in your throat and feel your lymph nodes. Just relax as much as you can. I’ll start with your back. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Anything feel particularly tender or painful when I press here?
PATIENT: No… not really. Maybe… a little bit on this side. But it is not… sharp pain. Just… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little sensitivity on the left side. That's good to know. And how about here?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes. That is a little uncomfortable. Not too bad, but… I can feel it. Like a… dull ache. It comes and goes. It is probably nothing. I… I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any tenderness or swelling here?
PATIENT: Yes. A little bit on this side. It feels… swollen. But I do not know if it is always like this. I haven't… checked very carefully. It is probably just my imagination. I have been very anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel a slightly enlarged lymph node on the left side. It’s not significantly large, but it’s good to note. Now, let’s take a quick look at your throat… Say "ah" for me. Everything looks reasonably normal in your throat. No significant redness or swelling. Now, let's check your heart rate and blood pressure. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be due to your anxiety. Blood pressure is within normal limits. Alright, Jeannemarie, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I want to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, please. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to know what is wrong. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. I also want to order a complete blood count, or CBC, to check for signs of infection or inflammation. And, given the blood you’ve been coughing up, I think a sputum culture is important to see if we can identify any bacteria or other organisms. Lastly, I’d like to order a CT scan of your chest to get a more detailed image and rule out any other potential causes. These tests will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No… I do not think so. They sound… thorough. Is the CT scan… is it safe? I have heard… things about radiation.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. You’re right to ask about radiation. CT scans do use a small amount of radiation, but the benefits of getting a clear diagnosis and ruling out serious conditions usually outweigh the risks. We use the lowest possible dose to get a good image, and the amount of radiation you'll be exposed to is relatively low. We’ll also take precautions to minimize your exposure. Do you have any history of allergies to contrast dye, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. And my kidneys… I do not know. I have not been told I have any problems. I have not seen a doctor… regularly, since my husband passed. I am sorry. I should be more careful. But I… it has been difficult.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jeannemarie. I understand. We’ll proceed cautiously, and if there's any concern about your kidneys, we can adjust the testing accordingly. Okay, so we’ll get these tests ordered right away. The radiology department will contact you to schedule them. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you cough up a significant amount of blood – more than a few teaspoons – or if you develop a fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that is everything. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very… kind. And patient. I was very anxious, and you listened to me. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. It’s my job. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns at all. We’re here to help. I hope you feel better soon. .
