DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I’m kinda busy, so if we can just get straight to it, that’d be great. It’s my bruising. It’s been getting worse, even though I’m on the blood thinner. It just...happens with everything now. Barely bump into something and wham, big bruise.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you want to be efficient, and we will be. You're experiencing increased bruising despite being on a blood thinner – is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s exactly it. It doesn’t make any sense, does it? I mean, the whole point of the medicine is to stop the bruising, right? And it was working for a while, but now… not so much. I haven’t changed anything, Doctor. Same dose, same everything.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has this worsening been going on for?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three weeks ago? Hard to say exactly. It was gradual, you know? Not like one day it was fine and the next it wasn't. More like… slowly getting easier to bruise. Like paper skin or something. I really don’t like this, Doctor. It's worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks of gradual worsening. And you haven't experienced any other symptoms alongside the bruising – no bleeding gums, nosebleeds, heavier periods, blood in your urine or stool, fatigue, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just the bruising. I get tired, sure, but I'm always a bit tired. Nothing extra tired. And definitely no… blood anywhere, thank goodness. Honestly, I just want to know why this is happening.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what blood thinner are you currently taking, and what dosage?
PATIENT: It’s… Warfarin. Fifty milligrams, once a day, in the evening. I’ve been on it for… oh gosh, almost five years now, after the… well, never mind that part. Fifty milligrams, though, definitely. I check it regularly, my numbers are usually good. That's what's so strange!
DOCTOR: Okay, 50mg of Warfarin daily for almost five years, and you regularly monitor your INR. What has been the range of your recent INR values?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... I have it written down here somewhere. Okay, found it. Last three months… 2.1, 2.3, and… 2.0. So, mostly in the good range, you know? Between 2 and 3. It hasn’t been wildly off or anything. That’s why I don’t understand what's going on. It’s like the medicine should be working.
DOCTOR: Okay, those INR values are generally within the therapeutic range. To get a better picture, can you tell me about any recent changes in your life – new medications, supplements, diet changes, recent illnesses, or any falls or injuries you may have had, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No new medications, definitely. No supplements. Diet… no big changes. I've been eating pretty much the same. I had a cold a couple of weeks ago, but that was mild, just a sniffle and a cough. And no falls, no. I'm careful. I did start drinking a little more herbal tea, now that I think about it. Chamomile, mostly. But surely that wouldn’t… would that do something?
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild cold a couple of weeks ago and an increase in chamomile tea consumption. Chamomile can have some anticoagulant properties, though usually it's a pretty small effect. It's good you mentioned that. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Can I take a look at the areas where you're bruising easily?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. It's mostly my arms and legs, I think. And my back, a little. It’s like… anything touches me now. See? It's not like I'm getting beat up or anything, Doctor. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some ecchymoses in various stages of healing on your forearms and legs. They appear symmetrical. No signs of petechiae or purpura. Palpation reveals no areas of tenderness or swelling beyond the bruising. Capillary refill is normal. Let me listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, do you have any family history of bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My parents were… healthy, as far as I know. They’re both gone now, so I don’t really have much information. And my siblings… well, we don't really talk about that stuff. This is just… frustrating. I just want to feel normal again. Is it possible the medicine is just… wearing off? Even if my numbers are okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of bleeding disorders. It’s understandable to be frustrated, Ms. Hainley. It’s possible the Warfarin isn’t working as effectively as it once was, even with stable INR values. Sometimes, the body can develop a tolerance, or other factors can interfere with its absorption. However, before we jump to conclusions, let’s run a few blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I want to check your complete blood count, coagulation studies including PT/INR, and a liver function panel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Blood tests are fine. As long as we're getting somewhere. I just hope it's not something serious. I really don't have time for this, you know? I got things to do. When will I get the results?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll get the orders sent to the lab now. The results usually take 24-48 hours. The lab will likely contact you directly with how to access them, or my nurse will call you with the findings. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any activities that could cause injury, and if you experience any significant bleeding – nosebleeds that won't stop, blood in your stool or urine, excessive bruising – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. No major activities, watch for bleeding… got it. Look, I appreciate you trying to figure this out, Doctor. Hopefully, it's nothing too bad. Is there anything else I need to do? Or can I go now? I really do need to get going.
DOCTOR: Alright. No, I think that’s all for now. Just let us know if anything changes or if you have any concerns before we get the lab results. I’ll also have my nurse send over a list of instructions and emergency contact information for you. I’m glad we were able to discuss this, Ms. Hainley. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. You too.
