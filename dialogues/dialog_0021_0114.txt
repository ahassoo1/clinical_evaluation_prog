DOCTOR: Alright, Maribeth, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Maribeth Vanderwiele. And please, let’s try to be swift. I have a luncheon to attend later.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. Well, let’s not waste any time then. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s my breathing. When I lie flat, it gets… difficult. Like something is pressing on my chest. It’s been happening for, oh, I’d say a month now, maybe a little longer. It’s quite bothersome, especially when trying to rest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Difficult breathing when lying flat, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s not constant, mind you. Only when I am… horizontal. Sitting up, or even reclining a bit, is perfectly fine. It’s just… lying flat. Do you understand? It feels… constricted.
DOCTOR: Constricted… alright. And has this been getting progressively worse over that month, or is it fairly stable?
PATIENT: It’s… gradual. Not sudden. It wasn’t noticeable at first, just a little… effort to breathe. Now, it’s definitely more pronounced. I find myself propping up with extra pillows just to get comfortable enough to sleep. It’s… inconvenient, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Extra pillows, you say. Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this – any coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath when not lying down, swelling in your ankles, or chest pain?
PATIENT: No coughing, no wheezing. And thankfully, no swelling in my ankles. My feet feel alright. Shortness of breath? No, not really, when I’m sitting or walking about. Just… this difficulty when I try to lie down. And no chest pain, thankfully. It’s mostly just… uncomfortable. A tight feeling. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Tight feeling… alright. And are you on any medications currently, Maribeth?
PATIENT: Just what the doctor prescribed for my blood pressure, years ago now. A small white pill, once a day. And a vitamin D supplement, the little chewable kind. That’s all. I don’t take anything else, and I try to be very diligent about taking those two. Do you need the names of them?
DOCTOR: No, no, not right now. We can look those up if necessary. Have you had any recent changes to your diet or activity level?
PATIENT: No changes, not really. I eat fairly lightly, mostly vegetables and fish. And I take a short walk each morning, weather permitting, of course. It's not strenuous, mind you. Just a gentle stroll around the block. I haven’t altered my routine in months. I’m a woman of habit, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history, Maribeth?
PATIENT: Well, let me see. I had a gallbladder removed, oh, thirty years ago now. And I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Otherwise, I’ve been quite fortunate. Nothing major, thankfully. My blood pressure has been a bit high for a while, which is why I take the medication, but otherwise… healthy, I suppose. I’ve always been a fairly robust woman. Do you need more detail on any of that?
DOCTOR: Gallbladder, pneumonia… alright. And family history?
PATIENT: My mother had heart trouble, later in life. And my brother… he had diabetes. Both of them passed on, years ago now. I don't believe anyone else in the family had any significant health issues. It’s all rather… distant, truthfully. I don’t keep close track of everyone’s ailments. Is this information proving useful? I do hope we’re getting somewhere.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it could be a number of things. Let’s just listen to your chest and back, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you deem necessary. Just… please be swift. I truly don’t want to be late for my luncheon. I'm hosting, you see. It's quite important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Maribeth. If you could just lie down on your back, please. I’ll need to listen to your lungs and heart. Take a deep breath for me…
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, lying flat is… not ideal. Here we go. Deep breath… one… two… three… Is that sufficient? It's rather difficult, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright… and another deep breath… Hmm. Sounds a little diminished on both sides, but nothing terribly concerning. Let's listen to your back now. Just relax for me. ...and another breath. A few crackles here and there, but not alarming. Do you smoke, Maribeth?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always had a strong aversion to it. My husband smoked, unfortunately, but I never touched a cigarette in my life. It’s quite unhealthy, you see. And I’ve always prided myself on taking care of my health, despite my… age. It's a relief to hear it isn't terribly concerning, truthfully. What do you suspect it is?
DOCTOR: Well, it could be a bit of fluid buildup in the lungs, possibly related to your heart. Or it could be something as simple as age-related changes. It’s difficult to say for certain without some further testing. I’d like to order a chest X-ray, just to rule out anything serious. And perhaps an EKG, to check your heart rhythm. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An X-ray and an EKG… very well. Though I must confess, I am not fond of all these tests. It all seems rather… excessive. But if you deem it necessary, I suppose I have no objection. Just… please try to be as efficient as possible. I have a luncheon to prepare for, you know. And I’m the hostess. Will these tests be done here, at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can do both right here in the clinic. The X-ray will only take a few minutes, and the EKG is quick as well. We'll have the results back relatively quickly, hopefully within the hour. After that, we can discuss the findings and determine the best course of action. I'll get the orders sent to radiology and the EKG technician right away.
PATIENT: Very well. The sooner the better, truly. I appreciate your efficiency. I must confess, I’m starting to feel a bit anxious about all of this. I simply want to know what’s causing this breathing difficulty, and then… get back to my life. I have a luncheon to host, after all. And I have a reputation to uphold. Please, let me know as soon as the results are available. I trust you'll do your best to expedite the process?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I understand. I’ll let you know as soon as the results are in. The technician will be in shortly to perform the EKG, and radiology should be able to fit you in relatively quickly. Just try to relax, alright?
