DOCTOR: Good morning, Gabbrielle. I'm Neeraj Auelua, but you can call me Neeraj. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Yes, lovely to meet you as well. It's… well, it's my skin. It's a bit… off, colour-wise. Not a serious thing, I’m sure, but my husband insisted I get it looked at. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Right, your skin. A change in colour, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a rash, not itchy or anything. It’s just… patches. Sort of a… dullness, really. And it’s mostly on my arms and hands. I noticed it a few weeks ago, but I thought it was just the sun, honestly. Though I was very careful with sunscreen.
DOCTOR: Okay, patches of dullness on your arms and hands, noticed a few weeks ago. And you were being careful with sunscreen, so that’s good to know. Can you tell me a little more about where exactly on your arms and hands these patches are?
PATIENT: Well, it's mostly on the backs of my hands, you know, the part that gets the most sun even with sunscreen. And on my forearms, mostly the outer sides. Not on my palms, thankfully. It’s not… raised or bumpy or anything, just… less vibrant. Like the colour is… faded. It's difficult to describe. I'm not a doctor, you know. I organize things, I don't look at them.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, you're doing a great job describing it. "Less vibrant" and "faded" gives me a good picture. Have you noticed it getting worse, staying the same, or perhaps even improving at all since you first noticed it a few weeks ago?
PATIENT: It's… stayed pretty much the same, I think. Maybe a tiny bit more noticeable when I haven't been getting enough sleep. But honestly, that could just be my imagination. I've been a bit stressed with the archive renovations, so I’m probably just imagining things. It’s not spreading, if that’s what you mean. It’s just… there. Annoying, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, stable for a few weeks, possibly a little more noticeable with stress and lack of sleep, and not spreading. That's helpful. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any other changes to your skin recently?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm. Let me think. No… not really. It's not dry, not flaky. I haven't had any blisters, no new moles. It doesn't hurt, doesn’t itch, doesn’t burn. It’s just the colour. Honestly, it’s rather… uneventful. Which is why I suspect it's nothing serious. My husband just… panics easily. He thinks everything is a sign of something dreadful.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating when you feel like something is being blown out of proportion. Okay, just a few more questions, then I'd like to take a look at your skin. Have you been taking any new medications or supplements recently?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I take my vitamin D in the winter, that's it. And I haven't changed brands or anything. Same dosage, same everything. I’m very careful about what I put in my body, unlike some people. I stick to what works, you see. No experimenting. And certainly no new medications. My husband offered me something for my stress, but I refused. I don’t need chemicals to cope.
DOCTOR: Alright, no new medications or supplements. That’s good to know. Okay, if you’re comfortable, could I take a look at your arms and hands?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please, go ahead. Though I warn you, it’s not terribly exciting. It's just… dull skin, that’s all. I do hope it isn’t anything contagious. I have a rather important event next month.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There is some mild hypopigmentation – that’s a fancy word for a loss of colour – on the dorsal hands and forearms. It’s fairly symmetrical, and the skin texture appears normal. No scaling, blistering, or inflammation. Do you have any history of skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, or vitiligo?
PATIENT: Vitiligo? Good heavens, no! I’ve never had anything like that. My grandmother had a bit of rosacea, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t have eczema or… whatever the other one was. My skin has always been… sensible. I always used a good, gentle soap, and I’ve always been careful in the sun. I haven't even been sick in years. Honestly, I'm quite fastidious about my health.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of those conditions. That’s helpful. Now, have you been experiencing any other symptoms at all, even seemingly unrelated ones?
PATIENT: Unrelated ones? Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Perhaps a little fatigue lately, but that's just from the renovations at the archive. Endless paperwork, you see. And my husband's constant worrying doesn't help. But nothing… medical, as such. No fever, no chills, no weight loss. Just… normal life stresses, amplified by a very anxious husband. It’s probably just stress, isn't it? I’m sure it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: It very well could be. Just to be thorough, I'm going to order a basic blood test. It will check your thyroid function and vitamin levels, just to rule out any underlying deficiencies that could contribute to skin changes or fatigue. It's a routine precaution. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A blood test? Well… I suppose if you think it's necessary. I'm not terribly fond of needles, you understand, but I suppose a small prick is better than… whatever dreadful disease my husband is imagining. Yes, alright. A blood test, if you insist. But I expect it will show absolutely nothing. It’s probably just stress. When do I need to go for it?
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your apprehension. It's a quick procedure, and the discomfort is minimal. I'm sending a referral to the lab just down the street. They can fit you in anytime this afternoon or tomorrow morning. Here’s the paperwork with the address and phone number. They'll just need a small sample of blood. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend a good quality moisturizer, especially after washing your hands. And try to manage your stress levels as much as possible, easier said than done, I know. We'll discuss the results as soon as they come in, and if anything unusual shows up, we’ll investigate further. But for now, let’s not jump to conclusions. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. A moisturizer. I suppose that’s sensible. And… stress management. Easier said than done with him around. Very well. I’ll go for the blood test. And I’ll try to… relax. Though I make no promises. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose we’ll see what happens. I hope it’s nothing. Really, I do. .
