DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Let me see… well, my daughter, bless her heart, she’s been worried about me. I’ve been… having a little trouble sometimes. My arm feels weak, you know? Not all the time, just… comes and goes. And my family… oh, there’s been a lot of bad headaches on my mother’s side. That's what she told me, anyway. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I just want to make sure everything is alright.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weakness in your arm, and a family history of headaches. Alright. Let’s start with the arm weakness. Can you describe exactly when you notice it?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when, you say? That’s… tricky. It doesn’t seem to be after anything specific. Sometimes it’s in the morning, sometimes in the evening… I really can’t put my finger on it. It just… happens. It’s not painful, exactly. More… like it’s not listening to me, if that makes sense? Like it’s a little slow to respond. It doesn’t last long, though. Usually just a few minutes. But it worries my daughter, you see. She’s very thorough.
DOCTOR: I see. Intermittent weakness, not associated with any particular activity. And no pain. And you mentioned it doesn't last long – approximately how long would you say these episodes are?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… not long at all. Maybe… five, ten minutes? Sometimes less. It’s hard to say exactly. Time gets away from me, you know? It comes on, and then… well, it just fades away. Like a little cloud passing through. It doesn't happen every day, either. Some days I feel perfectly fine. It’s just… unpredictable. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Tofani. Unpredictable episodes of weakness lasting a few minutes. Now, let's talk about these headaches in your family. Your daughter mentioned a history of them. Can you tell me anything specific about who in your family had them, and what they were like?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches… my mother, she suffered terribly. And her sister, too. They were… very bad. I remember my mother being in bed for days sometimes, with a dark room and everything. I wasn't very good at remembering details, even then. They weren’t migraines, I don’t think. More… a constant, throbbing pain. They didn't go to the doctor much, back then. Not like now. It was just… something you lived with. My daughter said something about it being important to know, though. She’s very good at remembering things. I wish I was!
DOCTOR: Alright. A family history of severe, persistent headaches. Now, have you experienced significant headaches yourself, Ms. Tofani?
PATIENT: Oh, me? Well… yes, I suppose I have. Nothing like my mother, thankfully. Just… regular headaches, you know? The kind everyone gets. Tension headaches, my daughter calls them. From stress, maybe? Or not enough sleep. I take an aspirin, and it usually goes away. They don’t bother me much. I've never really thought much about them, to be honest. They're just… part of getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, occasional tension headaches that respond to aspirin. Now, let’s do a quick review of your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh dear, that’s a good question. I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, nothing too bad. And my blood pressure… it runs a little high sometimes, but I take a pill for that. The doctor told me to watch my salt, you know? Other than that… I think I’m pretty good for my age. I try to stay active, walk a little bit when the weather is nice. I’m not sure if that answers your question. It’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Arthritis and hypertension, managed with medication. Good. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill and anything for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think… I take a little something for my cholesterol, I believe. A small white pill. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take a sleeping pill. Just a half of one, usually. But that’s it, I think. My daughter keeps a list, you know. She’s very organized. I should probably ask her to come with me next time. I always forget something!
DOCTOR: Alright. We've got hypertension medication, a cholesterol medication, and an as-needed sleeping pill. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything. My daughter always asks me that, too. She worries about everything. I’ve never had trouble with pollen or anything like that. But if I ate shellfish, I might get a little tummy ache. But that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… doesn’t sit well with me. I avoid it, mostly.
DOCTOR: No known drug allergies, possible shellfish intolerance. Alright, Ms. Tofani. Now, before we move on, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I don’t mind at all. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. I get a little nervous with doctors, to be honest. But I trust you. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 142/88, pulse is 76 and regular. A little elevated, but not unexpected. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. I'd like to do a quick neurological exam, just to assess your strength and coordination. Could you squeeze my hands, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. There you go. Is that alright? I hope my hands aren’t too weak. I’ve been a little worried about that, you know. They just sometimes feel… slow. It's hard to explain. And please, don't rush me. I need a little time to do things sometimes. It's just... getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Good. Strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Now, can you close your eyes and touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… is that alright? It’s a little harder with my eyes closed. I’m a little shaky, you know. There. Is that… good enough? I’m not very good at these things. I always worry I’m not doing it right. It’s probably just my nerves.
DOCTOR: Alright. Coordination is slightly diminished, but not significantly. Now, I’m going to check your gait. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. I’m a little unsteady on my feet, you know. I don't want to fall. It’s probably just my shoes. They aren't very supportive. Is that alright? I try to be careful. I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tofani. Thank you. Please sit back down. Based on your history and the physical exam, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. Given your intermittent arm weakness, headaches, and slightly diminished coordination, we need to rule out a few things. It's unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening, but further investigation is warranted. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a metabolic panel to start. We should also get an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural issues.
PATIENT: Oh, dear… an MRI? That sounds… serious. Is something wrong? I knew I shouldn’t have come to the doctor. I always worry about things. Blood tests, I can handle. But an MRI… what are you looking for, Doctor? Is it something bad? My daughter will be very worried. She’s very protective, you know. I just want to make sure it’s nothing serious. Please, tell me what you think. I need to know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tofani, please try to remain calm. An MRI is a precautionary measure. It allows us to get a detailed look at your brain and rule out any potential causes for your symptoms. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. We’re looking for things like strokes, tumors, or other structural abnormalities, but it’s very common to have a normal MRI. The blood tests will give us information about your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Given your age and symptoms, it's important to be thorough. I want to be certain we have all the information before we move forward. I understand your daughter will be worried, and I will explain everything to her as well. But at this point, it’s too early to jump to any conclusions. We'll review the results as soon as they're available and discuss the best course of action then. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a referral to a neurologist for a consultation. They specialize in these types of issues and can provide further guidance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a neurologist… That sounds… complicated. But alright, if you think it’s best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. But please, tell me honestly, are you worried? Is it something serious? I just want to know the truth. My daughter will be so worried. And I don't want to be a burden. It’s just… getting older is hard. It’s just hard. Alright, a neurologist, and the tests. I suppose I should call my daughter. She’ll want to know everything. Please, just promise me you’ll tell me the truth, whatever it is. I need to know what’s going on with my body.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tofani, I understand your anxiety, and I appreciate you asking me directly. It's not my intention to cause you unnecessary worry. While your symptoms warrant investigation, I don't have enough information at this point to definitively say whether it's something serious. That's why I'm recommending these tests and a consultation with a neurologist. The neurologist will be able to conduct a more thorough evaluation and provide a more accurate diagnosis. I assure you, I will be transparent with you throughout this process. We will discuss the results of the tests and the neurologist’s findings as soon as they are available, and we will develop a plan together. And to answer your question directly, it is my professional responsibility to investigate these symptoms, but that does not mean there is a reason to panic. I will keep you informed every step of the way. Now, I will get the referral paperwork started for you. Do you have any questions for me before I do that?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a little better. A little. It’s just… hard to hear, you know? I’m just a little worried. Alright, no questions right now. Just… please, be gentle with my daughter when you talk to her. She gets very anxious. And thank you for listening to me. I appreciate it. And thank you for being honest. I just want to make sure I’m not… a burden. Alright, go ahead with the paperwork. I suppose we’ll just have to wait and see.
