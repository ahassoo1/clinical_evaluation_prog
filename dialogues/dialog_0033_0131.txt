DOCTOR: Right. Mykeisha Sladen, age 36. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Dechene. It's my blood pressure, it’s been a bit high lately. That’s what the nurse said when she took it, anyway. I haven’t been feeling too bad, but she wanted me to come in and get it checked out proper.
DOCTOR: “A bit high,” you say. Well, that’s…vague. Can you give me some numbers, if you happen to know them?
PATIENT: Hmm, numbers…let me think. The nurse said something like…140 over 90? Maybe? Honestly, I don’t really remember the second number. I just know she looked a little worried and wrote it down. I don’t usually pay attention to those numbers, you know? I just figure if they’re taking it, it must be important. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes…some sense. 140 over 90 is elevated, yes. Have you been experiencing any symptoms with the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Symptoms…not really. I mean, sometimes I get a little headache, but I get those anyway, you know? Stress, probably. And maybe a little tired, but who isn’t these days? Nothing that feels…connected to the blood pressure, if that makes sense. Like, no blurry vision or anything scary like that. Just…normal stuff, really.
DOCTOR: “Normal stuff.” Right. And how long have you been feeling this…“normal stuff”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Probably a couple of months now, I’d say? It’s hard to pinpoint, to be honest. The headaches come and go, and the tiredness…well, that’s just life, isn't it? I think it started getting a bit more consistent around…May maybe? Around the time my auntie moved back to Barbados. It was a lot of helping her sort things out.
DOCTOR: May. Okay. And is there any family history of hypertension – high blood pressure – that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! My grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had it. Bad. He was always having to watch his salt intake and everything. And my auntie, the one who just moved, she’s on medication for it too. So, yeah, it definitely runs in the family, I think. I always figured I’d end up with it eventually.
DOCTOR: As it often does. Any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the flu a couple of years ago, but that's about it. Oh! And I get a bit of eczema on my arms sometimes, but it's not too bad. Just a little cream helps. Nothing serious. I try to stay pretty healthy, mostly. I walk when I can, and I eat okay. You know, normal things.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Just the cream for the eczema, like I said. Nothing else. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it, to be honest. I try to let my body do its own thing, you know? Unless I really need something, I don’t bother with it. Medicare covers the cream, thankfully. It’s a little expensive otherwise.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll check your pulse. Then we can discuss some options. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Dechene. I’m happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but a little…robust. Pulse is 78 and regular. No murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, although I do detect some mild wheezing. Now, have you been experiencing any shortness of breath, or chest pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. No chest pain at all. Sometimes, if I'm walking up a really steep hill, I get a little breathless, but that’s just because I’m not very fit, you know? Nothing serious, like a wheezing feeling or anything. Just…puffing a little. It doesn't happen often. Mostly when I’m visiting my sister, she lives on a really big hill. Is that what you mean by wheezing? Because if so, it’s just because of the hill.
DOCTOR: And do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. My mother would kill me. And honestly, I can't stand the smell. No, never touched a cigarette in my life. It's just not for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your family history and the elevated blood pressure reading, we should start a trial of medication. I'm going to prescribe a low dose of lisinopril. We’ll see how you respond. But before we proceed, have you had any recent blood work done?
PATIENT: Blood work? Hmm... not recently. I think the nurse took some when I first signed up with Medicare, but that was ages ago. Like, maybe a year ago? I don't remember exactly. I don't really go to the doctor much unless I have to, you know? It's not my favorite thing. Does it matter? Should I have had some done recently?
DOCTOR: It would have been…helpful. But alright. We will order some labs – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. And an EKG, just to be safe. I’ll also give you a prescription for the lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once daily. Take it at the same time each day. And…try to reduce your salt intake. It's…basic advice, but it makes a difference.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds like a lot. Salt…right. I do like to cook, so that might be hard. Labs and an EKG…will Medicare cover all of that? I don’t want to get a huge bill I wasn’t expecting. And 10 milligrams…is that a lot? I always worry about side effects.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover it. I’ll put in the orders, and they will contact you to schedule the tests. 10 milligrams is a low dose – it’s a starting point. Side effects are usually minimal – sometimes a little dry cough, or dizziness. If you experience any severe side effects, contact the clinic immediately. Here’s a prescription for the lisinopril, and a list of instructions. Now, follow up with me in one month, and we'll review the lab results. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay, one month…I can do that. Dry cough…that doesn’t sound good. And dizziness…I get dizzy sometimes anyway, so I won't know if that’s the medication or just me! Um…no, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Dr. Dechene. You’ve explained everything really clearly. I'll try my best to remember all of this. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you experience any concerning symptoms, don’t hesitate to call. Next patient.
