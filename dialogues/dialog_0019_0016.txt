DOCTOR: Good morning, Nicky. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… fine. I suppose. It’s about my patient, old Mr. Abernathy. He's been on blood thinners for a while now, you see, and he’s just been bruising like a peach lately. It’s getting a bit ridiculous, frankly. I just want to make sure it’s not… something foolish he's doing. He's not the sharpest tool in the shed, bless his heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising easily… that's a good thing to check out. It’s good you’re bringing it to my attention. Now, when you say “lately,” roughly how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Probably… three or four weeks now? Maybe a bit longer. It’s hard to say exactly, you know? I see a lot of patients. It wasn’t sudden, not like he bumped into a wall or something. Just… gradually more and more little spots appearing. It's irritating, to be honest. He keeps asking me if it’s serious, and I don’t want to alarm him unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Right, a gradual onset over three to four weeks. And you said it's mostly little spots?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. Not huge, purple welts or anything. More like… small, reddish-purple dots. And they seem to pop up even with the slightest touch, practically. He’ll just be sitting there, and I’ll be checking his pulse and… poof, another one. It's really quite bothersome. Are you sure this isn’t just… old age? He is eighty-seven, you know.
DOCTOR: Well, eighty-seven is certainly a factor to consider, but we still want to rule out anything more concerning. Even with age, a significant change in bruising isn’t something we ignore. Do you notice the bruising in any particular areas, or is it all over?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a fair point, I suppose. It seems to be… mostly on his arms, actually. And his legs. Not really on his torso, thank goodness. And his face is clear, which is a relief. He'd be terribly self-conscious. He's a bit of a dandy, old Mr. Abernathy. I’ve always suspected he creams his face twice a day, even though I’ve never asked. It’s probably just the blood thinner, honestly. But one has to be cautious.
DOCTOR: Right, mostly on the arms and legs, thankfully not the face. That's helpful. Now, has anything changed with his blood thinner recently?
PATIENT: Good question. Let me think... no, not that I'm aware of. He’s been on the same dosage for… well, quite a while now. At least six months, maybe longer. I always double-check when I see him, and it hasn’t been altered. He gets his prescriptions filled at the usual place, Miller’s Pharmacy down on Elm Street. A reliable establishment, mostly. Unless… unless they made a mistake? I suppose that’s possible, but unlikely. They’re usually quite careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, same dosage, filled at Miller's Pharmacy... good to know. It's good you have a reliable pharmacy. And just to be thorough, has he started any new medications, even over-the-counter things like aspirin, ibuprofen, or supplements, in the last few weeks?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… tricky. He doesn’t really tell me about things like that, you see. He's a bit… secretive. But I believe he mentioned something about a new arthritis cream. A topical one, he said. Something his daughter brought him. She fusses over him something awful, bless her heart. But I didn’t ask him what it was specifically. Honestly, I barely had time to finish the physical exam before he started asking about the bruising again. It's a constant struggle getting a straight answer from him.
DOCTOR: Okay, a new topical arthritis cream, brought by his daughter. That's good to know - some of those can interact with blood thinners or cause increased bruising. I think we should take a look at his arms and legs, just to assess the bruising. And then we can review his medication list in his chart, to see what the pharmacy has on file. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Honestly, I just want to be sure he’s alright. He's a bit of a character, old Mr. Abernathy, but he’s… a good patient. If he wasn’t, I wouldn’t be here, wasting my valuable time, would I? Go ahead, take a look. Just try not to make a fuss, he gets anxious easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see several small, reddish-purple bruises here, scattered across your forearms and lower arms. They do seem fairly superficial. "Multiple small ecchymoses noted bilaterally on the forearms, ranging in size from 2-5mm. No signs of active bleeding or significant swelling." Now, are you experiencing any pain or discomfort in those areas?
PATIENT: No, not really. He says, "Just a bit tender, Doctor. Like a bruise usually is." He’s being rather stoic, actually. He always tries to act tougher than he is. "He says they're not 'excruciating,' just a mild ache now and then." He’s very particular with his words, you see. Always has been. I’ve been treating him for years, and he hasn’t changed a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know they aren't causing significant pain. Let me take a look at his legs now. "Similar ecchymoses noted bilaterally on the lower legs, similar in size and appearance to those on the arms. No edema or signs of infection observed." Now, while I'm looking at this, do you notice any bleeding from your gums, nosebleeds, or any blood in your stool or urine?
PATIENT: He says, "No, Doctor. None of that. Perfectly normal. Though I did chip a tooth a few weeks back, when I was eating a pecan pie. A very hard pecan, it was. But the bleeding stopped quickly." He's very specific with these details, you see. Always has been. And a little… self-absorbed, perhaps. Always talking about his pecan pies. "He says no nosebleeds, no blood in his stool, no trouble with his gums. Just the tooth, which he assures me is ‘under control’."
DOCTOR: Pecan pies and chipped teeth… alright, good to know. It’s helpful to have that detail. Now, let me quickly review his medication list here in the chart. Ah, yes. Warfarin 5mg daily… and… nothing else recently prescribed that would explain this. No new NSAIDs, no new supplements listed. It does say he refills at Miller’s Pharmacy, as you mentioned. Given everything, it's possible the bruising is related to the Warfarin, especially with the new arthritis cream potentially increasing the effect. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a quick blood test to check his INR level, just to make sure his Warfarin dose is correct. Also, a complete blood count to rule out any underlying issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible. Do what you think is best, Doctor. A blood test sounds… thorough. And I appreciate that. He does worry, you see. Old Mr. Abernathy worries about everything. It's exhausting, honestly. But, yes. A blood test. Go ahead. Just try to make it quick, if you could. He hates needles.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. We’ll just need a small sample from his arm. And it'll give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. I’m going to order the blood tests now, and then I'll have the nurse come in and draw the sample. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any activities that could cause injury, and let me know if you notice any new bleeding or bruising, or if you develop any unusual symptoms. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. He's nodding. "No strenuous activities. Avoid injury. And report any new bleeding." He's repeating it to himself, as if trying to memorize it. Honestly, he's a bit of a hypochondriac. But, yes. He understands. No strenuous activities, avoid injury, report anything unusual. "And… how long will these tests take, Doctor? I have a bridge game this afternoon."
DOCTOR: I understand wanting to know about your bridge game. The tests usually take a few hours to come back. We should have the results by this afternoon. I'll have the nurse call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I'm going to write a note for his chart recommending he temporarily discontinue use of that new arthritis cream, just to be safe. And I'll also write a brief summary of our conversation for his primary care physician. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… prudent. Temporarily discontinue the cream. And inform his physician. Yes, good. He's nodding vigorously. "Wise. Very wise." He seems relieved, actually. He hates uncertainty. Honestly, he's a bit of a worrier. But, yes. Discontinue the cream and inform the physician. He’s practically beaming now. "So… can I go now, Doctor? My bridge partners will be wondering where I am."
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. You're free to go. We’ll be in touch as soon as the test results are available. And if anything changes or you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Abernathy. We'll get to the bottom of this. And thank you for bringing him in. It’s always best to be cautious.
PATIENT: Yes, well. It was a bit of a… ordeal, honestly. But you seem capable, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. Old Mr. Abernathy can be… a handful. But he's a good patient, deep down. Just let me know what the tests say. I trust your judgment. And thank you again. It’s good to know someone is paying attention.
