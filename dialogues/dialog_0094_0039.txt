DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. I see you're 88 years young. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, I got a letter from the lab, you see. Said somethin’ about my cholesterol bein’ high. Hyper… hyperlip… somethin’ like that. Didn’t quite catch all of it. Thought I best come get it checked out. Don’t want any surprises, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Hyperlipidemia – that’s high cholesterol, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. It's very common, and we can certainly discuss it. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if you’ve ever been told you have high cholesterol before?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. Never. I’ve been to doctors over the years, of course, but nobody ever mentioned anything about my cholesterol. Always felt pretty good, actually. A little stiff in the mornings, but who isn’t at my age? I try to stay active, though. Walk around the block most days, weather permit’tin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. And you mentioned some stiffness in the mornings. Is that stiffness in your joints, or more in your muscles?
PATIENT: Oh, mostly my joints, I’d say. Knees and hips mostly. Not terrible, just… there. Takes a bit to get movin’, that’s all. Used to be worse, but the walkin’ seems to help. My wife, bless her heart, always said I needed to keep movin’. She passed away a few years back, so I try to do things to honor her memory, you know? Keepin’ active was a big one.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's wonderful that you're keeping active, and that's a lovely way to honor her memory. Besides the stiffness and the cholesterol results, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but I figure that’s just gettin’ older. Appetite's good, sleep’s okay… Oh! My feet swell up a bit at the end of the day if I’ve been on them a lot. But that happens every now and then, hasn’t been too bad lately. Other than that… no, can’t think of anything. I feel pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Bohnett. Swelling in the feet is worth noting, though. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to take a little somethin’ for my blood pressure a few years back, but I don't take nothin’ regularly now. My doctor at the time said I didn’t need it anymore, so I stopped. Can’t recall the name of it, though. It was a little white pill, I think. Small thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And you said you were taken off blood pressure medication a few years ago. Do you happen to remember why you were taken off of it?
PATIENT: No, I don’t rightly remember, Doctor. The doctor… Dr. Henderson, that was his name… he just said my numbers were lookin' good and I didn't need it anymore. I didn't push it, you know? I trust doctors. He was a nice man. It was maybe… five, six years ago? Hard to say, time flies when you’re older.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Bohnett. It's common to forget details like that over time. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… let me see. My mother lived to be 92, healthy as a horse right up until the end. My father… he had a heart attack when he was about 65, I think. And my sister… she had some kind of trouble with her blood sugar, but she didn’t take care of herself very well. Smoked like a chimney, bless her soul. Didn’t eat right either. Other than that… not sure. Didn’t talk much about health problems when I was growin’ up.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. A history of heart attack in your father and blood sugar issues in your sister. And do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life, Doctor. My wife, she tried it once or twice, but didn’t care for it. Always said it smelled awful. I always agreed with her. No, never been a smoker. I always thought it was a silly habit.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's very good to hear. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam if that’s alright. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your feet and ankles. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead. I've always been a pretty healthy fella, so I don’t expect nothin’ too bad. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Great. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 152/88. A little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at your feet. I do note some mild edema in both ankles, as you mentioned. Pulses are present, but a bit diminished in the dorsalis pedis arteries. Okay, Mr. Bohnett. Everything seems generally okay, but we definitely need to address the elevated blood pressure, the murmur, and the elevated cholesterol. The mild swelling in your ankles is also something we’ll keep an eye on.
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s a lot of somethings. A murmur, you say? Is that bad, Doctor? And what about the cholesterol? What do we need to do about all of it? I just want to feel good, you know? Not have a lot of trouble. Is this gonna mean I need to take a bunch of pills?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bohnett. It sounds like a lot, but we'll take it one step at a time. The murmur… it's often harmless, but it can sometimes indicate a problem with a heart valve. We’ll want to investigate that further with an echocardiogram – it’s a painless ultrasound of the heart. As for the cholesterol, your levels are elevated, which increases your risk of heart disease and stroke. We'll discuss lifestyle changes first - diet and exercise. If that’s not enough, then medication may be necessary. We don’t have to start pills right away, let’s see how you do with lifestyle changes first. And the elevated blood pressure is important to control as well. Again, lifestyle changes can help significantly. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work - a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel to look at your cholesterol in more detail, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone to rule out any thyroid issues. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Wow. That is a lot of tests. An echo… and blood work… Alright, I guess if you think it’s necessary. I don’t mind the tests, so long as they don’t take too much blood. I get a little faint sometimes, you know? And about the diet… what kind of diet are we talkin’ about? I like my breakfast, and I’m not much of a cook. My wife used to do all the cookin’.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bohnett. It does seem like a lot, but these tests will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. We’ll only take the necessary amount of blood, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable during the process. We have staff that are very experienced at drawing blood, and we can have you lie down if you feel faint. As for the diet, it’s not about deprivation, it’s about making healthier choices. We’re aiming for a heart-healthy diet – lower in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium. More fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and fish. For breakfast, things like oatmeal with fruit, or whole-wheat toast with a little avocado. We can get you a referral to a registered dietitian who can help you create a meal plan that fits your lifestyle and preferences. They can also provide you with easy recipes and tips. It's about making small, sustainable changes. To start, could you tell me about a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: Well… let’s see. I usually get up and have a couple of slices of toast with butter and a little bit of jam. And a cup of coffee, of course. Can't start the day without coffee. For lunch, it’s usually a sandwich. Ham and cheese, usually. Sometimes I'll have a bag of chips with it. And for dinner… depends. Sometimes I’ll heat up a frozen meal. Shepherd’s pie is my favorite. Or I might have a piece of fish if I’m feelin’ ambitious. And I do like my sweets, you know? A cookie or a piece of pie with my coffee after dinner.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being honest, Mr. Bohnett. That gives me a good idea. It sounds like we can definitely make some small changes to improve your diet. Cutting back on the saturated fats from the ham and cheese, swapping the frozen meals for healthier options, and reducing the sweets would be a good start. The dietitian can help you with specific meal ideas and portion sizes. For now, let’s get those blood tests and echocardiogram scheduled. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and explain the process and answer any questions you have. She’s wonderful, very patient and kind. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be lovely. Sarah, you say? Good. I like havin’ a kind face explain things. All this is a bit much to take in at once. And an echo… will that take long? I have a bridge game on Wednesdays, so I don’t want to miss that.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Mr. Bohnett. Sarah is excellent, and she’ll be happy to go over everything with you. The echocardiogram usually takes about 30-60 minutes. We can schedule it for a Tuesday or Thursday to avoid your bridge game, if you’d like. We can also work around other commitments if needed. Let me just quickly summarize our plan: 1. Blood Tests: To get a detailed look at your cholesterol, kidney function, and thyroid levels. 2. Echocardiogram: An ultrasound of your heart to check for any valve issues. 3. Dietitian Referral: To help you develop a heart-healthy meal plan. 4. Lifestyle Changes: Focus on a healthier diet and regular exercise. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… well, as good as it can, I suppose. Tuesday would be best for the echo. And I appreciate you workin’ around my bridge game. That’s important to me, you know? Keeps the mind sharp. Alright, let's get this over with, then. Sarah can come in whenever she’s ready. I guess I’m in your hands now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re in good hands, Mr. Bohnett. And we’ll definitely work around your bridge game – keeping your mind sharp is just as important as keeping your body healthy. I’ll let Sarah know to come in right away. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions at all. We're a team, and we'll tackle this together. “Sarah, could you please come to exam room three when you have a moment?
