DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. My name is Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I haven't got all day, so let’s just get this over with. It’s this tiredness, see? Just…dragging. And I’ve been…well, it’s embarrassing, but I’ve been eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to know something’s not right. Honestly, I don’t know why I’m even doing it. It’s just…appealing, sometimes. Don’t ask me to explain it, I haven't the foggiest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. I understand you’re feeling tired and, and this is quite unusual, you've been experiencing an urge to eat dirt. We'll certainly get to the bottom of this. First, let’s talk about the tiredness. How long have you been feeling this dragging sensation?
PATIENT: Oh, a good while now. Months, certainly. Maybe six? It comes and goes, but it's been worse lately. It’s not like I can just…sleep it off, you know? It doesn’t really help. And it’s not just feeling sleepy, it’s…everything feels heavy. Like wading through mud, even when I have had enough sleep. Honestly, I've always been a bit…low energy, but this is different. This is…debilitating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so several months of fatigue that’s progressively worsening, not relieved by rest, and you’re describing it as a feeling of heaviness. That’s helpful. Now, when you say “worse lately,” can you pinpoint anything that might have triggered this increase in fatigue?
PATIENT: Triggered? Honestly, doctor, I haven't got time for…detective work. Life is what’s triggered it. Getting older, I suppose. Bills, worrying about…things. Being alone. What do you want me to say? It just is. I haven’t been doing anything different, haven’t traveled, haven’t changed my diet…well, except for the dirt, but you already know about that. It’s just…a general wearing down.
DOCTOR: I understand, Candis. It sounds like a lot of stress and the general challenges of life are weighing on you. We’ll try to figure out if there’s a medical reason contributing to this fatigue, and we can discuss ways to manage the stress as well. Let’s move on to that dirt eating – what we call geophagia. How often are you eating dirt?
PATIENT: Oh, geophagia, is it? Fancy word for something so…common sense. Look, it's not like I'm sitting down to a bowl of it every day. It comes in waves, see? A few times a week, maybe. Sometimes not for a week or two. It's usually just a little handful, a bit of clay I find in the garden, or sometimes even just…plain old earth. It’s just…satisfying. Don’t judge me, doctor. I'm not a child.
DOCTOR: I'm not judging you at all, Candis. It's my job to understand what’s going on, and you’ve been very open with me. Knowing it comes in waves and it's a small amount is helpful. Do you notice anything that triggers the urge to eat dirt?
PATIENT: Urgh. Triggers. Always with the triggers. Honestly, it’s hard to say. Sometimes it just…comes over me. Maybe when I'm feeling particularly low, or stressed. And sometimes, and this is embarrassing, when I smell the rain coming. It sounds ridiculous, I know, but the smell of wet earth…it just makes me want it. Don't look at me like that! I told you I don't understand it!
DOCTOR: No, I’m not judging, Candis. The smell of rain is an interesting observation, actually. It suggests there might be a connection to certain minerals. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue and the urge to eat dirt?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. Well, my stomach’s been a bit off sometimes. Not bad, just… unsettled. And I’ve been a bit…pale, I suppose. People have mentioned it, anyway. I don’t spend a lot of time looking at myself. And I get…winded easily. Climbing the stairs is a bit of an ordeal these days. It’s just…the general wearing down, I suppose. Honestly, doctor, I’m probably just falling apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. So, alongside the fatigue and geophagia, you’re experiencing some stomach upset, paleness, and shortness of breath with exertion. Those are all things we need to investigate. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your stomach, and take your blood pressure. Then we can talk about some possible blood tests to rule out any deficiencies. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, lovely. More poking and prodding. Fine, get it over with. The faster we’re done, the better. Honestly, I haven't got all day, you know. But don’t expect miracles. It’s probably just old age.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could sit up for me on the examination table, that would be great. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear, but you do seem a bit breathless just sitting there. Now, let’s just take a look at your stomach. Please lie back for me. A little tenderness there on the left side, but nothing too concerning. Your skin does appear a bit pale, as you mentioned. I'm going to order some blood work. It will check your iron levels, vitamin D, B12, and a complete blood count to look for anemia or any signs of infection. We'll also check your thyroid function, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Thyroid function? Honestly, doctor, what are you thinking? I just eat a little dirt when I’m stressed. It’s not some complicated disease. But fine, do your tests. I suppose it can't hurt. Just…don't keep me waiting for the results. I’ve got things to do, you know. And can I get a glass of water after this? My mouth feels all dry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Candis. A glass of water is no problem at all. I understand you're anxious to get this sorted out, and I'll make sure the lab results are expedited. We just need to rule out some possibilities. While we wait for the results, is there anything else you'd like to tell me?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s quite enough. Honestly, I've said too much already. The less you know, the better. Just get the tests done, tell me what you find, and I'll be on my way. I don't need a long explanation, just the facts. And please, don't start suggesting I need therapy or something. I’m perfectly fine, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candis. I completely respect your wishes. I'll focus on the facts and provide you with the results as quickly as possible. A nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, is there anyone who brings you to appointments or helps you out at home?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I manage perfectly well on my own, thank you very much. Always have. I don’t need anyone fussing over me. I live alone and I prefer it that way. It's just…easier. Don't worry about it. Just get the blood drawn and let me know when the results are back. I'll be going now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. I understand. A nurse will be in shortly to take your blood. We will call you as soon as the results are available. Thank you for coming in today. .
