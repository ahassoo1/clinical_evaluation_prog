DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, please, tell me – in as much detail as possible – what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one, actually, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line needs some… information from a doctor. Just to say I’m fit enough to travel, you understand. Nothing serious at all, just a formality, really. They sent a rather long form, and I thought it best to come directly to a doctor to fill it out properly.
DOCTOR: A cruise, you say. Yes, well, cruise lines do have their protocols. It's prudent to be thorough, certainly. Although, I must say, it's rather unusual to seek medical clearance for a perfectly healthy individual. Nonetheless, we shall proceed. Let's begin with the basics. Have you experienced any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Oh, not at all! Perfectly healthy, as you say. No changes, not a one. I’ve always been quite… robust, you see. Though… let me think. Old Mrs. Henderson down the street had a terrible cough last month, and I did feel a bit… drained after helping her with her groceries. But that was just from the lifting, I’m sure. Nothing to worry about, not a proper illness. I haven’t been sick sick, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Not sick sick,” you say. Right. It is helpful to delineate, of course. Fatigue following exertion, while not necessarily indicative of a serious condition, is something we should note. Now, to be absolutely certain, have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats in the past few weeks?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of those. Not a degree of fever, not a shiver, and certainly no night sweats. I sleep quite soundly, actually. Though, now that I think of it, I did wake up once feeling a little… warm. But it was a warm night! The window was open, and I’d had a rather thick quilt on. It was just the quilt, I’m positive. I took it off and slept the rest of the night like a log. Would you like me to detail the thread count? It’s Egyptian cotton, you know. Very breathable.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your attention to detail, Ms. Squiers, the thread count of your quilt is not particularly relevant to your medical assessment. We are attempting to establish a baseline of your health status. Let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a single one. Never have been much for pills, you see. Always believed in a good diet and fresh air. Though… I do occasionally take a spoonful of honey for my throat if it feels a bit scratchy. And sometimes a wee bit of lemon in my water. But that’s hardly medication, is it? Just… soothing. My grandmother always swore by honey and lemon. She lived to be ninety-two, you know. A very robust woman, just like myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, anecdotal evidence is hardly a substitute for a proper medical history. We are cataloging all substances you ingest that might affect your health. So, to be perfectly clear, only honey and lemon, occasionally?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is correct. Only honey and lemon. And a good strong cup of tea, of course. But that’s just… tea! Earl Grey, usually. Though sometimes I have a builder’s tea if I’m feeling particularly… practical. But that doesn’t count as a medicine, does it? It's just a beverage. I do try to limit my sugar, though, for the sake of my figure. I'm rather proud of my figure, you know. Still fit into my good tweed skirt.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's discuss any allergies you may have. This includes food, medications, insect stings, or environmental factors. Any reactions – rashes, difficulty breathing, swelling – that you have experienced in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies! No, not really. I always thought allergies were for… delicate people. I’ve always been quite hardy, you see. Though… I did get a bit of a rash once, years ago, after handling some chrysanthemums. But that was just the pollen, I expect. And it cleared up quite quickly with a bit of soap and water. Nothing serious at all. And… oh, yes! I do get a bit of a sniffle sometimes when the cat sheds. But that’s just… cat fluff. I’m not allergic allergic, if that makes sense. I just… sneeze a bit. It’s quite endearing, really. The cat doesn’t mind.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a mild reaction to chrysanthemums and occasional sneezing around cats. We are documenting these… sensitivities. Now, Ms. Squiers, let us move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or asthma?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never. I’ve always been as healthy as a… well, as a robust Scottish terrier! My doctor back home – lovely man, Doctor MacIntyre – always said I had a constitution of steel. He said my blood pressure was always perfectly normal, and I haven’t a sweet tooth, so never any worries about diabetes. And my heart… well, it beats strong, I assure you. I do a bit of gardening, you know. Quite strenuous work, really. And I haven't a single wheeze in my lungs. I've never needed an inhaler, or even a cough sweet, if you can believe it! Just good, fresh air. Though… my Auntie Agnes did have a touch of asthma, years ago. But that was her lungs, not mine. She smoked a dreadful lot of cigarettes, you see. A very different constitution altogether.
DOCTOR: Very well. No personal history of chronic illness. Let's proceed to past surgical history. Have you ever undergone any operations or had any significant injuries requiring medical intervention?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, not a single one! Not a stitch, not a scrape, not a broken bone. I've always been remarkably careful, you see. A bit clumsy perhaps, but always manage to land on my feet. I once tripped over a garden gnome, but just brushed myself off and carried on. And… well, I did have my tonsils out when I was a wee girl. But that was ages ago, when I was seven. And it was a very simple operation, Doctor MacIntyre said. Just a quick nip and a bit of ice cream afterwards. Hardly counts as medical intervention, does it? It was more of a… treat, really. Though, I did have a rather nasty splinter once, when I was building a birdhouse. But my mother took it out with a pin. Perfectly alright afterwards. No need for a doctor, you see. Just a bit of common sense. And a good strong cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Right. Tonsillectomy as a child, and a splinter removed by your mother. Noted. Now, Ms. Squiers, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke, or any other hereditary illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, family history! Well, my grandmother, on my mother’s side, lived to be ninety-two, as I mentioned. Very robust woman, always active. Though, she did have a touch of rheumatism in her knees in her later years. But that was just old age, I expect. And my Uncle Alistair… he had a bit of a cough, years ago. But he smoked a dreadful lot of pipes, you see. A very different constitution altogether. And… oh, yes! My Auntie Morag… she had a bit of a… flutter of the heart, I think. But she was a very nervous woman, always fretting about something or other. A very different constitution altogether. And my father… he was perfectly healthy, as far as I know. A robust Scottish man, always active. No, I don't think there's anything significant in the family history, Doctor. Just a lot of robust constitutions and a few… nervous types. It’s mostly good genes, I expect. And a good Scottish upbringing, of course. Fresh air and a strong cup of tea. That’s what keeps you healthy, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. No significant family history of illness. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Dreadful things, cigarettes. And alcohol… well, I might have a small glass of sherry with Christmas dinner. Just a small one, to celebrate. And recreational drugs… heavens, no! I’m a respectable woman, Doctor. I wouldn't dream of it. I do enjoy a good cup of tea, as I’ve mentioned. And perhaps a small biscuit with it. But that’s hardly a vice, is it? I do a bit of gardening, as well. Keeps me active. And I enjoy a good walk. Fresh air is very important, you see. And I visit Mrs. Henderson down the street. She’s a lovely woman, but a bit frail. I help her with her groceries. It’s a good way to spend an afternoon. And I read a lot. Mostly historical novels. Very educational. No, I lead a very quiet, respectable life, Doctor. A very healthy life, as far as I’m concerned. And a very good constitution. You can't beat a good Scottish upbringing, you see. Fresh air, a strong cup of tea, and a good book. That's what keeps you going. And a small glass of sherry with Christmas dinner, of course.
DOCTOR: Very well. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. Now, one final question regarding your social history: What is your occupation, and what is your level of physical activity on a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, my occupation! I’m a merchandise displacer and window trimmer, Doctor. Very creative work, actually. I arrange things beautifully in shop windows and inside stores. It requires a good eye for detail and a bit of artistic flair. Though, it does involve a bit of lifting and arranging, you see. And climbing ladders sometimes. But I’m quite nimble, actually. And as for physical activity… well, I do a lot of walking, as I’ve mentioned. To and from the shops, and around town. And I do a bit of gardening. And I help Mrs. Henderson with her groceries. And I arrange things in shop windows. And I climb ladders sometimes. And I walk to and from the shops. And I do a bit of gardening. And I help Mrs. Henderson with her groceries. It's a fairly active life, Doctor. A very healthy life, as far as I’m concerned. And a very good constitution. You can't beat a good Scottish upbringing, you see. Fresh air, a strong cup of tea, and a bit of artistic flair. That's what keeps you going. And a small glass of sherry with Christmas dinner, of course. And a bit of arranging. It's quite strenuous, actually.
DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Squiers, thank you for providing me with a… comprehensive overview of your health history. While you appear to be in remarkably good spirits, and you’ve consistently emphasized your… robust constitution, I do feel compelled to perform a brief physical examination to ensure everything is as you describe. It is standard practice, you understand. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick examination of your throat. May I proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness! A physical examination? Well, I suppose that’s sensible, Doctor. Though, I assure you, everything is perfectly alright. But yes, if you insist. Do try to be gentle, though. I do have rather delicate skin. And please, don’t poke me too much. It’s all very well, a robust constitution, but I do prefer a bit of comfort, you see. And perhaps a cup of tea afterwards? It would be most… restorative.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Squiers. We will proceed with the utmost care. And I can certainly arrange a cup of tea afterwards. If you would please lie back on the examination table, we can begin. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale… Good. Lungs sound clear bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles noted. Now, I’m listening to your heart… Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Blood pressure is… 130/80. Within normal limits. Now, let me just take a quick look at your throat… Slightly erythematous, but no exudate or significant swelling. Tonsils are unremarkable. Overall, your physical examination is within normal limits. No acute abnormalities detected. However, given your consistent emphasis on your robust constitution, and your limited recollection of any past illnesses, I would recommend a routine blood test to establish a baseline and rule out any underlying conditions. It is a precautionary measure, you understand. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness! A blood test? Well, that does sound a bit… invasive, doesn’t it? I’ve never had a blood test in my life! But… I suppose if you insist, Doctor. For precautionary measures, of course. Though, please be gentle. I do have rather delicate veins. And do tell me beforehand what exactly you’re looking for. I wouldn’t want any unpleasant surprises, you see. And perhaps a biscuit afterwards? It would be most… restorative. And a cup of tea, of course. And perhaps a small glass of sherry? For medicinal purposes, you understand. It would calm my nerves. A robust constitution, you see, but still… a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Squiers. We will proceed with the utmost care. The blood test is a routine screening to assess your overall health, including your complete blood count, cholesterol levels, and kidney and liver function. It will help establish a baseline and identify any potential issues early on. We will take every precaution to minimize discomfort, and a skilled phlebotomist will be performing the procedure. Regarding your request for a biscuit, a cup of tea, and a small glass of sherry… I can certainly arrange those for you after the blood test. However, I must advise against consuming any alcohol immediately before or after the procedure, as it can interfere with the results. A biscuit and tea would be perfectly acceptable, though. So, shall we proceed with the blood test?
PATIENT: Oh, very well, Doctor. A biscuit and tea it is, then. No sherry, sadly. But a robust constitution can withstand a little disappointment, you see. And yes, let's get this blood test over with. The sooner it's done, the sooner I can get back to arranging things beautifully in shop windows, and climbing ladders, and helping Mrs. Henderson with her groceries. And reminding everyone about the importance of fresh air and a good cup of tea. And a small glass of sherry on Christmas dinner, of course. Though not before or after a blood test, you insist. Very well. Lead on, Doctor. But do be gentle. And do tell me what you're looking for, beforehand. I wouldn't want any unpleasant surprises. A robust constitution, you see, but still… a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Squiers. We will proceed to the lab now. The phlebotomist will explain the procedure in detail, and I will be right there to answer any questions you may have. The blood test will involve drawing a small sample of blood from your vein, typically in your arm. It may cause a brief, sharp pinch, but it should not be painful for long. The sample will then be sent to the lab for analysis, and the results should be available within a few days. We will review them together at your follow-up appointment. The tests we are ordering include a complete blood count to assess your red and white blood cell levels, a metabolic panel to evaluate your kidney and liver function, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. These tests will provide a comprehensive overview of your health and help identify any potential issues early on. Here we are. The phlebotomist is ready for you. Please let me know if you have any concerns or questions. I will be right outside, should you need me.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A phlebotomist, you say? It all sounds rather… clinical, doesn’t it? Very well, Doctor. I shall try to be brave. And please do let me know if anything feels… unpleasant. A robust constitution, you see, but still… a bit sensitive. And do remind me what we're looking for, beforehand. I wouldn't want any surprises. And do ensure they use a clean needle. A robust constitution, you see, but still… rather particular. And do tell them to be gentle. And do let me know if anything feels… unpleasant. And a small biscuit afterwards, please. A robust constitution, you see, but requires sustenance. And a cup of tea. And… well, perhaps a small glass of sherry on Christmas dinner. Though not before or after a blood test, you insist. Very well. Lead on. But do be gentle. And do ensure they use a clean needle. And do let me know if anything feels… unpleasant. And a small biscuit afterwards, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Squiers. I assure you, the phlebotomist is a highly skilled professional and will take every precaution to ensure your comfort and safety. She will use a brand new, sterile needle, and will explain the procedure in detail before she begins. I will be right here with you throughout the entire process, and will intervene immediately if you experience any discomfort. “Good morning, Sarah. Ms. Squiers is a little anxious about the blood draw, so please be as gentle and reassuring as possible.” “Now, Ms. Squiers, just relax and take a few deep breaths. We are looking for a complete blood count to check your red and white blood cell levels, a metabolic panel to evaluate your kidney and liver function, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. These tests will provide a comprehensive overview of your health and help identify any potential issues early on. And, as we discussed, a small biscuit and a cup of tea afterwards. Please let me know if anything feels unpleasant, and I will be right here with you.” .
