DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, doc, no offense, but "pleasure" is a strong word. I'm here 'cause I've been, well, throwing up blood. Not a lot, but enough to scare the bejesus outta me. It started a couple days ago, and it ain't stoppin'. Figured I better get it checked before I end up lookin' like a crime scene.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Gentz, and I assure you I take this very seriously. It's certainly wise to get this investigated promptly. “Throwing up blood,” or hematemesis, as we call it, can be a sign of several things, and we need to determine the cause. To begin, could you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Hematemesis? Really? You gotta use those fancy words, huh? Look, it’s… bright red. Sometimes it’s got little bits in it, like… well, undigested food, I guess. Other times it's just straight blood. And it smells… metallic, if that makes any sense. It ain't like a normal nosebleed, that's for sure. Happened three times yesterday, twice this morning. Makes me feel weak just thinkin' about it. And frankly, it's kinda unsettling. I don’t do unsettling.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the medical terminology, Mr. Gentz. I sometimes fall into that habit and will make a conscious effort to explain things more clearly. Bright red blood, particularly with undigested food, is helpful information. The metallic smell is also characteristic. Could you tell me about any other symptoms you’re experiencing alongside the vomiting?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… Well, I’ve been feelin' tired, real tired. More than usual, and I'm always tired. And my stomach’s been achin', a dull ache, kinda constant. Not sharp, nothin’ dramatic. And… I’ve been a little lightheaded. Had to sit down quick after gettin' up this mornin'. Oh, and no appetite, which, honestly, ain't new. I haven't been eatin' much since… since my wife passed. Everything just tastes like ash, you know? But the lack of appetite with this… it's worse.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. That must be incredibly difficult, and it's not surprising that your appetite has been affected. The combination of fatigue, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, and reduced appetite alongside the hematemesis is concerning. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Hmm. Not much, honestly. I've been pretty healthy, knock on wood. Had the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox, that kinda thing. No broken bones, no serious illnesses. Had my gallbladder out maybe fifteen years ago, but that was it. High blood pressure, the doctor said, a few years back, but I never bothered with pills. Didn't see the point. Just tried to watch my salt intake, mostly. Other than that… nothin'. I don't go to doctors unless absolutely necessary, and frankly, this is pushin' it. I avoid 'em like the plague. All they ever do is poke and prod and tell you to change your life.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Gentz. Knowing about the high blood pressure, even if untreated, is important. And having had your gallbladder removed is also relevant. Did you have any surgeries related to your gallbladder removal, and were there any complications?
PATIENT: Nah, it was pretty straightforward. Went in, they took it out, I went home. No complications, nothin' fancy. Just a few days of discomfort, a little soreness, that's it. They didn't find anything bad or nothin' like that. Standard procedure, the doctor said. I remember it bein' kinda painful for a week or so afterwards, but I bounced back pretty quick. I'm a tough guy, always have been. I just don't see the point in dwellin' on stuff like that. Gets ya nowhere. Now, are we gettin' anywhere with this blood thing, or are we just gonna talk about my past forever? I got things to do, ya know.
DOCTOR: You’re right to bring us back to the present concern, Mr. Gentz. Apologies for the detailed questioning; it’s standard practice to gather a complete history. Now, concerning your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like stomach ulcers, bleeding disorders, liver disease, or any cancers, particularly gastrointestinal cancers?
PATIENT: Family history… Ugh. My family? Let me think. My father had… diabetes, I think. And his brother, my uncle, had heart trouble. Lots of heart trouble. Other than that… nothin' springs to mind. My mother… she died young, complications from childbirth, they said. Wasn't a lot of talk about medical stuff in my family, to be honest. Yemenis don't really do preventative care. You get sick, you deal with it. You don't go around askin' about granddad's stomach problems. And frankly, I barely knew most of 'em. We weren’t close. No ulcers that I know of, no cancers. Mostly just… old age and bad luck, as far as I can tell. Look, I'm tellin' ya, I'm a healthy guy. This blood thing is a fluke, I swear.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. Thank you for sharing what you recall. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Social history? What am I, a teenager? Look, doc, I'm a fifty-one-year-old widower who operates a crematory. What kinda wild lifestyle do you think I lead? I used to smoke, back in my younger days, maybe a pack a day. Quit about twenty years ago. Best thing I ever did. Don’t drink, never really liked it. And drugs? Absolutely not. I got no time for that nonsense. I drink my coffee black, that's about as exciting as it gets. Mostly, I just go to work, come home, and try not to think about things. That’s my social life. Does that answer your question? Honestly, I’m startin’ to feel like you’re lookin’ for somethin’ to blame this on. I just threw up some blood, doc. Sometimes things happen.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Gentz, and I assure you I’m not looking for blame. I’m simply gathering information to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Quitting smoking twenty years ago is excellent. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I told you, I avoid doctors like the plague. I don’t take medications. Not now, not ever. Vitamins? Maybe a multi-vitamin every now and then, if I remember, but that's it. And supplements? Nope. I get my nutrients from my coffee and a healthy dose of pessimism. Seriously, doc, I'm a pretty simple guy. No pills, no potions, no fancy treatments. I just want to know what's wrong with me so I can get back to work. This is gettin' ridiculous. You're askin' me about vitamins now? This blood thing is real, doc. It's happening. Are you gonna actually look at me, or just keep askin' me about my life?
DOCTOR: You are right to express your frustration, Mr. Gentz. I apologize for the extensive questioning, and I assure you I am ready to move to a physical examination. I was attempting to establish a baseline and rule out potential contributing factors. Now, if you would please allow me, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, starting with listening to your abdomen and checking your vital signs. Then I’ll check for any signs of anemia or internal bleeding. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. I got things to do. Just… be quick about it, alright? And try not to poke too much. I don’t do well with bein’ poked and prodded. Let's just figure out what's goin' on and get me outta here. I'm not exactly enjoyin' this, doc. Not one bit. And if it's somethin' serious, just tell me straight. I don't need sugarcoating. Just the facts. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Gentz. I will be as efficient and direct as possible. Your abdomen is slightly tender to the touch in the upper quadrant, but there’s no rigidity or guarding. I don’t hear any abnormal sounds. Your heart rate is 88 beats per minute, blood pressure is 140/90, and your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I’m also going to check your stool for occult blood. Finally, I'll check your sclera to assess for jaundice. Your sclera are clear. There's no obvious sign of jaundice. Now, based on the information we’ve gathered so far—the hematemesis, the tenderness in your upper abdomen, and your history—there are several possibilities we need to investigate. We could be dealing with a peptic ulcer, gastritis, or esophagitis. Less common, but more serious, causes could include a bleeding varices or even a tumor. To differentiate between these possibilities, I need to order some blood work and an endoscopy. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Endoscopy? What in the world is an endoscopy? Is that where you stick a camera down my throat? Because if you're thinkin' about stickin' a camera down my throat, you can forget about it. Absolutely not. I have a bad enough time with a thermometer, let alone some fancy spy gadget. Look, doc, I appreciate you tryin', but I'm tellin' ya, it's probably just somethin' I ate. Bad shrimp, maybe. Or too much coffee. I don’t need a camera lookin' around inside me. Just give me somethin' for my stomach and send me on my way. I don’t like this, not one bit. And frankly, I don't trust fancy gadgets. You're gonna poke around inside me with a camera? No way. No how. Forget it.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Gentz, and I respect your wishes. An endoscopy does involve a thin, flexible tube with a camera inserted through the esophagus to visualize the stomach and duodenum. It is the most accurate way to determine the cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and it allows us to take biopsies if needed. However, I will not proceed with any procedure without your informed consent. Given your reluctance to undergo an endoscopy at this time, we can start with the blood work to assess your hemoglobin levels, liver function, and kidney function. This will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and help rule out some of the more serious possibilities. If the blood work comes back significantly abnormal, or if your symptoms worsen, I strongly recommend reconsidering the endoscopy. Would you be agreeable to proceeding with the blood work?
PATIENT: Blood work… alright, fine. I’ll do the blood work. It’s less intrusive than stickin’ a camera down my throat. But that’s it. No cameras, no scopes, no nothin’ like that. Just blood work. And if it comes back normal, you leave me alone. You understand? I’m not comin’ back for any fancy procedures. This is a one-time deal. I'm a grown man, doc, and I know my body. Probably just need to lay off the coffee for a few days. Now, how long is this gonna take? I got things to do, remember? I don’t spend all day sittin' in doctor’s offices. And no need to tell me about all the fancy things the lab can do. Just draw the blood and tell me when I can go.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Gentz. I understand. We’ll proceed with the blood work. It should take approximately 30 minutes to draw the samples and send them to the lab. Results typically take 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I will provide you with instructions on managing your symptoms. Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and spicy foods. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as dizziness, lightheadedness, or black, tarry stools, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No questions. Just… get it over with. And make sure whoever draws the blood knows what they’re doin’. I don’t have a lot of patience for needles. I appreciate you layin' out the instructions, though. At least you’re bein’ straightforward about it. Just… let me know when you’re ready. I’ll try not to faint. Probably. Don't want to make a mess. And don't try to sell me on any fancy procedures later. Blood work is all I’m agreein’ to. Got it? Good. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Understood, Mr. Gentz. We will only proceed with the blood work. And rest assured, our phlebotomist is highly experienced. We’ll make sure you’re comfortable throughout the process. My assistant will be right with you to draw your blood. It will only take a few minutes. Please let me know if you need anything at all. I’ll be right here.
