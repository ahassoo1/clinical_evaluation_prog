DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, my husband, he insisted I come. He’s been reading things… about planning for, shall we say, the inevitable. He wants me to fill out some papers, an “Advance Directive” or a “POLST” form, I believe he called it. Frankly, I find the whole discussion rather morbid, but he’s quite insistent. I suppose it’s best to be…prepared. Though I don't entirely understand why I need such a thing.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, your husband is a sensible man, though I understand your hesitation. It is unpleasant to contemplate. These documents, as you correctly state, are meant to outline your wishes regarding medical care should you become unable to communicate them yourself. It’s about ensuring your preferences are honored, not necessarily about speeding anything along. Now, before we get to the forms themselves, let’s just get a general sense of your overall health. Have you been seeing a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? Well, when I need to. I’m generally quite healthy, Doctor. I don't believe in fussing over every little ache and pain. My husband, of course, goes for check-ups religiously, but I find it rather… unnecessary. I have a doctor in the city, but I haven’t seen her in, oh, perhaps two years? It’s been quite some time. I assure you, I am a very robust woman for my age.
DOCTOR: Robust, you say. Very good. Still, even robust individuals benefit from periodic assessments. Two years is rather a long interval. Do you recall the name of your physician in the city?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s…Dr. Dubois. Yes, Dr. Antoinette Dubois. She’s…specializes in internal medicine, I believe. Though I mostly saw her for routine things – a bad cold, that sort of thing. Honestly, I can’t recall the exact address, it’s been so long. It’s near the opera house, I think. A very fashionable practice. Why is this information so important, exactly? We're discussing my wishes, not my medical history.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Chilla, because these directives are only truly meaningful if we have a clear understanding of your baseline health. Knowing who your previous physician was allows us to potentially obtain records, to see what, if any, chronic conditions you may have, what medications you've been prescribed in the past. It’s about ensuring we’re accurately reflecting your desires, not making assumptions. Now, aside from your physician, are you currently taking any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I prefer to avoid such things whenever possible. My mother always said medication is just a temporary fix, and it weakens the system. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, because of the lack of sunlight, of course. But that’s it. Absolutely nothing else. And I certainly don’t want it documented anywhere that I take a simple vitamin! Really, Doctor, I pride myself on my good health. I eat very well, get plenty of sleep, and avoid stress. That's my regimen.
DOCTOR: Very well. And allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nothing significant. I dislike pollen, naturally, who doesn’t? It makes my eyes water a bit in the spring. And certain perfumes give me a headache, but that's hardly an allergy, is it? I wouldn't say I have any serious allergies. My husband, on the other hand, is allergic to everything under the sun. It’s quite a nuisance, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. And family history, Ms. Chilla?
PATIENT: Family history… A rather bleak one, if I'm honest. My mother died of… complications, shall we say, in her late sixties. My father passed away from a heart condition many years before that. And my brother… well, he wasn’t very careful with his health. Let’s just say it was a premature end. It’s not a history I particularly enjoy dwelling on, Doctor. It's why I'm so diligent about not needing doctors, you see.
DOCTOR: I see. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Is this a medical consultation or an interrogation, Doctor? I live a perfectly normal life. I'm a professor, I teach literature. I enjoy reading, of course. We travel occasionally. We have a lovely home. What more do you need to know? I do not smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I find it terribly vulgar to overindulge.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, I assure you this is a standard part of the assessment. Knowing your daily habits allows me to get a more comprehensive understanding of your overall wellbeing. It's not about judgment, it's about information. Now, do you engage in any regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Physical activity? Well, I walk. I walk to the market, I walk around the house. Is that what you mean? I find strenuous exercise… rather uncouth. I prefer activities that stimulate the mind, not the body. I attend lectures, I read, I engage in intellectual discussions. That is my exercise. I assure you, my mind is very active for a woman my age. Perhaps that should be documented, instead of my lack of jogging.
DOCTOR: Noted. And finally, Ms. Chilla, before we move on to the physical examination, are there any specific concerns you have at this moment?
PATIENT: Concerns? Honestly, Doctor, my only concern is that this whole process is rather… unnecessary. I am perfectly capable of making my own decisions, should the need arise. And frankly, I find it morbid to discuss such things. My husband is simply being overly cautious. But if you insist, I suppose… sometimes I have a little trouble sleeping. Not every night, mind you, but occasionally. It’s likely just stress, from work. Nothing to worry about, I assure you. It's hardly a medical concern.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Chilla, I will perform a brief physical examination. This is simply a baseline assessment, to get a sense of your current state of health. It will be quick and painless, if you permit. We will check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: If you must. But please be quick, Doctor. I have a luncheon engagement later this afternoon. And do be gentle. I have very sensitive skin. I trust you've thoroughly washed your hands?
DOCTOR: Of course. Please have a seat and relax. I will begin with your blood pressure. Left arm, please. Relax your shoulder. 138 over 82. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is regular, 78 beats per minute. Take a deep breath for me... and exhale. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Now, if you'll follow my finger with your eyes... Excellent. Grip my hand firmly... Very good. And finally, can you touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? Honestly, Doctor, this is rather undignified. I feel like a child in a school examination. Do you require any further…prodding? I would like to be finished soon. My time is valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: No further examination is necessary at this time. Your reflexes are intact, and coordination is normal. Overall, your physical examination is unremarkable. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and I would recommend monitoring it regularly. Now, Ms. Chilla, before we discuss the Advance Directive and POLST form, I must emphasize the importance of addressing your elevated blood pressure. This could be related to stress, as you mentioned, but it’s crucial to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I recommend scheduling an appointment with a cardiologist for a thorough evaluation. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Absolutely not. I assure you, Doctor, it's merely a temporary fluctuation. I will simply take a few more walks, and perhaps reduce my caffeine intake. I do not require the attention of a specialist. This is precisely what I was attempting to avoid. I came here to fill out some papers, not to be subjected to a battery of tests and diagnoses. I trust you have the forms ready? I’d like to get this over with as quickly as possible. I refuse to spend any more time on this… unnecessary scrutiny.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chilla. As you wish. However, I must document your refusal of a cardiology referral. These are the Advance Directive and the POLST form. The Advance Directive outlines your wishes regarding medical treatment in general, while the POLST form specifies your preferences for life-sustaining treatment. Read them carefully. If you have any questions, I will attempt to answer them, though I suspect you’ve already made up your mind. Take your time. I will be here.
PATIENT: Fine. Though I fail to see the point. My wishes are quite simple: do everything possible to preserve my life, unless I specifically instruct otherwise. “Values and beliefs…” Honestly, Doctor, this is rather intrusive. Is there a section where I can simply state my desire for aggressive treatment? Because that is all that needs to be said. This entire document seems… unnecessarily complicated. And I refuse to fill out that one. It’s far too… morbid.
DOCTOR: As you wish, Ms. Chilla. We can focus solely on the Advance Directive, then. However, I must reiterate that a comprehensive Advance Directive includes specific instructions regarding various medical scenarios. Simply stating a desire for “aggressive treatment” is insufficient. For example, this section addresses end-of-life care. Do you wish to specify your preferences regarding resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, or artificial nutrition?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, you are determined to make this as difficult as possible, aren't you? Fine. Resuscitation… yes, attempt it. Mechanical ventilation… I suppose so, if there's no hope of recovery, but only as a temporary measure. And artificial nutrition… yes, if I’m unable to eat. But I want it to be the best quality, mind you. No bland hospital food. Is that detailed enough for you? And I want my husband to be the one to make all the decisions, should I be unable to do so myself. He’s far more sensible than I am, and he understands these things. There. I’ve said what needs to be said. Let’s be finished with this, shall we? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Very well. This is…adequate, though not comprehensive. I will document your preferences. And your husband will be listed as your healthcare proxy. Now, Ms. Chilla, I must strongly advise you to reconsider your refusal of a cardiology referral. Elevated blood pressure can lead to serious complications, and early intervention is crucial. I can provide you with the name of a highly-regarded cardiologist in the area. But ultimately, the decision is yours. Here is a copy of the completed Advance Directive for your records. Please keep it in a safe place, and inform your family and healthcare providers of your wishes. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. I trust you will not bother me again about this… blood pressure. I’ve wasted enough time here already. And please, do remember that my husband is to be contacted in all matters pertaining to my health. He’s far more sensible about these things.
DOCTOR: .
