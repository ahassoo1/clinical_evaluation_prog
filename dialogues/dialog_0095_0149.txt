DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, morning, Doctor. Vanochten, you say? Hmm. Well, honestly, it’s all this fussin’ and messin’ about with… things. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s the one who made the appointment. She thinks I need to be poked and prodded. I don’t recall anything being wrong wrong, you understand? Just…old age, I suppose. It’s what happens when you get to be my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your daughter is concerned, and that’s good. Even if things aren’t “wrong wrong,” as you say, it's helpful to check things out. Just to be thorough. Can you tell me a little more about this “fussin’ and messin’ about”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It was…a young man, I think. A nice enough boy, but kept talkin’ about tests and scans and…Medicare. Always somethin’ about Medicare. And then they wanted to…stick me with needles! I haven’t had a needle since…well, a long time ago. And for what? I feel perfectly fine, mostly. My feet ache a little, but that’s just from standin’ so much when I was…practicin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some tests were recommended, and you're understandably hesitant about needles. And you mentioned foot pain related to previous work. “Practicin’?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I was a podiatrist, you see. For…a long time. A very long time. Before I retired, of course. All this standin’ and lookin’ at feet…it does a number on your feet, eventually. Though, I always took good care of my patients’ feet. Better care than I took of my own, I reckon. It's just… I don’t see why I need all this now. I’m old. Things ache. That's just…life.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you had a very fulfilling career, and it’s common for people to put their own health needs last when they’re busy taking care of others. Just to get a clearer picture, are you experiencing any pain besides your feet?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well…my knees. They creak something awful. Especially when it’s damp, like it has been lately. And sometimes, when I try to get up from a chair, it’s a bit of a struggle. But honestly, Doctor, I just chalk it up to…well, you know. Age. I don’t need a fancy test to tell me I’m gettin’ old. It's rather obvious, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is obvious, Ms. Gunasekara, but it's also important to rule out anything that could be more than just age-related wear and tear. Just to be sure. Have you noticed any swelling in your knees, or any warmth to the touch?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Oh, goodness, I don't know. I haven't really looked at my knees, Doctor. I mean, I feel them, of course, when they're achin', but I haven’t been inspectin’ ‘em for swelling. Warmth…? No, I don’t think so. I wear stockings, you see. Always have. A lady always wears stockings. They keep you warm. And… I suppose they’d hide any warmth, wouldn’t they?
DOCTOR: They might. Okay. And how about any pain in your hips, or your back?
PATIENT: Oh, my back! Yes, my back bothers me somethin’ fierce sometimes. Especially after I’ve been bendin’ over…pickin’ up somethin’. Or sittin’ for too long. It just…aches. A dull ache, mostly. But it comes and goes. I usually just rub it with some liniment. That usually helps a bit. My daughter keeps tellin’ me I need to see a specialist…a chiropractor or somethin’. But honestly, Doctor, I don’t trust those back-crackin’ folks.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. We can certainly discuss that further. And you mentioned liniment helps. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about other parts of your body... any trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing…? Oh, goodness no. I’m breathin’ just fine, thank you. Always have been a good breather. Though, sometimes, when I walk up the stairs… I get a little…winded. But that's just because I'm old! And those stairs are awfully steep. My daughter keeps tellin’ me we need to move to a one-story house. But I like my garden. And the view from the upstairs window. I’d miss that too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no trouble breathing at rest, just some shortness of breath with exertion like stairs. And you feel generally well otherwise. Before we do a physical exam, I want to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious conditions—like heart problems, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… High blood pressure, yes. I had that for a bit. Years ago. They put me on some pills. I took ‘em for a while, but then my doctor…Dr. Hemmings, a lovely man…he said I could try gettin’ off of ‘em. And I did. It was fine for a long time. As for the others…diabetes? I don’t think so. My mother had somethin’ with her sugar, but I never did. Heart problems…no, not that I recall. I always had a strong heart. Still do, I reckon. Though, I do get a little…fluttery sometimes. But that’s just nerves.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that was managed with medication and then discontinued, and some occasional palpitations. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Hmm. Let me see… oh! Yes. I had my gallbladder out. Years and years ago. And…and I had a hysterectomy. That was…a long time ago as well. Before I met my husband. A necessary thing, the doctor said. Not a pleasant experience, but…necessary. Other than that, nothin’ that I recall. Just a few stitches here and there over the years. From gardenin’, mostly. Those rose bushes can be treacherous, you know.
DOCTOR: Rose bushes are treacherous. Okay, gallbladder removal and hysterectomy. And now, just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications – including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I take a little somethin’ for my arthritis. Just when it flares up. Ibuprofen, I think it is. And sometimes, when I can't sleep, I take a little chamomile tea. My daughter buys it for me. She says it's good for relaxin'. Other than that…no, not really. I don't hold with all those pills and potions, you know? A little common sense and a good night's sleep is usually enough.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Gunasekara, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your joints. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well, Doctor. If you must. I suppose it can’t hurt. Just be gentle, will you? My skin is rather thin these days. And don't poke too much at my knees. They’re already complainin’ enough as it is. And…try not to take too long, alright? I have my stories on in a little bit. I don't want to miss the good part.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Gunasekara. Gentle is my middle name. If you could just have a seat here, and we'll get started. First, let's take your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… that’s good. 150 over 88. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your history and that you're a little anxious. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Deep breath, you say? Is that alright? My lungs haven’t been the same since…well, a long time ago. I used to smoke, you see. Before I knew any better. But I quit, years ago. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good. Your breathing sounds a little wheezy, but nothing too alarming. It's likely related to your previous smoking and a little bit of age-related changes. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a bit of a struggle, Doctor. They creak something awful, don’t they? Like an old gate. You see? Just like an old gate. And…they’re a little swollen, I suppose. I hadn’t noticed, really. But now that you mention it…yes. A little swollen. And…tender. Especially right here. That’s where it hurts the most.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can feel some tenderness there, and a bit of swelling. Your left knee is a little less tender, but also shows some swelling. Alright, Ms. Gunasekara. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you've told me and what I've found, it sounds like you have some osteoarthritis in both of your knees. This is very common, especially at your age, and it's likely contributing to the pain and stiffness you're experiencing. The elevated blood pressure is something we should keep an eye on, as well.
PATIENT: Osteo-what-now? Oh, dear. Is that serious, Doctor? Will I have to have…surgery? My daughter keeps talkin’ about surgery. I don't want surgery. I've had enough of surgery for one lifetime, thank you very much. And my blood pressure…? Is it really that bad? I feel perfectly fine, mostly. Just a little…old.
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis just means that the cartilage in your knees has worn down over time, causing pain and stiffness. It’s not necessarily serious, and most people manage it well with conservative treatments. And no, you absolutely don’t need surgery right now, or even necessarily ever! Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but we can manage that with lifestyle changes—like diet and exercise—and possibly medication if needed. We'll start with the simplest things first, alright?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes…? Diet and exercise…? Well, I suppose I could try that. I do enjoy a good walk in the garden, when my knees allow. And I make a lovely tomato salad. Though, I do enjoy a little salt on it. Is salt bad? My mother always said a pinch of salt brings out the flavor. And…what about the chamomile tea? Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Walking in the garden is excellent! And tomato salad is wonderful. A little salt is fine, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s the too much salt we need to worry about. And chamomile tea is perfectly fine. It’s a lovely, relaxing beverage. So, here’s what I recommend. First, let’s try to increase your activity level gradually. Short walks, as your knees allow. Second, we’ll focus on a healthy diet—lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and reduced salt intake. Third, I’m going to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health and see if any other underlying issues are contributing to your symptoms. And finally, I'll prescribe a mild pain reliever—like ibuprofen—that you can take as needed for the knee pain. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Hmm. Short walks…healthy diet…blood work…and those little pills. Well, alright, Doctor. I suppose I can try that. I’ve always been a good patient. Though, I do hope the blood work doesn’t take too long. And…will those pills make me sleepy? I like to watch my stories, you see. And…can I still have my tomato salad? With just a little salt?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Gunasekara. You can still have your tomato salad, with a little salt. And the pills shouldn’t make you sleepy, but if they do, we can adjust the dosage or try a different medication. The blood work should only take a few days. I’m going to write you a prescription for the ibuprofen and an order for the blood work. The lab is just down the hall. Here you go. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the blood work results and see how you’re doing with the new plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Two weeks, you say? Very well. I suppose that’s alright. So much fussin’ and messin’ about. But…you seem like a nice young man, Doctor. And you didn’t try to rush me. That’s a good thing. Well, alright then. I suppose I should be gettin’ home now. My stories are about to start.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Gunasekara. Enjoy your stories. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help. Take care, and I'll see you in two weeks.
PATIENT: .
