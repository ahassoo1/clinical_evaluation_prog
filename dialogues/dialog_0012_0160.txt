DOCTOR: Hi Candis, welcome. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have all day. It's this tiredness, see? Just… dragging. And it's not just regular tired. It's… well, it’s hard to explain. And then I started… eating dirt. Yes, dirt. Don’t look at me like that, it’s not like I want to, it just… happens. It's gotten worse lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for telling me. It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot right now, and it takes courage to share things that are difficult to talk about. You mentioned a persistent tiredness that’s different than just being regular tired, and you've been experiencing a craving to eat dirt. That’s a really important thing to mention. Could you tell me a little more about the tiredness?
PATIENT: Important? It's weird, that's what it is. Look, I just feel… drained. All the time. It doesn’t matter if I sleep eight hours, or six, or barely anything at all. I wake up feeling like I ran a marathon. And it's been going on for… oh, I don't know, a few months now? Maybe longer. It's hard to keep track when every day feels the same. It's just…exhausting, plain and simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a persistent feeling of exhaustion for several months, regardless of how much sleep you get. That's definitely something we need to look into. And you said it’s hard to keep track of time, which can happen when you’re feeling this way. Now, about the dirt… can you tell me when this started?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is taking forever. Okay, the dirt… it started, oh, maybe six weeks ago? Around the time the weather got so hot. I was out in the garden, weeding, and I just… tasted it. It was a little clump of clay, and… well, I didn’t spit it out. And then I started wanting more. It’s awful, really. I try to stop, but it's like… a compulsion. Don't tell me about iron, I already know about iron.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the dirt craving started about six weeks ago, coinciding with the hot weather and gardening. You mentioned you're aware of the connection to iron, which is good. We'll definitely explore other possibilities as well. Just to be clear, is this craving only when you're gardening, or does it happen at other times too?
PATIENT: Other times too! Honestly, it's embarrassing to even admit. I… I find myself thinking about it when I'm inside, even. I've, uh, been digging around in the flowerpots. And… well, I even went outside one night, just to get some from the garden. Don’t judge me. It’s not like I’m enjoying it. It's just… this need.
DOCTOR: Candis, I’m not judging you at all. It sounds like you’re experiencing something very distressing, and you’re being very brave sharing this with me. It’s important to understand what’s going on, and that means being honest about everything. This craving isn't limited to when you’re gardening, it’s happening even when you're inside. And you’ve gone outside specifically to find dirt when you weren't gardening. Okay. Let's switch gears a bit. Have you noticed any other changes in how you're feeling lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Besides being tired and eating dirt? What kind of changes are you even asking about? I… I guess I've been a little more forgetful than usual, but who isn’t at my age? And… my stomach hasn’t been right. It’s hard to explain. Just… off. Not pain, exactly, just… unsettled.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased forgetfulness and some stomach upset. Not pain, but just a general unsettled feeling. That's helpful. When you say "unsettled," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is tedious. It’s like… everything feels slow. Like it’s taking forever for food to digest. And I… I haven’t been as hungry as I used to be. I used to have a good appetite, but now… it’s just not there. I've lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t actually weighed myself. Honestly, I don’t have the energy to bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, so slower digestion, decreased appetite, and some weight loss, although you haven't weighed yourself recently. Given your age, and the combination of fatigue, the unusual craving, and these other symptoms, I want to do a thorough check-up. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. Let's start with your vitals—blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and weight. Then I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam – just to check your reflexes and coordination. We'll also take a look at your abdomen. It will take a bit of time, but I’ll explain everything as we go. If you don't mind stepping on the scale first?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But don't expect me to stand there for long. I haven't eaten all day, so don't make a fuss about the weight. It'll probably be low.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Just step on when you’re ready. Okay, 107 pounds. And your height is 169 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. 169. Now can we please get on with it? I have a garden to tend to, you know. And don’t start asking about my diet. I eat perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on. Blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear—no wheezing or crackling. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Just relax your arms and legs.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. I haven’t got all day. And don't poke and prod too much. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the lower quadrants. No masses or enlargement. Now, I'm going to order some bloodwork. It will check for a number of things, including a complete blood count, iron levels—even though you mentioned knowing about iron—kidney and liver function, and thyroid levels. We'll also check your Vitamin D levels. It's a pretty standard panel. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever tests you need to do, just do them. But I’m telling you, it’s probably just a phase. Old age, you know. Things wear out. But don’t go sending me to a specialist or anything. I’m not traveling anywhere for some blood tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. We’ll start with the bloodwork, and we can discuss the results together. We won’t jump to any conclusions or referrals until we have more information. I'll write the lab order now and you can take it to the front desk. They’ll schedule an appointment for you to get the blood drawn. And I'll also give you a printed list of the instructions on how to prepare for the blood draw, just to be sure everything goes smoothly. It’s best to avoid eating or drinking anything for 8-12 hours before the test. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just get me out of here. I need to get back to my garden. And don't expect me to call if anything changes. I'll manage.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. I understand. Here’s the lab order and the instructions again. Please take care of yourself, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you do have any concerns. We're here to help. Have a good day.
