DOCTOR: Hi Avril, good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. My… how you say… the office called for a check-up. A phone check-up, yes? I am… okay, mostly. Just getting older, I think. But they said I should come in to talk.
DOCTOR: Okay, a routine check-up initiated by the office – that’s great that they’re being proactive. And yes, “just getting older” is a perfectly valid reason to come in! It’s good to get things checked out, even if you’re feeling mostly okay. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit more about why the office suggested you come in?
PATIENT: Hmm. I do not… remember exactly. Something about my… blood pressure, maybe? The lady on the phone, she said it was a little high when they called to remind me about a test. I had the test, and then she said I need to see a doctor. I have Medicare, so I came when they told me to. It is… confusing sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It is confusing sometimes! So, a slightly elevated blood pressure reading prompted this visit – that's a very common reason to come in, and we're happy to take a look. To get a better picture, can you tell me if you’ve ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or if you've ever had any issues with it in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. My husband, he… he had problems with his heart, but that was many years ago. I went to the doctor regularly with him, but I never… I never had any problems myself. They always said my blood pressure was good. That was before… before he passed. I mostly just go to the doctor when something is really wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So, no previous diagnosis of hypertension, and your blood pressure has typically been good in the past. It sounds like this might be a relatively new thing. Do you happen to know what your blood pressure reading was when the office called?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, I do not. I think the lady said something about one-forty… over… something? I am not good with numbers. I remember thinking it sounded high, because she said I needed to come see the doctor, but I do not remember the exact number. I am sorry. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, don’t worry about it at all! It’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember the exact number. One-forty over something is a little elevated, and that’s why we want to take a look. To get a better sense of things, let’s do a quick check of your blood pressure now, and then we can talk a little bit about your health history. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I am a little nervous, but… I will try to be calm. Is it… is it a painful test?
DOCTOR: Not at all! It's completely painless. It just involves wrapping a cuff around your arm and inflating it briefly. It might feel a little snug, but it shouldn’t hurt. I'm just going to have you sit comfortably with your feet flat on the floor and your arm supported at about heart level. Then I’ll wrap this cuff around your arm and take a reading. It'll only take a minute. Just try to relax and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright. I will try. My arm is… quite large, you know? From working on cars. Maybe the cuff will be too small? I have been a mechanic for many years. It is… hard work. But I like it. It keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know! And that’s excellent that you've been a mechanic for so many years – that is hard work. We definitely have larger cuffs available, don’t worry. It's important to get an accurate reading, and using the right size cuff is part of that. Okay, here we go. Just relax your arm. I'll let you know when I'm starting. Deep breaths…
PATIENT: Okay… I am ready. It feels… tight. But I will try to stay calm. I used to work with very loud machines, you know? Much louder than this. So… this is nothing.
DOCTOR: That’s good to remember – you’re certainly used to dealing with different sensations! Okay, the reading is… 152 over 88. That is a bit elevated, as we suspected. It's not alarmingly high, but it's definitely something we need to investigate further. Now, sometimes blood pressure can fluctuate. We’ll want to confirm this reading with a few more checks over the next few minutes. In the meantime, could you tell me a little bit about any other medical conditions you might have?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my knees, they bother me sometimes. From kneeling to work on cars. The doctor gave me some pills for it, but I do not take them very often. They make me… sleepy. And I have… arthritis, I think? My hands are a little stiff in the morning. But other than that… I am mostly healthy. I do not smoke, and I do not drink much alcohol. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. My husband… he liked wine very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So, some knee pain and arthritis, but otherwise you’re feeling pretty good. You’re taking care of yourself, that’s good. And you’re not a smoker and only drink a glass of wine with dinner. That’s excellent. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I have not had any bad reactions to any pills that I remember. I have taken some for the knees, and some when I had a cold, but nothing… serious. I have a sensitive stomach, sometimes. But that is not an allergy, is it? Just… easily upset. I try to eat bland foods.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and a sensitive stomach. That’s good information. It’s good to be aware of that. Now, let's talk about your past medical history a bit more. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, when I was a little girl, I had… the measles. But that was many years ago. And when my husband was very sick, I stayed in the hospital with him. But that was not me being sick. I did not need to be hospitalized myself, not really. Just… visiting. He had a heart problem, you know? It was very sad.
DOCTOR: Okay, you had the measles as a child, and you stayed with your husband during his hospitalization, but you haven’t been hospitalized yourself. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have been very lucky, I think. No broken bones, no surgeries… just a few aches and pains from working on cars. My husband… he had surgery on his heart. But that was him. I… I have always been healthy, mostly. Except for the knees, maybe. They bother me when it is cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries for you. That’s good to know. Just some knee pain. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my mother, she had… diabetes, I think. Yes, diabetes. She needed to take pills for it. And my father… he had a problem with his heart, I think. He died when I was young. It was… sudden. My husband’s family… they were mostly healthy, I think. He did not talk about it much. He was a private man.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had diabetes and your father had a heart problem. That's helpful to know. And finally, let’s talk a little about your social history. Do you currently work, and if so, what do you do?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I am a mechanic. I have been a mechanic for… many years. It is hard work, but I like it. I own my own small shop. It keeps me busy. And I have a few good customers. I like fixing cars. It is… satisfying.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful! Owning your own shop is a big accomplishment. So you’re still actively working as a mechanic. Do you have any hobbies or activities you enjoy outside of work?
PATIENT: Not much, really. Working on cars takes up most of my time. And I… I like to garden a little bit. Just a small garden. Tomatoes and peppers mostly. My husband… he liked to fish. But I do not… I do not fish. It is too quiet. I like to be busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gardening is your main hobby. And you prefer to stay busy. Alright, that’s a good overview. Now, to get back to your blood pressure, given your slightly elevated reading today, and the history of heart problems and diabetes in your family, I’d like to run a few simple tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Tests are… okay. As long as they are not too painful. I am a little nervous, but… I will try to be brave. Just… tell me what they are, yes? So I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Of course, absolutely. I'll explain everything as we go. First, I’d like to do a basic blood test to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and a few other things. It's just a small prick in your finger or arm. Then, I’d also like to do an EKG, which is a quick, painless test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. We just attach a few sticky pads to your chest, arms, and legs. And finally, I think it would be helpful to get a urine sample. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… okay. A blood test, an EKG, and… a urine sample. I can do that. A prick in the finger, sticky pads… it does not sound too bad. I am a little worried about the blood test, I do not like needles. But… I will try. As long as it does not take too long. And you will tell me the results, yes? I want to know what is going on.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand your worry about the needle, and we’ll get it done as quickly and gently as possible. I’ll be right here with you the whole time. And yes, I will absolutely explain the results to you as soon as they’re available. Let’s start with the blood test then. If you’ll follow me this way… the phlebotomist will take great care of you.
PATIENT: Alright. Let us go then. I hope it does not hurt too much. I have not had blood taken in many years. .
DOCTOR: It will be quick, I promise. And the phlebotomist is very skilled. We’ll take things one step at a time.
