DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it's…it's this tiredness. Just so tired. And…and I keep…eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but…it feels good, you know? It's weird. Can we just get this over with? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Tiredness and…an urge to eat dirt. That is unusual. We'll definitely try to figure out what's going on. It's good you came in. First, let's talk about this tiredness. How long have you been feeling excessively tired?
PATIENT: Excessively? What does that even mean? I've been tired for…a long time. Months, I guess. Maybe longer. Honestly, I don't really keep track of these things. It just…is. It's like dragging myself through mud all day, every day. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. “Dragging yourself through mud” gives me a much better idea. Months, okay. And is this tiredness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's mostly constant. Some days are…worse. Like, I can barely get out of bed. But it's always there, a little bit. Even when I sleep, I don’t feel rested. It's just…ugh. Look, is this going to take long? I really don’t have time for…for feeling around and asking a bunch of questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Hedy. I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. It’s important to get to the bottom of this, though, and asking questions is part of that. Okay, so constant tiredness, even after sleeping. And you mentioned the dirt-eating. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It just…happens. I'll be outside, maybe gardening, and I just…taste it. The dirt. And it feels good. Like something I need. It’s…hard to explain. It's not like I want to eat dirt, but if I don't…I feel…off. Like something’s missing. And it’s not just any dirt, you know? It has to be…earthy. Dark. Not sandy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's an urge that comes on when you're outside, specifically with certain types of dirt – earthy, dark dirt. And it alleviates a feeling of something missing when you do it. Have you noticed any other cravings for unusual things – not just dirt – or any changes in your sense of taste or smell?
PATIENT: Changes in…smell? Taste? I don't know. I eat. I sleep. I work. I don't pay attention to things like that. Honestly, doctor, I don’t have time for fancy questions. I program CNC machines, okay? I deal with metal and code, not…smells. But... now that you mention it, sometimes food does taste kinda bland. Like it's missing something.
DOCTOR: Okay, bland taste is good to know. That could be a clue. I'm going to ask a few more questions, then I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to get a better overall picture. Is there any family history of unusual eating habits, anemia, or digestive issues?
PATIENT: Digestive issues? My mother…she complained about her stomach a lot. Always something. But she was a dramatic woman, okay? Everything was a crisis. And my father…he didn’t talk about anything. Ever. Anemia? I have no idea. Look, I really don’t know my family history. I didn't spend much time asking about it. I was busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It's common to not have a detailed family history. Let’s talk about your medical history then. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. I've been perfectly healthy my entire life, until this…tiredness and dirt thing. I work hard, I don't sit around feeling sorry for myself, and I don't go to doctors. Until now, of course. Honestly, I'm probably just run down. A little vacation is all I need.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses. And you don't take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't believe in filling my body with chemicals. I eat when I'm hungry, sleep when I'm tired, and get back to work. It's a simple life.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And do you have any allergies – to foods, medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I've never had a problem with anything. Seriously. You're asking a lot of questions, doctor. Is this going to lead to something, or are you just trying to waste my time?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Hedy. I assure you, I'm not trying to waste your time. These questions are necessary to get a complete picture and rule out different possibilities. Okay, no allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and just take a look at your skin and eyes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. But be quick, okay? I have things to do. And don't poke around too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be as efficient as possible. If you could please have a seat here, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not concerning at this point. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Conjunctiva appears pale. Let me just take a look at your skin now… Skin appears pale as well. And your fingernails… they seem a little brittle. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, I’m concerned about possible iron deficiency anemia. The tiredness, the craving for dirt – which can sometimes indicate pica associated with iron deficiency – and the paleness of your skin and conjunctiva are all suggestive of that. Do you recall any blood loss recently, even small amounts?
PATIENT: Iron…what? Look, I don’t know about any of that fancy stuff. Blood loss? No. I mean, maybe a little when I cut myself gardening, but nothing serious. Honestly, I just want to feel better. Is this dirt thing serious? Will I have to stop working?
DOCTOR: The dirt eating, or pica, is often a sign of a nutritional deficiency, and the most common one is iron deficiency. It’s good you haven’t had significant blood loss. We need to confirm whether or not you’re iron deficient. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check your red blood cell levels, and an iron panel to check your iron stores, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. We'll also check your vitamin B12 and folate levels, just to rule out other possibilities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: More tests? Seriously? Look, I really don't have time for this. Can't you just…give me something? A shot or a pill or something? I need to get back to work. And I don’t want a whole list of appointments.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Hedy. I wish I could just give you something right now to make you feel better, but it’s important to know what is causing your tiredness and the dirt craving before we start any treatment. Giving you something without knowing the cause could potentially mask the problem or even be harmful. The blood tests will give us the information we need to make an accurate diagnosis and develop the best treatment plan for you. The blood tests are relatively quick and easy. We can do them here in the clinic today. It will take a few days to get the results back, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the next steps. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Just…get it over with. But I’m telling you, it’s probably just stress. A little vacation is all I need. But…fine, do the tests. Just hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. Alright. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. It shouldn’t take long. I’ll let you know when they’re ready. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No. Just…get it over with. And please don’t make me come back if it’s something silly. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: I assure you, we'll discuss the results thoroughly and make a plan that works for you. I won't dismiss your concerns, and we'll focus on getting you back to feeling your best. .
PATIENT: .
