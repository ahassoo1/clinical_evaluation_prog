DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, good morning. I am here for… the check-up before the insurance starts. They told me I need to do this. It is… required, yes? I have Medicare.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. A welcome to Medicare exam. That's perfectly normal, and good of you to get it done right away. It helps us get a baseline of your health. So, just to confirm, you don't have any specific concerns right now?
PATIENT: Concerns? No, not really. I feel… fine. I work. I eat. I sleep. Everything is… normal. I do not understand why I need to be here if nothing is wrong. Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Mr. Barban. It's a preventative measure. Even if you feel fine, it's important to check everything out. We want to catch anything small before it becomes a bigger problem. It also establishes a relationship with a primary care doctor, which is helpful down the road. Think of it like maintaining a car – you get it checked even when it's running smoothly. Now, let's just go through some questions to get a better picture of your overall health. If you don’t mind. Have you been seeing any other doctors regularly, or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospital? No. Never. I do not… like doctors. I only come when I must. And no, I do not see any other doctors. Just… this one, now. For the insurance. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Barban. We’ll try to be as quick as possible. It shouldn't take too long. Just a few questions, and then a brief physical exam. Okay. Let’s talk about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Significant…? My family is from Yemen. Things are… different there. My grandfather, he had… old age. My mother, she had… problems with her stomach, I think. Nothing… serious. They did not have good doctors. They did not go to the hospital much. It is… not common where they are from. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. “Old age” and “problems with her stomach” are good to know. It's understandable that access to healthcare wasn't always easy. Were there any specific kinds of stomach problems, if you recall?
PATIENT: Specific…? No. Just… pain. And she did not eat much sometimes. She complained a lot. My aunt, she has… high blood? The pressure, yes. She takes pills for it. That is all I remember. It is not my area of… expertise. I work in a factory. I do not talk about health all day.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. “High blood pressure” is good to know. So, your mother had stomach pain and loss of appetite, and your aunt has high blood pressure. That gives us something to work with. Now, just to cover all bases, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I do not take anything. I eat healthy. Mostly. Vitamins? No. Supplements? What are those? I drink coffee. Every morning. Does that count? It helps me work. It is… important for my job.
DOCTOR: Coffee doesn’t count as a medication, Mr. Barban. Good. No current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I have never had any allergies. I work with… many things in the factory. Dust, metal, food. Nothing bothers me. I am strong. I do not get sick easily. I have a good immune system, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Alright, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. It is… bad for you. My father smoked. He had a cough. A very bad cough. I do not want to end up like him. I do not need that. It is… unhealthy. I avoid it. Completely.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Good for you. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Sometimes. With my friends. On the weekends. Not much. A little bit of beer. It helps me relax. I do not drink every night. Only when I am… celebrating. Or stressed. It is… normal. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, occasional beer consumption isn't a problem, Mr. Barban. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, is there anything else you'd like to mention?
PATIENT: Physical exam? What does that involve? I do not like being… touched. Is it necessary? I thought this was just a… questionnaire. I am feeling a little… uncomfortable now. I just want to get this over with. For the insurance.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Barban. The physical exam is just a quick check of your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and a listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also take a look in your ears and throat, and feel your abdomen. It's all very routine and helps me get a better overall picture of your health. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. If you're truly uncomfortable with anything, we can skip it, but it does give me valuable information. Would you like me to explain each step as I go?
PATIENT: Explain each step? Yes, please. That might be… better. I do not like surprises. And… please be gentle. I am a strong man, but I do not enjoy being… prodded. What is first? Blood pressure, you said? What does that even mean? And what will you do?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Blood pressure measures the force of your blood against your artery walls. It’s a good indicator of your heart health. What I’ll do is wrap this cuff around your arm, like this. It will inflate and tighten briefly, then deflate. It doesn’t hurt, it just feels a little pressure. I’ll be listening with this stethoscope to hear the sounds of your heartbeat as it inflates and deflates. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tighten? Like… a snake? No, I do not like that sound. A snake… squeezing. Is it very tight? Will it hurt my arm? I have strong muscles. I do not want to damage them. Can you… not squeeze so hard? Perhaps just… touch it. Do not tighten. Just touch. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Barban, we can do it gently. I understand your concern. I will not squeeze tightly. I will barely inflate the cuff, just enough to get a reading, and I will make sure it doesn't feel uncomfortable. It won’t damage your muscles, I promise. We can just barely touch your arm with the cuff, and I’ll listen with the stethoscope. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable…? Yes. Barely touch. Do not squeeze. And tell me what you are doing before you do it. Do not surprise me. And what is this… stethoscope? Is it cold? I do not like cold things on my skin. This is… a lot. Are you sure this is necessary for the insurance? Maybe just the questionnaire is enough?
DOCTOR: This is a stethoscope. It’s just a tool to listen to the sounds inside your body, like your heartbeat and breathing. It isn’t cold. It’s room temperature. And yes, Mr. Barban, the insurance requires a brief physical exam along with the questionnaire. It’s standard procedure. I understand your anxiety, and I’ll go as slowly as you need me to, explaining each step before I do it. First, I’ll just have you sit comfortably, and I’ll gently wrap the cuff around your upper arm. It won’t be tight, I promise. Just enough to get a reading. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But if it hurts, I want you to stop immediately. And explain before you touch me. Do not surprise me. I am sitting now. My arm is… ready. But be gentle. Very gentle. I am a strong man, but I do not like unnecessary… force. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Barban, I understand perfectly. I will explain each step before I touch you, and I will stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. Okay. I’m now going to gently wrap this cuff around your upper left arm, like this. It will feel a little pressure, but it shouldn't be tight or painful. Just tell me if anything feels uncomfortable. Now, I’m going to place this part of the stethoscope on your arm, just below the cuff. It’s just listening for your heartbeat. I will now slowly inflate the cuff. It will feel a bit of pressure. Let me know if that’s alright.
PATIENT: Okay… it feels… strange. Not painful. But strange. Like… a snake, but a very gentle snake. It is… okay for now. But do not inflate it more. Just leave it like this. And what are you listening for? What does my heartbeat sound like? Is it… fast or slow? Is it… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It’s good that it doesn’t feel painful. I’m listening for the sounds of your heartbeat. Your heartbeat sounds regular and strong. It’s a little fast, but that’s likely due to your anxiety. It’s perfectly normal to have a slightly elevated heart rate when you’re nervous. But it's good overall. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to listen to your lungs, just to make sure everything sounds clear. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Listen to my lungs? What does that involve? Do I need to… take off my shirt? I do not like being… exposed. And what if… something is wrong? What if you find something bad? I do not want to know. I just want this to be over with. Quickly. For the insurance. Do I need to take off my shirt? Tell me exactly what you are going to do. Do not surprise me.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Barban, you do not need to take off your shirt. Listening to your lungs just involves placing the stethoscope on your back and chest, over your lungs, while you take a few deep breaths. I’m just listening for any unusual sounds, like wheezing or crackling. It won’t be uncomfortable, I promise. I will explain each step before I do it. I will place the stethoscope on your back, like this. Then I will ask you to take a deep breath. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. But be gentle. Do not press too hard. And tell me when to breathe. Do not surprise me. And do not take too long. I just want this over with. Quickly. Is it… cold? Is the stethoscope cold? This is… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: It’s room temperature, Mr. Barban. Not cold. Now, I’d like you to take a deep breath for me, just like this. Okay, good. Now exhale. And another deep breath, and exhale. Everything sounds clear, Mr. Barban. Your lungs sound good. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart, just to complete the exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright… heart now? How close will you be? Do not get too close. I do not like… personal space. And do not touch me unnecessarily. Just listen. Do not poke or prod. And tell me what you are listening for. What does a good heart sound like? Is mine… good? This is… stressful. Do I need to lie down?
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to lie down. I will listen to your heart with the stethoscope, just like I did with your lungs. I will be as quick and respectful of your space as possible. I won’t get too close. I'm just listening for any unusual sounds, like murmurs or extra beats. I'm now going to place the stethoscope on your chest, like this. It won’t be uncomfortable. Okay, now take a deep breath. And exhale. Your heart sounds good, Mr. Barban. Regular and strong. No unusual sounds. Everything sounds normal so far. That completes the physical exam. Are you feeling alright?
PATIENT: Fine. It is… over now? Good. That was… unpleasant. I do not enjoy being… examined. What happens next? Will you tell me… everything is okay? I just want to know if I am… healthy. And if I can go now. For the insurance. Do not make me wait long. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Barban, that completes the exam. And yes, everything sounds good. Your heart and lungs sound healthy, and your blood pressure is within a normal range. Based on this initial exam, you appear to be in good health. Now, this is just a baseline exam. It's important to schedule regular check-ups to monitor your health and catch any potential problems early on. We can discuss that further if you'd like. But for the purposes of your insurance, you've completed all the necessary requirements. I'll have the nurse print out a summary of your visit for you. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Regular check-ups? No. I do not want to come back here. This was… enough. I just want the paper. For the insurance. So I can go. Quickly. Is it ready now? The paper. Do not make me wait. I have things to do. And please… no more touching. Just the paper. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Barban. I understand. Nurse, can you please bring a summary of Mr. Barban’s visit to examination room three?
PATIENT: Finally. Good. Thank you. I will… be waiting. And please… no more surprises. Just the paper. I just want to go now. Is it… much longer? I have things to do. This was… stressful.
DOCTOR: . It should be just a moment, Mr. Barban. The nurse is very efficient. I apologize if this experience was stressful for you. I understand that medical examinations can be uncomfortable. I want to assure you that I did my best to respect your boundaries and make you as comfortable as possible. .
PATIENT: .
