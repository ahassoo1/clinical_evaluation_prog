DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Though I must say, I haven’t much time for pleasantries. Work, you see. It’s…draining. Utterly draining. I suppose that’s what one calls it these days. Burnout. Is that the term? Honestly, the youth and their…labels. I’m a teacher, you know. Was a teacher. Postsecondary. Though the details…they’re becoming…blurred.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds as though you've been under a great deal of stress. It’s perfectly alright if details are difficult to recall; we can take things at your pace. You mentioned being a teacher, and perhaps transitioning from that role. Could you tell me a little more about what’s been draining you, and when you began to feel this way?
PATIENT: “Feel this way”? Doctor, I’ve been a rational man my entire life. Feelings are…unproductive. But, very well. The students, naturally. No respect for knowledge anymore. Always questioning, demanding…simplification. And the administration… endless meetings about… initiatives. Meaningless initiatives. When did I begin to feel…this way? Honestly, it’s been a gradual decline. Years, probably. Though pinpointing a specific date? I haven’t the faintest idea. I retired… last year, I believe. Or was it the year before? The years all run together now. It’s terribly frustrating.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like a challenging situation, both with the students and the administrative demands. A gradual decline over years is quite common, and it’s understandable that the exact timing is difficult to recall. To help me understand what’s going on now, could you describe what you’re experiencing currently?
PATIENT: “Experiencing”? Doctor, I’m tired. Constantly tired. And irritable. My wife… well, my ex-wife, bless her soul… used to say I was difficult. Now, it’s simply… exhausting to engage. I have little patience for… frivolity. And I find myself… forgetting things. Important things. Names, dates… the plot of a perfectly good novel I read just last week. It’s… disconcerting. Though, I suppose, one should expect a degree of decline at my age. It’s not as if I’m spring chicken, you know. Though I was always a very sharp man. Still am, I assure you. Mentally, at least. Most of the time.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Schlatterer. Fatigue, irritability, and memory difficulties are certainly things we should investigate further. It’s good that you're aware of these changes. You mentioned these changes have been occurring gradually. Have you noticed any other symptoms – perhaps changes in your appetite, sleep patterns, or any physical discomfort?
PATIENT: Appetite…hmm. I suppose I haven’t much of one these days. Everything tastes…bland. My wife – again, my ex-wife – was a wonderful cook. Used to make a magnificent sarma. But now…food is simply fuel. And sleep… fitful, at best. I wake frequently, often with a racing mind. Ruminating, you see. About… things. Old grievances, mostly. And physical discomfort… my back aches, naturally. Old war wound, you know. Though that’s to be expected. It flares up occasionally. And my hands… they tremble a bit. Though I always had steady hands. Used to be quite the pianist, you know. A very good pianist. Not anymore, of course. Everything… is fading. Truly fading. Let’s just get this over with, shall we? I have a library book to return.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to move things along, Mr. Schlatterer. We will, but it’s important to gather as much information as possible. Thank you for being so forthcoming. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: Medical history… Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the foggiest. I saw a doctor, of course. When I needed to. A check-up here and there. Perhaps some indigestion, once. My wife… she handled all the medical arrangements. Always insisted on preventative care. A very organized woman. I vaguely recall something about my cholesterol being… elevated? Perhaps. Years ago. And my blood pressure… possibly a bit high. Though I’ve always been a healthy man. Very active, you see. Used to walk for miles. I’m not one for ailments. I pride myself on my constitution. Really, I haven’t any significant medical history to speak of. A minor war wound, as I mentioned, and perhaps some elevated cholesterol. That’s it. Are we nearly finished?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schlatterer. That's helpful. And we are getting closer. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Absolutely not. I don’t believe in them. Poison, that’s what they are. My wife… again, my ex-wife… tried to get me to take something for my arthritis, years ago. I refused, of course. A perfectly good cup of chamomile tea is all one needs. And perhaps a little brandy, on occasion. For the aches, you see. But that’s it. No pills, no potions, no…chemicals. A natural man, I am. Always have been. Really, I take nothing. Except perhaps a little brandy now and then. Are we quite finished now, Doctor? I have that book to return, you know. A first edition. Very valuable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. I appreciate your honesty. Just a few more questions, then we can proceed with a brief physical examination, if you’re agreeable. Before we do that, could you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I've lived a full life. I've eaten everything. Traveled everywhere. Encountered all manner of flora and fauna. I’m not prone to… sensitivities. Though, come to think of it… I did have a rather unpleasant reaction to some shellfish, decades ago. But that was a one-time occurrence. And I’m certain it was simply a bad oyster. Not an allergy, per se. Really, I have no allergies to speak of. Absolutely none. Now, can we please conclude this…interrogation? I'm beginning to feel rather faint. And that book… it’s overdue, you know. A library’s rules are very strict.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. Thank you for your patience and for answering my questions. Before we proceed with the physical exam, I want to explain what I’m going to do. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a brief neurological assessment – checking your reflexes and balance. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Neurological assessment? Balance? Doctor, I assure you, my balance is perfectly fine. And my reflexes… well, they’re as good as they ever were. But, very well. If you must. Get it over with, quickly. I haven’t all day, you know. And please, be gentle. I’m a fragile man. Mentally, at least. Though I still have my wits about me, naturally. Just… proceed. And hurry.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. If you’ll follow me, we can get started. It will only take a few moments. Please, have a seat here on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Would you please remove your shirt and lie back?
PATIENT: Remove my…shirt? Doctor, really! Is this absolutely necessary? I assure you, my heartbeat is perfectly regular. And my lungs… perfectly healthy. I walked for miles, you know. Daily. But, very well. If you insist. But do hurry, please. This is…undignified. And be mindful of my modesty. I’m a respectable man. Though I suppose… one doesn't have much choice in these matters. Get on with it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Just breathe normally. Your heart rate is a bit slow, but regular. I do detect a slight crackling sound in your lower lungs, primarily on the right side. It’s subtle, but warrants further investigation. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated – 142/90. I'm going to check your pulse in your wrists. Your pulse is weak and a little irregular.
PATIENT: Irregular? Weak? Nonsense. I assure you, my constitution is perfectly sound. A slight crackling… probably just a bit of dust. I spend a lot of time in the library, you know. Old books, old paper… it's bound to accumulate. And elevated blood pressure? Preposterous. I lead a perfectly sedentary life. No stress, no excitement… just quiet contemplation. This is… unsettling, Doctor. Very unsettling. Perhaps I’m coming down with something? A chill, perhaps? Or the onset of…fading? Is that a possibility? Honestly, I feel rather… fragile. And cold. Get on with it, please. The sooner this is over, the better. I have that book to return, you know. And I’m quite sure I left my spectacles in the waiting room. A first edition, Doctor. Very valuable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Just try to relax. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Now, I'm going to check your neurological reflexes. Your reflexes are diminished, particularly in your lower extremities. And your gait is slightly unsteady, as you stand to sit. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Your eye movements are a little slow, and there's a slight tremor in your hands. Based on this brief examination, Mr. Schlatterer, you are experiencing several concerning symptoms – fatigue, memory difficulties, slow heart rate, elevated blood pressure, diminished reflexes, and some mild tenderness in your abdomen. These symptoms could be indicative of several different conditions, including dehydration, nutritional deficiencies, underlying heart condition, or early signs of dementia. It’s difficult to say definitively without further testing.
PATIENT: Dementia?! Are you suggesting… I’m losing my mind?! Preposterous! Absolutely preposterous! I may be forgetful, perhaps. A bit absentminded. But I’m perfectly lucid! I can still recite entire passages from Proust, you know. Proust! This is… terrible. Utterly terrible. I knew it. I knew something was amiss. It’s the fading. It’s finally catching up with me. What… what do we do? What tests must be done? And how long will it take? I have a library book to return, you know. And… and I’m quite sure I left my spectacles in the waiting room. A first edition, Doctor. Very valuable. You must help me, Doctor. Please. You must. Before it’s… too late.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, please, try to remain calm. I said it could be an early sign, and that’s simply to be thorough. We need to investigate further to determine the cause of your symptoms. I understand your anxiety, and I assure you, we will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. First, I’d like to order some blood tests to check for any nutritional deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, and signs of infection. We’ll also perform a urine analysis. Then, I recommend a comprehensive neurological evaluation, including an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. I will also schedule you for an electrocardiogram to assess your heart rhythm. These tests will help us determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend you stay well hydrated, eat a balanced diet, and avoid any strenuous activity. I understand you’re concerned about returning your book, and we’ll certainly keep that in mind. Perhaps a family member or friend could assist you?
PATIENT: Family… My ex-wife wouldn’t be much help. She’s… preoccupied. And I don’t have any close friends. Just… acquaintances. Library patrons, mostly. They wouldn’t understand. And an MRI? Is that… painful? I’ve always been a bit claustrophobic. And the tests… how long will they take? I have… obligations. Library obligations, you see. Very important obligations. This is… overwhelming. Utterly overwhelming. Perhaps… perhaps I should just go home. And… and forget about the book. And… and everything else. Is that… a possibility? Just… leave it all behind? It’s… it’s becoming too much. Too much for an old man to bear. And my spectacles… I really must find my spectacles. A first edition, Doctor. Very valuable.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. We will take things one step at a time. The MRI is not painful, though it can be a bit uncomfortable for those with claustrophobia. We can discuss medication to help you relax during the procedure, and the technicians will do everything they can to make you comfortable. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes. As for your spectacles, let me ask the reception staff to check the lost and found. We'll do our best to locate them. Right now, I'm going to write you a prescription for a mild anxiolytic to help manage your anxiety. I also recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment with me next week to discuss the results of the tests and develop a comprehensive treatment plan. In the meantime, please, focus on getting some rest and staying hydrated. We'll get through this together, Mr. Schlatterer. And as for the book… we can address that later. Your health is the most important thing right now. Do you have any questions for me at this moment?
PATIENT: Anxiolytic… very well. Anything to quell this… turmoil. Turmoil is an apt description, Doctor. Utter turmoil. Questions… yes. One question, perhaps. Will… will this affect my ability to… recall things? To read? To… appreciate literature? That is… paramount, Doctor. Absolutely paramount. I would hate to… lose my connection to the world of books. It’s… all I have left, you see. All I have left. And my spectacles… a first edition, Doctor. Very valuable. Please, tell me… will I still be able to read?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, that's a very valid and important question. The anxiolytic should improve your ability to focus and recall things by reducing your anxiety. As for the underlying cause of your symptoms, it's too early to say definitively whether it will affect your cognitive function. However, many conditions can be managed with treatment, and we’ll explore every option to preserve your ability to read and enjoy literature. We will do comprehensive testing to determine the exact cause of your difficulties and tailor a treatment plan specifically to your needs. If your cognitive function is affected, there are therapies and strategies that can help improve memory and concentration. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any stressful situations and focusing on activities you enjoy, such as reading. We will address the issue of your spectacles as soon as possible. I want you to know, Mr. Schlatterer, that we will do everything we can to help you maintain your quality of life and preserve your passion for literature. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe… I believe that will be all. For now. Perhaps… perhaps I should go home. And… and try to find my spectacles. And… and read. Yes. Read. That sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor Shely. You have… given me a sliver of hope. A very small sliver. And… and please. If you happen to find my spectacles… a first edition, Doctor. Very valuable.
DOCTOR: We'll do everything we can, Mr. Schlatterer.
