DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Honcoop is the name. Look, I ain't got all day, so let’s get right to it. I need a… a paper. A paper sayin' I can do somethin'. Somethin' with my… face. That's all. Don't rightly remember the details, to be honest. Just need it approved. Is that somethin' you do here?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. No problem at all. It sounds like you might need a medical form filled out for something involving your face. Many places require a doctor’s approval for procedures like that. To make sure I fill it out correctly, could you tell me a little more about what this paper is for?
PATIENT: Paper? Look, I went to a… a place downtown. Very nice establishment. They talkin’ about fixin’ things. Smoothin’ things out, you understand? Some… wrinkles. That’s what they said. Don't ask me to explain it, I just want the okay to go through with it. I don’t recall the name of the place, exactly. Fancy name, though. Real fancy. They need you to sign somethin’. That's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cosmetic procedure to address wrinkles. That helps. To be sure it's safe for you to proceed, and to fill out the paperwork properly, I need to ask a few questions. It's standard procedure, Mr. Honcoop. First, have you had anything like this done before?
PATIENT: Before? Heavens, no. I ain’t a young man anymore, but I ain’t had nothin’ done. This is a first. I take care of myself, mostly. Good eatin’, good sleepin’... when I can get it. But this… smoothin’ business? Brand new. Don't waste time askin' about what I have done, 'cause there ain't been nothin'. Next question, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, fair enough. No previous procedures, understood. Let's talk about your medical history then. Do you have any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else your previous doctors have told you about?
PATIENT: Doctors? I seen a few in my time. Mostly just for aches and pains. Old age, you know. I don't remember anythin’ serious. Blood pressure, maybe? I think somethin' about that once. But it weren't nothin' to write home about. They gave me a little pill, I think. Stopped takin' it. Look, I ain’t one for sittin’ around complainin’ to doctors. I get by. I feel alright. Now, can we please get to this paper? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Honcoop. We’ll get there. Knowing about past medical issues, even if they weren't serious, helps me make sure this procedure is safe for you. Just a few more quick questions, then we can talk about the paperwork. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat just about anything. Not too keen on shellfish, but that’s just a preference, not an allergy. Never had a reaction to any medicine that I recall. Look, I'm a pretty simple man. Don't fuss much. Can we hurry this up, Doctor? I ain't got all day to be recallin' things. This is gettin' ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, that’s good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… I take somethin' for my… joints. They get a bit creaky in the mornin'. Little white pill. Can't recall the name. And… sometimes a pain reliever for my back. When it’s really botherin’ me. Aspirin, usually. That's it. Now, please, Doctor. This paper. Is that what we're here for, or are we gonna be doin' a full life history? I got a schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, joint pain medication - we'll try to figure out the name later if we can, and aspirin as needed. We're almost there, Mr. Honcoop. Just a couple more questions. Do you have any family history of medical problems – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family? Lord, where do I start? My mama… she had the sugar, I think. Diabetes. She wasn’t a healthy woman. My daddy… he just… died in his sleep. Heart, I reckon. My brother, he had some kinda… lung trouble. Smoked too much. That's all I remember. Old family, lots of troubles. Now, can we get to the signin'? I'm startin' to feel faint just thinkin’ about all these ailments.
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a good picture. Last question, Mr. Honcoop. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no! Never touched the stuff. Gives me a cough just thinkin’ about it. I always told my brother he was askin' for trouble. Now look, Doctor, are you gonna write this paper or not? I got an appointment to keep. This whole thing is takin’ too long. I need to be goin’.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration. However, before I can comfortably sign this form, I need to do a brief physical exam. It's important to make sure you're healthy enough for this procedure. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a quick look at your skin. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Exam? You want to examine me? Now you're askin’ too much! Look, I came here for a paper, not a medical inspection! I told you I’m fine. Perfectly fine. I don’t need you pokin’ and proddin’ me. This is ridiculous! I'm leavin'. You can keep your paper. I'll find another doctor. A doctor who understands I don't need all this fuss! .
