DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, frankly, it’s about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about it for my arthritis. Says it’s much better than those pills the other doctor gave me. I just want to see if it's something I might be eligible for, you understand. Not that I need it, but… well, she’s quite insistent.
DOCTOR: Right. Medical marijuana. While I appreciate your daughter's concern, and I understand you're exploring options, it’s not quite as straightforward as simply being “eligible.” It’s a controlled substance, and there are specific criteria for its use, even in states where it's legal. Before we discuss that further, let's talk about your arthritis. How long have you been dealing with it?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Well, of course, I understand it’s not a simple matter. One doesn’t simply get things these days. As for how long… goodness, decades. It started mildly, just a little stiffness in my hands, you see. That must have been… oh, sixty years ago, at least? It’s gotten progressively worse, naturally. Though I’ve managed. I always have. It’s just… the pain is becoming more frequent, and the pills don’t seem to be doing as much anymore.
DOCTOR: Sixty years… that’s a significant duration. And the current medications aren’t providing adequate relief, you say?
PATIENT: Adequate? No, Doctor, they are not. They make me… drowsy, mostly. And they upset my stomach. I find myself just… avoiding activity, which is hardly ideal. A woman my age shouldn’t be sitting around all day, you know? Though my daughter, she says the marijuana won’t have those side effects. I do hope she’s right.
DOCTOR: Your daughter is understandably enthusiastic, but it's important to be realistic. While some patients do experience fewer side effects with medical marijuana, it’s not without potential risks and complications, especially considering your age. Before we explore that avenue, I'd like to get a more detailed picture of your arthritis. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Well, it’s not a sharp pain, you understand. More of a… a deep ache. A constant throbbing, really. It’s worst in my hands and my knees, naturally. Makes it difficult to… well, to do anything requiring dexterity. Knitting, mostly. And gardening, though I haven’t been able to do much of that lately. It also gets worse with the weather, you know? Damp days are simply dreadful. A proper ache, it is. And it keeps me up at night.
DOCTOR: So, primarily in the hands and knees, a deep, throbbing ache, exacerbated by damp weather and impacting your sleep. And it’s affecting your ability to engage in hobbies… knitting and gardening, you said. Now, have you had any swelling or redness in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling, sometimes. Not terribly noticeable, mind you. It’s more of a… puffiness, really. It comes and goes. And redness… occasionally, yes. But it’s not constant. My daughter keeps telling me it sounds like… what did she say? Rheumatoid arthritis? But the doctor before… he just called it arthritis. And gave me pills. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve seen so many doctors over the years, I can barely keep track. They all say something different.
DOCTOR: Rheumatoid arthritis is certainly a possibility, though arthritis is a broad term, as you’ve rightly observed. The intermittent swelling and redness are… suggestive. Now, let's move on to some other areas. Have you experienced any stiffness in the mornings?
PATIENT: Oh, terribly so, Doctor. Absolutely terribly. It takes me… well, a good hour, sometimes longer, to get moving properly. My hands feel like… like claws, you know? It’s quite unpleasant. I have to have a very hot cup of tea and really… work them through it. It’s not a good way to start the day, I assure you. It used to be just a little bit of stiffness, but now… it’s quite debilitating, really.
DOCTOR: Prolonged morning stiffness is… consistent with inflammatory arthritis. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well, I do get rather tired, more so than I used to. Though that could just be my age, naturally. And occasionally, I feel a bit… achy all over, not just in my hands and knees. A general malaise, you might say. My daughter tells me I should be getting more rest, but honestly, Doctor, a woman my age has responsibilities. One can’t simply lie around all day. It's not as if I have nothing to do.
DOCTOR: "Malaise"…fatigue and general unwellness. And you've seen previous doctors for this, who have prescribed medication without further investigation. Now, let’s briefly discuss your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me see. I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. And I had a touch of pneumonia once, but that cleared up quickly. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been a fairly healthy woman, despite my arthritis. I watch what I eat, I get regular exercise… well, I used to get regular exercise. I try to stay active, you understand. I’ve never been one to complain, or go running to the doctor for every little ache and pain. It's just… this arthritis is becoming increasingly difficult to manage.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal and a past episode of pneumonia. Alright. And any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, I don’t believe so. Oh, wait! I had a hysterectomy, quite a long time ago. When I was… oh, in my thirties, I suppose. It was necessary at the time. But other than that, no. Just the gallbladder and the hysterectomy. I’ve always been rather lucky, in that regard. Never needed much in the way of medical intervention, until this arthritis started bothering me.
DOCTOR: Hysterectomy. Alright. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Is there anyone in your family with arthritis, or any other autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Family history… that’s a difficult one. My mother had… something with her joints, I believe. But she didn’t talk much about it. She was a very private woman, you see. And my aunt… she had a terrible rash, all over her body. Something autoimmune, my daughter said. But honestly, Doctor, I wasn’t terribly close to either of them. We didn’t really discuss these things. It's not as if it was common knowledge, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let's discuss medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Well, just the pills the doctor gave me for the arthritis. Ibuprofen, mostly. And sometimes, when the pain is particularly bad, I’ll take a little something for sleep. Just an over-the-counter sleep aid. Nothing strong, mind you. And I take a vitamin supplement, of course. Everyone my age should take a vitamin supplement. But other than that, no. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you understand. It can’t be good for you, all those chemicals.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, a sleep aid, and a vitamin supplement. Alright. Now, Ms. Ranells, let me be frank. Your symptoms – the decades-long arthritis, the stiffness, swelling, fatigue, family history… These are suggestive of a more systemic inflammatory process, potentially rheumatoid arthritis. Simply masking the pain with ibuprofen isn't addressing the underlying issue. As for medical marijuana… while it may provide some symptomatic relief, it's not a substitute for proper diagnosis and treatment. And frankly, given your age and other health considerations, self-treating with marijuana could be… unwise. I recommend a full blood workup, including a rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibody test, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you agree to that?
PATIENT: Rheumatoid arthritis? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Blood workup, you say? Well, I suppose if you think it’s necessary. Though I really don’t like needles. And I’ve never been one for… fussing with doctors, you understand. But… If it will help me figure out what’s going on, and perhaps find a better way to manage this pain… alright. Yes, I suppose I agree. But I still think my daughter has a point about the marijuana. It’s worth exploring, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with the blood workup. I'll have the nurse draw the samples. As for the marijuana, I will not be recommending it at this time. Once we have the lab results, we can discuss appropriate treatment options, which may include disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, or a referral to a rheumatologist. In the meantime, continue taking the ibuprofen as needed for pain relief, but please avoid self-treating with any other substances. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Disease-modifying… what did you say? Those sound… complicated. And a rheumatologist? Oh dear. More doctors. Well, I suppose I have no choice, if you think it’s necessary. No, I don’t think so. Just… please hurry, Doctor. I don’t like being in pain, and I’d like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. And… can you write down the name of that blood test, so I can tell my daughter? She’ll want to know. Rheumatoid… something.
DOCTOR: Very well. The blood test is called an "Anti-CCP antibody test" and a "Rheumatoid Factor". I’ll also order a complete blood count and an ESR and CRP. The nurse will explain the process. It will take some time for the results to come back, but we’ll get this sorted as quickly as possible. In the meantime, try to rest and avoid activities that exacerbate your pain. And please, no self-treating. I'll have the nurse come in and draw the blood, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they are available. Do you have any other concerns before I leave?
PATIENT: Anti-CCP… it looks rather complicated. Very well. No, I don’t think so. Just… please, Doctor, make sure the nurse is gentle. I really don’t like needles. Thank you. I believe that’s all. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll inform the nurse. Another patient relying on internet advice…
