DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, I need to get some health forms signed and, you know, verified. It's for… paperwork. Lots of paperwork these days. I just want to get it over with, if you don't mind. It’s mostly for a program I’m applying for.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we can certainly get those forms completed. However, I am a physician, and I do need to ask a few questions to ensure I’m accurately representing your health status on these documents. It’s not just about a signature, you understand. It's a legal responsibility. So, let's start with your general health. Have you been feeling well recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, I understand. Legal… everything has to be legal these days. Well, “feeling well”… I’m 76, Doctor. Things ache. But nothing major. I get tired easily, but who doesn't at my age? I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, truthfully. I try to stay out of those places if I can. Is there a specific thing you need to know? Just tell me what you need for the forms.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Melvenia. And I understand your reluctance. However, “things ache” is rather vague. Let’s try to be a little more specific. Where are you experiencing the aches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Everywhere, really. My knees, mostly. And my back. My shoulders too, if I’ve been doing anything… like gardening. It’s just… old age, I guess. It comes with the territory. But it doesn't stop me from doing things, you know? I just… push through it. Are we getting close to being done with these questions?
DOCTOR: We’re getting there. But I need to establish a baseline, Melvenia. When did these aches start, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that’s hard to say. A little at a time, over the years, I suppose. Maybe… ten years ago? It started with just my knees, then the back joined in. It’s not sudden, Doctor. It’s just… a slow decline. I don’t remember a specific incident or anything that started it. I just woke up one day and things weren't as easy as they used to be. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. Now, besides the aches, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, I get more tired than I used to, like I said. And my memory isn’t what it used to be, but honestly, Doctor, whose is at my age? I forget little things… where I put my glasses, what I was going to say mid-sentence… things like that. Nothing major, though. And I’ve been a little… winded, if I walk too far. But I mostly just take things slow. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is. Now, have you had any recent illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past year?
PATIENT: No, no illnesses or hospital stays. Not in the past year, or really, for many years. I try to stay healthy. I eat my vegetables, I get a little exercise… well, as much as my knees will allow. I had a bad cold a couple of winters ago, but I just stayed home and rested. Nothing serious enough to go to the doctor about.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. It’s… ibuprofen, I think? The regular kind. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take a little something with melatonin in it. But that’s it. Nothing else, Doctor. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. Is this almost finished?
DOCTOR: Almost. Just a few more questions, Melvenia. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had any problems with food or anything like that. I can eat pretty much anything. Well, I don’t like cilantro, but that's not an allergy, is it? Just a preference. No, no allergies, Doctor. Truly. Can we please get this over with? These forms are time-sensitive.
DOCTOR: Very well. One final question, Melvenia. Have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was young, a long, long time ago. And I had a hysterectomy when I was in my thirties. But that was… decades ago. Nothing else, Doctor. Really. Is that everything? Can we finally get these forms signed?
DOCTOR: Alright, Melvenia. That’s all the questions I have for now. However, given your history of aches, fatigue, and memory issues, I would like to perform a brief physical exam just to get a better baseline. It won’t take long, but it's important to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Doctor, I just need these forms signed. I don’t have time for a whole examination. I’m perfectly fine, just a little old and creaky, that’s all. Can’t you just sign the forms based on what I’ve already told you? It’s really important I get these submitted quickly. I don’t want to delay the process any further.
DOCTOR: Melvenia, with all due respect, I am a physician, and I have a professional obligation to ensure the accuracy of the information I provide. Simply signing a form without a proper assessment would be irresponsible and potentially detrimental to your health. A brief exam—checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, a quick neurological check—will take only a few minutes and provide valuable information. It's a small price to pay for peace of mind. I understand your urgency, but I cannot compromise my ethical standards. If you are unwilling to allow a basic physical exam, I am afraid I cannot sign these forms for you today. I am doing this for your benefit, Melvenia. Perhaps it's time to get you properly evaluated for a change.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Fine. Do whatever you have to do. Just get it over with quickly, please. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time. I’m perfectly fine. Just old.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148 over 82. Slightly elevated, but not critically high. Heart rate is 78, regular rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles noted. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Alright, Melvenia. Everything seems within normal limits for your age, but your blood pressure is something we should monitor. Now, I will need you to sign a release form to access your medical records from any previous providers, if you have them. This will allow me to have a more complete picture of your health history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I told you, no allergies. And no, I don’t have any previous medical records. I haven’t really had a doctor for… well, a long time. I just try to take care of myself, that's all. Now, can you please just sign the forms? I really need to get this done.
DOCTOR: Very well, Melvenia. I will sign the forms, but with the understanding that this assessment is limited due to the lack of prior medical history. I recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment for a more comprehensive evaluation, including blood work to assess your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Here you are. I've noted my recommendations on the back of the form. Please be sure to follow up with a primary care physician as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, that’s all. Thank you. And thank you for signing them. I appreciate it.
