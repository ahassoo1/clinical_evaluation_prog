DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, I suppose. They’ve been giving me trouble again. It feels like I need to… go… quite often, and it’s not very comfortable, you understand. I don’t recall exactly when it started this time, but it's been a bit now.
DOCTOR: I see. Frequent and uncomfortable urination. Can you elaborate on what “not comfortable” feels like, Ms. Wease?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, it burns, a little. Not a terrible burn, but… unpleasant. And sometimes… a bit of a ache down low. It’s just… bothersome. Honestly, I’ve had this happen before, years ago. I don’t remember all the details. It’s hard to keep track, you know? Is this… serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Wease. The burning sensation and lower abdominal ache are certainly things we need to investigate. It's good you mention this has occurred before. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, let's try to piece together a more complete picture. First, regarding the frequency – about how often would you say you're needing to urinate during the day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. More than usual, certainly. I… I suppose every couple of hours? Maybe three? It’s difficult to say exactly. I’m not one for keeping track of such things. It’s just… a lot. And then sometimes at night, too. Which is… inconvenient. I used to sleep right through, you know. It’s all very disruptive.
DOCTOR: I see. Frequent urination, both day and night. And it’s disrupting your sleep. Do you notice any pain while you're urinating, or is it more the burning sensation afterwards, as you described?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. It's mostly the burn during, I think. A little bit of ache afterwards, but the burning is what I notice the most. Not awful, mind you. But… noticeable. It doesn’t feel like a normal… emptying, if you understand. It feels… strained. Does that make sense? I don't know if I’m explaining this very well.
DOCTOR: You're explaining perfectly well, Ms. Wease. It sounds like you're experiencing dysuria – discomfort or pain when urinating – and a bit of strain. Let’s delve a little deeper into your history. Have you noticed any blood in your urine at all?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear, no. Not that I've seen. I always… check, you know. I haven’t noticed anything like that. No, thankfully not. I really do hope it’s not… anything serious. This whole thing is just… tiresome. I just want to feel normal again. Is this something I… caught, Doctor? From somewhere?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Wease. The absence of blood is good. As for whether it’s “caught” from somewhere, it could be a number of things. Most often, these symptoms indicate a urinary tract infection, or UTI. However, it could also be related to irritation, or other factors. To help me determine the cause, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a long time ago now. Let me think. I had a bit of trouble with my gallbladder, years ago. They took it out. And I used to have… high blood pressure, but that was well-controlled with… a little pill. I don’t take it anymore, the doctor said it wasn’t necessary. Other than that… not much, I don’t think. I’ve been fairly healthy, all things considered. I haven’t seen a doctor in… quite a while. I usually just… tough it out. Is that foolish?
DOCTOR: It’s not foolish at all, Ms. Wease, many people delay seeking medical attention. Knowing about your gallbladder removal and history of high blood pressure is helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can take most pills, no trouble at all. My daughter always said I was a sturdy one. But, honestly, Doctor, could this be… serious? I keep thinking of… my friend, Elsie. She had trouble with her kidneys, and it was… not good. I don’t want to end up like Elsie.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Wease, especially given your friend Elsie’s experience. It’s good you shared that with me. We will work through this systematically. While the possibility of kidney involvement needs to be considered, it's important to remember that your symptoms are often caused by something much less serious. To continue gathering information, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Just a little something for my… joints, sometimes. When they ache. It’s just… ibuprofen, I think? The regular kind. Nothing fancy. And, oh! Sometimes a little something for… sleep. When I can't get to rest. But I don't take it every night. Just when I'm really… bothered. I can't remember the name of it, though. My daughter usually handles all that now. Honestly, Doctor, this is all a bit much. Can’t you just give me something for the burning?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Wease, and I assure you we will get to a solution. It’s important to have a complete picture before prescribing anything, though. Knowing what you take, even occasionally, is important to avoid potential interactions. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never! I wouldn’t dream of it. My husband… he used to enjoy a little brandy now and then, but I never touched the stuff. I like a nice cup of chamomile tea, that’s about it. And I certainly don’t… use anything else. I’m a respectable woman, Doctor. This is all very… personal. Are you trying to find out if I’m a bad person? I just want to feel better. Can we please just get to that part?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions felt intrusive, Ms. Wease. I assure you I'm not trying to judge your lifestyle in any way. I am simply gathering information to help me understand your overall health and determine the best course of treatment. I completely understand your desire to feel better, and we will get there. Now, finally, can you tell me about any significant medical history in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. My mother… she had trouble with her stomach, years ago. And my father… he had a weak heart, I think. He passed away when I was quite young. And my brother… he had diabetes, but he wasn’t very good at taking care of himself. Honestly, Doctor, everyone in my family had something wrong with them. It's probably just my lot in life. Can we please just get this over with? I feel a little faint. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and I apologize for the length of the questions, Ms. Wease. Knowing about your family history is helpful. It does seem there is a predisposition to some health challenges, but that doesn't mean you are destined to experience them. I believe I have enough information for now. I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your reflexes, and a quick urine sample to analyze. This will help us rule out more serious issues and determine if an infection is present. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… a sample, you say? Well, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And please be gentle, Doctor. I’m not as sturdy as I used to be. And the examination… quickly, if you please. I have… errands to run. And I really do feel a bit weak. Just get it over with, and tell me what’s wrong. I just want to go home. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. We will be as quick and gentle as possible. Please sit on the examination table. I will leave you a clean container for the urine sample, and I’ll be right back with the rest of the equipment.
