DOCTOR: Hi Delron, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. I’m here for… the army thing. The exam. Gotta get it done, you know? Before they change their minds about letting someone like me in. It’s August 2nd, right? Didn't want to miss the date.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is August 2nd. And absolutely, getting everything sorted out is smart. So, this is for a military enlistment physical?
PATIENT: Physical? Well, yeah. That’s what they call it, I guess. Look, I’m a practical guy. I build things. Engines mostly. Good, strong engines. Not… paperwork and running around. Is this going to be a lot of that? Because I'm not good with waiting. And I've got a schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll try to keep it as streamlined as possible. There is some paperwork involved, unfortunately, but we'll get through it. The physical itself is pretty thorough, just to make sure everything is in good working order. It's standard for enlistment. To start, can you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: General health? What do you mean? I don’t get sick. Never have. Eat a decent breakfast, work hard all day. That’s about it. I don’t sit around feeling sorry for myself, if that's what you're asking. And I definitely don’t go to doctors unless I absolutely have to. Which is why I’m here, obviously. Don’t want them saying I’m not… robust enough.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear! It sounds like you're very active and take care of yourself. When you say you don't get sick, have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Absolutely not. Once had a bad cut on my hand when I was fixing a… well, never mind what I was fixing. Didn't need stitches, just wrapped it up tight. And a sprained ankle playing… doesn’t matter. Nothing a good wrap and a few days off couldn’t fix. Look, I’m a strong Swede. We don't do hospitals. It’s a weakness, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. So, no serious illnesses or hospital stays. And just a hand cut and a sprained ankle, both of which you managed yourself. Have you had any surgeries at all?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. Why would I let someone cut me open unless it was… absolutely necessary? Which it never is. I fix things, I don’t become the thing that needs fixing, if you follow. I mean, what kind of question is that? You’re starting to sound like my wife. Always worrying about things.
DOCTOR: Fair enough. No surgeries. Let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of serious medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer – in your parents, siblings, or grandparents?
PATIENT: Family history… Ugh. My mother… she worried a lot. About everything. Said her father had something with his… heart, I think. But he lived to be eighty, so it couldn’t have been that serious. And my father… strong as an ox, worked in the shipyard his whole life. Never a day sick. My sister… she’s a bit… delicate. Always catching colds. But that’s her husband’s fault, probably. Soft lifestyle. That’s all I really know. Are we getting anywhere with this? It feels like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so possible heart history on your maternal grandfather, but he lived to eighty. Your father healthy, your sister prone to colds. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Except maybe those fancy French things my wife tries to make. They taste like… chemicals. But allergic? No. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m a pretty simple guy. Meat, potatoes, coffee. That’s all I need. Don’t go putting anything fancy in me, though. I don't trust anything I can't pronounce.
DOCTOR: Good to know. No known allergies. And we won't be offering anything fancy! Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I don't need medications. I work hard, I eat right, I sleep enough. What would I need a pill for? Maybe a strong coffee in the morning, but that's not a medication. My wife takes something for her… nerves, I think. But that’s her problem. I’m a perfectly functioning machine. Don’t need any of that stuff. Are we done yet? This is taking a long time. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good starting point. So, no allergies, no medications, no surgeries, generally good health with a possible family history of heart issues on your maternal side. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don’t expect anything fancy. I’m built like a… well, you’ll see. Just don't poke around too much. I don't like being touched unnecessarily. What's first? Blood pressure? Whatever. Let's go. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your height and weight. Then we'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. After that, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Okay, you're 187 centimeters, which is about 6 foot 1 and a half inches. And you weigh… 53 kilograms, which is 117 pounds. That's a bit lower than expected for your height. Now, let’s get your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 110/70. That’s a good reading. Your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit.
PATIENT: 117 pounds? That can't be right. I eat plenty. Maybe the scale is broken. I’m a solid guy. Always have been. I work with engines all day, lifting heavy things. I’m probably closer to… well, never mind. Just write down what you want. It doesn’t matter. As long as it says I’m fit enough to serve. Are we getting somewhere with this, or are we just going around in circles? My back is starting to ache.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. The scale is calibrated regularly, but sometimes these things can vary slightly. We can double-check it in a moment. For now, let's just proceed. Okay, listening to your heart now… sounds regular, no murmurs. And your lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax. No tenderness or unusual sounds. Everything sounds good so far. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Never. I work hard, things get sore sometimes, but it’s not pain. It’s… muscle fatigue. A good night’s sleep fixes it. My back’s a little stiff, maybe. It’s always a little stiff. It’s from lifting things, you know? Engines are heavy. But no pain. Honestly, I feel fine. Perfectly fine. Is this all you’re going to do? Because I’m starting to think this is a waste of time. A perfectly healthy man shouldn’t have to spend this long getting poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. Alright, let’s just do a quick neurological exam – check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Just to be thorough. Okay, reflexes are normal. Balance is good. Coordination seems fine. Everything seems to be within normal limits. However, I am concerned about your weight. It is significantly lower than expected for your height, and that can be a cause for concern. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Unintentional weight loss? What are you talking about? I haven't lost weight! I eat like a horse. Always have. Maybe you're measuring me wrong. Or maybe the scale is still broken. Look, I’m a practical man. I build things with my hands. I don’t sit around worrying about numbers. I’m strong. That’s all that matters. Is this going to disqualify me? Because if it is, I’m wasting my time. I need to know straight away. No beating around the bush. I have things to do. And I’m not going to sit here and be told I’m underweight when I clearly am not. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I’m not trying to disqualify you. I’m simply trying to be thorough and rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing the weight loss, if there has been any. Significant weight loss can be a sign of various things, and it's important to investigate. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some routine blood work. It’s just a standard panel to check your overall health, including your blood count, electrolytes, and kidney and liver function. It will also help rule out any nutritional deficiencies. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking and prodding? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. I came here for a simple exam, not a full medical investigation. I haven't got time for all this. And frankly, I don't like needles. But… if it's the only way to prove I'm fit enough to serve, I guess I'll do it. But make it quick. And don't tell me it's going to hurt. I don't like being told what's going to hurt. Just get it over with. What do I have to do? And how long is this going to take? I've got things to do, remember? Things that require a fully functioning, un-poked and un-prodded man.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I'll make sure it's as quick and painless as possible. We'll just need a small sample of blood. It will take about ten minutes. I'll give you a requisition form, and you can go to the lab right down the hall. They're very efficient. Here's the form. Just take this to the lab, and they'll take care of it. Once the results are back, we can review them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just… get this over with. I want to know when I’ll have the results. And I want it to be quick. Don't make me come back here again. I’ve wasted enough time already. Right. Lab down the hall, you said? Fine. Let’s get it over with. And if I find out this is all a waste of time, I’m… well, I’ll be very unhappy. Just get me the results. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The lab usually takes 24-48 hours to process the results. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. And don’t worry, we'll get to the bottom of this. Thank you for your patience, Delron. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. .
