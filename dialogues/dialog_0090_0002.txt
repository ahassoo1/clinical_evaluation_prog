DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my waterworks. They aren't working so good. It’s hard to… push it out, you know? Like it’s stuck. It's been happening for a little while now, I think. Not sure how long, exactly. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Waterworks not working so good… difficulty with urination.” And you say this has been going on for a “little while”?
PATIENT: Yes, a little while. Not a long, long time, but not just yesterday either. My husband, he helps me remember things sometimes… but he’s not here today. It feels… weak, when I try. And I have to… strain. Is that the right word? Strain? It just doesn’t come easy.
DOCTOR: “Strain” is a perfectly good word, Ms. Stoffregen. And you’re experiencing weakness with your stream, as well. Do you feel like you’re completely emptying your bladder when you go, or does it feel like there’s always some left?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think some is left. It doesn't feel… completely empty. Like a little bit stays behind, even after I'm done. It's hard to tell for sure, though. I just know it takes a long time, and it’s not like it used to be. Used to be easy, you know? Just… go. Now it’s a whole thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain… more like… uncomfortable. A bit of a ache sometimes, afterwards. But not burning, no. Just… sore. And tired, my whole tummy feels tired after. Does that make sense? It’s a dull ache, not a sharp one. Like I’ve done too much lifting, maybe. But I haven't been lifting anything!
DOCTOR: Alright. “Uncomfortable, dull ache afterwards.” So, no burning sensation, just discomfort. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I don't really look at it, Doctor. My husband, he always does the looking. I just go. I haven't noticed anything different, I don't think. It looks… yellow. Like it always does. I really couldn’t say, sorry. Everything’s just a bit… blurry, you know? Not just my eyesight. My mind too.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. We’ll proceed as best we can. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any problems with your kidneys, or have you ever had a urinary tract infection?
PATIENT: Kidneys… oh dear. I don't remember anything about my kidneys. I've been to doctors a lot over the years, with all sorts of things… but I can't recall anything about my kidneys. And infections… maybe? I’ve had waterworks troubles before, a long time ago. But I’m not sure if it was an infection. My husband would know. He keeps all the papers. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. It's just… old age, I guess. Everything gets jumbled up.
DOCTOR: We can look through your records, Ms. Stoffregen. But let's start with something simpler. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I take a little pill for my waterworks, the doctor gave it to me. And another one for my heart. It’s a little white one, and a little blue one. I think that’s all. I used to take more, but the doctor took me off some of them. I try to remember, but sometimes I forget if I took it this morning or not. My husband helps me with that too. He puts them in a little box, all neat and tidy. He's a good man.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I used to get a little rash sometimes when I was a little girl, playing in the flowers. But I haven’t had that in years. Nothing serious, not like some people. I can eat anything, I think. My husband always makes me nice fish stew, and I eat everything in it. No troubles there. I don’t really have any… sensitivities, I don’t think. Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just a quick look and listen. It will help me get a better idea of what's going on. Can you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Oh dear. Well… alright, Doctor. If you think it's best. It's just… my bones are a bit creaky, you know? It might make some noises when I move. I’m not very flexible anymore. But I’ll try my best. Just be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: I will be as gentle as possible, Ms. Stoffregen. First, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright… a deep breath. Like this? Is that alright? It feels… funny, you know? All these tubes and things. It makes me nervous. But I’ll try. Is that good, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay… and another deep breath. Good. Hmm. Sounds normal so far. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Does this feel uncomfortable anywhere?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s a bit… ticklish! No, not painful, just… sensitive. There, on the left side. Feels a bit… full. Not like a hurt, just… heavy. And a little bit here too, on the right. It’s alright, Doctor, just a little bit sensitive. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like I've eaten too much.
DOCTOR: Okay. And no guarding or rebound tenderness. Good. Now, I'm just going to listen to your back. Just take normal breaths, Ms. Stoffregen.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. My back isn't very good, you know? Lots of aches and pains. But I’ll try my best. Just let me know if you need me to move. I'm not very nimble anymore. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Everything sounds clear. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you may have some urinary retention – meaning your bladder isn’t emptying completely. The fullness you feel and the strain you experience are consistent with that. It could be a number of things, from a weakened bladder muscle to a blockage. I want to order a post-void residual test – that’s a simple ultrasound to measure how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a test? Ultrasound? That sounds… fancy. What will it show? And will it hurt? I don’t like things poking and prodding. A weakened bladder muscle… that sounds old. Is that just from being old? I don’t mind a little bit of poking if it helps, but I don't want anything too scary. And will my husband need to come with me? He's better at understanding these things.
DOCTOR: It's not scary at all, Ms. Stoffregen. It's completely painless. The technician will just use a wand on your abdomen - it doesn’t go inside you. It’s just like getting a picture. It will show us how much urine is left in your bladder after you go to the bathroom. And yes, a weakened bladder muscle can be a normal part of aging, but we need to rule out other causes. We'll get a better idea once we have the results. It would be helpful if your husband came with you, if possible. He can certainly help with understanding the results. I'll write you a referral for the ultrasound. The technician will explain everything to both of you. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds a little better, not poking inside. Just a picture. Alright. And my husband can come? That's good, he's good with numbers and all those… machines. A referral, you say? Will that take long to get? I don't like waiting around too long. My bones get creaky if I sit for too long. And will it cost a lot of money? I'm on a fixed income, you know. Medicare, I have.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't take long to get the referral – I’ll have my nurse send it over to the imaging center right away. They will call you to schedule an appointment. And yes, Medicare should cover it, but it’s always best to double-check with them. I’ll make a note on the referral to confirm coverage. The imaging center will be able to tell you the exact cost, but it should be a standard covered procedure. Now, while we're waiting for the ultrasound results, I want you to try to drink 6 to 8 glasses of water a day, unless I tell you otherwise. And when you feel the urge to go, don’t hold it. Just go. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Water… yes, I can do water. Six or eight glasses… that's a lot. But I can try. And don't hold it… yes, I usually don't. It's just… sometimes I forget. Everything gets jumbled up, you know? But I’ll try my best. Don't hold it, drink lots of water… and my husband can come with me for the picture. That sounds… alright. Is there anything else I need to do? Or any signs to look out for? I don’t want to worry my husband for no reason.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. If you develop a fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain, or if you're unable to urinate at all, call my office immediately. Those would be signs of a potential infection. Otherwise, just follow the instructions – drink plenty of water, don’t hold it, and schedule the ultrasound with your husband. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they are available. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Fever, chills, pain… and drink water. My husband will help me remember. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you taking the time. It’s nice to know someone is listening.
