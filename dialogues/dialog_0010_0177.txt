DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Jimmi. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh… good afternoon to you too, doctor. Well, it's… down there. Something’s… leaking. Not good leaking, you know? Been happening a little while now. I don't remember exactly when it started, but it's definitely been a few weeks. It’s… messy.
DOCTOR: Okay, “messy” gives me a starting point. A few weeks, you said. Can you tell me a little more about this leaking?
PATIENT: More? What do you want to know? It's… stuff coming out. Yellowish, sometimes. And it smells… bad. Like old fish, maybe? I keep having to change my… underthings. It’s embarrassing, you know? A woman my age… shouldn’t have these problems.
DOCTOR: I understand it's embarrassing, Jimmi, and you’re right to get it checked out. It’s good you came in. When you say “down there,” are you referring to your vagina?
PATIENT: Vagina? Oh, no, no, not there. Down there. You know… the other part. Between the legs. The… boy part. I… well, I got a little bit of everything, you see? A long story. Not something you usually talk about with a doctor, but… there it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for clarifying. So, this is coming from your urethra – the opening where you urinate?
PATIENT: Ure…what-a? You using big words again, doctor. Just… the hole where the pee comes out. That's what I mean. It's coming from there. And it’s not just pee, you understand. It's… thicker. And smells. Really smells bad. I tried washing it, but it doesn’t help much.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for explaining. It sounds like you're experiencing some discharge from your urethra, and it's concerning you due to the color, odor, and the fact that washing isn’t resolving it. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate, or any itching or discomfort in the area?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain. More like… a little sting, sometimes. When I go. And it feels… rough. Not smooth like it used to be. And itchy. Yes, itchy. Especially at night. Makes it hard to sleep. It’s just… not right. Everything’s just… old and not working good anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little sting with urination, roughness, and itching, particularly at night. That gives me a better picture. Have you noticed a fever, or any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: Fever? Hmm… I don't think so. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but I always feel a little warm. I get hot flashes, you know? Old lady problems. And my back… always hurts. Arthritis, probably. I don’t know. I just figured it was my back acting up. Everything hurts at my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. And to confirm, have you had any changes in your urine stream – like difficulty starting or stopping, or a weaker stream than usual?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, it takes a little longer to get going sometimes, that’s true. And it’s not as… strong as it used to be. I have to push a little. And it doesn't go all the way out at once, you know? Little dribbles. I figured… well, I figured that’s just what happens when you get old. Everything leaks eventually.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Jimmi. It’s helpful to have all this information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll need to check your abdomen and then do a quick look at the area to see what we’re dealing with. We’ll also take a urine sample to send to the lab for testing. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh dear. I don't like doctors poking and prodding. But… if you have to. I suppose I should find out what's going on. A urine sample… that's not so bad. Just… be gentle, okay? I’m a delicate flower, you know, even if I don’t look it. And no surprises. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and I’ll explain everything before I do it. No surprises, I promise. First, let’s get you a clean container for the urine sample. The nurse will show you how to collect it properly. Then we'll come back and do the exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. A clean container… sounds easy enough. And you'll explain everything? Good. I don't want any sudden moves. And… make sure the room is warm. I get cold easily, you know. Old bones. Just… don’t rush me, okay? I need a little time.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jimmi. We’ll take all the time you need. I'll have the nurse bring in a warm blanket as well. Let’s start with the urine sample, and then we’ll get you settled and comfortable for the exam. I’ll let the nurse know you prefer a warm room. Do you need any assistance getting to the restroom?
PATIENT: No, no. I can get to the restroom myself. Slow and steady, that’s my motto. Just… don't forget the blanket. And tell the nurse to be gentle with the door. It squeaks something awful. Makes my ears hurt. And… where is this restroom, exactly? Don't want to get lost.
DOCTOR: It’s just down the hall on the left, Jimmi. The nurse, Maria, is right outside, and she’ll show you the way and make sure everything is comfortable. She’s aware you'd like a warm blanket and that the door squeaks. Take your time, and let us know when you’re finished with the sample. I’ll be right here when you get back.
PATIENT: Alright. Maria… squeaky door… warm blanket. I hope she understands. Old people have needs, you know? Not as simple as young folks. Tell her to be careful with the container, too. Don’t want to spill anything. Okay. I’m going. Don’t start without me.
DOCTOR: I won’t, Jimmi. Take your time, and we’ll get everything sorted out. I'll be right here.
