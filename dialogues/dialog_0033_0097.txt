DOCTOR: Right. Marija Chilla, age 44. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor… Dechêne, is it? Yes, well, my husband and I have been discussing… planning, you might say. For the future. He feels it’s… prudent to have some forms filled out. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… something happen. He mentioned an Advance Directive, or a POLST form. I confess, I don’t entirely understand what either of those are, but he insisted I speak with a professional.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, your husband is… cautious, I suppose. It’s not an uncommon request. An Advance Directive and a POLST form… they’re both related to end-of-life planning, essentially. The Advance Directive is a broader document outlining your general healthcare wishes, while the POLST—Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment—is a more specific medical order. Before we delve into paperwork, though, is there anything currently troubling you?
PATIENT: Currently? No, nothing of that sort. Perfectly healthy, as far as I am aware. A bit tall, perhaps, but that is a family trait. My husband simply wishes to be… prepared. He worries excessively, you see. It’s rather inconvenient, if I’m being frank. But I suppose it’s best to indulge him, if it means peace of mind. So, if you could explain these forms… in plain language, please. I don’t need a lecture on medical ethics.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “perfectly healthy” is good to hear, though a complete assessment is always advisable, regardless. As for your husband’s… diligence, let's focus on the Advance Directive first. It allows you to document what types of medical care you would or would not want if you were unable to communicate those wishes yourself. Think about things like ventilation, feeding tubes, resuscitation... things of that nature. The POLST form, on the other hand, is a set of orders a doctor can follow. It's more immediate and focuses on current, life-sustaining treatments. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I take vitamins, if that counts. And I try to eat a balanced diet, though my husband does fuss about my fondness for pastries. As for these… scenarios you describe, I find them rather morbid, to be honest. But if I had to choose… I suppose I would not want to be kept alive artificially. Prolonging suffering seems… undignified. Though I shudder to think of being in such a state. But resuscitation… isn’t that standard procedure? I mean, one always tries to save a life, doesn't one? I don't understand why I'd need to specify that.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “standard procedure” is… a bit of an oversimplification. Resuscitation, or CPR, can be… traumatic. It’s not always successful, and it can cause fractures, internal injuries… it’s not a gentle process. The POLST form allows you to state whether or not you want those interventions attempted. Some people prefer a natural death, even if it means a shorter lifespan. Before we proceed with paperwork, I really should perform a basic examination. Just to get a baseline. It's… prudent. Do you mind if I check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I find this rather excessive. I came to fill out some forms, not undergo a physical examination. I assure you, I am perfectly capable of determining my own well-being. My husband’s anxieties are already causing enough disruption. But… very well. If it will expedite the process, I suppose I can tolerate a brief check. But please be quick about it. And do try not to poke and prod unnecessarily. I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Very well. It will be a quick assessment, I assure you. Please have a seat on the examination table. First, I'll check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. 140 over 90. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Heart rate is 78, regular rhythm. No murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again. Good. Breathing appears normal. Height and weight are noted as 199cm and 137kg respectively. BMI is 38.5, indicating obesity. It’s important to be aware of the potential health risks associated with that.
PATIENT: Obesity? Really, Doctor? Is that truly necessary to point out? I am a tall woman. Always have been. My weight is perfectly proportionate to my height. And my health is quite excellent, thank you very much. I do not require a lecture on the perils of… proportion. Now, if we could please move on to these forms… I haven’t got all day. And frankly, this entire process is becoming rather tiresome.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “proportionate” or not, it’s a relevant factor in overall health risk. But we can certainly move on to the forms. However, given your… concerns, I strongly recommend a basic blood panel to assess cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. It’s… prudent to have a baseline, especially before making any significant healthcare decisions. Here. This is the Advance Directive. It’s fairly straightforward. Read through it carefully, and let me know if you have any questions. It covers a range of scenarios. We can discuss each section as you go. First, it asks you to designate a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so. Do you have someone in mind?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy? Naturally. My husband, of course. He’s… quite capable. And exceedingly meticulous. He’s already given it considerable thought, I assure you. He probably has a draft prepared, somewhere. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure why I even bothered coming here. He handles all these… practical matters. But… very well. Let me see this… document. Though I doubt I’ll be making any alterations. He’s already decided what’s best.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, while your husband’s… involvement is admirable, it’s important that you understand the implications of each section. This form is legally binding, and it reflects your wishes, not his. For example, this section concerns artificial nutrition and hydration. It asks whether you would want a feeding tube inserted if you were unable to eat or drink. Do you understand what that entails?
PATIENT: A feeding tube? Goodness, Doctor, how morbid are we getting? I suppose if I were… utterly incapacitated, it would be preferable to being starved, wouldn’t it? Though the thought is rather unpleasant. My husband is quite insistent on… preserving life, at all costs. He believes every moment is precious. So, yes, I suppose I would want a feeding tube. If it would prolong my life, even by a short while. Though I shudder to think of the indignity. But… he would be devastated if I refused. And frankly, I’m rather tired of arguing. Just… put it down. A feeding tube. Next question.
DOCTOR: Very well. Feeding tube. This section concerns resuscitation – CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It asks whether you would want attempts made to revive you if your heart stopped beating or you stopped breathing. Do you understand the risks and benefits of CPR?
PATIENT: Risks and benefits? Honestly, Doctor. If my heart stops, I suppose it’s… rather academic, isn’t it? Of course, one always tries to save a life. It’s… barbaric not to. My husband would be… inconsolable if I refused. He has a rather… strong moral compass. He believes every possible measure should be taken. So, yes. Resuscitation. Attempt it. Please. Just… get it over with. I have a luncheon with Mrs. Dubois. And I’m simply not enjoying this conversation.
DOCTOR: Very well. Resuscitation. Here. This form is signed and dated. As you’ve stated your wishes, it is legally binding. I strongly advise you to discuss this document with your primary care physician as well. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That will be all. Though I must say, this entire experience has been… rather unpleasant. I came for a simple formality, and it has turned into a… philosophical debate. Honestly, I find it rather… undignified. Thank you for your time. Though I doubt I’ll be returning. And please, do try to be more… cheerful with your next patient. It’s rather unsettling. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a… pleasant day. .
