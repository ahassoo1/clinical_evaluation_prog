DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Uh… well, my wife, bless her heart, she said I needed to get some… paperwork. Something about time off? I’m a bit fuzzy on the details, honestly. It’s about work, I think. Something to do with being able to… take a bit of time? She handles most of that stuff.
DOCTOR: Right, paperwork… time off. That's perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. We can certainly sort that out. But before we get to that, is there anything else bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm… bothering me? Not… particularly. I feel alright, I guess. A little tired, maybe? Old age, you know. But nothing I can put my finger on. Really, it’s just this… form thing my wife mentioned. She said it was important, and I didn’t want to forget. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Mr. Limtiaco. Memory can be a bit tricky as we get older. It’s good you came in. Even if it’s just for paperwork, I like to get a general sense of how my patients are doing. Just to be thorough. Perhaps we can start with a quick review of your overall health. Have you been seeing any other doctors recently?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… let me think. I think I saw Dr. Moreau last year, maybe? For a check-up, I believe. Just a routine thing. And… the dentist, of course. Six months ago, I think. Other than that… no, not really. I try to stay out of doctor’s offices when I can. They never have anything good to tell you, ha!
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Limtiaco. It's good to hear you're generally healthy enough to avoid frequent visits. Do you recall what Dr. Moreau checked for during your appointment last year?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Just… the usual, I suppose. Blood pressure, cholesterol… weight, maybe? He poked around a bit with the stethoscope, listened to my heart and lungs. Nothing specific stood out, I don’t think. He said I was… “stable.” Is that the word? Yes, stable. I remember that. He didn't mention anything about any special tests or anything. Honestly, I tune most of that medical jargon out, if I’m being truthful. It just makes my head spin.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. “Stable” is good news! It sounds like you had a routine check-up and everything was normal. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… oh dear. That’s a bit of a challenge. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. Things get… muddled. I had chickenpox as a boy, of course. And I broke my arm once, when I was climbing a mango tree. A rather spectacular fall, actually. But serious illnesses? Not really. I’ve always been a fairly robust fellow. There was… something, years ago. A fever, maybe? When I was stationed in… oh, what was the place? Anyway, it wasn't serious. Just a little under the weather for a week or so. My wife would know the details, she has a much better memory for these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. It's good you've been generally healthy. And we can always follow up with your wife if needed. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I think I had my tonsils out when I was a child. A long time ago, when they used to do those things all the time. But that's about it, as far as I can recall. Nothing else. No major operations, thankfully. I've always avoided the hospital when possible. A bit of a… aversion, you might say. Not my favorite place, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Limtiaco. Hospitals aren’t for everyone. Now, just one more question about your past. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. That’s another good question. I don't think so. I’ve always been able to eat pretty much anything without any problems. And I haven't had any bad reactions to any medications that I recall. Nothing that springs to mind, anyway. My wife always reminds me to tell the doctor if I’m trying something new, just in case. She’s very cautious that way, which I appreciate. I don’t think I've got any major allergies, but I can’t say for certain. It's a bit hazy, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just this. Doctor Moreau prescribed them, last year, I think. Something for my… joints. They get a bit stiff in the mornings, you see. Old age, again. And… I take these every day. Just to keep things ticking along. My wife insists. That's all. Nothing else, really. Just the pills and the vitamins.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let me just make a note of these. So, you’re taking [medication name] for your joints, and a daily multi-vitamin. And how much of each do you take, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh dear, the dosages… that’s a bit of a challenge. I think it’s one of these joint pills every morning with breakfast. And… Just one of these vitamins every day. Maybe two? My wife usually handles dispensing them, so I don’t pay much attention. She puts them in a little container for me each week, you see. I just take what she gives me. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more precise. My mind isn't what it used to be, you understand.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. We can verify the exact dosages with your wife or the pharmacy if needed. Now, just a few more general questions. Do you have any family history of medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father, he had… something with his heart, I think. Years ago. He passed away when I was still quite young. And my mother, she had… arthritis, maybe? Her joints were always stiff, like mine. But other than that, I don’t really know. My family wasn’t one for talking about these things, you see. Not a very medical family, overall. My wife might know more, she’s better at remembering these details. She kept all the family records, you see. I'm afraid my memory is a bit… spotty.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Well, that’s a broad question, Doctor! I’ve lived a long life, seen a lot of things. I was in the military for many years, stationed all over the world. Then I retired and… well, settled down with my wife, raised a family. We have… two children, I believe. And… several grandchildren now. I don’t drink much alcohol, and I never smoked. I enjoy gardening, and spending time with my family. Mostly, I just like to keep busy, you see. I try to stay active, keep my mind sharp. That’s about it, really. A fairly quiet life these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, before we get to the paperwork your wife mentioned, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, certainly. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. I’m a bit of an old man, you see. Things creak and groan a bit these days. Go ahead, when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Your pulse is 72, regular and strong. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds. Now, let's take a look at your throat… Throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. And I'll just feel your lymph nodes… No swelling or tenderness. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort anywhere?
PATIENT: No, no pain or discomfort. Just the usual aches and creaks. Old age, you know. Nothing to worry about. My wife always says I’m just getting old and grumpy. Everything seems… alright. No complaints. I appreciate you checking me over so thoroughly, Doctor. It’s reassuring to know everything is still… ticking along. Now, about that paperwork? Is it about being able to… take some time off work? My wife was very insistent I get it sorted.
DOCTOR: Alright, well, everything appears to be within normal limits, Mr. Limtiaco. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which is common with age, but we can monitor that. You seem to be in generally good health for your age. And yes, let's talk about the paperwork. Your wife is likely referring to a form for Family and Medical Leave . It allows eligible employees to take unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons. It sounds like she's concerned about you having the documentation you need to take time off if necessary. Is there a specific reason you anticipate needing leave?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… That’s a good question. I don't specifically anticipate needing leave, not that I know of. My wife mentioned something about… feeling more comfortable having the paperwork on hand, just in case. She’s very organized, you see. She said… something about my joints acting up more frequently, and the possibility of needing to… rest. And maybe see a specialist if they get worse. But I haven’t talked to anyone about it yet, not really. She just said it was best to be prepared. She worries about me, bless her heart. She’s a very practical woman.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly reasonable, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like this is more of a preventative measure. In that case, I can certainly fill out the necessary FMLA paperwork indicating that you may have a medical condition that could potentially require leave in the future. However, it's important to understand that this doesn't automatically guarantee leave, and any specific leave requests would still need to be approved by your employer. Would you like me to proceed with completing the form?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful. Whatever makes my wife happy. She’ll be so relieved. And if it means I don’t have to worry about it, all the better. Just let me know if you need any more information. I'll try to remember what she told me, but don’t hold me to it. You’re a good doctor, you know. Very patient with an old man like me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. It's my pleasure. I’ll just need a few minutes to complete the form. Before I finish, do you have any other concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just the paperwork, and a little reassurance that I’m not falling apart completely. You've done a wonderful job, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and patience. I appreciate it more than you know. Perhaps I should schedule a follow-up appointment for a routine check-up? Just to keep things ticking along, as you said.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Limtiaco. Here’s the completed FMLA form. I’ve also made a note to schedule a routine follow-up appointment for you in six months, just to monitor your blood pressure and overall health. You can schedule that with the receptionist on your way out. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. And it was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and give your wife my best! Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. You've been a great help. I’ll be sure to tell my wife you said hello. She’ll be very pleased. Take care yourself, Doctor.
