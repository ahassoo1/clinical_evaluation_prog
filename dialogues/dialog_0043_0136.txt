DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fogelstrom. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 38 years of age. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… it’s my… belching. It’s been happening a lot.
DOCTOR: Belching, alright. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Fogelstrom?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… two, three weeks? I don’t really keep track of days, sorry. Just… a while now. It’s… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. “A while now” gives me a good starting point. And I understand it can be embarrassing; that’s why you came to see me, and you’ve done the right thing. Can you describe what the belching is like?
PATIENT: Well… it just… happens. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes not. It doesn’t hurt, really. Just… air. A lot of air. Like… bubbles coming up. It’s loud, sometimes. And it smells… normal, I think?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s not associated with pain, and the smell seems normal. Does anything seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger? Like… make it happen? Um… sometimes if I drink something fizzy, like soda. But not always. And… sometimes when I’m stressed, maybe? I don't know. It’s hard to say. I don’t always notice why it happens.
DOCTOR: Alright, so fizzy drinks seem to be a potential trigger, and possibly stress. Do you find it happens more frequently at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… maybe after dinner? When I sit and relax, then it starts. But not every night. I eat different things, so maybe that’s why? I’m not sure. It’s very random, I think.
DOCTOR: Random, alright. And what about what you eat?
PATIENT: Oh… everything? I eat a little bit of everything. Cuban food, mostly. Rice and beans, chicken, pork… sometimes a little bit of beef. Nothing too spicy, usually. I don’t think it’s the food, because I’ve eaten the same things for years.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you experience any other symptoms along with the belching?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like… what do you mean? Do you mean… like feeling sick? No, not really. Sometimes my stomach feels a little full, maybe, after I eat. But that’s normal, right? It’s just from the food. I don’t have… pain, or… anything bad.
DOCTOR: No pain, good. And feeling full after eating is normal. Just making sure we cover everything. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I’ve never really been sick. Just… colds sometimes. I don't go to the doctor much. That’s why I waited so long with this belching. I thought it would go away.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never needed surgery. Everything always worked okay… until this.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um… my grandma had… high blood pressure, I think. And my uncle… he had something with his heart, maybe? I don’t really know, to be honest. My family doesn’t talk about those things much.
DOCTOR: That's alright. It’s helpful to know what you do. Now, regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No smoking. Maybe a little bit of wine sometimes, with dinner. But not much. And definitely no drugs. I don't like those things.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I don’t need them. Just… water. And maybe some tea sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Fogelstrom. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It sounds like you've been experiencing excessive belching for a few weeks, not associated with pain, potentially triggered by fizzy drinks and stress, with no significant medical history or medication use. Given your description, it’s most likely that you’re experiencing what we call aerophagia – essentially, swallowing too much air. This can happen for a variety of reasons. We can explore some lifestyle modifications to see if we can manage this. Before we do that, though, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to rule out anything else. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Lifestyle modifications… I can try that. And yes, a physical exam is okay. I want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you don't mind, please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This will help me listen for any unusual sounds. It might be a little cold, so I’ll make sure to warm the stethoscope first. Alright, your abdomen sounds normal – no unusual sounds detected. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender to the touch. I'm also going to check your pulse and blood pressure. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, which is normal, and your blood pressure is 120/80, also within the normal range. Everything seems physically normal at this point. It further supports the likelihood that this is related to aerophagia.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s good to hear. So it’s not… serious? Just air?
DOCTOR: Exactly. It doesn’t appear to be anything serious at this time. It’s likely just air. However, excessive belching can be disruptive and uncomfortable, and we want to address it. I recommend trying a few things. First, eat slowly and chew your food thoroughly. This will reduce the amount of air you swallow. Second, avoid carbonated beverages as much as possible. Third, try to identify and manage any sources of stress in your life. And finally, avoid chewing gum and hard candies. These can also cause you to swallow more air. Let's see if these modifications help over the next couple of weeks. If your symptoms don’t improve, or if they worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can consider further testing, such as a check for Helicobacter pylori infection, or a referral to a gastroenterologist. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Slow eating, no soda… I can try that. Stress is hard, but I will try to relax more. No more gum, either. Okay. So… I just wait two weeks and see?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Two weeks, and see if the symptoms improve with those lifestyle changes. If they don't, or if you develop any other symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits, don't hesitate to call the office and schedule an appointment sooner. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. Fogelstrom?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You were very helpful. I feel a little better knowing it’s probably not something serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fogelstrom. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. We're here if you need anything in the future. Here's a handout with the lifestyle modifications we discussed, and a list of symptoms to watch out for. Have a good day, Ms. Fogelstrom.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too!
