DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I'm Dr. Yackey. Let’s try to be concise, shall we?
PATIENT: Concise is excellent. Yes, well. My skin... it’s darkened. And I tire easily. It's been... a while now, I suppose. Not debilitating, but… bothersome. Frankly, I haven't much time for bothersome things these days.
DOCTOR: Right. Darkened skin and fatigue. And you said “a while now”?
PATIENT: A while. Months, certainly. Perhaps… longer. Honestly, the specifics escape me. Time blends, you understand. My wife, bless her, notices these things more than I do. She's the practical one. I just… feel it. Less energy, and this… discoloration. It’s not… appealing.
DOCTOR: I see. And has this discoloration… spread?
PATIENT: Spread? Hmm. That’s… a good question. I haven’t been meticulously tracking it, Doctor. It seems… more pronounced on my hands, perhaps. And my face. Though, honestly, it could just be the lighting. I spend a good deal of time outdoors with my work, reinforcing iron. Sun exposure, you understand. It’s a rugged profession. Not that I’m complaining, mind you. A man needs to do something.
DOCTOR: Right. Outdoors work. Do you happen to know if this started after you began this… ironwork?
PATIENT: After? Possibly. It’s difficult to say with certainty. I’ve been doing that sort of work for… well, a long time. Decades. It all rather runs together. My memory isn't what it once was, you see. I suppose it could be related. One can never be entirely sure. Is it truly essential to pinpoint the exact starting date, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful, Mr. Drahota. To establish a timeline. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. I eat… adequately. Sleep… well, as well as an old man can sleep. Perhaps a bit more thirsty than usual? But that could just be the weather. It’s been rather warm, hasn’t it? Frankly, I’m a perfectly functional man, Doctor. I don’t go around listing every minor discomfort. It feels… undignified.
DOCTOR: You mentioned thirst. Has that increased significantly?
PATIENT: Significantly… now you’re asking a lot of a man with a fading memory. Perhaps. I do find myself reaching for water more often, yes. It’s not… debilitating. I just… drink more. My wife keeps a pitcher full, thankfully. She anticipates these things. Always has. Is there a specific reason you are focusing on my fluid intake, Doctor? It feels… rather specific.
DOCTOR: Just trying to gather information, Mr. Drahota. Now, do you have any family history of… say, diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Kidney problems? Goodness. I… honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea. My family… we weren’t ones for discussing ailments, you understand. Practical people. Focused on doing, not dwelling. My father was a strong man, worked with his hands his whole life. My mother… she kept the home. No one talked about… internal workings. I’m afraid I can’t be of much assistance on that front. Truly. Is this… essential, Doctor? I have appointments later.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a quick physical examination, then. It won't take long. Can you roll up your sleeves, please?
PATIENT: Roll up my sleeves… yes, certainly. There. Though, I must say, I’m rather particular about my shirts. Fine cotton. It’s a shame to be wrinkling them like this. Do get on with it, if you please. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Your pulse is regular, though somewhat weak. And… yes, I do observe some hyperpigmentation on your forearms, consistent with sun exposure. No edema. Capillary refill is a bit slow, approximately three seconds. Is there any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not particularly. A slight… pressure, perhaps. But nothing I would categorize as painful. Frankly, I’ve endured far worse during my profession. Ironworking is not a gentle trade, you understand. It’s… robust. Are we nearing the conclusion, Doctor? I have a meeting with the foreman shortly. A rather important matter regarding the structural integrity of the new bridge.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your age, fatigue, increased thirst, and observed hyperpigmentation, it's difficult to say definitively without further testing. We need to rule out dehydration, and assess your kidney function. I’m ordering a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count. Can you provide a urine sample, please?
PATIENT: Urine sample… yes, alright. A minor inconvenience, I suppose. Where exactly am I to… deposit this sample, Doctor? And is there a specific container I should be utilizing? I'd rather not make a mess. Honestly, the bureaucracy of modern medicine is… rather excessive.
DOCTOR: Down the hall, third door on the left. There's a sterile container in there. And please, try to collect a mid-stream sample. I’ll have the results sent to you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake and avoiding strenuous activity. .
PATIENT: Avoiding strenuous activity… A rather impractical suggestion, considering my profession. Very well. I shall endeavor to comply, though it will undoubtedly cause some… complications. Thank you, Doctor. Mid-stream… the indignities continue. .
