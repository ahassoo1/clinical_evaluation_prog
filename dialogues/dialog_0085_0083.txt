DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Lahn, you say? Yes, well. It's about a… a little thing. Not a serious thing, you understand. I just… I thought it would be nice to have a card. A “Get Well” card. Or, you know, a card with some encouragement. My… my ex-wife, she always sent cards. Even when we weren’t… well. It just feels good, that’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. It's perfectly alright to want a little encouragement, and it’s good you’re taking care of your emotional wellbeing. It sounds like those cards were important to you. While I’m a doctor and typically focus on physical health, I certainly appreciate the importance of emotional support. Before we go further, though, just to be thorough, is there anything medically concerning you today?
PATIENT: Medically? No, no. Nothing like that. I feel… fine. Perfectly fine. A little lonely, maybe. But that’s… that’s just life, isn't it? I don't need you to look at anything. Just… a card. Is that so strange, Doctor? A doctor giving a man a card?
DOCTOR: Not strange at all, Mr. Kammer. It’s certainly not a typical request, but I want to make sure you’re comfortable and that I understand what’s going on. It sounds like you're feeling a bit down and are seeking a small gesture of kindness. To make sure I’m approaching this in the best way, could you tell me a little more about why you came to the doctor specifically for a card?
PATIENT: Well… my daughter, she said it was a good idea. She said, “Dad, you need to talk to a professional.” A professional! Like I'm… I don’t know. She thinks I’m… sad. And she said a doctor could… write something nice. To… to cheer me up, I guess. She said Medicare might cover it. She's a very… practical girl, my daughter. Always thinking about things like insurance.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of your daughter, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like she’s concerned about your wellbeing and wants to help in any way she can. And you're right, it’s good she’s thinking about practical things like insurance. So, it sounds like this is largely about feeling lonely and wanting some emotional support, and your daughter suggested coming here. Just to be sure, have you been experiencing any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… a fever? No. Nothing like that. I eat regular. Sleep regular. I watch my TV. I… I go to the grocery store. You know, regular things. I just… I miss having someone to… to share things with. My ex-wife, she always knew what to say. Even when she was… upset with me. Now it’s just… quiet. Too quiet.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of loss and loneliness, which can be very difficult. It’s completely normal to feel that way after a significant change in your life. It’s good that you’re able to identify those feelings. While I can certainly acknowledge the importance of emotional support and the value of a kind gesture, it's also important to rule out any underlying factors that might be contributing to how you're feeling. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, sleep patterns, or energy levels beyond what you’ve already mentioned?
PATIENT: Well… maybe I don't sleep quite as well. I wake up a couple of times during the night. Just… thinking. And I don't get out as much. Used to go to the… the VFW hall with the boys. Now… now it's easier to just stay home. It's less trouble. And my appetite… it's alright. I eat. But I don't… crave anything, you know? Like I used to. A good steak. Or my ex-wife's arroz con gandules. Now… it's just food.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you've experienced some changes in your sleep, social activity, and appetite, which could be indicative of something more than just loneliness. These changes, along with your feelings of sadness, could potentially be related to mild depression. It’s very common, especially after experiencing loss or significant life changes. It's not a sign of weakness, and it's very treatable. Before we discuss potential options, would you mind if I ask a few more questions, just to get a better understanding of your overall mood and feelings?
PATIENT: Depression? Now, hold on a minute. I'm not depressed. I'm just… a little sad. Everyone gets a little sad sometimes. It's life, isn't it? I don't need… pills or anything like that. I just want a card. That’s all. My daughter is going to make me sound like a crazy man.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Kammer, and I want to assure you that I'm not jumping to conclusions. I’m simply exploring all possibilities to ensure you receive the best care. And I absolutely respect your wishes—I am not suggesting medication at this point. My goal is to understand what’s going on and help you feel better, and if that means simply acknowledging your feelings and offering some support, then that’s what I’m happy to do. However, it's important to rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms, even if they seem minor. Sometimes, even mild depression can benefit from simple interventions. Perhaps we can talk about some strategies for coping with loneliness and improving your mood, and then, if you're comfortable, I can write a card with a few encouraging words. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Strategies? What kind of strategies? I don't need… group therapy or anything like that. I’m a private man, Doctor. Always have been. And… well, I suppose talking about it… it’s… alright. A little. But I don't want to waste your time. You have other patients, I’m sure. Important patients. If you could just… write the card… that would be nice. A simple card. With a nice picture. Maybe a sunset. And… something about… hope. Yes. Hope. That would be good.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. I understand. We can absolutely focus on writing a card with an encouraging message and a picture of a sunset—that sounds lovely. And I assure you, your wellbeing is important to me, and I'm not rushing you. We can take as much time as you need. Before I write the card, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. Never have. My father… he was always sick. Always taking something. I swore I wouldn't end up like that. Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything. Except maybe oysters. Never liked oysters. Alright, Doctor. Let's get to the card, shall we? A nice sunset. And something about hope. That’s what my daughter would want.
DOCTOR: Excellent. A sunset it is, and we'll definitely include something about hope. While I type, would you mind if I quickly check your weight and blood pressure, just as a routine part of the visit?
PATIENT: Blood pressure? Weight? Now you're making me nervous. I told you, I'm not sick. I just want a card. But… alright. Go ahead. Quick, now. Don't want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your weight is 165 pounds. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which is not uncommon, especially if you’re feeling anxious. But it’s good to be aware of it. We can discuss some lifestyle changes to help manage it if you’d like. But for now, let's focus on the card. How does this sound?
PATIENT: “Dear Mr. Kammer, it takes courage to reach out and ask for support. I admire your strength. May the beauty of a new sunset bring you hope and peace. Wishing you brighter days ahead. Sincerely, Dr. Lahn.” It’s… alright. A little formal, maybe. And “strength”? I don’t feel very strong. It’s a little… cheesy. Can you make it a little less… fancy? And maybe something about… remembering the good times? My ex-wife… she always said to remember the good times.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. How about this?
PATIENT: “Dear Mr. Kammer, it takes courage to reach out, and I’m glad you did. I hope you find comfort in knowing you’re not alone. Remember the good times, and let them bring you strength and peace. Wishing you brighter days ahead. Sincerely, Dr. Lahn.” That’s… better. Much better. Yes. That’s a good card. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kammer. I’m glad we were able to find something that works for you. I also want to mention, just as a precaution, that if you continue to feel down or experience any changes in your mood, please don’t hesitate to reach out. And if your blood pressure remains elevated, we can discuss some simple lifestyle changes or consider further evaluation. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, no questions. I think… I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. For the card. And for… listening. I should be going now. My daughter is probably wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kammer. It was my pleasure. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a wonderful day, and please give your daughter my best. .
