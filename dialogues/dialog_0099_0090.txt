DOCTOR: Right. Mackenzi Brightful, 29 years old. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor Overgaard. Well, it’s… about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I need to make sure I’m healthy enough for it, I believe. It’s a bit difficult to recall all the specifics, truthfully. It's been a trying time.
DOCTOR: A surgery, you say. Alright. It's understandable things are hazy when you're stressed. No need to worry about recalling everything at once. Let’s start with the basics. What kind of surgery are you planning to have?
PATIENT: Oh, um… It’s… cosmetic, I believe? Something to do with… well, with improving my appearance. My husband… he always said I was beautiful, of course, but… after everything, I just want to feel a little bit more like myself again. I’m afraid I don’t recall the exact name of the procedure. It was discussed with another doctor, some time ago. Perhaps you have it on file?
DOCTOR: Let’s see… accessing records now. Brightful, Mackenzi… cosmetic consultation… Ah, yes. It appears you had a preliminary consultation with Dr. Ramirez on March 12th of this year regarding a panniculectomy. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Panniculectomy… Yes! That’s it! That sounds right. Dr. Ramirez was very kind. I remember discussing it with him, but… everything is a bit of a blur, as you can see. It's been difficult since… since my husband passed. So, yes, that’s the surgery. A panniculectomy. I just want to be sure I’m a good candidate, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. A panniculectomy. And understandably, you want to ensure you’re healthy enough to proceed, particularly given the recent…circumstances. It's a fairly involved procedure, removing excess skin from the lower abdomen. It's not merely cosmetic, though, there can be functional benefits as well. We need to assess your overall health. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. I… I don’t believe so. I was generally very healthy before… everything. I did have some issues with… low blood pressure, perhaps? My husband was always the one who managed the medical things. He always said my blood pressure was a little low, but it was never anything serious enough to… require treatment, I don’t think. Other than that… honestly, I can’t recall. I apologize. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. Low blood pressure, potentially. We'll need to confirm that. It's important to know your baseline. And don’t apologize; it's perfectly understandable. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… I believe… I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, of course. That’s all I can recall, definitely. Nothing major. I’ve never had anything… serious enough to require a hospital stay, if that helps. My husband… he always handled the paperwork, so I wasn’t very involved in the details. I’m truly sorry for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Wisdom teeth removal. Alright. And no hospitalizations. We're getting somewhere. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medications currently. Not regularly, at least. I occasionally take something for headaches, but that’s it. Just over-the-counter pain relievers, when needed. Nothing prescribed, and nothing I take daily. I… I used to take something for anxiety, a few years ago, but I stopped a long time ago. My husband helped me wean off of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications, occasional pain relievers, and a history of anxiety medication that you've discontinued. Anything in your family history that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother had… high cholesterol, I believe. And my father… he had heart problems later in life. Nothing too serious when he was younger, but it developed as he got older. My husband's family… they were generally very healthy, as far as I know. He had a sister who… struggled with diabetes, but other than that, I can’t recall anything significant. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. High cholesterol in your mother, heart problems in your father, and diabetes in your husband’s family. That’s… relevant. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor! Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he always discouraged it. He was very health-conscious. He always made sure we ate well and exercised regularly. I've been trying to maintain that, but it's been… difficult lately. I do enjoy gardening, though. That keeps me active, at least. Do you need to know about alcohol? I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, but nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: Gardening is good. And occasional wine is…acceptable. Now, before we move on, let’s get some basic measurements. I’m going to need to check your height, weight, and blood pressure. And I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need. I trust your judgment. I just want to be sure I’m healthy enough for this surgery, if possible. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your height and weight. Just stand normally, please. 155 centimeters… and 93 kilograms. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly rapid. Lungs are clear, but breathing is a bit shallow. Your blood pressure is 110/70. That's a little on the low side, as you suspected. I also notice some mild abdominal pannus. This is fairly common, given your history. Now, I'm going to need to perform a brief physical examination of your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s alright. Whatever you need to do. You mentioned the low blood pressure… is that a concern? And the…abdominal pannus? Is that something serious? I apologize for all the questions, I just… I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: The low blood pressure isn't necessarily a concern on its own, but it's something we need to monitor closely during the surgery. And the abdominal pannus… it's not serious, per se, but it's what we're aiming to address with the panniculectomy. It's simply excess skin and fat. Tenderness is minimal, but there's some laxity of the abdominal muscles. No obvious masses or abnormalities. Alright. Now, I'm going to order some routine blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel – just to get a clearer picture of your overall health. And I would also recommend an EKG, to assess your heart function. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: That makes sense. Routine tests… yes, that sounds good. Allergies… I don’t think so. I’ve never had any serious allergic reactions. I’m slightly sensitive to penicillin, perhaps? I had a mild rash once, a long time ago, but it wasn’t severe. Other than that… no, I don’t believe so. My husband always kept track of those things. Is that alright? I truly apologize for being so…uninformed.
DOCTOR: A mild rash with penicillin. Noted. Alright. Now, let's discuss the surgery itself. A panniculectomy involves removing the excess skin and fat from the lower abdomen, and then tightening the abdominal muscles. It's a fairly involved procedure, and it requires a significant recovery period. It's typically performed under general anesthesia. Given your slightly low blood pressure and the mild rash with penicillin, I'm going to consult with Dr. Alvarez, the anesthesiologist, to ensure you're a suitable candidate for surgery. And I would also like you to have a pre-operative EKG and a complete blood count, metabolic panel and lipid panel to assess your overall health before we proceed. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Consulting with the anesthesiologist and getting the tests… yes, that sounds very sensible. I trust your judgment completely. I’m just… grateful for your time and attention. It’s a relief to know I’m being taken care of. Perhaps… could you tell me what the next steps are? When can I expect to hear from Dr. Alvarez? And when would I need to schedule the tests? I just… I’m eager to get this process started, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll contact Dr. Alvarez immediately, and she'll likely reach out to you within 24 hours to schedule a consultation. She’ll determine if you're a suitable candidate for general anesthesia. As for the blood tests and EKG, the clinic’s scheduling department will contact you to arrange an appointment. I’ll also have them send you the necessary paperwork. I recommend scheduling those tests as soon as possible. Once we have the results from Dr. Alvarez and the tests, we can discuss the surgery in more detail – the risks, the benefits, and the recovery process. We'll also need to ensure you understand all the pre-operative instructions, including what medications to avoid and how to prepare for surgery. Do you have any concerns regarding the costs involved?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at this time. I have private insurance, so I believe most of it will be covered. I can certainly inquire with my insurance provider if there are any concerns, but I haven’t anticipated any issues. I appreciate you asking, though. It’s very thoughtful of you. I believe that’s everything. I’m just… relieved to have a plan in place. Thank you again for your time and attention. I look forward to hearing from Dr. Alvarez and the scheduling department soon.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll get everything sorted as quickly as possible. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. And please, be honest with Dr. Alvarez about any medical conditions or allergies. It’s crucial for your safety. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I will. Thank you again. .
