DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. Welcome. I'm Dr. IUZZOLINO. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, things just… ain't been right lately. I does be feeling really thirsty all the time, even if I just drink water. And I hungry all the time too, even after I eat a good plate of food. It's just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Hmm, feeling thirsty and hungry all the time, even with water and good meals… I see. And how long has this been going on for, Bianca?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see now… it start maybe… three, four months ago? It was slow at first, you know? Just a little more thirsty than usual. But it get worse and worse each month. Now, it's like I can't get enough water or food to satisfy me. My husband say I does be eating him out of house and home! He joking, of course, but… it is a lot.
DOCTOR: Three or four months… gradually worsening. That's good information, Bianca. And besides the increased thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. I does feel a little more tired than usual, yes. Not all the time, but… especially in the afternoon. And I does have to go to the bathroom more often, to pee. More than usual, that is. I thought it was just the water, but… maybe it something else? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst, increased hunger, fatigue, and more frequent urination… Alright, Bianca, have you had any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision? Well, now that you mention it… things does seem a little blurry sometimes. Not all the time, and I have glasses, you know? But… maybe I need a new prescription? I haven't change them in a while. I don't know if that's what you mean, Doctor. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It could be important, Bianca. Blurred vision can sometimes be associated with…well, we’ll get there. Now, have you experienced any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm… not that I know of. Maybe a pound or two? But I ain't been weighing myself regular. I does feel a little… smaller maybe? But I thought that was just 'cause I getting older. I haven't been eating less, though. If anything, I been eating more! It’s confusing, Doctor. Really confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant weight loss that you’re aware of. Alright. And do you have any sores that are slow to heal, or any frequent infections?
PATIENT: Sores… infections… No, Doctor. I does get little cuts sometimes, like anyone, but they heal up normal. No slow healing. And I haven’t been sick with any infections lately. Just the usual little colds, maybe, but nothing serious. I does try to stay healthy, you know? I don't go out much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca. That's helpful. Now, let's talk a bit about your past medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, heart problems, kidney issues, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, Doctor. Never been told I have diabetes. I does get a little pressure sometimes, when I stressed, but my husband say it just my nerves. No heart problems, no kidney problems. I ain't been to the doctor much over the years. I try to stay away from them, if I can, you know? I just try to take care of myself. I eat my fruits and vegetables, I drink my water… I don't understand why I feeling like this.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medical conditions. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. A long time ago. And I had a baby, but that wasn't a surgery, was it? Just… a natural birth. No other surgeries, Doctor. Nothing else that I can remember. I try to avoid them, if I can. They scare me.
DOCTOR: Tonsils as a child, natural birth… good. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you have a family history of diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother… she had the sugar, yes. Diabetes. She get sick with it when she get older, and she passed away a few years ago from it. My father… he had a bad heart. He passed away when I was young. And my brother… he got kidney problems. He on dialysis now, poor thing. So… yes. Lots of sickness in my family. That’s why I worry, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of diabetes, heart disease, and kidney problems… that is important information, Bianca. And do you currently take any medications, or have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any pills, not regular ones. Just maybe some pain reliever sometimes, when my joints bothering me. And no, I don't have no allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to any medicine. I try to stay away from them, if I can, you know? I prefer natural remedies. Like bush tea, and things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a few other simple tests. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. I just want to know what's going on with me. I feeling so tired all the time, and thirsty, and hungry... it's just not right. Do whatever you need to do to figure it out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, Bianca, but that can happen with stress or anxiety. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds normal, but your breathing sounds a little quiet. Now, I’m just going to quickly examine your feet. Alright, I notice a little swelling in your feet, and your sensation seems a bit reduced in your toes. Finally, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little slow. I'm going to order some blood work and a urine sample. This will help us to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. I’m glad you’re checking everything. Blood work and a pee sample, yes. Whatever you think is best. You think it's serious? My brother, he been sick so long… I don’t want to end up like him.
DOCTOR: It's good that we're being thorough, Bianca. It's too early to say for certain what's going on. But given your symptoms – the increased thirst, hunger, fatigue, and your family history – we need to rule out some possibilities, including diabetes. The blood work will give us a lot of information. We’ll also check your kidney function, just to be safe. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it's better to be cautious. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and collect the urine sample for me. It’ll take a few days to get the results back, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend that you try to reduce your stress levels as much as possible. And please, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as blurred vision, unexplained weight loss, or sores that don't heal, please call the office immediately. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that sounds good. Less stress… easier said than done, but I’ll try. And I’ll watch for those other things you say. Blurred vision, weight loss… I will pay attention. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better just knowing we’re doing something. When will the nurse come?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bianca. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. The nurse, Maria, should be with you shortly. She’s just finishing up with another patient. She’ll explain the process for the blood work and urine sample. It shouldn't take long. I'll be back to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you covered everything. I’ll just… wait for the nurse. Thank you again. You’re a very kind doctor. I’ll be ready.
DOCTOR: Very good. I'll let Maria know you're ready. Please don't hesitate to call if anything comes up.
