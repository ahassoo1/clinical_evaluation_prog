DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups. They just won't stop. It's been… oh, let me think… more than two days now, I think. It's really getting on my nerves, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Hiccups lasting longer than 48 hours can certainly be disruptive and concerning. More than two days, you say. Alright. Let's try to get to the bottom of this. To start, could you describe the hiccups themselves?
PATIENT: Well, they’re… regular hiccups, I guess? You know, the kind where your chest kind of… jerks and you make that “hic” sound. They come on and off, not constantly, but often enough to be annoying. I haven't really noticed anything causing them, which is strange. Usually, I can pinpoint something—like drinking too fast, or getting startled—but this time, nothing comes to mind.
DOCTOR: I see. So, spontaneous hiccups without an obvious trigger. That's helpful to know. Are they interfering with your daily activities at all – eating, sleeping, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely. Eating is a bit of a nightmare, to be honest. I have to take really small bites, and even then, sometimes one will sneak in mid-chew. It's embarrassing when I'm out with friends! Sleeping is okay, but it sometimes wakes me up, which is frustrating. And… well, I manage events, you know? Coordinating things needs a clear head, and these hiccups are making it hard to concentrate. It’s just… tiring.
DOCTOR: I can certainly appreciate how disruptive that must be, especially with your work. Alright. Now, let's delve a little deeper. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no chest pain. I haven’t been coughing or feeling sick at all. My stomach feels normal, no heartburn or indigestion. I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, but honestly, that could just be the stress of work, or these hiccups keeping me awake. I don’t think so, but I haven’t really noticed anything else specifically. Oh! Now that I think about it, my burping has been a little… more frequent, maybe? But it’s not painful or anything.
DOCTOR: Increased burping is good to know, thank you. Let’s move on to your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, and I broke my arm once, but nothing major. No serious illnesses, no surgeries aside from that. I don't take any regular medications, just over-the-counter pain relievers if I have a headache. And…oh, I had a really bad bout of food poisoning a few years ago, but I recovered fine. I’m generally quite healthy, to be honest. Which is why this is so strange!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Redeye. It’s helpful to know you’re generally healthy. And yes, sometimes these unexplained things are the most puzzling. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, as far as you know?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I eat everything, pretty much. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve tried different foods throughout my life, traveling and all, and nothing’s ever bothered me. I’ve never even had poison ivy! I think I’m pretty lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: That is fortunate, Ms. Redeye. Now, let's briefly discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, and she took medication for it for years. My father had…arthritis, I think? It wasn’t anything serious, just aches and pains as he got older. And my grandmother on my mother’s side… she had some kind of stomach problem, but I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago, and we weren’t very close. Honestly, that’s about it. No major illnesses that I know of. We weren’t a family that talked much about health.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I manage events, like I said, so it’s a pretty busy job. Lots of meetings, phone calls, and being on my feet. I don’t have a lot of free time, but I try to eat healthy when I can. I don't smoke, and I only drink socially—a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I used to go to the gym more regularly, but I haven't been in a few months because of work. It’s a bit of a struggle to find the time, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you lead a fairly active life, despite the busy schedule. Now, just to be thorough, are there any recent significant life stressors or changes that you’ve experienced?
PATIENT: Well… my divorce was finalized about six months ago. It was…amicable, thankfully, but it’s still been a bit of an adjustment. And work has been particularly hectic lately—a big event coming up next month, lots of pressure to make it a success. I suppose that’s probably the biggest thing. I try not to let it bother me, but it's definitely been weighing on my mind.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Redeye. Significant life changes, even amicable ones, can certainly contribute to physical symptoms. It's good you're acknowledging the stress. Alright, let’s move on to a brief physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen, just to rule out anything obvious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just take a deep breath in… and out… Very good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or unusual sounds that I can detect. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackling. Your abdomen is soft, not tender to the touch. No masses or organomegaly that I can feel. Everything feels normal so far. Given your history and the exam findings, the hiccups are likely related to stress and possibly some irritation of the phrenic nerve, which controls the diaphragm. However, persistent hiccups can sometimes indicate an underlying medical issue, so I’d like to order a few basic blood tests—a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level—just to rule out any other possibilities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. I’d rather be safe than sorry. Blood tests are fine. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And what happens if something is wrong? I don't want to worry needlessly.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The lab usually takes about 24 to 48 hours to process the results. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as they're available. If anything is abnormal, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. It simply means we need to investigate further. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency, or something that requires a referral to a specialist. I will explain everything to you thoroughly before making any decisions. In the meantime, I recommend trying some simple remedies to help alleviate the hiccups—deep breathing exercises, holding your breath, drinking water slowly, and avoiding carbonated beverages. If they persist despite these measures, we'll discuss other options—possibly a muscle relaxant or, in rare cases, a referral to a gastroenterologist. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds…reasonable. And thank you for explaining it so clearly. Okay, so blood tests and try the remedies. I think I can manage that. When should I start the remedies? Immediately? And are there any specific breathing exercises you’d recommend? I always forget the proper way to do those things.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can start the remedies immediately. As for breathing exercises, a simple one is to breathe deeply into your stomach, hold your breath for a few seconds, and then exhale slowly. Repeat this several times. Another helpful technique is to breathe into a paper bag—but be sure to not hyperventilate. Just a few slow, deep breaths. I’m going to write down a few instructions for you, including the remedies and the lab information. My nurse will also provide you with a lab requisition form. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a bit better just knowing we're looking into it. I’ll go get the blood tests done tomorrow.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Redeye. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. We’ll follow up as soon as the lab results are available. Have a good day, and I hope the hiccups subside soon.
