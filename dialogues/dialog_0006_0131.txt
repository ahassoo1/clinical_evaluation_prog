DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sladen, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hi Dr. Gorga. It's the high blood pressure, really. The nurse took it a few times and said I needed to see someone. It’s been a little high lately, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure. Right. A little high lately… can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I don’t really feel any different, if that makes sense. I just noticed the numbers when I was getting my regular check-up. Before that, I hadn't really been keeping track. The nurse said it was a bit worrying, so I figured I should get it checked out properly. I have Medicare, so it's good to get things looked at, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, good to be proactive. And Medicare is good for that. So, you haven’t had any symptoms – no headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, anything like that?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing like that at all. Honestly, if the nurse hadn't said something, I wouldn't even know. I feel… normal. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I work a lot, so I just figured that was from that. Nothing that felt different than usual, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a better picture… do you have any history of high blood pressure in your family?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a good question. Let me think… My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had it, I think. She was always at the doctor’s, though, for all sorts of things. And my uncle, maybe? He was a bit… unhealthy, if I'm being honest. Ate a lot of salt, always complaining about feeling stuffy. I'm not sure if that was blood pressure, though. It was a while ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history is… possible. We'll keep that in mind. Now, just a quick check – any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't really had to take much medication, thankfully. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing regular. And I've never had a reaction to anything, so I think I'm good there.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Well, let's just do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline, okay?
PATIENT: Sure, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Gorga.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just lie down on the table here. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure again, of course. And I'll just take a quick look at your eyes, ears, nose, and throat. Nothing too involved.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds simple enough. Just let me know if anything feels weird, yeah?
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are… regular. No murmurs that I can detect. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds on both sides. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. A little elevated, as the nurse noted. Pulse is 78 and regular. Eyes look good, pupils are equal and reactive. Ears are clear. Throat looks… normal. A little redness, but nothing significant.
PATIENT: Hmm… 148 over 92, you say? Is that… bad? I really don’t know what those numbers mean, exactly. Just that it’s higher than it should be, I guess. I feel fine, though. Is it something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: Well, it's not critically high, but it is elevated, yes. And consistently high blood pressure, over time, can lead to… problems. We need to investigate further. I'd like to order some routine blood work – just to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and things like that. Also, an EKG just to check your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Blood work and an EKG. Alright. Will that tell you what’s causing it? And… will I need a referral for those things? I haven't really done a lot of this before, so I'm a little lost.
DOCTOR: It will give us a much better picture, yes. The blood work will help rule out any underlying causes, and the EKG will make sure your heart isn’t being affected by the pressure. You'll need a lab order for the blood work, and a referral to the cardiology department for the EKG. I’m writing those up now. It's a standard procedure, Ms. Sladen, nothing to worry about. Here are your lab orders. And this is the referral to cardiology – they'll call you to schedule the EKG.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That’s… a lot of papers. So, I go to the lab first, then they'll call me about the EKG? And… how long will it take to get the results back from the lab? I need to get back to work next week, so I’m hoping it’s not going to be too long.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Lab first, then cardiology will contact you. Results usually take about three to five business days, but I'll flag it as urgent. We can discuss the results when you come back in, or I can call you with any immediate concerns. It shouldn't interfere with your work schedule too much. In the meantime, I’d like you to try to reduce your salt intake, and try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.
PATIENT: Okay, three to five days. Less salt, more exercise. I can definitely try that. I do a lot of walking already, with my job, but I’ll try to be more conscious about the salt. Is there anything else I should be doing? Like, any foods I should avoid? Or anything I should be looking out for, like symptoms that mean I need to call you right away?
DOCTOR: Good question. Avoid processed foods as much as possible – those are usually loaded with salt. And limit caffeine and alcohol. As for symptoms, if you experience severe headaches, vision changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, or numbness or weakness on one side of your body, go to the emergency room immediately. Don’t hesitate. Otherwise, we'll just monitor things for now and discuss the results when they come back. Do you have any other questions for me today, Ms. Sladen?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. That’s a lot of information, but I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. Less salt, more walking, watch out for scary symptoms, and come back in when the results are ready. Thank you, Dr. Gorga. I’ll make sure to schedule a follow-up appointment. Actually… one last thing. Is it okay if I get a copy of these lab orders for my records?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Good idea. Let me print you another copy. Here you are. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up. I think that's everything for today, Ms. Sladen.
