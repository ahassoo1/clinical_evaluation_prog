DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A… a delicate matter, really. Something a gentleman doesn’t typically discuss with… well, anyone. Though, at my age, one finds oneself in need of assistance with… certain functions. It's a… discharge. Yes. A rather unpleasant one, I assure you. Not something I've… encountered before, or, at least, not that I recall.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. These things can be… difficult to discuss. You mentioned a discharge. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well… it’s… wet. Naturally. And… not entirely pleasant in aroma, if I may be frank. It’s been… going on for a few days now, perhaps a week? Time does rather… blur these days. I haven’t a clue why it’s happening. I’ve been happily married for… well, a very long time, and such things haven’t been an issue before. My wife… she suggested I come, of course. A practical woman, my Fatima.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Thank you for sharing that with me. It’s good you came in. To help me understand better, could you describe the discharge a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? Goodness. It’s… fluid, Doctor. A yellowish… tinge, perhaps? Not particularly thick, though not entirely… watery either. It’s… it's simply there. And bothersome, naturally. I haven’t noticed any… pain, thankfully. Just… the inconvenience, and the unpleasant sensation. It stains the… undergarments, you see. A most undignified situation. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright, yellowish discharge, no pain, and staining your undergarments. And you said this has been going on for about a week?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately a week. Though, as I mentioned, time isn’t what it once was. I haven't been feeling unwell otherwise. No fever, no chills, no… unusual aches. Just this… this troublesome issue. It’s rather embarrassing, to be perfectly honest. A man doesn’t expect such things at my age. A long and respectable life, and then this. Do you… do you have any idea what it might be, Doctor? I'd prefer to not dwell on it, if possible.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Krok, there are several possibilities. It could be a simple infection, or something else entirely. To get a better idea, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – any burning, frequency, or urgency?
PATIENT: Urination… hmm. No, I don’t believe so. Not that I recall. I go about my usual routine, as I have for… decades. Perhaps a slight difficulty starting sometimes, but I attribute that to… age, naturally. No burning sensation, no increased frequency. No, I’d say everything is… as usual, in that regard. Though, my wife does nag me to drink more fluids. She's always fussing over my health. A good woman, but… persistent.
DOCTOR: Alright, no changes in urination. Good. And have you noticed any swelling or pain in your groin area, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Swelling… now that you mention it, perhaps a slight discomfort, yes. Not pain, precisely, but a… fullness, perhaps? Especially after I’ve been on my feet for a while. I spend most of my days tinkering in the workshop, you see. Farm equipment, mostly. It keeps me busy, but… it can be strenuous at times. But nothing I haven't handled before, mind you. A man builds up a tolerance for such things over the years. But swelling… yes, a little, perhaps. A most minor inconvenience. Is that… worrisome, Doctor? I do prefer to avoid complications, if at all possible.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, given the discharge and the swelling, it would be prudent to perform a quick physical exam. Just to rule out anything serious. It’s a standard procedure, and it will help me get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… well, I suppose so. If it’s necessary. I’d prefer to not dwell on it, of course. A man doesn’t relish such examinations, particularly at my age. But if it will put my mind at ease, and rule out anything… serious, then proceed, I suppose. But be gentle, Doctor. A man isn’t as… resilient as he once was. And please, be discreet. I have a reputation to maintain, you see. A lifetime of respectable service… one doesn’t wish to jeopardize that now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. Discretion is assured. And I will be as gentle as possible. If you could just lie down on the examination table, we’ll begin. I’m just going to take a look and palpate your abdomen and groin area.
PATIENT: Very well. Let us get this over with, then. Please, do hurry, Doctor. And try not to… disturb things too much. A man’s dignity is a fragile thing, you see. A lifetime of… respectability.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen, starting here. Does this cause you any discomfort?
PATIENT: A little… a little tender there, yes. Not pain, precisely, but… a definite discomfort. I do have a rather sensitive stomach, you see. Years of… frugal meals, perhaps? Nothing serious, I assure you. Just a slight… sensitivity. Please, be gentle, Doctor. Very gentle. It feels… intrusive, you see. A man isn’t accustomed to such probing.
DOCTOR: Alright, very gentle. I’m just checking for any tenderness or masses. And how about here, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes! That’s… tender! Very tender! Please, be careful! It’s… sensitive, you see. Extremely sensitive! I do have some… age-related discomfort there, perhaps? Nothing serious, I assure you. Just… a little soreness. Please, do not press too hard, Doctor. It’s quite… unpleasant. A man isn't accustomed to this level of… scrutiny.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok, I understand. I apologize if that caused you discomfort. Based on the tenderness you’re describing, and the discharge, I am concerned about the possibility of an infection or inflammation. There is a definite swelling in the groin area as well. Given your age and the sensitivity, I recommend we get some laboratory tests done to confirm the diagnosis. We will need a urine sample, and possibly a swab of the discharge. Would you be able to provide those for me?
PATIENT: Laboratory tests… a urine sample… a swab… Goodness. It seems this has escalated rather quickly. A man doesn’t relish the thought of… samples. But if it’s necessary for a diagnosis, then… yes. Yes, I suppose so. I’d prefer to get this over with as quickly as possible. Though… where exactly am I to… provide these samples? And… will it be uncomfortable? A man’s privacy, you see… it’s rather important.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. Your privacy is paramount. There is a restroom just down the hall. I will provide you with a sterile container for the urine sample. As for the swab, we can collect that here, in a private manner. It will involve a gentle swabbing of the affected area. I will explain the procedure thoroughly before we proceed. It should not be particularly uncomfortable, but please let me know if you experience any pain. I will give you a moment to gather yourself, and then we can proceed with the samples.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Let us get this over with, then. A man prefers to avoid… delays. And please, do be gentle. A lifetime of respectable service… one doesn’t wish to end it with… indignity. I shall return… when I am… prepared.
