DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Secondi. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, my pee is… orange. It started a couple days ago. I don't know why. It's a little strange, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is certainly something worth investigating, Mr. Secondi. Orange urine can have several causes. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe it a little further?
PATIENT: Further? Okay. It's… bright orange. Not dark, not light. Just… orange. Like, the color of a carrot, maybe? And it doesn't hurt when I pee. Just… the color is weird. I drink a lot of water, always have. Maybe it's something I ate? I don't know.
DOCTOR: I understand. Bright orange, resembling the color of a carrot, and no pain with urination. And you typically drink a lot of water. That’s good information. To clarify, has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. We have the same things most weeks. Pasta, chicken, some vegetables. My wife does most of the cooking. I did eat a lot of carrots last week, now that you mention it. For a snack, you know? With hummus. Is that… could that do it?
DOCTOR: That's quite possible, Mr. Secondi. Carrots are rich in beta-carotene, which can indeed cause a harmless orange discoloration of the urine. However, to rule out other potential causes, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Do you take any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Vitamins… yeah, I take a multivitamin. Just a regular one, from the store. And sometimes, when I feel a cold coming on, I take Vitamin C. But I haven’t taken any Vitamin C in, oh, maybe a week or so. Just the multivitamin every day. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. Some vitamins, particularly those containing beta-carotene or high doses of Vitamin C, can also cause urine discoloration. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions, such as liver or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Liver or kidney problems… no, not that I know of. I've never been told I have anything like that. I get a check-up every year, and the doctor always says I'm healthy. Just a little high blood pressure, but I take a pill for that. It's working, I think. They check everything at the yearly check-up.
DOCTOR: Good. So, you have a history of hypertension, managed with medication. And your yearly check-ups have been normal otherwise. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Just the pill for the blood pressure. A small white pill. I take it every morning with breakfast. And… sometimes, if my back hurts, I take ibuprofen. But not often. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. Nothing else, I think. My wife helps me keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Very good. So, just the blood pressure medication daily and ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife has some allergies, to pollen and stuff, but I'm good. No problems there. I can eat anything, take any medicine... well, usually. I try not to take too much medicine, you know?
DOCTOR: Excellent. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work. I'm an engineering technician. Mostly in the office, but sometimes I go to sites. I exercise a little bit, walk the dog. I don't smoke, and I don't drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I'm married, have two kids grown up and gone. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Secondi, that’s very helpful. It sounds like you lead a healthy lifestyle. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be causing your orange urine, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, and then I'd like to order a urinalysis – a simple urine test – just to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. A test is fine. I don't mind. What will the test show? Will it tell me if it's just the carrots? And the exam is okay too. I trust you, Doctor. I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The urinalysis will help us to assess things like your hydration level, check for the presence of blood or protein, and rule out any infection. It will also give us some indication as to whether the color change is likely due to something harmless like beta-carotene, or if further investigation is needed. If you could please follow me, and we'll start with the physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. Then, we'll collect a urine sample. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Let's do it. I'm ready when you are. I hope it is just the carrots. It's a little embarrassing, you know? Having orange pee. .
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel a little embarrassed, Mr. Secondi, but it's a common concern. We see this from time to time. Please have a seat here on the table. We'll start by checking your blood pressure, and then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear bilaterally. No murmurs or wheezing noted. Now, if you could please provide a urine sample, I’ll get that sent to the lab for analysis. There’s a collection cup in the bathroom. I'll give you a set of instructions on how to obtain a clean-catch sample.
PATIENT: Okay, good. Blood pressure is good, you say? That's good news. I'll go get the sample now. A clean-catch… right. I remember something about that. .
DOCTOR: Beta-carotene intake, medication review… rule out hepatic or biliary obstruction… Need to emphasize the importance of hydration…
