DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um... my nose. It feels... not good. Like, stuffed up. It has been like this for... a little while, I think. Not sure how long, exactly. It’s just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: “A little while,” is rather vague, Ms. Boham. It’s important for me to ascertain the precise duration of your symptoms. Can you recall when you first noticed this nasal congestion?
PATIENT: Oh... precise... I am sorry. My memory is... not so good. Maybe... a few weeks? Or maybe longer. It is hard to say. It started slowly, I think. Not all at once. Just... getting worse little by little. I work outside, Doctor. Maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Working outdoors could be a contributing factor, yes. Though, naturally, we must rule out other possibilities. Is the congestion constant, or does it fluctuate throughout the day?
PATIENT: It is... mostly constant. But worse when I lie down, I think. It makes it hard to sleep sometimes. And... my head feels heavy. Like pressure. Not a bad headache, exactly, just... full. Does that make sense? I am sorry if I am not explaining it well.
DOCTOR: It’s… adequate, Ms. Boham. We need to be more specific. This "heaviness" in your head – is it localized to a particular area, or is it generalized?
PATIENT: Localized… um… it feels… all over my forehead, I think. And… behind my eyes, maybe? It is hard to tell. It is not a sharp pain, Doctor. It's just… uncomfortable. Like a lot of pressure. I don't know many words, I am sorry. It is just... a stuffy head and a heavy feeling. It makes it hard to think.
DOCTOR: Ms. Boham, while I appreciate you attempting to describe your symptoms, imprecise language hinders a proper diagnosis. Let's try a more systematic approach. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches accompanying this congestion and "heaviness?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. I haven’t felt hot. And no chills. My body… maybe a little tired sometimes, but I work very hard, so I am usually tired. It is hard to tell if it is from the work or... something else. I don’t know. Is a fever… feeling warm? I am not good with this. Sorry.
DOCTOR: A fever is an elevated body temperature, Ms. Boham. Generally above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Have you taken your temperature recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… we don’t have a thermometer at home. We don’t have much money for those things. I just… feel normal, I think. Maybe a little warm after work, but that is from the sun. I don’t know what the temperature is, I am sorry. I just want my nose to feel better. It is hard to breathe sometimes. Especially at night. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a physical examination, then. I need to auscultate your lungs and palpate your sinuses. Please recline on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. If you think that will help. I am ready when you are. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, I’m going to listen to your breathing with this stethoscope. Please take slow, deep breaths in through your mouth. Breathe deeply… and again. Alright. Your lung sounds are… clear, bilaterally. Though slightly diminished. Now, I'm going to palpate your sinuses. This may be slightly uncomfortable. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not much. A little pressure, maybe. But not pain. It feels... kind of normal. It is hard to explain. There. That feels a little bit… tighter. But still not bad. Like a full feeling, if that makes sense. I am not sure if I am helping.
DOCTOR: The tenderness is minimal, but present. It suggests some degree of sinus congestion. Now, I’m going to examine your throat and nasal passages. Please open your mouth and say "Ah." "Ah…" There appears to be some mild mucosal swelling and… a small amount of purulent discharge. Your nasal passages are congested, with evidence of mild inflammation. Based on the physical examination, it appears you are suffering from acute sinusitis.
PATIENT: Sinusitis… is that bad, Doctor? Is it from the work? I don’t want to lose my job. We need the money. Will medicine help? I just want to feel normal again. And be able to sleep.
DOCTOR: Ms. Boham, while I understand your concerns, it's not always possible to pinpoint a single cause. Your work environment may be a contributing factor, but sinusitis can also be caused by viral or bacterial infections. It is not typically severe, but left untreated, it can become more problematic. We will start with a course of antibiotics to address any potential bacterial infection. I’m also going to recommend a nasal saline rinse twice daily to help clear the congestion. And over-the-counter decongestants as needed. I will also provide you with a referral to an otolaryngologist – an ear, nose, and throat specialist – should your symptoms not improve within a week. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. I have never taken much medicine. Just… pain pills sometimes, for my back. But I don't remember what they were called. The doctor at the free clinic gave them to me. I don’t have any bad reactions to anything, I think. The money for the medicine... how much will it cost? It's just… hard right now.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic – amoxicillin – and a nasal saline solution. The amoxicillin will require a prescription, but the saline solution is available over-the-counter. Given your financial situation, I will contact a local charity that provides assistance with medication costs. I cannot guarantee coverage, but I will do my best to secure a discount or financial aid for you. The prescription will be sent to your usual pharmacy. If you do not have a regular pharmacy, I can provide a list of affordable options in the area. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. Boham?
PATIENT: That is very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. No, I don’t think so. You explained everything very well. I will try the medicine and the salt water. And if it doesn’t get better, I will go see the other doctor. Thank you again. You have been very helpful.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will have the nurse provide you with a printed summary of your visit, including medication instructions and the referral information. Follow up with your primary care physician in one week to assess your progress. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Boham.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
