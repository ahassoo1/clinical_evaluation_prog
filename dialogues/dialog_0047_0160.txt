DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Honestly? It’s this tiredness. Just… dragging all the time. And it’s not like I’m doing anything to be tired. I mostly just sit, help folks stretch… it’s ridiculous. And this… well, it's embarrassing, but I've been craving dirt. Actual dirt. Don't look at me like that, I know it sounds crazy.
DOCTOR: Right. Craving dirt… that is unusual. Let’s try to unpack this a bit. When did this tiredness start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it's been creeping up on me, really. Maybe… six months ago? Started as just feeling a bit more worn out at the end of the day, and now it’s all the time. Even mornings are rough. It’s not like I’m doing anything that would make me tired, you know? I just… am.
DOCTOR: And this craving… how long have you been experiencing that, and how often?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't make me talk about it. It started around the same time as the tiredness, I suppose. Maybe four months ago? And it's… a few times a week now. Not every day, thankfully, but when it hits, I need it. It’s just… a certain kind of clay, you know? From the park down the street. It's humiliating.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s good you’re telling me. Unusual cravings can sometimes point to deficiencies. Are you experiencing any other changes?
PATIENT: Deficiencies? What, like I’m not eating enough? I eat perfectly fine. A little soup, some bread… I don't need all those fancy meals. Honestly, I don't have the energy to cook. And no, not really any changes. Just tired and… this. I don't think it's anything serious. Probably just getting old.
DOCTOR: Well, “just getting old” can be a factor, certainly. But we need to rule out other possibilities. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... nothing major. A bit of arthritis in my hands, that's all. The doctor said it comes with the territory, being a physical therapist aide for so long. And I had the flu a few years back, but who hasn’t? I don't go to doctors much. Mostly, I just try to push through.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. I avoid hospitals if I can. Too many germs, you know? And frankly, I don't trust 'em. Always poking and prodding... no thank you. Just keep me moving and give me some soup, and I'm good.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family. My sister, she's doing alright, lives in Addis Ababa. We don't talk much anymore, though. It's been years. My parents... they're gone, of course. Died a long time ago. And no, as far as I know, no one in my family had anything interesting going on with their health. Just normal old age stuff, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, no. I don't take any of those pills. They just make you feel worse, I've heard. I've always preferred to just deal with things myself. A little rest, a bit of sunshine, some good food… that’s all you need. I don’t want to be dependent on a pharmacy.
DOCTOR: Right. No medications. And any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had them. I can eat anything, really. Though I don’t much care for spicy food. That's not an allergy, just a preference. Honestly, I think people these days complain about too much. A little tiredness and a craving? It’s not the end of the world.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, despite your… preferences regarding medical intervention, we should still proceed with some basic tests. Your symptoms, while perhaps not "the end of the world," warrant investigation. I’d like to check your iron levels and run a complete blood count. And just to be thorough, a vitamin D test as well. Are you agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? After I told you I don't take pills and don't like doctors? Fine, do your tests. Get it over with. But don’t expect any dramatic revelations. It’s probably just a phase. And honestly, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly to draw some blood. It will only take a few minutes. In the meantime, let's have a quick physical exam. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Oh, this is just lovely. Fine, I'm standing. But don't expect miracles. My joints aren’t what they used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some mild swelling in your joints, consistent with arthritis, as you mentioned. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Sounds clear, no noticeable abnormalities. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90, but not critically high. Palpating your abdomen… no tenderness. Alright, that's sufficient for now. We'll proceed with the blood work, and we’ll discuss the results when they come back. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit silly. All this fuss over a little tiredness and a… a habit. Just let me know when it's over. I really have things to do, and sitting here isn't helping.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you shortly. We’ll contact you with the results as soon as they are available. Hopefully, it will just confirm that everything is as expected. Don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms in the meantime, though I doubt that will be the case. .
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you. Or whatever. Just… hurry up with the tests, please. I’m wasting my whole day here.
