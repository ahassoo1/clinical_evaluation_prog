DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi. Well, to be honest, it's... a bit of everything, I guess. I just don’t feel right. Been feeling kinda…off. Not sick, exactly. Just… not on. My wife, bless her, always said I needed to take better care of myself. She had a point, probably. It's been a while since... well, since everything. Mostly just hoping to sleep better and maybe, I don’t know, get a bit more energy. I do a lot of bending over fixing instruments, and it’s starting to feel it, you know?
DOCTOR: "Everything," you say. Vague, but alright. We’ll get there. So, let’s try to be a little more specific. When did this “feeling off” start?
PATIENT: Ugh, specific… right. See, that's where it gets tricky. Honestly? It all kinda blends together after a while. Probably… six months? Maybe longer. It’s hard to say. Things just gradually… dimmed. Like a light bulb losing power, you know? Not suddenly, just… less bright. I wouldn’t even say it was after anything specific happened. It just… was.
DOCTOR: Right. Gradual. Okay. And you mentioned sleep and energy. Is the sleep issue difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or just not feeling rested after sleeping?
PATIENT: Oh, it's definitely staying asleep. I can fall asleep alright, usually pretty quick, actually. But then… I wake up. A lot. Like, three, four times a night. Sometimes more. And I just… lie there. Thinking. Worrying. It's not like I'm actively worrying about anything specific, it just… happens. And then, when I do finally get back to sleep, it's never deep. Never refreshing. And yeah, that makes for a pretty rough day, obviously.
DOCTOR: Okay, so disrupted sleep, not feeling rested. And you said bending over is becoming difficult?
PATIENT: Yeah, the bending. It's in my lower back, mostly. Always thought it was just part of the job, you know? Years of hunching over violins and cellos. But it’s getting worse, I guess. Not like crippling pain or anything, but it’s just… constant. And it makes it harder to concentrate, too. If I'm uncomfortable, I can’t really focus on the delicate work. It’s a problem, especially with some of the older instruments. They're… finicky.
DOCTOR: Right. So, lower back discomfort impacting concentration. Let’s talk about other things. Any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. Not really, I guess. I eat when I’m hungry. I don’t go out of my way for anything specific. My wife used to make all sorts of lovely Syrian dishes, but… that's another story. Now it’s mostly just… simple things. Sandwiches, pasta, that sort of thing. Nothing fancy. I don't really enjoy eating anymore, if that makes sense. It’s just fuel, you know? Just something to keep me going.
DOCTOR: "Not enjoying"… alright. Any recent weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Weight… I haven't really checked. Probably lost a little, to be honest. The clothes feel a bit looser. Not intentionally, mind you. Just… haven't been feeling up to much, so haven't been eating as much, I suppose. It's not like I'm starving myself or anything. Just… less of an appetite, and less energy to bother with it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you mentioned your wife… I'm sorry for your loss, if that is what you meant. This change in appetite and energy, has it impacted your mood at all?
PATIENT: Oh. Uh, yeah. It has. I mean, it’s been… a while. Five years, now. And… no, it’s not like I’m depressed, exactly. Just… less. Less interested in things. Less motivated. Everything feels… muted, you know? Like looking at the world through a dirty window. I just… go through the motions. Repairing instruments is a good distraction, thankfully. Keeps my hands busy. But it doesn’t… fix anything, obviously.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just routine things, to get a baseline. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and feel your abdomen. And I'll take a look at your back, naturally. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do. I guess. I haven’t really been to a doctor in years, so… just tell me if anything feels weird, or if I need to do anything special. It's all a bit much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear… again, deep breaths… and out. Soft, no tenderness… a little bit of gas, but nothing concerning. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. Now, about your back… can you bend forward for me?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yeah, that's… not great. It's mostly lower back, right here. Feels kinda tight. And if I stand for too long, it gets worse. It's a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, just… constant.
DOCTOR: Yes, I feel some muscle guarding and tightness in the lumbar region. Range of motion is slightly limited. No radiating pain down the legs, correct?
PATIENT: No, no pain down the legs. Just in my back, like I said. It doesn't shoot down or anything. It just… aches. Sometimes it feels like a knot, other times it's just… sore. Honestly? I’ve probably just aggravated it over the years. Bending over fiddly instruments all day isn’t exactly good for your spine, I imagine.
DOCTOR: It’s likely a combination of muscle strain and age-related wear and tear. Given your history and the exam findings, I’m not immediately concerned about anything serious. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few blood tests. Just a basic metabolic panel and a CBC… to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out any inflammation. We can also discuss potential imaging if the pain doesn't improve with conservative management. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests, huh? Always something. Fine, sure. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel… normal again, you know? I don’t really like being poked and prodded, but… if it helps, then okay. I guess conservative management is… what, exactly?
DOCTOR: Conservative management means things like physical therapy, stretching exercises, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, and avoiding activities that aggravate the pain. We can get you a referral to a physical therapist if you’d like. And I recommend taking it easy for a few days, avoiding any heavy lifting or prolonged bending. As for the blood tests, the nurse will draw them before you leave. I’ll review the results when they come back, and we can discuss next steps then. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. My wife always handled all the medication stuff. I just told her what hurt, and she figured it out. I’ve taken ibuprofen before, for headaches, and it was fine. But I haven’t really taken anything regularly. Honestly, I tend to just… ignore things until they get too bad. Which, admittedly, isn't a great strategy.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s best to be proactive. We’ll get the blood tests done, and if the pain persists, we’ll consider further investigation. In the meantime, try to rest and avoid aggravating activities. The nurse will give you a list of instructions before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: I don't think so. Just… hoping to feel better soon, I guess. It's hard to enjoy anything when you're constantly aching. And I miss… well, it doesn’t matter. It’s just… frustrating, you know? This whole thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we’ll do what we can. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and provide you with the instructions. Try not to worry too much, and follow the recommendations. .
