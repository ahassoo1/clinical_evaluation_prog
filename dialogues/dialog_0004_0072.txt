DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve just been… forgetting things. Little things, mostly, but it's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Forgetting things, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Like… where I put my keys, or what I was about to say mid-sentence. Not huge things, but enough that I noticed it happening more and more. It’s not like I can’t function, but it’s definitely… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling is a fair word. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Heidenthal?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think maybe… six months? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. It started slowly, just little lapses, and I brushed it off as being tired or stressed. But it feels like it’s gotten worse in the last couple of months, definitely.
DOCTOR: Six months… okay. And are these memory lapses consistent, or do they seem to happen at certain times, or under specific circumstances?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I don’t really think so… not that I’ve noticed. It doesn’t seem to be tied to being tired, because it happens even when I’ve had a good night’s sleep. And it’s not like it’s only when I’m stressed, either. It just… happens. Randomly, really. I'm starting to wonder if it's just getting older, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Well, getting older can contribute, certainly. But six months is enough time to warrant investigation. Have you noticed any other changes, Ms. Heidenthal?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. Not really. I mean, I’ve been a little more… anxious, maybe? But I chalked that up to worrying about the memory stuff. I don’t feel confused, if that makes sense. Just… forgetful. And a bit worried about being forgetful. I haven't had any trouble with, like, speaking or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no difficulty with speech. And the anxiety is likely related, as you said. Do you have any family history of memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: That's a tough one. My grandmother, on my mother’s side… I think she had something, but nobody really talked about it much. She just… faded, you know? We didn’t really know what was going on. My mother always said it was “old age” and that's all. I'm not sure if it was anything specific or not, truthfully. I don't really have any other information about it.
DOCTOR: Vague family history… Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, honestly. And sometimes ibuprofen for a headache, but not very often. Nothing regular or anything. I'm pretty healthy, otherwise. I try to eat well and get some exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. No regular medications. Ms. Heidenthal, I'd like to do a brief physical and neurological exam to get a better sense of things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could sit up here for me. I'm going to check your reflexes, balance, and do a few simple cognitive tests. It won't be anything strenuous. First, let's just start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130/80. Normal. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, I'd like you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head. Eye movements are normal. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, stand up slowly for me. I'm going to check your balance.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good, I'm ready. I feel a little wobbly sometimes, but that’s probably just me being tall. I’m 6’4”, so my center of gravity is a little… off.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. It can affect balance. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions, just to assess your memory and cognitive function. Please answer to the best of your ability. First, what is the date today?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… Is it still August? Oh dear. It’s August 2nd, right? 2025? I… I think so. I had a birthday recently, so I should know… I’m just a little frazzled, I guess.
DOCTOR: Yes, today is August 2nd, 2025. It’s alright to be a little off. Now, can you tell me the names of three objects I'm going to name?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, I can do that. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Pen. Chair. Picture. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat those three objects back to me.
PATIENT: Hmm… pen… chair… and… oh dear. What was the third one? It was on the wall… a picture… I just saw it! I’m so sorry. It's right there… I can see it… it’s… I can’t remember! I’m really embarrassed.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s okay. We're just assessing. Now, I'm going to ask you a simple math question. Can you count backwards from 100 by sevens?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… 100… 93… 86… 79… 72… 65… Oh… I'm losing it already. 58… and… uh… I’m really bad at math, I always have been. I’m so sorry. I can't do it. It’s just… gone.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Ms. Heidenthal. That was helpful. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, there is some indication of cognitive impairment. Now, I'm not going to jump to any conclusions, but I do want to rule out some possible causes. I'd like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, thyroid panel, Vitamin B12 levels, and a basic metabolic panel. Additionally, I recommend an MRI of the brain to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. If it can help figure out what’s happening, I’m all for it. MRI sounds a little scary, but if it’s necessary… yes. Let’s do it. I just want to know what's going on. And hopefully it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m ordering those tests now. The lab should be able to accommodate you today. I will also have my nurse schedule the MRI. She’ll give you instructions on how to prepare. It's important to stay calm during the MRI, and follow the technician's instructions carefully. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous mental activity, and getting plenty of rest. I’m also going to give you a referral to a neurologist. They are the specialists in these kinds of cases, and will be able to provide a more thorough evaluation. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A neurologist… okay. No, I don’t think so, not right now. Just… what could it be? Is it… Alzheimer’s? Is that what you’re thinking? That’s what I’m most afraid of, honestly. I've seen it happen to family, and… it's frightening.
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, it’s understandable that you’re worried. It could be a number of things. Memory loss can be caused by stress, anxiety, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or even medication side effects. It could be an early sign of something more serious, like Alzheimer’s or another form of dementia, but we don't have enough information to make that determination yet. That's why we're running these tests. Jumping to conclusions at this stage would be irresponsible. We need to rule out all other possibilities before we can consider a diagnosis like Alzheimer’s. The neurologist will be able to perform a more comprehensive assessment and provide you with a more accurate answer. I'll give you the lab orders and the referral information now. Please call the lab to schedule your appointment. My nurse will contact you to arrange the MRI. And remember, I'm here if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes. I understand. It's just… a lot to take in. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for not… scaring me. And for being patient. I really appreciate it. I’ll call the lab right away. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. It is a lot, and I understand your anxiety. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. We'll get to the bottom of this, one step at a time. Have a good day, and please, take care of yourself.
