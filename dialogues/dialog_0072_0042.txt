DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammann. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s good to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Real good to meet you too. Well, I reckon I’m here for a check-up, mostly. A “men’s health optimization visit,” as the nice lady on the phone called it. Truth is, I’m gettin’ up there in years, and I want to make sure everything’s still tickin’ like it should. Keepin’ up with my etchings takes a bit of stamina, you know? And I want to be around for my grandkids.
DOCTOR: A “men’s health optimization visit,” yes. I see. And you’re concerned about maintaining your energy levels, particularly with your…etchings, and for your grandchildren. That’s very good of you to think ahead. Let’s start with a bit of background. Have you had a primary care physician regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Yep, I did. Dr. Peterson, back in Tulsa. Real good man. But he retired a few years back, and I… well, I kinda put off findin’ another one. Truth be told, I’m not one for botherin’ folks if I can avoid it. He always knew my history, you see? I guess I figured I’d just keep on keepin’ on. But now that I’m thinkin’ about it, it probably is time I get things checked out proper-like.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not uncommon to delay these things. Dr. Peterson, in Tulsa… alright. Do you recall any significant medical issues he treated you for?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… Dr. Peterson, he had me for high blood pressure for a bit, maybe ten years ago? Put me on some pills for it, and they worked real well. Took 'em for a few years, then he said I could try cuttin' back on salt and see how it went. That seemed to do the trick, so I got off the medication. Other than that… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. Musta been thirty years, or more. I don’t remember the specifics, to be honest. It was before my wife passed, I think.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in the past, managed with lifestyle changes – good. And a cholecystectomy, gallbladder removal, approximately thirty years ago. We'll need to confirm those details in your records, of course. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. I don’t much believe in takin’ pills if I can help it. I do take a multivitamin every now and then, but that’s about it. Mostly I just try to eat sensible and get a bit of exercise when I can. Mostly walkin' around my workshop, really. It keeps me busy, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications, occasional multivitamin. And you mentioned walking around your workshop for exercise. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. My wife, bless her heart, she was always a bit sensitive to pollen, but I never had any trouble myself. I eat pretty much anything, and I ain’t never been stung by a bee or nothin’ either. I reckon I’m a pretty lucky fella, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Kammann. Now, let’s talk a bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, things like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a tough one. My mama, she had diabetes. Passed away when I was pretty young, I think it was complications from it. And my grandpa, on my dad’s side, he had a bad heart. Didn’t live to be an old man, not like some. Other than that… I don’t rightly know. My dad wasn’t one for talkin’ about family history. Kept mostly to himself. My wife’s family, I don't know much about them, to be honest. Didn’t spend a whole lot of time with 'em.
DOCTOR: Diabetes in your mother, cardiac issues in your paternal grandfather. We'll document that. And you mentioned limited knowledge of your wife’s family history. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, she tried 'em for a bit when she was younger, but she quit before we got married. Said they didn’t agree with her. I always thought that was a smart move.
DOCTOR: Very good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I'll have a beer with supper sometimes. Or a glass of wine on a special occasion. Nothing too regular, though. I ain't one for gettin' rowdy. Mostly just a bit of somethin' to wash down the food. Wouldn't say I need it, understand? Just enjoy the taste now and then.
DOCTOR: Moderate alcohol consumption. And finally, regarding your social history, what is your current occupation?
PATIENT: Well, I’m an etcher and engraver. Been doin' it for… goodness, over forty years now. I have a workshop out back, and folks commission me to do all sorts of things. Portraits, landscapes, designs for jewelry… keeps me busy, and I enjoy it. It’s a good trade, a quiet trade.
DOCTOR: Etcher and engraver. Excellent. Alright, Mr. Kammann, that gives me a good overview of your background. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s fine with me, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I reckon it's time I let you poke around a bit and see what's what. I’m not afraid of a little examination.
DOCTOR: Very good. Please have a seat on the table, and we’ll begin. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. Within normal limits, though we will want to monitor your blood pressure during future visits. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. I’m going to palpate your abdomen now. Let me know if you feel any tenderness. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. Finally, I’ll check your reflexes and perform a brief neurological assessment. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Neurological assessment is grossly normal. Everything appears to be within normal limits, Mr. Kammann, but to get a more complete picture, I’d like to order some blood work. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a PSA test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yep, that sounds real sensible, Doctor. Blood work’s fine with me. Whatever you think’s best. A PSA test, you say? What’s that for? I ain’t much good with medical terms, understand?
DOCTOR: A PSA test, or Prostate-Specific Antigen test, is a blood test we use to screen for prostate cancer. It measures the level of a protein produced by the prostate gland. An elevated level can indicate the presence of prostate cancer, but it can also be elevated for other reasons, such as inflammation or an enlarged prostate. It’s simply a screening tool, and if it is elevated, we would then discuss further testing options. It’s fairly standard for men your age, Mr. Kammann. Do you have any objections to having it done?
PATIENT: Nope. No objections at all, Doctor. If it helps you make sure I’m still in good workin’ order, then I’m all for it. My wife always said I was too stubborn for my own good. Maybe this’ll help you keep me in line. So, where do we go from here? Do I need to go somewhere special for the blood work?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll have a requisition form printed for you, and the lab technician will take care of everything. They’ll need to draw a few vials of blood. Once the results are back – typically within a few days – my nurse, Sarah, will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or concerning symptoms – such as difficulty urinating, blood in your urine, or unexplained pain – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Kammann?
PATIENT: Nope. I reckon that covers everything. You explained it all real clear-like, Doctor. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen and not makin' me feel like an old fool askin' questions. I’ll go get that blood work done now, and I’ll look forward to hearin' from Sarah. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kammann. It was my pleasure. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. Sarah will be in touch shortly. Have a good day.
