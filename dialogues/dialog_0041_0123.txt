DOCTOR: Hi Carla, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my skin. It’s been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy! It started a few weeks ago, I think, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.
DOCTOR: Okay, itchy skin. That is frustrating. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Maybe a month now? It's hard to say exactly, you know how it is. It comes and goes, but when it comes, oh boy. Especially on my arms and back.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It's easy to lose track of time. And it sounds particularly bothersome when it flares up. On your arms and back… is it just those areas, or does it spread to anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's mostly my arms and back, yes. But I think I felt a little bit on my legs the other day, just my calves. Not as bad, though. And it’s not on my face, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily arms and back, with maybe a little bit on your calves. And thankfully not on your face. Is it… a constant itch, or does it come in waves?
PATIENT: It comes in waves, definitely. Some days I barely notice it, and other days… well, I just want to rip my skin off! It’s worse at night, I think. Makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse at night… that's good to know. And you said it feels like you want to rip your skin off… is it a burning itch, a prickly itch, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not a burn, no. More… a deep, uncomfortable scratchiness. Like something is crawling under my skin, almost. And it gets worse when I get warm, you know? Like if I've been doing something around the house or if it's humid.
DOCTOR: Right, a deep scratchiness, almost like something crawling… and worse with warmth. Okay. Have you noticed any rash or bumps with the itch?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, there was something. A few little red spots, mostly on my back. They didn't really look like anything serious, just little… raised bumps. They faded pretty quickly, though. I didn’t think much of it at the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, little red bumps that faded quickly… that’s helpful. And have you tried anything to relieve the itch so far?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I’ve tried a few things. Some lotion, regular lotion, not anything special. And I took a Benadryl a couple of times, but it makes me so sleepy. Didn’t really get rid of the itch, just knocked me out.
DOCTOR: Alright, regular lotion and Benadryl, which didn't provide much relief and made you sleepy. Okay. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health… Do you have any other medical problems, like diabetes or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. No, not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it was under control with some pills years ago. Nothing else, really. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat my fruits and vegetables.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure that's controlled with medication. Good to hear you're staying healthy. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills, yes. And sometimes I take an over-the-counter pain reliever if my knees are bothering me, but that’s it. Nothing regularly. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or plants?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. I eat everything! I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. Though, I did get a rash once after using a new laundry detergent, but that was years ago. I just switched back to my old one.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, except for a past rash with a new laundry detergent. Good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Does anyone in your family have skin problems, like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My grandmother, my mother’s mother, she had terrible dry skin. Always complaining about it, always using lotions. But I don't think it was anything… serious, like eczema or psoriasis. Just very, very dry skin. No one else that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, your grandmother had very dry skin. And finally, what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean, exactly?
DOCTOR: Sorry, it's just a way of asking about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or have any hobbies that might expose you to irritants?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh, I see. Well, no, I don't smoke. Never have. And I have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. Just one. As for hobbies… I like to garden. And I do a little bit of sewing. Nothing too strenuous. I spend a lot of time with my grandchildren, that’s my favorite hobby!
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, a little bit of wine, gardening, and sewing. That's good to know. Alright, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to take a look at your skin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds good. Please, go ahead. I’m hoping you can figure out what’s causing this itch. It’s driving me crazy!
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to take a look at your arms and back. I see some mild redness, especially on your upper arms. It doesn't look like a severe rash, but there's some evidence of scratching. Is this area tender when I touch it?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit. Not terribly painful, but…sensitive. Especially right here, on my shoulder blade. It's been itchy there for days, so I’ve probably been scratching at it without realizing it. It feels a little bumpy too, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel some mild bumps there, and it does feel a little sensitive to the touch. And I don’t see any signs of infection. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing, it could be a few things. It sounds like it could be contact dermatitis – an allergic reaction to something your skin is touching – or possibly just dry skin that’s gotten irritated, especially with the gardening. It's also possible it's a mild form of eczema. To be sure, we could do a patch test to see if you're allergic to anything, but let’s start with something simpler. I’m going to recommend a topical steroid cream to help reduce the inflammation and relieve the itch. Also, a good, fragrance-free moisturizer. And try to avoid anything that might be irritating your skin, like harsh soaps or detergents. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable. A cream, alright. I can do that. I don’t want to have to do a lot of tests if I don’t have to. Is the cream something I can get at the drugstore? And what kind of moisturizer? There are so many! I just want to be comfortable again. This itch is awful.
DOCTOR: Yes, the cream is available over the counter. I’ll write you a prescription for a low-potency hydrocortisone 1% cream. Apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice a day. And for the moisturizer, look for something fragrance-free and hypoallergenic – brands like Cetaphil or Vanicream are good choices. Avoid anything with perfumes or dyes. Also, try to keep your skin cool and dry, and avoid scratching as much as possible. I know it's hard, but scratching can actually make the itch worse and lead to infection. Let’s see how you do with this for a couple of weeks. If it doesn't improve, or if it gets worse, then we can consider a patch test or see a dermatologist. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Hydrocortisone and Cetaphil… I can remember that. And I’ll try really hard not to scratch. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to figure this out. I hope this works. Is there anything else I should know?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Carla. I’m glad I could help. Just be aware that topical steroids can sometimes cause a little bit of thinning of the skin if used for a long time, so don't use it continuously for more than two weeks without checking with me. And if you experience any burning, stinging, or worsening of the itch, stop using it and let me know. Otherwise, just follow the instructions, and hopefully, you'll start to feel better soon. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor Polczynski. I really appreciate it. I’ll go pick up the cream and try it out. Thank you again. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Carla. You have a good day too, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
PATIENT: .
