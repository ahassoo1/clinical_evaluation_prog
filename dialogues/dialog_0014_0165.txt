DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege, nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it’s this fever. Keeps comin’ back. It ain’t high high, y'know? But enough to make me feel lousy. Been happenin’ for… oh, let me think… a couple weeks now, on and off. It’s just… annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Annoying is right. A fever that sticks around is… concerning. A couple weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, a couple weeks. Maybe a little longer, to be honest. Hard to keep track when it comes and goes. No other symptoms really, just… tired. And a little achy, but I’m an old man, doc, something’s always achin’ somewhere.
DOCTOR: Right, well, aches are common. But the fever with the tiredness… that’s what I need to figure out. Let’s try to pinpoint this a bit better. When you say “on and off”, can you describe how it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay. It’ll be gone for a day, maybe two. Feelin’ alright, doin’ my usual stuff. Then, outta nowhere, kinda like a warm flush, and I just feel… weak. Not sick, exactly, just… blah. And a little warm. Usually goes away by the next day. It doesn’t happen every day, though. More like every few days. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, it does. So, it's intermittent...coming and going. And you said no other symptoms – no cough, no chills, no sore throat, no… anything else at all?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing else. I eat okay, sleep okay… well, as okay as an old man can sleep, ha! No headaches, no stomach trouble, no… look, I’d know if somethin’ else was wrong, doc. I pay attention to my body. It's just this fever. It’s weird 'cause it ain’t like the flu, it ain’t like a cold. It’s just… this low-grade, annoying heat.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, "annoying" fevers can be the hardest to track down. We need to rule a few things out. Have you travelled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Travelled? Nah, not for a long time. Last time was… oh, maybe five years ago to see my daughter in Florida. Been stayin’ put here since then. Just around town, doc. Grocery store, church… nothin’ fancy. No trips to the jungle or nothin’.
DOCTOR: Okay. And… just to be thorough, any recent changes in your life?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Let me think… My grandson started high school, which is… somethin’. And my wife, Elena, started a new knitting group. That’s about it, doc. Real quiet life, mostly. No new jobs, no new pets… definitely no new wives!
DOCTOR: Good to hear. Alright, well, let’s do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and maybe feel your lymph nodes. Just routine, okay?
PATIENT: Sounds good, doc. Whatever you need to do. I’m a pretty easy patient, I promise. Just get rid of this fever, that's all I ask. It's wearin' me down.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your temperature. 99.1. A little elevated, but not significant. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another… Heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Nope. Not there. Not anywhere. Just… tired. It's kinda like bein' run over by a small car, ya know? Not sick sick, just… worn out.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lymph nodes are… slightly palpable, but not enlarged. Everything seems normal, physically. It's frustrating when things aren't clear-cut. Do you have any known allergies, Mr. Brege?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. Eat anything, drink anything. Elena always says I got a cast iron stomach. Seriously, I haven't had an allergic reaction to anything in my life. I don't take much medication, either. Just a little something for my arthritis when it flares up. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, and what is that medication for your arthritis?
PATIENT: It’s… uh… let me see… Hold on just a sec… ah, here it is. It’s called… naproxen. 500 milligrams. I only take it when I really need it, though. Not every day. Maybe once or twice a week.
DOCTOR: Alright, naproxen. Okay. Look, Mr. Brege, this is a tricky one. Everything seems normal, but you're still feeling unwell. It could be a number of things, even a mild infection that’s not showing up strongly. Given your age and the persistence of the fever, I'm going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. That’ll give us a better picture of what’s going on. We should get the results back in a couple of days. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest and drink fluids. If the fever spikes above 101, or you develop any new symptoms—chills, cough, shortness of breath—go to the emergency room immediately, understand?
PATIENT: Okay, doc. Sounds good. Blood work, got it. I guess that’s what you gotta do. A couple days… alright. And yeah, I understand about the emergency room. I’ll watch for those other symptoms. Honestly, I just want this feelin' to go away. It’s just… drainin’.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll get to the bottom of it. The lab is just down the hall. They'll take care of you. Here's a piece of paper with the instructions. After the lab, schedule a follow-up appointment with me in three to five days to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, doc. Three to five days… alright. Thanks for lookin' at me. Hopefully they find somethin' out. I appreciate you listenin', at least. I’m used to bein’ dismissed as just an old man complainin’.
DOCTOR: You're not just an old man complainin', Mr. Brege. You're a patient who deserves answers, and we'll do our best to find them. Take care, and don't hesitate to call if you feel worse.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, doc. I appreciate that. I will. Bye now.
