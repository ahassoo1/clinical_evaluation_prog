DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, a few weeks back I had some blood work done, and the nurse called and said my cholesterol was a bit high. She said I should come talk to a doctor about it. I don't really understand all that stuff, to be honest. Just figured I better get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, high cholesterol. Right. It's good you're getting it checked. It can be a bit confusing, all those numbers. Do you remember roughly when the blood work was done?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was… around the middle of July, I believe. Maybe the 15th? Something like that. My granddaughter, Elsie, she scheduled it for me. She’s very good with these things. I wasn’t paying too much attention to the exact date, just went when she told me to.
DOCTOR: Okay, July 15th. Yes, I see those results here. Your total cholesterol is elevated… and your LDL, that’s the “bad” cholesterol, is a bit higher than we like to see. Before we get too far, have you ever been told you had high cholesterol before?
PATIENT: No, sir, never. Not a word. I've always been pretty healthy, or so I thought. I used to work outside a lot, you know, supervising the folks at the summer camp. Lots of walking, lots of fresh air. Still do a bit of gardening, though not as much as I used to. This is all a bit of a surprise, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, well, sometimes these things just develop over time. Let's talk a little about your family history, if you don't mind. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – had high cholesterol, heart problems, or a heart attack at a young age?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My mother, she lived to be 92, very healthy woman. Never had a bit of trouble with her heart, as far as I know. My father… he passed when I was quite young, in his fifties. I don’t recall him having any heart problems, but honestly, I was just a boy. I don’t really know much about my grandparents, either. They lived in Sweden, and we didn’t see them often. I don’t think anyone on either side had trouble with their heart, but it’s hard to say for sure. I never really asked.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, Doctor. It's called… Let me see… it’s called Glucosamine with Chondroitin. Been taking it for years, helps with the stiffness in my hands. Other than that, just a multivitamin sometimes, but I haven’t been real good about taking it lately. Elsie keeps telling me I should, but… well, you know. Old habits.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, sir, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I've had all my shots, too, you know, tetanus, flu, everything. Elsie makes sure of that. She's a practical girl, that one. I always tell her she should have been a doctor herself.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett. Before we talk about treatment options, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I haven't had a proper check-up in a while, so anything you want to look at, go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. I’ll also feel your abdomen. Just relax, and breathe normally. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 90. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear some slight crackling in your lungs, which could be due to a number of things. Nothing too concerning at the moment.
PATIENT: Crackling, you say? I haven’t been feeling any shortness of breath or anything like that. Just the usual little cough when the weather changes. I used to smoke a pipe, years ago, but I quit over twenty years ago. Could that be it? I always wondered if that did some damage to my lungs. Elsie told me I was a fool for ever starting, and she was probably right.
DOCTOR: Yes, a previous smoking history can certainly contribute to that. The crackling is mild, and with the lack of shortness of breath, it's not immediately alarming, but we’ll keep it in mind. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Alright. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Everything seems to be within normal limits overall, but we'll want to get some blood work done to get a more complete picture.
PATIENT: Blood work again? Seems like all you doctors do is take blood these days. But if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, I trust you. Elsie always says I’m too trusting, but what else can a man do? She’d probably make a good doctor herself, she’s so practical. Will this blood work be different from the last one? Will it tell you more about this… crackling in my lungs?
DOCTOR: Yes, this blood work will be a bit more comprehensive. The previous test focused primarily on cholesterol levels. This one will include a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection, and we'll also check your kidney and liver function. And yes, we can also order a chest x-ray to get a better look at your lungs and assess the cause of the crackling. It's a precaution, but it's better to be safe. I’m going to write an order for the blood work and the chest x-ray now. The nurse will give you the lab slip, and you can schedule the x-ray at the imaging center across the street. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Across the street, you say? That’s convenient. No, I don’t think so. Elsie usually handles all this for me, but she’s busy with her children today. She’ll be glad to hear it’s right across the street. So, just take the slip to the imaging center, and they’ll… take a picture of my chest? Sounds a bit strange, but if it helps, it helps. And the blood work… will I need to fast for that again? That’s always a bother. Elsie makes me special breakfasts when I have to fast, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for the blood work – no food or drink for at least eight hours beforehand. Water is okay. And yes, the x-ray is just a quick picture of your chest. It doesn't hurt at all. Here's the slip. Once the results are back, we can schedule another appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. We’ll talk about lifestyle changes, and potentially medication to lower your cholesterol. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’m not the best with all this medical stuff, you see. Elsie always says I’m too optimistic for my own good. But I trust you, and I’m glad I came in to get this checked out. Thank you again, Doctor Fazzina. I’ll go schedule the x-ray and get the blood work done as soon as possible. Stop by and let Elsie know about the breakfast part? She worries about me. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. I’m glad I could help. And I will certainly mention the breakfast to Elsie – a good breakfast is always a good thing. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and have a good day.
