DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern, good to meet you. So, you’re here today… tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Right, yeah. Um… sleep, mostly. And… feeling a bit… not bad, exactly. Just… not good. It’s hard to explain. Honestly, I don't really remember what made me book this appointment, but my wife… she would always tell me to get things checked out. She was very… particular. It’s something about not sleeping well, I think? And maybe getting… fitter? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Right. Sleep… and generally not feeling your best. And your wife encouraged this visit. Okay. Let's try to unpack that a bit. "Not good" is… vague. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… ugh. See, that's the problem, isn't it? It's not one thing. It’s like… waking up tired. Even if I’ve slept, like, eight hours. And then… just feeling sluggish all day. Not motivated. I used to be able to… well, I used to do things. Before… everything. It’s not like I’m sick, though. I just… feel old, I guess. Is that a complaint? Should it be?
DOCTOR: "Old" at 29?
PATIENT: Well, it feels old. Look, I don’t mean… physically. I suppose. Though… I’m not exactly built for comfort, am I? Always have been… long and thin. But it’s more… inside. Like a weight. And… things just don’t seem to… spark anymore, you know? I used to enjoy fixing instruments. Now it’s just… work. A job. Doesn’t matter if it’s a beautiful violin or a beat-up guitar – they all just feel the same. Maybe I’m just being dramatic. My wife always said I was prone to that.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, fatigue, lack of motivation, a sense of… diminished enjoyment in activities you used to find rewarding. And this feeling started… when, exactly?
PATIENT: Ugh, when… See, that’s the thing I can’t quite grasp. It wasn’t like a switch flipped. More… a slow fade. Probably… after she… well, after she passed. Everything kind of lost its… color, I suppose. It's been… a year and a half? Maybe two? Time just… blurs. I really don’t keep track anymore. Is that important? I mean, does it matter when it started if it just is now?
DOCTOR: It matters, Mr. Redfern, because understanding the timeline helps us determine the possible causes. Grief can certainly manifest as fatigue and loss of interest, and it can absolutely take time to process. However, those symptoms can also be indicative of other things. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… Not really. I eat. When I remember to. Which isn’t always, but it’s not… intentional. And weight… I haven’t weighed myself in… well, a long time. I used to be quite skinny, even for my height. Still am, I expect. Probably. My clothes fit, at least. Though they’re a bit… baggy. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to that sort of thing. Seems… frivolous. Is that a bad thing to say? My wife...she would always make sure I was eating properly, getting enough vitamins...
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant changes in appetite or weight. Let’s move on to sleep. You mentioned not sleeping well. Can you describe what that looks like?
PATIENT: Describe… ugh. It’s just… restless. I toss and turn. Wake up in the middle of the night. Not because of a nightmare, or anything. Just… awake. Thinking. Or not thinking. Just… there. I used to fall asleep the second my head hit the pillow. Now I just… lie there. Sometimes I get up and wander around. Make a cup of tea. It’s not like I’m counting sheep, or anything. That never worked anyway. And I definitely don't fall asleep quickly when I finally get back into bed. It's just… frustrating. A waste of time, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, restlessness. Do you feel rested when you do wake up in the morning?
PATIENT: Rested? No. Absolutely not. I wake up… tired. And sometimes… achy. Not like a pain, exactly. Just… stiff. Like I haven’t moved properly all night. Which, I suppose, is probably true. I don't usually bother stretching or anything. Seems… pointless. It’s like I haven’t even been asleep. Just… lying there. Existing. Is that a helpful answer? I feel like I'm just rambling now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, I understand this is difficult to articulate. You’re not rambling. We’re trying to get a clear picture here. Now, let's talk about other things. Any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Not really. I mean, nothing major. Sometimes I get headaches, but everyone gets headaches, right? And… I've been a bit forgetful lately, I suppose. Not like I can't remember my name, or anything. Just… little things. Where I put my keys. What I was supposed to pick up at the store. It's probably just age, honestly. Or stress. Though, what stress? I don't really do anything anymore. I just… work. And exist. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm making this worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. Headaches, some forgetfulness. Now, I'm going to ask you some broader questions, just to get a more complete picture. Have you noticed any changes in your mood?
PATIENT: Mood… Well, I'm not exactly jumping for joy, am I? I wouldn't say I'm sad, exactly. Just… flat. Like everything is… muted. It’s hard to explain. I used to get excited about things. New instruments to repair, a challenging project. Now… it’s just… work. It doesn’t matter what it is. It’s all the same. I’m not depressed, or anything. I just… don’t really feel much anymore. Is that a bad thing? My wife… she always said I was too sensitive. Maybe this is just me being normal.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, let’s talk about your wife. You've mentioned her several times. How long has it been since her passing, exactly?
PATIENT: … Eighteen months. It will be nineteen in a few weeks. It… feels like yesterday, and a lifetime ago, all at the same time. I still… see her everywhere, you know? In the garden. In the kitchen. It’s silly, I know. But… she did everything. Everything. And now… it’s just… quiet. Too quiet. I miss… everything about her. It’s hard to explain. I'm sorry. I'm probably just rambling now. It's… difficult to talk about.
DOCTOR: It’s not rambling, Mr. Redfern. It’s understandable. Grief is… complex. Now, I'm going to ask you about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff. Chickenpox, measles… nothing major. I broke my arm once, when I was a kid. And I had a bout of the flu a few years back. But nothing… serious. I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. Until… well, until recently. I don’t really go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to. It’s a waste of time, honestly. My wife… she was always the one who made appointments. She was very… proactive. I can't really remember anything else, to be honest. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant past medical history. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No. Never had any surgeries. I… I’m not a fan of hospitals. Or doctors, for that matter. My wife… she had her wisdom teeth removed, years ago. That was about it. I always avoided them if I could. Too much… fuss. Too much… everything. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m just repeating myself now.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Ugh. That's… complicated. My parents… they both passed away years ago. And I didn't really… keep in touch with a lot of my relatives. My mother… she had some sort of… heart trouble, I think. But I don't really remember the details. And my father… he had diabetes, maybe? I'm not sure. It was a long time ago. Honestly, I don't really know much about my family's medical history. We weren't a very close family. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm just grasping at straws now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited information regarding family history. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never have. My wife… she absolutely loathed smoking. Said it was… barbaric. I wouldn’t dream of it. It's… unpleasant. And unhealthy. I don't really have any bad habits, to be honest. Except maybe… not sleeping enough. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm just going around in circles now.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Alcohol… I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. A nice Cabernet Sauvignon. My wife… she enjoyed a good Pinot Grigio. But not anymore. Not really. It doesn’t… taste the same, you know? It just… feels pointless. I don’t really want to drink, to be honest. It doesn’t… appeal to me anymore. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm just rambling now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited alcohol consumption. And finally, any recreational drug use?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Absolutely not! Good heavens, no. My wife… she would have a fit! I don't even know anyone who uses recreational drugs. The very thought! That's… preposterous. Is that helpful? I feel like this is a rather… inappropriate question.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Redfern, I'm going to ask you about any allergies you may have. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not really. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, to my knowledge. Maybe a little bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s about it. My wife… she was allergic to shellfish, I think. But I’m fine. I don't really have any sensitivities, to be honest. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm just wasting your time now.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… no, nothing at all. I don’t really take pills. My wife… she had some medication for her blood pressure, I think. But I’m fine. I don’t need anything. I prefer to… manage things myself, if I can. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm just going around in circles now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Redfern. Thank you for that information. Now, I'm going to perform a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… physical examination? I suppose so. If you must. I’m not really one for… poking and prodding. Just… be gentle, alright? And quick? I don’t really enjoy being… examined. Is that alright? I just… don't see what good it will do, honestly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Redfern. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then I'll listen to your lungs and abdomen. After that, I’ll take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. It shouldn't take long. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… try not to make a fuss, alright? I don’t really like being touched unexpectedly. My wife… she always knew how to… prepare me. I suppose that’s the difference. Get it over with quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. Just relax. This won’t take long. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear, but breathing seems a bit shallow. Now, I'm going to check your abdomen. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. Abdomen is soft, no masses or tenderness. Ears are clear. Throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Overall, physical exam is unremarkable. However, I do notice you are quite pale and your breathing seems a bit shallow. But nothing acutely concerning.
PATIENT: Pale? I suppose… I haven't really looked at myself lately. And shallow breathing… well, I’ve always been a bit of a… quiet person. Is that bad? My wife… she always said I needed to… relax more. Is this going to require… more tests? I really don’t enjoy this. Is there anything wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, it's not necessarily indicative of something wrong. Your symptoms – the fatigue, sleep disturbances, lack of motivation, and pale appearance – could be related to several things. Given your history, and the grief you’ve experienced, it's important to rule out a few possibilities. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. We'll also check your iron levels. These tests will help us get a clearer picture of your overall health. Would you be willing to get those tests done?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests? I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. But honestly, I don’t really see the point. It’s probably just… me. My wife… she always said I worried too much. Fine. Do whatever you think is best. Just… get it over with quickly, alright? I have… things to do. Or, well, I used to have things to do. Is this going to be expensive?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Redfern. And I’ll make sure the lab orders are submitted to your insurance, so you won't have to worry about the costs upfront. Medicare should cover most of it. The lab is located just down the hall, room 203. They’re open until 5 pm today. You don’t need an appointment. Just tell them Dr. Overgaard sent you. It’ll take about 30 minutes. Once the results are back – usually in a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on getting some rest and eating nutritious foods. And if you’re feeling overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out to friends or family for support. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions? No… not really. I mean, I suppose… what are you looking for, exactly? Are you thinking I’m… sick? Or something? My wife… she always said I was a hypochondriac. Just… tell me if there’s something wrong with me, alright? Don't beat around the bush. And… will this take long? I really don’t have a lot of time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, I’m not thinking you’re sick. I’m simply ruling out potential causes for your symptoms. Fatigue, sleep disturbances, and lack of motivation can be caused by a variety of factors – everything from vitamin deficiencies and thyroid problems to underlying infections or, as you mentioned, grief. The tests will help us determine if there’s anything physically contributing to how you’re feeling. It’s a precautionary measure, nothing more. And regarding how long it will take… the tests themselves are quick. The follow-up appointment will likely be in about a week, once the results are back. We’ll discuss the findings and develop a plan together. Do you have anyone who can drive you home today?
PATIENT: Drive me home? No… I walked here. I live just around the corner. I always walk. My wife… she used to drive, but I prefer walking. It’s good exercise, you know? I’m fine walking. I don’t need a ride. Is there anything else? Can I… go now? I really don’t enjoy being here. And… will this cost me anything? I really don’t have a lot of money.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. No, this visit should be fully covered by Medicare. And the lab tests as well. I’ve already submitted the orders, so you don't need to worry about a bill. You're free to go whenever you're ready. Please try to get some rest today, and remember, if you're feeling overwhelmed, don't hesitate to reach out for support. Here’s a card with my contact information. If you have any questions or concerns before our follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to call. I'll see you in about a week. And please, try to take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you… I suppose. I’ll… try. Just… don’t expect too much.
DOCTOR: .
