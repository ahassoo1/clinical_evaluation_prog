DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I am here because my husband—a very practical man, you understand—insists I have one of these… advance directives, or a POLST form, he called it. He says it's “responsible.” Frankly, I find it a bit morbid to be planning for… well, you know. But he’s been quite insistent, and I thought it best to simply get it over with.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Marija. It can feel a bit unsettling to think about these things, even though it’s a very thoughtful and responsible step, as your husband says. It's really about making sure your wishes are known, should you ever be in a situation where you can’t express them yourself. We can take things at your pace, and I'll explain everything as we go. Before we dive into the specifics of a POLST or advance directive, perhaps we can start with a general check-in?
PATIENT: A general check-in? Is that truly necessary? I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly healthy. A little… tall, perhaps, but otherwise in excellent condition. I simply need the form. My husband made it sound as though it's a rather simple matter. A few signatures, and then we can be done. Are you saying it is not a simple matter?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your perspective, Marija. You’re right, it can be a straightforward process. However, even in excellent health, it's helpful to have a brief conversation to ensure we’re capturing your overall health picture accurately for the form. It helps us understand your values and preferences better. It doesn’t have to be a lengthy exam. Just a few questions about your medical history, any allergies, medications you might be taking, and perhaps a quick review of your systems. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it sounds rather tedious. I haven’t seen a doctor in… well, a very long time. I prefer to avoid unnecessary procedures. But, if it must be done to obtain this form my husband desires… very well. I suppose a “quick review” won’t be the end of the world. But please, do be brief. I have a book club meeting this evening, and I haven't even begun to consider what I will wear.
DOCTOR: I assure you, I’ll be as efficient as possible, Marija. Book club is important! Let’s start with allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none whatsoever. I have a remarkably robust constitution. I can eat anything, take anything… I simply have never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I was “blessed.” Though, I do find cilantro quite unpleasant, but that is a matter of taste, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Marija. A robust constitution is definitely a blessing. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I do not take medications. I believe in a healthy lifestyle. Plenty of water, sensible eating, and a good book. That is my regimen. I have no need for pills or potions.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s very good to hear. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I find this line of questioning rather… intrusive. It feels as though you are implying something is wrong with me. But, very well. As a child, I had the usual illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but I recovered quickly from each one. And… many years ago, I had my tonsils removed. A rather unpleasant experience, I must say. That is all. No other significant medical events.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Marija. It’s simply standard procedure to get a complete picture of your health history, even if you’re currently feeling well. Knowing about past illnesses and surgeries helps us understand your overall health and make informed decisions. So, tonsil removal as a child, and otherwise healthy. That's good to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Are you aware of any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. Now you're delving into matters best left undisturbed. My mother’s side was… complicated. There were whispers of various ailments, but my mother was very discreet. She preferred not to dwell on such unpleasantness. I believe my grandfather had a touch of the… the vapors, but that was a very long time ago, and I doubt it was anything serious. My father's side was… simpler. He was a robust man, a military officer, perfectly healthy. I suppose there might have been a distant aunt who had… indigestion, but again, nothing significant. Truly, Doctor, I can’t offer you much in the way of helpful information. It was not a family given to discussing their… weaknesses.
DOCTOR: I understand, Marija. It's perfectly alright if you don't have a lot of information. We can move on. Finally, let’s talk a little bit about your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor! Are you suggesting I engage in such… depraved behavior? I am a teacher of literature, for heaven's sake! I am a pillar of the community! I have never touched a cigarette, nor do I partake in alcoholic beverages. And as for… recreational drugs… the very idea! I spend my evenings reading, attending book club, and occasionally enjoying a stimulating conversation with my husband. These are my indulgences. I find your questions quite insulting, frankly.
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize, Marija. That was absolutely not my intention to insult you. Those are standard questions we ask all patients to get a complete health profile, and I certainly didn’t mean to imply anything otherwise. I apologize for the insensitive phrasing. So, to clarify – you do not smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs. That's good to know. Now, given your excellent health and activity level, as you've described, it sounds as though you’re in very good shape. Let’s move on to a brief physical exam, just to confirm everything you’ve told me. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But please, make it quick. As I mentioned, I have a book club meeting this evening. And I do need time to choose an appropriate outfit. A simple exam, you say? No lengthy prodding or poking, I trust?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. A very quick exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. If you could just sit back on the examination table, please. Heart sounds are normal, regular rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 120/80 – excellent. Ears appear clear. Throat is clear, no signs of inflammation. Everything sounds and looks very good, Marija. As you said, you appear to be in excellent health.
PATIENT: Well, naturally. I do take pride in my well-being. Now, can we finally proceed with this form? I find this entire process rather… undignified. And I really must hurry. The theme of tonight’s book club is… eighteenth-century novels. I need time to consider my ensemble.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. Let’s get this POLST form completed. It’s a relatively straightforward document. Essentially, it outlines your wishes regarding medical treatment should you become unable to communicate them yourself. We’ll go through it section by section. It covers things like resuscitation preferences, intubation, and artificial nutrition. We can discuss each option, and you can indicate your wishes. Do you have any initial thoughts or questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Resuscitation preferences? Intubation? Artificial nutrition? Doctor, this sounds… rather morbid. Is this truly necessary? My husband seems to think it is, but I find it all rather unpleasant to contemplate. What precisely is intubation? And do I truly need to consider what happens if I require… artificial nutrition? I prefer to eat sensible meals, thank you very much. Perhaps this form is more trouble than it’s worth.
DOCTOR: You’re right to question it, Marija. It is unpleasant to think about, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel overwhelmed. It's not about anticipating anything bad happening. It’s about ensuring your wishes are honored should something unexpected occur. Intubation is a procedure where a tube is inserted into your windpipe to help you breathe if you're unable to do so on your own. As for artificial nutrition, that refers to receiving nutrients through a tube if you’re unable to eat or drink. The form simply allows you to state what you would or would not want in those situations. You can choose to have full treatment, limited treatment, or no treatment. It’s entirely your decision, and you can change it at any time. Perhaps we can start with the first question: Do you want to be resuscitated if your heart stops or you stop breathing?
PATIENT: Resuscitated… Oh, dear. This is dreadful. To even consider such a thing… Very well. If it comes to that, I suppose… I suppose I would prefer… I would prefer not to be resuscitated. The thought of being… poked and prodded… and potentially brought back to life only to be in a diminished state… No, thank you. It’s undignified. Simply… don’t resuscitate. And please, let’s not dwell on the details.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. We’ll mark “Do Not Resuscitate.” That means healthcare professionals will focus on comfort care if your heart stops or you stop breathing. No further intervention. We’ll respect your wishes. Now, the next section covers artificial ventilation and artificial nutrition. Would you want either of those interventions if you were unable to eat or breathe on your own?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. None of it. I have never, and will never, require artificial anything. I maintain a sensible diet, I breathe perfectly well, and I have no intention of being sustained by tubes and machines. It sounds utterly barbaric. Remove those options entirely. Focus on… comfort, as you said. Dignity. That is all that matters.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. “Do Not Initiate Artificial Ventilation” and “Do Not Initiate Artificial Nutrition” are noted. Alright, that completes the major sections of the POLST form. Now, if you would just sign and date here, and I will sign as your physician, it will be legally valid. Do you have any final questions before signing?
PATIENT: There. Done. It’s… unsettling, but I suppose it’s for the best. My husband will be pleased. Though, frankly, I still find the entire process rather… morbid. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must be going. I have an outfit to choose, and a book club meeting to attend. I do hope I haven’t wasted too much of your valuable time.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Marija. You haven’t wasted any time. And it's perfectly understandable to find the process unsettling. You've done a wonderful job articulating your wishes. Here’s a copy of the signed form for your records. I'll also send a copy to your primary care physician. And please, don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or wish to make changes to the form in the future. Enjoy your book club meeting. And thank you for coming in today.
PATIENT: .
