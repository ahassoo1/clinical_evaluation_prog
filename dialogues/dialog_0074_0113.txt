DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Reisig, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s this… this going to the bathroom thing. I keep having to go. More than I used to, anyway. It's a nuisance, really. A real nuisance. I can’t rightly say when it started, just… gradually, I suppose. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive. And you’re right, it can sometimes be a part of getting older, but it's important to figure out why it's happening. You mentioned it started gradually – has the amount of urine you pass with each visit changed, or is it just the frequency that’s different?
PATIENT: Amount? Oh, goodness. I don’t pay much attention to that, Doctor. Honestly. I just know I'm going more often. Maybe… maybe a little less each time? It’s hard to say. My wife, bless her heart, she’s the one who keeps track of these things. I just… feel the urge. And then I go. It’s not like I’m overflowing or anything, just… frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, more frequent trips, perhaps slightly smaller amounts each time. And no sense of being unable to fully empty your bladder?
PATIENT: Empty? Hmm. Now that you mention it… sometimes it feels like there's a little left. Not a lot, mind you. Just… a lingering feeling. It’s not painful, just… incomplete. Like a glass that hasn't been fully drained, you know? Though I can't say for sure if that's always the case.
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a better picture. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – things like burning when you urinate, cloudy or foul-smelling urine, or any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: Burning? No, no burning. Thank goodness for that. Cloudy… well, I don’t really look at it, Doctor. That’s my wife’s department again. And pain… not really. My back always aches a bit, but that’s just old age and working the farm for all these years. It’s just a general soreness, not anything specific to… down there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, boy. That’s a long story. Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was a rough one. And I broke my arm falling off the barn roof a few years back. And… well, the usual aches and pains that come with living a long life. High blood pressure, the doctor told me once, but I take a pill for that. Can't recall the name of it now. My wife handles all the medications.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendectomy in your youth, a broken arm, and high blood pressure managed with medication. Do you know approximately when you were diagnosed with the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, the year? Now you’re asking something. Must have been… oh, ten, maybe fifteen years ago? It was after my oldest grandson was born, I think. My wife will know for sure. She’s got a chart for everything. I just remember starting the pills and feeling a little better.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Segretto, we can always verify with your records. And what about any surgeries besides your appendix?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Hmm. Oh! Yes, I had my knee replaced. That was… oh, about eight years ago, I reckon. A real painful recovery, that was. But it's good as new now, mostly. Gets a bit stiff in the cold weather, but nothing to complain about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendectomy, knee replacement, and high blood pressure. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. My wife gave me some bee sting cream once when I got stung in the garden, but that wasn’t an allergy, just a little swelling. I’m pretty hardy, you see. Ukrainian stock, good bones.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… there’s that pill for my blood pressure, of course. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it’s acting up. A little white pill, I think. And… my wife gives me a multivitamin every morning. Keeps me healthy, she says.
DOCTOR: Okay. To help me get a clearer picture, would you mind if I take a quick look at your electronic health record?
PATIENT: Oh, go right ahead, Doctor. I’m terrible with remembering all that stuff. My wife keeps everything organized, thankfully. I trust her judgment completely. Whatever’s in there is probably more accurate than anything I could tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Segretto, the record confirms you’re taking Lisinopril for high blood pressure and occasionally Ibuprofen for your arthritis. It also shows you had a rash reaction to penicillin a long time ago, in 1982. Is that still accurate?
PATIENT: Penicillin… Oh, yes! That’s right. I remember that. Broke out in a terrible rash. My whole body itched! I’ve steered clear of that stuff ever since. Good thing I told the doctor, back then. Smart move, that was.
DOCTOR: Good. It's important to keep that allergy documented. Now, just a couple more questions, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam if you’re comfortable with that. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not me. Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life. My father was a bit of a drinker, and I saw enough of that growing up. And smoking? Absolutely not. Bad for the lungs, you know. And recreational drugs… well, I’m a farmer, Doctor! I’ve got enough to deal with just keeping the crops growing.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh, now that’s a question. Let me see… Well, they’re… regular enough. I go every day, mostly. Not a problem there. Sometimes a little hard, especially when it’s hot, but nothing to complain about.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, would you mind if I listened to your heart and lungs, and did a quick abdominal exam?
PATIENT: Go right ahead, Doctor. I don’t mind at all. Just try not to poke too hard, my belly's a bit sensitive from all the farm work, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto, your heart and lungs sound good. Your abdomen is soft, but I did notice a little tenderness when I pressed on your lower abdomen, right above your bladder. Is that something you’ve noticed before?
PATIENT: Oh, you did, did you? Hmm. Now that you mention it… yes, sometimes I feel a little discomfort there. Not pain, exactly, just a little ache. I figured it was just my muscles, from all the lifting and bending. I haven’t paid it much attention.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of an enlarged prostate, also known as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. It’s very common in men your age. The frequent urination, the feeling of incomplete emptying, and the mild tenderness in your lower abdomen could all be related. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities, like a urinary tract infection, so I’d like to order a urine test and a simple blood test to check your kidney function. I also recommend a Prostate-Specific Antigen, or PSA, test. That will help us determine if further investigation is needed. What do you think?
PATIENT: Tests, you say? Hmm. Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, I trust your judgment. I’m not one for poking and prodding if it can be avoided, but I understand you need to figure out what’s going on. My wife will be happy to hear you're getting to the bottom of it. An enlarged… what did you call it? A prostate thing? Is that serious?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking, Mr. Segretto. BPH itself isn’t cancer, and it's very common as men age. It means your prostate gland has gotten larger, which can press on your bladder and cause the symptoms we’ve discussed. Many men manage it with medication or lifestyle changes. However, it’s important to rule out other causes of your symptoms, and the PSA test can help us with that. The urine test will check for infection, and the blood test will ensure your kidneys are functioning properly. We'll discuss the results as soon as they come in and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. That sounds… reasonable. Infection and kidneys, you say? Best to check those things, I suppose. And you’ll tell me what the results mean, right? I don’t understand all that medical talk. My wife can come with me when we talk about it, if that's okay. She's good with this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. I will explain everything clearly, and your wife is more than welcome to join us. I'll order the tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will give you the requisition forms. You can go whenever you're ready. After the tests, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results, usually within a week. In the meantime, try to drink a moderate amount of fluids – not too much, not too little – and avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Moderate fluids… no caffeine… Alright, I can manage that. My wife will remind me, I’m sure. Hmm… let me see. No, I think that covers it. You explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. And thank you for not dismissing me as just an old man with a weak bladder. Well, I suppose I'll go get these tests done then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Segretto. It was my pleasure. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before our follow-up appointment. The nurse will be happy to help too.
