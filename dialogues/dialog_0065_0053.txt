DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, really. But I’ve been having trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s getting harder to… you know, start going. It takes a while, and sometimes it doesn’t feel like I can go all the way.
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty initiating urination and a sense of incomplete emptying. That is something we should investigate. Let’s start with a little more detail. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started, I’d say, maybe… three months ago? At first it wasn’t too bad, just a little extra push needed. But in the last month or so, it's gotten noticeably worse. It’s not painful, thankfully, just… frustrating. And a little worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Frustrating and worrying are understandable. Three months, with worsening symptoms over the last month… alright. And is there any change in the stream itself?
PATIENT: A change in the stream… hmm. Let me think. Yes, actually. It's not as… strong as it used to be. It sort of starts and stops, you know? Not a constant flow like it was before. It's… weaker. And it takes me a bit longer to finish, even when I can go. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Yadao. Intermittent stream, reduced force… These are all important details. Have you noticed any urgency – a sudden, strong need to go?
PATIENT: Urgency… not really. I don’t feel like I have to rush, thankfully. It’s not like that at all. It’s just… getting it started is the hard part. And sometimes, even after I think I’m done, I feel like there’s still a little bit left. It’s a strange feeling. I’ve been trying to drink less water, thinking maybe that would help, but it doesn’t seem to be making a difference.
DOCTOR: Drinking less water isn't usually the answer. In fact, it can sometimes make things worse. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower back pain along with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my back feels alright. No pain there at all. I do sometimes get a little bit of… discomfort, down low, but it's not really pain, you know? More like a… pressure. It comes and goes. I just thought it was… old age catching up with me! But this bathroom issue is getting me concerned. It's just not normal for me.
DOCTOR: "Pressure" is a useful descriptor. Okay. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any changes in its color or smell?
PATIENT: No blood, thankfully. The color seems normal enough, I think. It's hard to say, really, I don’t spend a lot of time looking at it, if you know what I mean! And the smell… I haven't noticed anything different. Honestly, Doctor, I’m just relieved it’s not painful. That's what worries me the most, usually. But this… this is just irritating. And embarrassing. I used to have such a strong bladder, I could go for hours! Now… it's a different story.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Yadao. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, let's go over some medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think… I have high blood pressure, I’ve had it for years, but it's well controlled with medication. I take a small dose of lisinopril every day. And… I had a hysterectomy many years ago, back in… oh, goodness, must be forty years now. Apart from that, not much. I'm generally a healthy person, I eat my vegetables and try to get some exercise, but I’m not as active as I used to be. And, of course, the high blood pressure. I see Dr. Jankauskas for that, he’s a good doctor. He’s the one who told me to come see you about this. He thought it might be connected.
DOCTOR: Hysterectomy forty years ago, and well-controlled hypertension managed with lisinopril. That’s good information. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Never had a reaction to anything. Not to penicillin, not to bee stings, nothing at all. My mother always said I had a strong constitution! I do get a bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s it. Just a little sneezing and a runny nose. Nothing serious. I can take Benadryl for that if it gets bad. But no true allergies, no. And I haven’t changed any of my medications recently, just the lisinopril, same dose for years.
DOCTOR: No allergies, stable medication. Alright. And before we move on, could you tell me about any family history of urinary problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. My mother… she had a weak bladder when she got older. She had to go to the bathroom very often, even at night. She never went to the doctor about it, just… dealt with it. And my brother… he had some prostate trouble when he got older, needed surgery for it. But I don't know much about the details. Apart from that, not really. No one else in the family that I can recall had any problems with… going to the bathroom. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Yadao. A family history of bladder weakness and your brother's prostate issues… good to know. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I'd like to do a pelvic exam to check the strength of your pelvic floor muscles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A pelvic exam… well, it's been a long time since I've had one of those. But if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes, alright. If you think it will help figure out what's going on, then go ahead. It’s a bit… embarrassing, but I want to get this sorted out. Just… be gentle, please? And tell me what you're doing as you go along, if you don't mind. I get a little anxious with these things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Yadao. I completely understand your anxiety, and I will explain everything as I go. We'll take things at your pace, and I will be as gentle as possible. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. First, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This helps me check for any abnormalities. Please lie back comfortably on the table. Then we'll move on to the pelvic exam. I'll be checking the external structures first, and then gently examining your pelvic floor muscles. We’re assessing strength and looking for any areas of tenderness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. Listening to my tummy first is good. Just… tell me what you're listening for, if you don’t mind. I always worry about what they’re looking for when they use that thing. It's silly, I know, but… old habits. I always like to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Yadao. It's not silly at all to want to know what’s going on. I'm listening for any unusual sounds – things like bruits, which can indicate blood flow issues, or any bowel sounds that might suggest a digestive problem. Mostly, I'm just checking to make sure everything sounds normal. Okay, everything sounds good so far. No unusual sounds. Now, I’m going to ask you to take a few deep breaths, and I will palpate your abdomen. This just means I will gently press on your tummy to check for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if you feel any pain when I do this.
PATIENT: Alright. Deep breaths… And pressing on my tummy… that's okay. No pain there, just feels… normal. A little bit of pressure, maybe, but nothing uncomfortable. It’s just like when Dr. Jankauskas checks my blood pressure, really. I’ve had plenty of those over the years. He always has cold hands, though. Your hands are nice and warm, Doctor. That’s a relief!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about my hands, Ms. Yadao. Dr. Jankauskas’ cold hands are a common complaint, I've heard! Alright, everything feels normal so far with the abdominal exam. Now, I'm going to prepare for the pelvic exam. I need you to remove your undergarments, and I'll provide a drape for you to cover yourself. I'll explain each step as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you're uncomfortable. Remember, this is all confidential, and we're just trying to figure out what's going on.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. The pelvic exam… Just… take it slow, please? And tell me everything you’re doing. It's been so long since I’ve had one of these, I’m a little nervous. And a drape would be good, yes. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. It makes me feel a bit better.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Yadao. I completely understand your nervousness. We'll take as much time as you need. I'm going to start by visually examining the external structures. I’m looking for any signs of irritation or abnormalities. Then, I will use a speculum – it’s a smooth, plastic instrument – to gently open the vaginal canal so I can examine the cervix. This may cause some mild pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. After that, I will do a bimanual exam, where I use two fingers to gently feel your uterus and ovaries for any tenderness or masses. Before I start, do you have any questions at all?
PATIENT: A speculum… yes. I remember those. It's the opening part, isn't it? Will it be cold? That was always the worst part. And the feeling… it's a little uncomfortable, isn't it? Will you tell me when you’re about to put it in? Just so I know. And… and what are you looking for exactly? Are you checking for… something bad? I'm probably being silly, but I always worry about these things.
DOCTOR: You’re not being silly at all, Ms. Yadao. It's perfectly normal to be anxious about these things. Yes, the speculum can feel a little cold, but I use a lubricant to make it more comfortable, and I warm it up before using it. I will definitely tell you before I put it in, and I will go slowly. As for what I’m looking for, I’m checking the cervix for any signs of inflammation, infection, or abnormal cells. I’m also checking the size and shape of your uterus and ovaries. It’s a routine exam, and most of the time, everything is perfectly normal. But it’s important to rule out any potential problems. Before we proceed, are you comfortable with me continuing?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes. Go ahead. Just… tell me what you’re doing as you go along, please. And if it feels uncomfortable, I’ll tell you. I promise. Just… take it slow. And be gentle. I’m ready, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Yadao. I’m going to start by visually examining the external structures now. Just a quick look to make sure everything looks normal. I'm just observing the skin and checking for any irritation or abnormalities. Everything looks good so far externally. Now, I’m going to use the speculum. I’ve warmed it up and have plenty of lubricant. I’ll let you know exactly when I’m inserting it. It may feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Remember, you can tell me to stop at any time. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes. Ready. Just… be quick, if you can. And tell me when it's over.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. I’m going to insert the speculum now. Just a little pressure… You may feel a slight coolness as it goes in. Okay, almost there… Just a few more seconds… Alright, I’m in position now. I’m just going to take a quick look at your cervix. It may feel a little different, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just a quick glance… Okay, everything looks good so far. The cervix appears healthy, and there’s no sign of any inflammation or infection. Now, I’m going to gently remove the speculum. Just a moment…
PATIENT: Just… hurry, please. It feels… strange. And cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Yadao, almost there… Just a few more seconds… Alright, all done. The speculum is out now. I know that can be uncomfortable, and you did great. Now, I’m going to perform a bimanual exam. I’ll gently insert two fingers into your vagina to feel your uterus and ovaries. This will help me assess their size, shape, and position. It may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Okay. Done with that. Yes, alright. Go ahead with the… the fingers. Just… be gentle, please. And tell me what you’re feeling for. I'm ready, I think. Just… be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Yadao. I’m going to insert two fingers now. Just a little pressure… You may feel some pressure as I gently feel your uterus and ovaries. I’m feeling for any tenderness, masses, or abnormalities. Okay, almost there… Just a few more seconds… Alright, I’m in position now. I’m just going to gently feel your uterus… everything feels normal so far. Now, I’m going to feel your right ovary… Okay, everything feels normal on both sides. Your uterus and ovaries feel normal in size and shape. There’s no tenderness or masses. Everything feels good. I’m going to gently remove my fingers now. Just a moment…
PATIENT: Okay. That… that wasn’t too bad. Just… a little uncomfortable. How does everything feel? Are you sure everything is okay? Is there anything wrong? You're not finding anything?
DOCTOR: Everything feels completely normal, Ms. Yadao. Your uterus and ovaries feel normal in size, shape, and position. I didn't find any tenderness or masses. That's very good news. Based on the physical exam, everything appears to be within normal limits. However, to rule out any potential underlying causes of your symptoms, I would like to order a urine analysis and a blood test to check your kidney function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… good. Very good. I’m so relieved to hear that. So, it’s probably just… old age? A urine test and blood test… yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I’d rather be safe than sorry. What do I need to do? Do I need to fast for the blood test? And where do I go for the tests?
DOCTOR: It's certainly possible that your symptoms are related to age-related changes, Ms. Yadao. However, we want to rule out other potential causes, such as a urinary tract infection or kidney problems. For the blood test, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water. We'll draw the blood right here in the office. And for the urine test, you can just provide a sample when you come in. We'll give you a cup and instructions. Here’s a lab requisition form. It has all the details. You can schedule an appointment with the lab at your convenience. The number is on the form. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. Fasting for the blood test… I can do that. And a urine sample… easy enough. So, just schedule an appointment with the lab, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up with you. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me and explain everything. I feel a bit better knowing it’s probably not something serious. Is there anything else I need to do? Or anything I should be looking out for in the meantime?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. In the meantime, continue to drink plenty of water, even if it means going to the bathroom more often. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. If you notice any fever, chills, pain in your lower back, or blood in your urine, please contact me immediately. Otherwise, just focus on staying hydrated and comfortable. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Duplichan. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I’ll schedule the tests tomorrow. And I’ll be sure to call if anything changes. Have a good day! .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Yadao. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day as well. .
