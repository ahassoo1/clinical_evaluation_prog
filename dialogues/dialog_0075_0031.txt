DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, my left leg is quite swollen, and… I have a bit of a heart problem, they told me it’s called atrial… something. It’s been acting up, I think that’s related.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, thank you for letting me know. Swelling in one leg and some concerns with your heart – we’ll definitely look into both of those. Let’s start with the leg. When did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… three days ago? It wasn't much at first, just a little bigger than usual. But it's gotten worse each day, especially this morning. It feels… tight, almost.
DOCTOR: Alright, three days ago, gradually worsening, and feeling tight. Is the swelling just in your calf, or does it extend higher up or down your leg?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my calf, I think. And a little bit around my ankle. Not so much higher up, though. I haven’t noticed it going up towards my knee, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. And is there any pain associated with the swelling?
PATIENT: Not really pain, exactly. More… uncomfortable. Like a heavy ache, if I stand for too long. It’s not sharp or anything. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy ache with prolonged standing. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the touch in that calf, or any changes in the skin's texture?
PATIENT: Let me feel… No, it doesn't feel warmer than the other leg. And the skin looks… normal, I think. Maybe a little bit shiny, but that might just be from… well, I don’t know. It seems alright.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any recent injuries to that leg – a twist, a bump, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing that I can remember. I haven’t done anything to hurt it. I've been mostly at home, working on my computer. It just… appeared, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no injury. Now, you mentioned your heart condition – atrial… something. Do you know what your doctor called it exactly, and are you currently taking any medications for it?
PATIENT: It's… atrial fibrillation, I think? That’s what the papers said. And yes, I take… let me see… Oh, here. I take these twice a day. They’re… Rivaroxaban, the label says.
DOCTOR: Okay, Rivaroxaban twice a day for atrial fibrillation. Good. And have you been taking it as prescribed?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. I try to take them at the same time every day, with my breakfast. Sometimes I forget if I've already taken them, but I’m pretty good about it, I think. It's a bit hard to keep track sometimes, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the leg swelling and the atrial fibrillation, have you experienced any other symptoms recently – shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, fatigue, anything at all that seems unusual?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I have been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But I also haven’t been sleeping very well. It's hard to say if it's from the heart or just… life. No chest pain or dizziness, though. And I can breathe alright, I think. It doesn't feel any harder than normal.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Can you sit up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. It’s a bit higher than my chair at home.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I’m going to start by checking your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a look at your leg. Please try to relax and breathe normally. I'm listening to your heart now... and your lungs... I'm feeling both legs now to check for any differences. I’m measuring the circumference of your calves. The unaffected leg is 38 centimeters. The swollen leg is… 42 centimeters. There is mild tenderness to the touch, but no significant warmth. Okay. The swelling is quite noticeable, and there is a four-centimeter difference in circumference between your legs. Your heart rate is a little fast, but that could be related to the swelling or just anxiety. No significant findings in your lungs.
PATIENT: Okay… four centimeters, that sounds like a lot. Is that… bad? I’m a bit worried now. What does this mean, Doctor? Is it my heart?
DOCTOR: It's good you're expressing your concerns, Nixon. A four-centimeter difference is significant, and we need to investigate it further. It could be related to your atrial fibrillation, but it's also important to rule out other possibilities. One concern would be a blood clot in the leg, also known as deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. It’s important to take this seriously as clots can travel to the lungs. Another possibility could be something called lymphedema, or an issue with the veins in the leg. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a D-dimer blood test, which can help rule out a blood clot. I also recommend an ultrasound of your leg to visualize the veins and rule out any blockages. Do you have any known allergies that I should be aware of before ordering these tests?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything… not that I remember, anyway. A blood clot… that sounds scary. Will I… need to go to the hospital? Is it serious right now?
DOCTOR: It is serious, Nixon, which is why we're taking these steps. The risk of a blood clot traveling to your lungs is the main concern. However, the tests will help us determine the extent of the problem and guide the appropriate treatment. We're not necessarily rushing to the hospital right now, but depending on the results of the D-dimer, an ultrasound, and a review of your symptoms, further investigation – potentially including a CT scan of your chest – might be necessary. Let's start with the blood test and ultrasound. I'll write the orders now. I’ll also want to review your medical records a bit more closely. Do you mind if I take a look at those?
PATIENT: No, that's fine. You can look at my records. I just… I hope it’s not too serious. And I hope it’s not my heart causing all this. I get so worried about it. How long will the tests take? Will I have to stay here for a long time?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Nixon. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious in this situation. We'll do everything we can to get you answers quickly. The D-dimer blood test should only take a few minutes. We can draw it right here in the clinic. The ultrasound will take a bit longer, perhaps 30-45 minutes. We'll schedule that for you as soon as possible, either today or tomorrow, depending on availability. I'll also ask the nurse to check your vital signs again – your heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels – just to be sure everything is stable. While we're waiting for the results, I want you to avoid prolonged standing or sitting and try to keep your leg elevated. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. I can do that. Elevate it… and no standing for too long. I think I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I was getting very scared.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. That’s what I’m here for. I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood now, and we’ll get the process started. I’ll also have her schedule your ultrasound. Once the results are available, we’ll discuss them in detail and create a plan of action. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or worsening leg pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Chest pain, shortness of breath, or worse leg pain – go to the emergency room. I’ll remember that. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel a bit better knowing what's happening now.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’m glad to hear that. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns at any time. .
PATIENT: .
