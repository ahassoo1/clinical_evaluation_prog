DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Kammer, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is me. Early Kammer. And… is everything alright, Doctor? You look like you’re… studying something very important. Not that I’m questioning your work, of course. Just…observing.
DOCTOR: It’s just… your file is a bit sparse. But nevermind that. Let's get down to business. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's… a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I just… I wanted a card. A “Get Well” card. Or… encouragement. Something nice. My niece, she always sends cards, you see. Very thoughtful girl. And… well, I thought if the Doctor sent one, it would… mean something. You know? Not feeling my best lately. A little down. Not sick, exactly. Just… low.
DOCTOR: A…card?
PATIENT: Yes, a card. Like you give someone who is… unwell. Or sad. It’s a small thing, I know. But it would lift my spirits. My ex-wife… she never sent cards. Never anything thoughtful like that. So, I thought, a Doctor… a Doctor is someone important. And a kind word from a professional… well, it carries weight, you understand? It's a bit… different than a card from a relative, yes?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, this is a medical clinic. We address medical concerns. I am a physician, not a… card-giver. Are you experiencing any actual symptoms that are concerning you?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well… I feel… tired. And… not as sharp as I used to be. My memory isn’t what it was. But who doesn't forget things at my age? It's… normal. But I thought maybe a little… boost. A kind gesture. Is it so wrong to want a little encouragement, Doctor? It's not like I'm asking for medicine or anything complicated. Just a small card. A small act of… kindness.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, you are presenting with vague complaints of fatigue and memory issues. While I understand you'd like a card, those symptoms warrant a bit more investigation. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Sleep? Well, I sleep alright. Not like a baby, of course. Too much on my mind. And appetite… I eat. Not as much as I used to, maybe. But I’m not losing weight, if that’s what you’re thinking. I still enjoy my… pastelillos. Very good pastelillos down at the bakery. But… are you saying I’m… sick? I don't feel sick. Just… down. Low energy. Is there a test for being… low energy? Maybe that’s what I need a card for. To feel… boosted.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, fatigue and changes in appetite can be indicative of underlying medical conditions. It’s not simply a matter of being “low energy”. We need to rule out other possibilities. Let’s start with a basic physical exam. And then I’ll order some blood work. We’ll see what that tells us. Please, sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Relax? With all this… poking and prodding? I don’t like doctors. Never have. My father… he always said doctors just want to find something wrong so they can charge you more money. But… alright. If you insist. But I still think a card would have been… quicker. And more… uplifting. But… blood work it is. Just… be gentle, please. And try not to poke too much.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Kammer, I am not trying to "poke too much." This is standard procedure. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Can you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: My blood pressure? Is that… bad? Is it high? My ex-wife… she had high blood pressure. Very stressful woman, she was. Always yelling. Makes your blood pressure go up, you know? And you want a good blood pressure. It’s… important. Here. But… gently, please. I bruise easily. Especially when I’m… stressed. And this is… stressing me out, a little.
DOCTOR: 140 over 90. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. It can fluctuate. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply, please. Any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. No chest pain. Though… sometimes I get a little… indigestion. From the pastelillos, maybe. Very rich filling. Shortness of breath… not really. Unless I’m climbing stairs. Which I don’t do much of anymore. Too much effort. Just… checking. But… everything feels… normal. As normal as it ever does. You’re sure this isn’t just… because I’m a little down? Maybe a nice conversation would have been enough.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, your lungs sound clear. Heart rate is regular. However, your age and these symptoms… we need to rule out more serious possibilities. Let's move on to a neurological exam. I'm going to test your reflexes now. Just relax your arm.
PATIENT: Ouch! That was… unnecessary! My knee! Are you trying to break my leg? I always said doctors… they don’t care about your comfort. Just… poking and prodding. And now… hitting. Is this how you treat everyone, Doctor? A little encouragement would have been… far more effective. And less painful.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard reflex test, Mr. Kammer. And your reflexes are… diminished. That, combined with your fatigue and memory issues, suggests… well, it suggests we need to investigate further. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. And I’m scheduling you for a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. And frankly, Mr. Kammer, I’m not going to discuss cards any further. We are here to address your health.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Very well. If you have any questions, you can call the office. Have a… day. .
