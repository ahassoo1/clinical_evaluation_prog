DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Schneer, so tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello doctor. It's… well, it's my ears, I think. Things haven't been quite as clear as they used to be. Not sure when it started, exactly. Seems like a long time now. Everything's a bit muffled, you know? Like talkin' underwater, maybe?
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing, you say. And you’re not certain when it began... that’s alright, a lot of patients have trouble pinpointing these things. Just “a long time now,” hmm?
PATIENT: Yes, a long time. I used to work in a shoe factory, a real noisy place it was. Lots of clatterin’ and bangin’ all day long. Maybe that had somethin’ to do with it? I don't rightly recall. My memory ain’t what it once was, you see.
DOCTOR: A shoe factory… yes, that could certainly contribute. Prolonged exposure to loud noises is a common cause of hearing loss. We’ll need to explore that further. Now, besides the muffling, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes I get a bit of a ringin’ in my ears, especially when it's quiet. Not all the time, mind you. And… sometimes it feels like pressure, like somethin's stuffed in there. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain, really.
DOCTOR: Ringing, or tinnitus, and a feeling of fullness…yes, that's helpful. When did you first notice the ringing?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now you’re askin’ somethin’ tricky! I truly can’t say. It comes and goes, it does. Probably around the same time as the mufflin’, I reckon. Maybe a few months after I retired, but honestly, it's all a bit blurry now. Time just slips away, doesn't it? I just know I’m havin’ trouble hearin’ folks talk. My granddaughter tries to be patient, bless her heart, but… it’s frustrating for both of us.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll try to piece things together. Have you ever had your hearing tested before, Mrs. Schneer?
PATIENT: A hearin’ test? Oh, I don't think so. Not that I recall, anyway. Back in my day, we didn’t bother with much of that. If you couldn't hear, you just got closer! I suppose times have changed. I don’t remember the doctor ever mentionin' one, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like a hearing test is definitely in order. It's a simple procedure and will give us a good baseline to work from. Before we do that, let’s quickly go through some other things. Any dizziness or balance problems?
PATIENT: Dizziness… no, not really. I get a little unsteady sometimes, but that’s just my age, I think. My knees aren’t what they used to be, and I’m careful walkin’ on uneven ground. But no spinning or anything like that. Balance is…okay. I haven’t fallen or nothin’, thankfully. I’m lucky so far, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about any pain in or around your ears?
PATIENT: No pain, doctor. Not a bit. Just… quiet. Too quiet, sometimes. It’s more of a… missin' sound, than an ache or somethin’. I can feel things vibratin’ sometimes, but it’s hard to make out the words. Does that make any sense? I’m afraid I’m not very good at explainin’ these things.
DOCTOR: You're explaining perfectly well, Mrs. Schneer. No pain, just muffled hearing and a feeling of fullness. Alright. I’m going to take a quick look in your ears now, if that’s alright with you. It’ll just be a brief examination.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, go right ahead, doctor. I don’t mind at all. Just be gentle, if you would. My ears are a bit… sensitive, you know. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright… hmm. There appears to be some cerumen – earwax – present in both ears. It’s not excessive, but it could be contributing to the muffled hearing. The ear canals themselves appear normal. Tympanic membranes… appear intact, but slightly dull. No obvious signs of infection or inflammation at this time. Alright, Mrs. Schneer. That wasn’t too bad, was it?
PATIENT: No, not at all, doctor. Just a bit ticklish, that’s all. So, earwax, you say? Is that bad? Can you just… take it out? My granddaughter mentioned somethin’ about gettin’ your ears cleaned… is that what you mean? I’m always forgettin’ what people tell me, you see.
DOCTOR: Well, earwax is a natural substance, and usually, it protects the ear. But sometimes it can build up and cause hearing problems. It's quite common, especially as we get older. And yes, we can certainly remove it. There are a few ways to do that. We can try irrigation—gently flushing it out with water—or I can manually remove it with special instruments. Given your age, and just to be cautious, I think manual removal would be best. It gives me a better view of the ear canal. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, manual removal… sounds a bit scary, but if you think it’s best, doctor, I trust your judgment. As long as it’ll help me hear better, I’m willin’ to try anything. Just… be gentle, please. My ears are very sensitive, you see. And… will it hurt? I don’t like pain, doctor. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Schneer. I assure you, it shouldn’t hurt. It might feel a little strange, a bit of pressure perhaps, but it's generally very well tolerated. I'll take my time and be as gentle as possible. I'll let you know every step of the way. First, I'm going to use a light to get a better view…
PATIENT: Alright… if you say so, doctor. I trust you. Just… tell me what you’re doin’, okay? Keep talkin’ to me. It makes me feel better when I know what’s happenin’. My granddaughter says I get anxious when I don’t know somethin’… Here we go, then…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Schneer, I'm just gently loosening the wax now. It's a bit compacted, but nothing too concerning. You might feel a slight pressure… just tell me if anything feels uncomfortable, okay?
PATIENT: Oh… that is a bit strange. Feels… ticklish, and a little cold. Is that normal, doctor? My ear feels… full, even fuller than before. Are you almost done? It's makin’ me a bit nervous, this is.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly normal, Mrs. Schneer. The irrigation fluid is a bit cooler, and loosening the wax can cause that sensation of fullness. I'm making good progress now. Just a little bit more… you're doing wonderfully, just relax. See, there we go… I'm getting quite a bit out now. It looks like this ear was significantly blocked. Now, the other ear… this one seems a little less impacted. We’ll just clean it out as well, just to be sure.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s better… a little better. It feels… emptier, somehow. I can feel a little bit of a difference, I think. It’s still muffled, but not quite as much. Are you done now, doctor? I’m gettin’ a bit tired, I think. All this fussin’… an old woman shouldn’t have to go through all this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Schneer, I'm all finished now. That wasn’t too bad, was it?
PATIENT: No, not too bad. A bit uncomfortable, maybe, but you were very gentle, doctor. It feels… lighter, certainly. I still can’t hear very well, but… maybe a tiny bit better? It’s hard to tell. What happens now? Are we done? Will I be able to hear my granddaughter better now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Schneer. I’m glad it wasn't too unpleasant. Now, to assess how much improvement we’ve made, I’d like to perform a quick hearing test. It's a simple test where you'll just indicate when you hear tones in your ears. It'll give us a baseline reading, and we can compare it to a more comprehensive test later if needed. It’s important to establish a starting point. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Another test? Oh dear… Well, if you think it’s necessary, doctor, I suppose so. Anything to help me hear better. But please, make it quick, okay? My ears are a bit tired now. And… explain everything you’re doin’, please. I don’t like surprises. What am I supposed to do?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Schneer. I'll explain everything as we go. It's very simple. I'm going to put headphones on you, and you'll hear a series of tones at different pitches and volumes. When you hear a tone, just press this button. It doesn’t matter how faint it is, just press the button when you detect anything at all. We’ll test each ear separately, and it should only take a few minutes. Sound good?
PATIENT: A few minutes, you say? Alright… as long as it’s not too loud. And you'll explain everything? I'm a bit worried I won't do it right. My memory isn’t what it once was, you know. Alright then… let’s get it over with. Just be gentle with the headphones, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Schneer, just relax and try to focus. I'm going to start with your right ear. You’ll hear a series of beeps, and just press this button whenever you hear one, no matter how faint. It’s okay if you miss some. I just want to see what you can hear. It won’t be painful, I promise. Okay, here we go…
PATIENT: Beep… I think I heard something. Was that right? It was very faint, almost like a whisper. Is that what I’m supposed to do? I'm afraid I'm doing it wrong.
DOCTOR: That was perfect, Mrs. Schneer! You did exactly right. Don't worry about missing any, just press the button when you think you hear something. It’s okay if it’s a faint whisper. Okay, here's another one… and another… That’s good, very good. Alright, now let’s move on to the left ear.
PATIENT: Oh dear, this is tiring. And I don’t think I’m hearing much on this side. I missed a lot of those beeps, didn’t I? Maybe my ears are just too old to be fixed. Is there any point in continuing?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Schneer, we’ve gathered enough information for now. The results confirm what I suspected. You have moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. It's not uncommon at your age, and it's likely a combination of age-related changes and previous noise exposure. The good news is, there are options available to help you. The best course of action is a hearing aid evaluation with an audiologist. They can assess your hearing in more detail and determine if you would benefit from hearing aids. They’ll also be able to properly fit and program them for your specific needs.
PATIENT: Hearing aids? Oh dear… those things don’t work very well, do they? My cousin had a pair, and she said they just made everything sound tinny and weird. And they’re so expensive, aren’t they? I don’t have a lot of money, doctor. I don’t know… I don’t think I want hearing aids. Is there anything else I can do? Maybe just… louder telephones?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Schneer, technology has improved drastically. The hearing aids of today are nothing like the ones your cousin used. They are very sophisticated and can be programmed to provide clear, natural sound. While they do involve an investment, they can significantly improve your quality of life. Loud telephones are a temporary solution, but they won't address the underlying problem. Frankly, refusing to consider hearing aids because of outdated perceptions is… short-sighted. I strongly recommend a consultation with an audiologist. I can provide you with a referral to a reputable clinic. They’ll discuss your options and help you determine if hearing aids are right for you. It's the most effective solution, and frankly, the only one worth considering.
PATIENT: Oh dear… I just… it all seems so complicated. I’m an old woman, doctor. I don’t understand all that fancy technology. And I don’t want to spend a lot of money on something that might not even work. Maybe… maybe I’ll just have to learn to live with it. I just want to hear my granddaughter, that’s all. And I don’t know how much longer I’ll have with her…
DOCTOR: Mrs. Schneer, I understand your hesitation, but you’re underestimating yourself. The audiologist will explain everything in simple terms and guide you through the process. And as for the cost, there are financing options available. Look, I’m not suggesting you rush into anything, but dismissing hearing aids entirely is… unrealistic. I’ll provide you with the referral information. Just schedule a consultation and get their opinion. It’s a simple step, and it could make a world of difference. Now, let's get this referral written up for you. It's just a precaution, of course. Here you go. The clinic is located…
PATIENT: Alright… thank you, doctor. I suppose it can’t hurt to just… talk to them. But I don’t know… I just have a bad feeling about this. It all seems so… overwhelming. Thank you for your time, doctor. I think… I think I’m ready to go home now. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Schneer. If you change your mind, you know how to reach the clinic. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. Have a good day.
