DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It's... something about my legs, really. They just feel… weak. It started a few days ago, after I had a really nasty cold. Not a pleasant experience, I assure you. It’s rather inconvenient, to be frank.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weakness in your legs, and it began after a cold. Inconvenient is certainly a good way to put it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not just a bit more, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s both legs, and it feels like trying to walk through thick mud. Like they just… won’t go. I’m usually quite active, you know? I lead tours – walking tours, mostly – so this is really slowing me down. And honestly, it's a little embarrassing. I had to practically drag myself out of bed this morning. I don’t usually complain, but… it’s noticeable.
DOCTOR: I see. Both legs affected, a sensation of walking through mud, and impacting your usual activity level significantly, even making it difficult to get out of bed. That certainly sounds concerning, Ms. Firestone. And it’s good you’re bringing it to my attention. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about the cold you had?
PATIENT: Oh, it was thorough, Doctor. The full spectrum, really. Started with the sniffles, then a proper sore throat, coughing… the works. Fever for a good two days, I’d say. Nothing I couldn't handle, mind you - I rarely bother with doctors for something simple like a cold. Just typical over-the-counter stuff, lots of fluids, rested as much as possible. It should have cleared up completely, but then these legs started acting up. It's the weakness that's the worry, not the sniffles, naturally.
DOCTOR: Right, a complete cold with fever, treated with over-the-counter remedies and rest. And the weakness developed after the cold symptoms subsided. Thank you for clarifying. Now, Ms. Firestone, could you describe the weakness in more detail?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I can't move them, Doctor. I can walk, but it takes… effort. Like I said, walking through mud. And they feel… heavy, almost. It's worse when I first stand up. Takes a few seconds for them to ‘wake up’, if you know what I mean. And I notice it more when I've been sitting for a while. It's not a sharp pain, just… fatigue. An odd fatigue. I’ve tried a few stretches, but it doesn't really help much. Honestly, it’s rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s not a complete inability to move your legs, but increased effort with a sensation of heaviness, worse after sitting, and a brief period of difficulty when first standing. No sharp pain, just fatigue. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms associated with this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No tingling or numbness. No shooting pains, like I said. My back feels alright, though I did feel a little stiff after I dragged myself out of bed this morning – probably from… well, from dragging myself out of bed. No fever now, thankfully. I haven't felt dizzy or anything like that. My hands are fine, everything seems to be working normally… except for these legs, of course. I suppose I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, but that could just be from the cold. Really, it’s mostly just the legs.
DOCTOR: Alright, no tingling, numbness, or shooting pains. Back stiffness is likely related to the difficulty getting out of bed. No fever currently, and hands are functioning normally. Increased fatigue is a possibility related to recovery from the cold. Ms. Firestone, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I’m Medicare eligible, as you can see. I generally keep in good health. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago, but that was a one-time thing and I recovered perfectly. No diabetes, no heart problems, no arthritis, thankfully. I was divorced a few years back, and frankly, the stress of that was probably worse for my health than anything else. Otherwise, I'm remarkably… resilient. I don’t particularly like doctors, so I avoid them when I can.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Firestone. No major medical problems besides gallbladder removal fifteen years ago and a history of stress related to divorce. That's good to know. And I appreciate you letting me know you generally prefer to avoid medical visits. Do you have any family history of significant medical conditions, such as neurological problems, muscle weakness, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. My mother… she had arthritis in her hands when she was older, but that was just old age, really. My father was a strong man, always active. He died of a heart attack, unfortunately, but that was sudden. As far as I know, there wasn't any history of… neurological problems or muscle weakness in either family. No autoimmune diseases that I’m aware of. We weren’t a family that discussed these things openly, if that makes sense. It's not like we kept secrets, exactly… it was just not something we talked about.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Firestone. A history of arthritis in your mother, heart attack in your father, and no known history of neurological problems or autoimmune diseases in the family. Thank you for sharing that information. Now, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, very little. I take a multivitamin every morning, that's it. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I'll take ibuprofen. But that’s it. I really try to avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself, you see? I don't believe in loading up on pills for every little ache and pain. It’s just not my style. I used to take something for my blood pressure a few years ago, but it was making me feel dizzy, so I stopped.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Firestone. Just a multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed, and previously tried medication for blood pressure that caused dizziness. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam to assess your strength and reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, fine. Just get on with it, Doctor. Honestly, all these questions are rather tiresome. I'm perfectly capable of walking, as you can see. But if it will get me out of here faster… yes, go ahead. But please, don't make me do anything… strenuous. I’m not particularly fond of being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Firestone. I’ll keep it as brief and comfortable as possible. First, let's check your reflexes. Please sit comfortably. I’m going to lightly tap on a few points on your knees and ankles. Your reflexes are… normal and symmetrical bilaterally. Now, could you please try to push against my hands with both legs?
PATIENT: There. Is that what you wanted? Honestly, it feels a bit silly. As you can see, I can push. It’s just… heavier than usual. And I tire a bit quicker, I suppose. Don't get me wrong, I’m not completely useless. It’s just… not what it usually is. Now, can we please move on? I have a tour scheduled for tomorrow, and I need to rest.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Your strength is present bilaterally, but I do note some fatigue with sustained effort, as you pointed out. There is some mild resistance, requiring more effort than expected. I'm not detecting any significant tenderness or swelling. And now, if you could walk a few steps for me, please. I'm observing your gait. Your gait appears slightly wide-based, and your pace is a little hesitant. Based on this preliminary examination, and considering your history of a recent cold, I suspect this may be related to post-viral fatigue or, possibly, a mild neuropathy. However, to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order some blood work. It will include a Complete Blood Count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, vitamin B12 levels, and a thyroid panel. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Neuropathy? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds… alarming. And blood work? Honestly, I really dislike needles. But… if you think it's necessary, I suppose. A wide-based gait? Is that… bad? I just try to be careful, you see? I don’t want to fall. Fine. Do the blood work. But please, just be quick about it. And don't tell me it's going to be painful. I have a very low tolerance for discomfort.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Firestone. Neuropathy simply means there may be some mild irritation of the nerves, and it's often treatable. The blood work will help us determine if there are any underlying vitamin deficiencies or other imbalances that could be contributing to your symptoms. The blood draw will be quick, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. It will be a brief pinch, and then it’s over. I will also order a Vitamin D level, as deficiency can cause fatigue and muscle weakness. While we await the results, I recommend continuing to rest, staying well-hydrated, and avoiding any strenuous activity. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience any new symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, or difficulty with balance, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Vitamin D, you say? Honestly, I spend plenty of time outdoors. I lead tours, remember? But… fine. Do the test. And I suppose I can rest. It’s not ideal, given my schedule, but I’ll try. No numbness, no tingling, thankfully. I just want to feel normal again. And… honestly, Doctor? How long will this take? I really don't want to be stuck here all day. And will the results be… alarming? Please be honest with me. I don’t appreciate being kept in the dark.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, Ms. Firestone. The blood work should take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete, and the results typically take 2-3 business days to return. I want to assure you that it is unlikely the results will be “alarming.” However, it’s essential to rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. If there are any abnormalities, we will discuss them thoroughly and develop an appropriate treatment plan. In the meantime, I'm going to document my findings and provide you with a summary of our conversation and the ordered blood work. I will also include some general information about post-viral fatigue and recommendations for self-care. Do you have any preferences regarding how you’d like to receive this information – email or paper copy?
PATIENT: Email, please. It’s quicker. Honestly, I don’t have time for paper copies. And… make sure it’s clear. I don’t want to have to decipher medical jargon. Simple language, Doctor. Please. Just… the basics. What I should be looking for, what I should do, and when I should worry. That’s all. Now, can we please finish this? I have a tour to plan, you know. And I need to rest.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Firestone. I’ve documented everything in simple terms. As you can see, I’ve included a summary of your symptoms, my examination findings, and the ordered blood work. It also outlines recommendations for rest, hydration, and monitoring for worsening symptoms. This is your copy. My email address is also included on the summary should you have any questions once you review it. I’ll also send you a copy electronically. I believe that concludes our consultation today. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. And I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Firestone. Get some rest, and I hope to hear from you soon. .
