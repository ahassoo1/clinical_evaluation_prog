DOCTOR: "Bula vinaka, Mr. Alcorta! I'm Dr. Kimm. It's lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's… my eyesight. It’s been going. Not suddenly, you understand. It's a gradual thing, but it’s gotten to the point where it's… inconvenient. I pride myself on being a sharp man, and this is simply… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: “Okay, I understand. It’s definitely frustrating when your body doesn’t quite cooperate with what you need it to do, especially something like your vision. 'Inconvenient' is a good way to put it. So, this has been a gradual change… about how long would you say it’s been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Perhaps six months, maybe longer? It’s difficult to say precisely. I hadn’t paid it much mind at first. Just assumed it was the lighting in the office, or fatigue. A man has responsibilities, Doctor. One doesn’t have time to catalogue every minor… imperfection. But it’s progressed. Now I find myself needing things… closer. And brighter. It’s rather a nuisance, truthfully.
DOCTOR: “Six months, okay. And it sounds like it's impacting your daily life now, needing things closer and brighter. That's good that you’re getting it checked out. Do you notice it’s worse at certain times of day, or in certain conditions?
PATIENT: Well, naturally it’s worse when there isn’t sufficient illumination. One can hardly expect to see well in the dark, Doctor. But beyond that… not particularly. It’s just… a dulling, a softening of the edges. It's not like a sudden blur, if that makes sense. More… everything lacks definition. And I’ve noticed, particularly when reading reports… the text seems to swim a bit. A very minor thing, of course, but quite irritating. I’ve always had excellent reading comprehension, and now… I find myself rereading sections. It's simply… not efficient.
DOCTOR: “Okay, that’s helpful. So it’s not a sudden change, but a gradual loss of clarity and sharpness, particularly with reading and in low light. And you’ve noticed some slight swimming or difficulty with the text. Alright. Have you noticed any other changes with your vision?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… there’s a sort of… haze, occasionally. Like looking through a slightly dirty window. It comes and goes. And… this may sound foolish, but sometimes my peripheral vision feels… muted. Not gone, you understand, just… less distinct. I wouldn’t have brought it up otherwise, honestly. It's probably nothing. A trick of the light, or perhaps just fatigue. I do spend rather long hours at my desk.
DOCTOR: “No, that’s not foolish at all. Actually, those are important details to mention – the haze and the muted peripheral vision. It's good you remembered those. So, to recap, you've got gradual loss of sharpness, difficulty reading, haze, and some muted peripheral vision, all over the last six months. Have you had any other medical problems recently, or anything going on with your overall health?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I try to avoid doctors when possible. I haven't had a proper check-up in… well, a long time. But, to answer your question… my blood pressure has been a bit elevated lately. Mrs. Henderson, the receptionist at the office, insisted I take a reading at the pharmacy. She’s a rather… insistent woman. Said I looked “peaky.” Nonsense, of course. But I did notice the reading was a bit higher than usual. Beyond that… just the usual aches and pains of getting older. Nothing significant. And I've always been… rather particular about my diet. I maintain a healthy lifestyle.
DOCTOR: “Okay, so elevated blood pressure recently, and you otherwise consider yourself healthy and maintain a good lifestyle. That’s good to know. And you haven't been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I assure you. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything. I’m a remarkably robust man, despite what Mrs. Henderson might say. I simply came to you because of this… this irritating issue with my eyesight. I expect a practical solution, if possible. I have reports to review, and frankly, I haven’t the time for… extensive investigations. A new pair of spectacles, perhaps? Or some sort of… ocular supplement? Something efficient.
DOCTOR: “I understand your frustration and desire for a quick solution, Mr. Alcorta, and I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. We can certainly discuss glasses and supplements, but to give you the best advice, I do need to perform a basic eye exam first. It’s important to rule out any underlying causes. It won’t be extensive, just a quick check of your vision, some basic tests, and I’ll look at the health of your eyes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But I must insist it be brief. I have a rather full schedule. And I trust you’ll explain everything in plain language. I have no interest in… technical jargon. Efficiency, Doctor. That’s what I’m looking for. Let's get this done.
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, Mr. Alcorta. Efficiency is my goal as well. I will explain everything clearly and concisely. Let’s start with your distance vision. Could you please stand about 20 feet away from the chart and read the smallest line you can see?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must confess, I already suspect my vision isn't what it once was. Let's see… E… F… P… T… Oh, this is rather small. V… N… Q… I believe that's as far as I can manage. It's… indistinct. As I suspected.
DOCTOR: “Okay, thank you. That’s helpful. Your distance vision is approximately 20/30 in both eyes. That means at 30 feet, you can see what someone with normal vision can see at 20 feet. Now, let’s check your near vision. Could you hold this card about 14 inches from your face and read the smallest line you can comfortably see?
PATIENT: Hmm… let's see. The top line is… fairly clear. The second line… somewhat blurry. And the bottom line… barely discernible. It's quite small, Doctor. And… swimming, as I mentioned earlier. It's… irritating. Approximately… one line down, I suppose. This is hardly satisfactory.
DOCTOR: “Okay, thank you. Your near vision is approximately 20/40. Now, I’m going to shine a light into your eyes to check your pupils and the health of your retinas. It won’t be uncomfortable, but it might be a little bright. Could you please look straight ahead?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But please, be swift. I have reports awaiting my attention. And do try to avoid excessive illumination. My eyes are rather sensitive, you know. Proceed.
DOCTOR: “Of course, Mr. Alcorta. I’ll be as quick as possible. Okay… I'm seeing a little bit of lens clouding in both eyes, which is common with age – what we call cataracts. The optic nerves look healthy, but there's some mild drusen – tiny deposits – in the macula of both eyes. These are also common with age, and often don't cause any problems, but we’ll want to keep an eye on them. Your pupils react normally. “Overall, your eyes appear to be in reasonable condition for your age, but the cataracts and drusen are contributing to your vision changes. The mild swimming you’re experiencing could also be related to the lens clouding. ”
PATIENT: Cataracts and… drusen? Are those… serious? And what does this all mean, precisely? I hadn’t anticipated requiring such… detailed explanations. I simply wanted a solution to my deteriorating eyesight, Doctor. Not a lecture on the ravages of time. Will spectacles suffice? Or are we discussing… more invasive procedures? I trust you can provide a practical assessment, and avoid unnecessary… medical terminology.
DOCTOR: “I understand your frustration, Mr. Alcorta, and I apologize if I’ve used too much medical jargon. Let me explain in plain terms. Cataracts are a clouding of the natural lens in your eye, which happens naturally with age. They’re very common, and thankfully, they’re treatable with surgery. The drusen are small deposits in the macula, which is the central part of your retina. They’re also common with age, and in your case, they aren't causing any significant problems right now, but we need to monitor them. “Regarding your vision changes, spectacles will help improve your vision, and I recommend we start with those. However, they won’t address the underlying cataracts. They’ll simply help you see more clearly with the vision you currently have. We can discuss cataract surgery if your vision continues to decline despite wearing glasses, or if they become significantly impacting your daily life. It’s a relatively safe and effective procedure, but it’s a decision we can make together down the line. For now, let’s get you fitted for some glasses and see how that works.”
PATIENT: Very well. Spectacles, then. Let us begin with those. However, I must insist on a… discreet frame. Something befitting a man of my stature and… professional standing. No gaudy colors, Doctor. And the lenses must be of the highest quality. I have reports to review, you understand. Clarity is paramount. And do ensure the prescription is precise. I will not tolerate substandard workmanship. Proceed.
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, Mr. Alcorta. Discretion and quality are my priorities as well. We have a wide selection of frames, and I’m happy to help you find something that suits your style and professional standing. We’ll also use the highest quality lenses and ensure a precise prescription. "I have an optician on staff who is excellent at what she does. She can take detailed measurements and help you choose the best options. Would you like to meet with her now?
PATIENT: Very well. Let us proceed with this… optician. But I must insist she be… efficient. I have a rather full schedule, you understand. And do ensure she understands my requirements: discreet frames, highest quality lenses, precise prescription. No unnecessary delays. Proceed.
DOCTOR: “Of course, Mr. Alcorta. Sarah, could you please escort Mr. Alcorta to the optical bay and have Optician Miller assist him?
PATIENT: Let us proceed. I haven’t the entire day, you understand.
