DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I seem to be… going to the bathroom quite a lot. More than usual, you see. It’s been happening for… oh, goodness, I can’t quite recall how long. A few weeks, perhaps? It's just… frequent.
DOCTOR: Frequent, you say. Alright. And when you say frequent… can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Numbers are never my strong suit. Let me think… well, normally, I’d go… perhaps three times a day? Four, on a… busier day. But now… it feels like every hour or two. It’s… disruptive, to be frank. And it's not just during the day, either. It's happening at night, as well.
DOCTOR: Every hour or two, even at night. Right. And is it… a full bladder each time, or just a little bit?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. It feels like a full bladder most of the time, but… sometimes it's just a small amount. It’s not a consistent thing, you see. It’s… variable. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not entirely sure why I’m even here. It just felt… necessary to mention it.
DOCTOR: Necessary is a strong word. Look, Mr. Verbos, many things can cause frequent urination. It could be anything from drinking too much fluid, to a simple urinary tract infection. Let's not jump to conclusions. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not exactly pain. But there's… a slight discomfort, sometimes. A bit of a stinging sensation, perhaps? It’s fleeting, though. It doesn’t last long. And it’s not with every instance, you see. Just… occasionally. It’s very… subtle. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Subtle is rarely helpful, Mr. Verbos. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color… no, I don’t believe so. It seems… normal enough. Perhaps a little lighter than usual, now that you mention it. But I haven’t paid particularly close attention, to be honest. And smell… no, I haven’t noticed anything unusual. I don't… actively smell my urine, Doctor. I hope that doesn’t sound impolite.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't sound polite, but it’s irrelevant. Let’s move on. Any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I haven’t felt feverish. Chills, no. Lower abdominal pain… occasionally, a slight ache, perhaps? But nothing significant. It comes and goes, and it's not… debilitating, you see. It's just… a vague discomfort. Like a muscle ache, maybe? Is that… relevant, Doctor? I'm not sure I'm being very helpful.
DOCTOR: Helpful would be providing clear answers, Mr. Verbos. Alright. Do you have any difficulty starting a stream of urine?
PATIENT: Difficulty… starting? Oh. Well, sometimes it takes a moment. Not a long moment, you see, but… there's a slight hesitation. A little… delay, perhaps? It's not a forceful stream at first, if that makes sense. It… eases in. It doesn't hurt, it's just… not immediate. Is that… typical? Is that what you were asking?
DOCTOR: Typical is subjective, Mr. Verbos. Let's skip over the minutiae. Do you have a history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes… Oh, goodness. My mother had something… a sugar problem, I believe. But I’ve never been… diagnosed myself. I had a check-up a few years ago, and they didn’t mention anything. I don’t… eat a lot of sweets, you see. Does that answer your question, Doctor? My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Let's see what your records say. Ah. Here we are. You had a blood glucose check last year. Slightly elevated, but within the pre-diabetic range. And… no follow-up. Typical. Now, do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Pre-diabetic… oh. I… don’t recall being told that. Medications… let me see. Just a small dose of something for my… blood pressure. A very small dose. Nothing else. I try to avoid medications whenever possible, you see. Is that… important, Doctor? I’m not sure I remembered everything correctly.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, 10mg daily. Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… oh dear. I… I don't believe so. I’ve never had any serious reactions to medications, you see. A slight rash once, perhaps, many years ago, but nothing significant. Nothing that required a trip to the hospital. Does that… help, Doctor? I apologize for being so vague. My memory… it's not what it once was.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. Let's do a quick examination. We'll check your abdomen and perform a brief neurological assessment. It's unlikely to reveal anything definitive, but it's necessary to rule out more serious issues. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh. An examination? Very well. I do hope it won’t be too… invasive, Doctor. I’m not a fan of medical procedures, you see. I suppose it’s necessary, though, if you think it’s best. Shall I… close my eyes? Or…?
DOCTOR: Just relax. I’m just checking for any tenderness or masses. Take deep breaths. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh. That’s… a little uncomfortable, yes. Not painful, exactly, but… a slight ache. Just a dull ache, you see. It’s… not a new sensation, though. I’ve felt it on and off for a while. Is that… normal, Doctor? Perhaps it's just my… digestion?
DOCTOR: Digestion is rarely this consistent. And it’s certainly not reassuring given your symptoms. Bowel sounds are present, though slightly diminished. Now, let's check your reflexes… Extend your leg, please.
PATIENT: Oh. That tickles. Is that… normal, Doctor? It felt a little… weak, perhaps? I don’t have a lot of… strength in my legs, you see. I try to stay active, but… it’s not as easy as it used to be. Is everything alright, Doctor? I'm starting to get a little anxious.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are present, but diminished bilaterally. Mildly concerning, but not necessarily indicative of a serious problem. Alright, Mr. Verbos. Based on your symptoms and the preliminary examination, I suspect a combination of factors may be at play. You have some risk factors for diabetes, your neurological assessment is slightly diminished, and your urinary symptoms are… persistent. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a urinalysis, and a prostate-specific antigen test. We need to rule out infection, kidney problems, and assess your blood sugar levels.
PATIENT: Oh dear. So many tests… Are those… serious tests, Doctor? Will they be… painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a… a garden party next week, you see, and I’d really hate to miss it. I apologize for being so… bothersome. I just… I get anxious about these things.
DOCTOR: They are standard tests, Mr. Verbos. Not painful, just a little inconvenient. Blood draw and a urine sample. The results will take approximately three to five business days. In the meantime, I recommend you limit your fluid intake, especially caffeinated beverages, and avoid sugary drinks. And try to relax. Worrying won't change the outcome. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are back to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds… acceptable, Doctor. Limiting fluids… and avoiding sugar… I can do that. A treatment plan… does that mean… something is seriously wrong, Doctor? I hope it’s not too serious. I really do appreciate your time, Doctor. And your… patience. I’m not the easiest patient, I imagine. .
DOCTOR: We’ll know more once we have the results, Mr. Verbos. Let's not jump to conclusions. The nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment and provide you with the lab requisitions. Have a good day. .
