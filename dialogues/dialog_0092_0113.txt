DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, good morning to you too, Doctor. Giganti, you say? A fine name. Well, it’s this… this waterworks situation. Been going on for a bit now. Just… going too often, if you catch my drift. It's a nuisance, really. A man shouldn't have to think about this all the time, you know? Especially at my age.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I understand. Frequent urination can be quite disruptive, and you're right, it shouldn't be something you have to constantly worry about. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this “waterworks situation”?
PATIENT: Well, how much detail do you need? It’s… frequent. Like I said. More than a normal man should be going, I reckon. Day and night. Though, mostly during the day. I try not to drink too much water, mind you. Don't want to make it worse. But even then… it's just… there. And it’s not painful, exactly. Just… insistent. Does that make sense? I'm not one for describing these things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Segretto. Thank you for sharing that. It's helpful to know it's not painful, but more of an insistent urge. When did you first start noticing this increased frequency?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a tricky question. Everything’s a bit of a blur these days, you know? Let me think… Probably… a few months ago? Maybe longer? It started gradually, I suppose. Didn't pay much attention at first. Just figured it was part of getting older. But it hasn't let up, so I thought I better get it checked. My wife, bless her heart, kept nagging me about it too. Women… always noticing everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's easy for things to come on gradually, and it's good you're addressing it now. And wives are often very good at encouraging us to take care of ourselves. To get a better picture, could you estimate roughly how often you’re urinating during the day?
PATIENT: Hmm… let’s see… before, you know, a normal man goes… maybe four or five times a day? Something like that. Now? It feels like every couple of hours. Maybe six, seven times? Possibly more. I really haven’t been keeping a precise count. It’s just… frequent. A nuisance, really. I'm a busy man, I have things to do! Not spend all day in the little boy's room.
DOCTOR: Alright, six to seven times a day is certainly a change. And I appreciate you sharing that despite not keeping a precise count. Do you ever experience any urgency – a sudden, strong need to go right now?
PATIENT: Urgency… yes, I suppose. Sometimes it comes on quite suddenly. You’re having a perfectly good thought, and then… there it is. A bit embarrassing, if I'm honest. Makes it difficult to get things done. Especially when I'm out in the garden. Have to abandon whatever I'm doing and rush back to the house. Not ideal, not ideal at all. It’s not constant, mind you, but it happens often enough to be a bother.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds quite disruptive to your daily routine. Do you notice any difference in urination at night?
PATIENT: Ah, the nighttime… that’s… not the best part, I’ll tell you that. I wake up… a couple of times, maybe three. Have to get up and go. Used to sleep right through the night, you know? Like a log. Now… it’s interrupted. Doesn’t keep me from sleeping completely, but it's not restful. And getting up in the dark… not good for an old man with dodgy knees. Makes it harder to get back to sleep too.
DOCTOR: I see. Waking up multiple times at night to urinate is certainly concerning. Have you noticed any changes in the stream of urine itself?
PATIENT: Stream? What do you mean, stream? Is it… is it supposed to be a certain way? I just go, you know? Never really paid attention to how it comes out. Is something wrong with it? My wife hasn't mentioned anything... She'd tell me if something was amiss, I reckon. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not one for examining… that part of my anatomy. It’s just… water, going out. That’s all I know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Segretto. I understand your discomfort. I just needed to ask. Let’s move on then. Have you experienced any pain or burning sensation when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not at all. Like I said earlier, it’s not painful. It’s just… frequent. And a bit of a nuisance, really. Sometimes it feels a little weak, maybe? Like it doesn't come out with much force. But no burning, no stinging. Nothing like that. Honestly, Doctor, if it hurt, I’d be here sooner. It’s the constant trips that bother me most.
DOCTOR: I understand. A weak stream can sometimes be associated with this. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that you’re aware of, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or any problems with your kidneys?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical history… Well, my wife handles most of that. She’s very organized, bless her heart. I think I had high blood pressure at one point, years ago. Took some pills for it, but I stopped taking them after a while. Didn't seem to be doing much good, and I didn't like the side effects. As for diabetes… no, I don’t think so. I enjoy my sweets, mind you, but my wife keeps me in check. Kidneys… never had any trouble with my kidneys, as far as I know. She’d have told me, though, if there was anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure is good to know. We’ll want to verify that and check your current blood pressure today. And we’ll also want to rule out any kidney problems. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Now, I had my appendix out when I was a boy, of course. That was a long time ago. And… oh, yes! I had a hernia operation, maybe ten years ago? Something like that. It was quite painful, I remember. But I recovered well. Apart from those two… no, I don’t think I’ve had any other surgeries. Nothing major, anyway. I've always been a pretty healthy man, despite my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix and hernia repair. We'll document those. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my father, he had a weak heart. Passed away when he was in his seventies. My mother… she lived a long life, thankfully, but she had arthritis, very bad arthritis. My sister, she had some sort of… trouble with her nerves, I think. But apart from that… not really. We weren't a particularly sickly family. Mostly strong, hard-working folk. Lots of farmers, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, heart problems in your father, arthritis in your mother, and nerve issues in your sister. Good to know. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I take this fish oil, for my joints. My wife swears by it. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take some ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind. Apart from that… no, not really. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I don't like the way they make me feel.
DOCTOR: Alright, fish oil and ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any problems with allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything, take anything, without any trouble. I’m a pretty simple man, you know? Don’t ask for much.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, Mr. Segretto, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I’d like to gently examine your abdomen. And then I'll do a brief digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A… a digital… what now? Look, Doctor, I appreciate you wanting to be thorough, but… is that really necessary? I mean, I’m not that bad. Just a bit of a frequent urge, that’s all. I'm an old man, and I'm not keen on poking around… down there. Is there any other way?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Segretto. I wouldn't recommend it if it weren’t important. A digital rectal exam allows me to assess the size and texture of your prostate, which can sometimes be enlarged and contribute to urinary symptoms like frequent urination. It’s a quick exam, and it will help me determine if further investigation is needed. It’s a standard part of the evaluation for men with these symptoms. We can certainly discuss alternatives, but they may involve more extensive and potentially more invasive tests. If you’d prefer, we can start with just the blood pressure, heart and lungs, and then discuss the options further. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Well… if it’s really necessary, I suppose. But I’m not happy about it, Doctor. Not happy at all. And you promise it's quick? And gentle? My wife will be furious if I come home with… discomfort.
DOCTOR: I promise it will be as quick and gentle as possible, Mr. Segretto. I'll explain everything as I go, and you can let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. I understand your apprehension, and I'll do my best to make it a comfortable experience. Let’s start with your blood pressure, and then we’ll proceed from there. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. It's not the most pleasant thing to discuss, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to inflate this cuff on your arm. It will feel tight for a few seconds. Your blood pressure is 148 over 86. That's slightly elevated. I'll make a note of that. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, if you could just lean forward a bit... I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. This will help me check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: A little… just a little. Not sharp, mind you, more of a dull ache. Right about… there. Could be nothing, I suppose. I get a bit of indigestion sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. I do feel a slight tenderness there as well. Now, as we discussed, to get a more complete picture, I'd like to perform a digital rectal exam. I’ll explain everything as I go. Would you prefer to change into a gown for privacy, or is it alright to proceed as is?
PATIENT: No... no gown. Just... just get it over with quickly, please. The less fuss, the better. I've lived a long life, Doctor, I’m not one for modesty. Just… be gentle. And quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Segretto. I understand. I'm going to ask you to bend over the examination table, if that’s alright. I’ll apply a lubricant to the gloved finger and gently insert it into your rectum. It may feel a bit of pressure or discomfort, but it shouldn't be painful. If you feel any pain, please let me know immediately. I'm going to insert the finger now… just relax your muscles as much as possible. Alright, I'm finished. I'll remove the glove and wash my hands. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, and there is some mild tenderness. It’s not significantly concerning at this point, but it does explain some of your symptoms.
PATIENT: Enlarged, you say? Just what I needed. And tenderness? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? Should I be worried? My wife will have a field day with this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Segretto, let’s not jump to conclusions. An enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, is very common in men your age. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. The tenderness could simply be due to the enlargement and inflammation. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a urine analysis to check for any infection or blood. Second, a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, blood test to screen for prostate cancer. And finally, I’d like to get a kidney function test to make sure everything is working properly. These tests will give us a better picture of what's going on and help us determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… always tests. Fine, fine. Do what you have to do, Doctor. But the less poking and prodding, the better. And please, no surprises. I’m an old man, I don’t need any more stress. Just tell me what’s wrong, and let’s get it fixed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I understand. We’ll take it one step at a time, and I’ll explain everything clearly as we go. I'll write you a lab requisition for the urine analysis, PSA, and kidney function tests. You can go to [Name of local lab] - they're located at [Address of local lab]. They're open [Lab hours]. Once we have the results back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. The results typically take a few days to come back. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of water, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and trying to urinate when you feel the urge. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers it. Just… drinking water and avoiding things. Sounds simple enough, I suppose. And [Name of local lab], you say? I’ll have my wife take me. She’s better at these things. Thank you, Doctor. Despite… everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Segretto. I understand it wasn’t the most pleasant visit, but I appreciate you coming in to get things checked out. If you experience any fever, chills, or inability to urinate, please go to the emergency room immediately. Here's the lab requisition and a summary of the instructions we discussed. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Segretto, and please give my regards to your wife.
