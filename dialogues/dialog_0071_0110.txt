DOCTOR: Good morning, Nicoletta. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Galena. It’s very nice to meet you. Well, I suppose you could say I'm hoping for a bit of a fresh start. I'm eighty-seven years young, and while I don't feel terribly unwell, things just aren't quite as…peppy as they used to be. I'd like a little jumpstart to my health, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Eighty-seven, that’s wonderful! A fresh start is always a good idea. And I certainly understand. “Peppy” is a good way to put it. Let's see…I just pulled up your chart. It says you’re 87 and…199 centimeters tall?
PATIENT: Oh, that chart! Yes, well, that’s a bit of an exaggeration, Doctor. I’m rather tall, I suppose, for a woman, but not that tall! I believe it’s closer to 163 centimeters, if that makes any difference. I always have trouble with those numbers. My daughter helped me fill it out, and I suspect she got a little carried away.
DOCTOR: Ah, that’s good to know! Daughters… always looking out for us, even if it means a little embellishment. 163 centimeters is much more reasonable. Okay, so we've got the height sorted. And your weight is listed as 149 pounds, is that accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right, Doctor. I try to keep an eye on it, you know? Not too much, not too little. It fluctuates a bit, of course, but 149 is usually pretty close to the mark. It’s good to be… mindful, I think is the word. I used to weigh less, but then again, that was a long time ago!
DOCTOR: Mindful is excellent. Very good. Now, you said you're hoping for a "jumpstart" to your health. Can you tell me a little more about what's been going on?
PATIENT: Well, it's not one specific thing, Doctor. It’s just… a general feeling of being a bit slow, I suppose. I used to be very active, gardening mostly, and walking with friends. Now, I find I get tired more easily. And little things… remembering names, sometimes. Nothing terrible, mind you, just… frustrating. I still live on my own, you see, and I want to keep living on my own. I don't want to become a burden to my children.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Nicoletta. It’s admirable that you’re so independent and proactive. Feeling a bit slower, getting tired more easily… and some memory issues. Those are all things we can look at. Let’s start with the tiredness. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been very gradual, Doctor. Over the last… perhaps a year, maybe a little longer. Not a sudden thing at all. It wasn't like I woke up one morning and felt terribly exhausted. Just… slowly, little by little, I found myself needing more rest after doing things. And I don’t sleep as soundly as I used to, either. I wake up a few times during the night. It’s not uncomfortable, just… not the deep, restful sleep I remember.
DOCTOR: Gradual onset, not sleeping as soundly… okay. And you mentioned some difficulty with memory. Can you give me an example of what you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Well, it's mostly with names, Doctor. I’ll meet someone, we'll chat for a bit, and then… poof! The name just slips my mind. Or I'll go to the store for one thing, and completely forget what it was by the time I get there! It’s not happening all the time, thankfully. And I can still remember things from long ago, perfectly. It’s just the recent things that are a little… fuzzy. My daughter says it’s just a sign of getting older, but I’d like to be sure.
DOCTOR: Daughters are usually right, but it’s always good to check things out. And you’re right to want to be sure. Now, aside from the tiredness and memory issues, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, Doctor. No aches or pains, no dizziness, no trouble with my eyesight. My appetite is good, thankfully. I still enjoy a good meal. And… no problems with, well, you know, going to the bathroom. I suppose I’m fairly lucky, all things considered. I just want to feel a bit more… myself again, if you understand. A bit more energy, a bit more clarity.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s perfectly reasonable. Now, have you noticed any changes in your mood or energy levels throughout the day?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. I think… I do feel a bit more easily discouraged than I used to. If I try to do something and find myself getting tired or forgetting things, I tend to just… give up. It's not sadness, exactly, but… a lack of motivation, perhaps. I used to be very determined, very stubborn even! Now, I find myself thinking, “What’s the point?” It’s not all the time, but it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay. A bit more easily discouraged, lack of motivation… we're getting a good picture here. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me see… years ago, Doctor, perhaps twenty years ago, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure. The doctor put me on medication for a while, and it seemed to do the trick. We gradually lowered the dose, and eventually I was able to stop taking it altogether. I haven't had any problems with it since, as far as I know. Other than that… nothing major. I've had the usual colds and flu, of course, but nothing serious. Oh! And I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, resolved with medication, and gallbladder removal. Do you recall when you had your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that was… let me think. It must have been… around 1998, I believe. Yes, 1998. My daughter, Leilani, was just starting school then. It was a bit of a scare, but the surgery went well, and I recovered quickly. She was a very good little helper during my recovery, always bringing me juice and crackers.
DOCTOR: 1998. Good. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the gallbladder. And a few stitches here and there as a child, but nothing that required a proper hospital stay. I've been very fortunate, really. I’ve always tried to be careful, and I think good genes have something to do with it, too. My mother lived to be ninety-five, and my grandmother even older!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I prefer to treat things naturally, if possible. A little rest, a good diet, and a positive attitude, that’s my philosophy. Although, I do take a calcium supplement sometimes, just to keep my bones strong. But that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, calcium supplement occasionally, but no regular medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As far as I know, I don’t have any allergies. I’ve eaten all sorts of things throughout my life, and I’ve never had a reaction. I’ve been stung by a bee once or twice, but nothing serious. Just a little swelling, that’s all. My daughter always worries about it, but I assure her, I’m perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My mother’s side of the family, there was some heart trouble. My uncle, he passed away from a heart attack when he was in his sixties. And my grandmother, she had a bit of trouble with her memory towards the end of her life, but we never knew for sure if it was Alzheimer’s or just old age. On my father’s side, not much that I can recall. He lived a long and healthy life. And my siblings, they’re all doing well, thankfully. No, not much serious illness in the family, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble on your mother’s side, and some memory issues in your grandmother. And now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Never. My mother always said smoking was a terrible habit, and I always listened to her. I've always enjoyed good health, and I didn't want to risk it. Not a smoker, never have been.
DOCTOR: Good. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, Doctor. But not anymore. I haven’t had a drink in several years, to be honest. I just find I don’t enjoy it as much as I used to. It doesn’t agree with my sleep, either. A little bit now and then, but nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, tell me a little about your social life. Do you have many friends and family nearby?
PATIENT: Oh yes, very lucky that way. My children, Leilani and Kekoa, they both live nearby, thank goodness. Leilani has a family of her own, so she’s busy, but always makes time for me. Kekoa is a bachelor, so he can visit more often. And I have a few close friends from church, we meet for coffee every week, sometimes more. I try to stay active, Doctor, it’s important. It keeps me young! Not as active as I used to be, but I still enjoy a good chat and a laugh.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, is there anything else you'd like to tell me, anything you think might be relevant?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, sometimes I feel a little… unsteady on my feet, especially when I stand up quickly. It doesn't happen often, but it's enough to make me cautious. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, of course. I have to wear glasses for reading and driving. But nothing major, Doctor. Just the usual signs of getting older, I suppose. I just want to feel like myself again, if you understand. A little more energy, a little more clarity, and a little peace of mind. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Nicoletta. And we will do our best to help you with that. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see if we can identify any contributing factors. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. Please, proceed. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me… Good. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath for me… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your pulse… 72 and regular. Thyroid feels normal. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, but nothing to worry about. Now, I’m going to check your ears… And your eyes… Your vision is a bit blurry, as you mentioned, but seems stable. Finally, let’s just take a look at your feet. Good circulation, but a little swelling in your ankles. That may be contributing to your feeling unsteady. Overall, everything seems within normal limits for your age, but the elevated blood pressure and ankle swelling are things we should monitor.
PATIENT: That makes sense, Doctor. I do notice my ankles swell up a bit by the end of the day. And you're right, my blood pressure has been creeping up a bit lately, I've noticed it at home sometimes when I check it. What do you think is causing it? Is it something I should be worried about? And what about the tiredness and the memory? What tests might you want to do to get to the bottom of that?
DOCTOR: Okay. The elevated blood pressure and ankle swelling could be due to a number of things. It could be related to fluid retention, mild heart failure, or even just being less active. The tiredness and memory issues are a bit more complex. Given your age, it's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I'd like to order a few tests. First, a complete blood count to check for anemia or infection. A basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes. A thyroid-stimulating hormone level to rule out thyroid problems. And a vitamin D level. We should also do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Finally, a urine analysis to check for any kidney problems or infection. Do all those sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, those all sound alright. Whatever you think is best. It's good to be thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and running these tests. Will they be able to tell me what’s causing the tiredness and memory issues with those? And how long will it take to get the results? I'm a little anxious to know what's going on, if you don’t mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Nicoletta. It’s perfectly normal to be concerned when you’re not feeling yourself. These tests will give us a good starting point, and help us narrow down the possible causes. The CBC, BMP, TSH, and Vitamin D will check for common underlying medical issues. The EKG will rule out any heart problems. The results should be back in about 3-5 business days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to monitor your blood pressure at home, and try to stay as active as possible without overexerting yourself. Drink plenty of fluids, and eat a healthy diet. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, or confusion – please don't hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’ll make sure to monitor my blood pressure and try to take better care of myself. And I will definitely contact the office if anything changes. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel much better just knowing we’re taking steps to figure things out. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nicoletta. It was my pleasure. Remember, we're here to help you every step of the way. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment and give you some instructions about the blood tests. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Have a good day.
