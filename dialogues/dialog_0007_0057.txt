DOCTOR: Hi Chellsea, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It is a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor Hernandez. I… well, I was told to come because of the cancer. It’s been… difficult. I’m still trying to understand everything, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chellsea, I understand. That is a lot to take in. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. We'll take things at your pace, and I'll do my best to explain everything clearly. First, can you tell me a little bit about what you have been told so far?
PATIENT: Well, the other doctor… he said it was in my… my chest, mostly. And that it’s… spreading. He used some words I didn’t quite understand, about… cells. And stages. He said I needed to see someone for… help. I mostly just remember feeling scared, and then my husband… he arranged this appointment before… before he passed. It’s all a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry to hear about your husband, Chellsea. Losing someone like that… that’s incredibly difficult, and it’s no wonder things feel blurry right now. It’s okay to not have all the details straight. So, you said the other doctor mentioned cancer in your chest and that it was spreading. Do you know what type of cancer they said it was?
PATIENT: No, sir. He didn’t say what kind it was. Just that it was… bad. He talked about tests, and scans, but I was too upset to really listen. I just wanted to… to go home. Would my records have that information, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, your records should have all those details. Let me pull them up right now. Okay, here we are… Chellsea Luft, age 20… ah, yes. It looks like you were seen by Dr. Miller on July 15th. The report indicates a diagnosis of… Stage III Small Cell Lung Cancer. It appears a biopsy was done to confirm. And it notes some imaging – a chest X-ray and a CT scan. Small Cell Lung Cancer is… well, it's a specific type of lung cancer that tends to grow and spread quickly. We'll talk about that more, but right now, let’s focus on getting a clearer picture of how you're feeling. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms – like coughing, shortness of breath, pain anywhere, fatigue, or anything else at all?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. The coughing… it started a few months ago. Just a little tickle at first, but it’s gotten worse. And I’ve been very tired. So tired I can barely get out of bed some days. My chest… it hurts when I breathe deep. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache. I haven’t lost my appetite, but everything just tastes… bland. And I’ve been losing weight, I think, even though I’m eating.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a much better understanding. Coughing, fatigue, dull chest pain with deep breaths, a loss of taste, and unintentional weight loss. Those are all consistent with what we'd expect with lung cancer. Now, have you ever smoked, or been around a lot of secondhand smoke?
PATIENT: No, sir. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he used to smoke, but he quit years ago. I always told him to quit because of the smell, and because I didn’t want him to get sick. He did… eventually. I don't understand… how could I get lung cancer if I never smoked?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Chellsea, and it’s one I hear often. While smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, it’s not the only cause. There are other risk factors, including exposure to radon gas, asbestos, and other environmental toxins. Sometimes, it happens without any known cause, due to genetic mutations. We’ll likely want to do some further testing to try to understand what might have contributed in your case. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you had any other serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, sir. I’ve always been healthy. Just the usual childhood things, like chickenpox, but nothing serious. I had my tonsils out when I was little, but that’s it. I haven't been to the hospital for anything in years… not until this. It's… strange. I feel like I’m talking about someone else.
DOCTOR: I understand, Chellsea. It is strange when something like this happens when you've always been healthy. Okay, and what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she had breast cancer, a long time ago. She’s okay now, she finished treatment years ago. My father… he had heart problems. He passed away when I was a teenager. And my grandmother, on my mother's side, she had some kind of stomach trouble, but I don’t know much about it. That's about all I know, really. We weren't very close.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. History of breast cancer in your mother and heart problems in your father. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: What do you mean, sir? Like… do I have friends? I worked as an Occupational Therapist... helping people get back on their feet after injuries, mostly. It was good work. I liked helping people. I... used to go hiking a lot with my husband, before... well, before everything. I don't really... go out much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good sense. You worked as an Occupational Therapist, enjoyed hiking with your husband, and haven't been as social since his passing. That’s understandable. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. I don't take anything regularly. Just… sometimes ibuprofen for a headache, if I need it. But that’s it. I always tried to stay healthy… eat right, exercise… I just… I don’t understand how this could be happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just ibuprofen as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I can eat anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. It's... It's all so confusing. I feel like I’m going backwards. I came here hoping for answers, but now I just have more questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Chellsea. It’s a lot to take in, and it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. We will get to answers. Okay, let's move on to a physical exam. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, check your lymph nodes, and feel your abdomen. It will take just a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That’s alright. Please, do what you need to do. I just want to know… what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chellsea, take a few deep breaths for me. In… and out… good. I’m hearing some decreased breath sounds on the right side, and some slight wheezing. It’s not dramatic, but it’s something we need to note. Her heart sounds are regular, but a little bit rapid. I’m feeling some slight swelling in the lymph nodes on the right side of her neck. They’re not large, but they’re definitely palpable. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender. Okay, Chellsea. Everything seems… consistent with what we've discussed. The decreased breath sounds, wheezing, and swollen lymph nodes are all things we’d expect to see with lung cancer. Based on your history and the physical exam, I believe we need to review your imaging reports in more detail. Dr. Miller ordered a CT scan, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. He did. I remember… lying in that machine. It was… scary. He said it showed something on my lung, but I don’t remember the details. Just… a dark spot. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that it was scary, Chellsea. And yes, a dark spot on a CT scan of the lung is something we need to investigate further. Let me pull up those reports now. Okay… here we are. The CT scan from July 12th shows a mass in the upper lobe of your right lung. It's approximately 6 centimeters in size. There also appears to be some enlargement of the lymph nodes in the right side of your chest. The report also mentions some possible involvement of the left lung, but it’s not definitive. Chellsea, based on the information we have so far, it is likely that you have Stage III Small Cell Lung Cancer. This means the cancer has spread beyond the initial tumor in your lung and into nearby lymph nodes. It is a serious diagnosis, but it’s not necessarily a hopeless one. There are treatments available, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. We will discuss these in more detail. But first... ...I want to order some additional tests to get a better understanding of the extent of the disease. We need to perform a biopsy of the lymph nodes to confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific type of Small Cell Lung Cancer. We will also want to do a PET scan to see if the cancer has spread to any other parts of your body. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A biopsy… another biopsy? I… I suppose so. If it will help. A PET scan… that sounds… complicated. Will these tests… hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I just… I want to know what I’m facing. Is it… is it curable?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Chellsea. It's perfectly normal to be scared and overwhelmed. Another biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the exact type of Small Cell Lung Cancer, which will help us tailor the treatment plan. The procedure itself is usually relatively quick, and we’ll make sure you're comfortable throughout. They'll likely use a local anesthetic to numb the area. The PET scan isn't as invasive. It involves injecting a small amount of radioactive tracer into your vein, which helps us identify areas of cancer in your body. It’s similar to an X-ray, but it provides more detailed information. As for whether it's curable… that's a difficult question. Small Cell Lung Cancer is aggressive, but treatment can be very effective, especially when caught early. The goal of treatment is to achieve remission, which means there's no evidence of cancer in your body. We will work together to develop the best possible plan for you. The results from the biopsy and PET scan will take about a week to come back. In the meantime, I want to schedule a meeting with an oncologist – a cancer specialist – to discuss your case in more detail. They will be able to answer your questions and provide you with more information about treatment options. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. An oncologist… that sounds good. I want to talk to someone who knows everything about this. A week… that feels like a long time to wait, but I understand. What about… what about Medicare? Will it cover all of this? I don’t have a lot of money. And… and what about me? I'm still young. Is there… is there support for people like me?
DOCTOR: Those are very important questions, Chellsea, and I’m glad you asked them. Let's address them one by one. First, Medicare should cover the majority of your treatment, including the biopsy, PET scan, consultations with the oncologist, and any subsequent treatment you may need. Our billing department will work with you to ensure that your claims are processed correctly and that you understand your financial responsibilities. As for support… absolutely. There are many resources available for young adults facing cancer. We have a social worker here at the clinic who can connect you with support groups, counseling services, and financial assistance programs. There are also national organizations, like the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute, that offer support and information. I want you to know that you are not alone in this. We will be here to support you every step of the way. I'm going to have my nurse, Sarah, schedule your appointment with the oncologist and connect you with our social worker. She’s excellent. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, sir. I think… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And for… for not making me feel stupid. It’s just… a lot to take in. I guess… I’ll just wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. It is a lot to take in, and you're not stupid at all. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed in this situation. I'm glad I could help. I'll have Sarah come in and get you scheduled. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions before then. Take care, and remember, we're here for you.
