DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Aluia, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello to you too, Doctor. Well, it's these bumps on my legs. On my shins, mostly. They're… red. And kinda sore, you know? Not always sore, but they bother me when I walk a lot. Been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly. It’s hard to say exactly. Time kinda… slips away when you're working, you know? I'm a mover, so I'm on my feet all day. Maybe a little longer than a month, now that I think about it. It started small, and I just figured it was a bruise or something from bumping into things. But it hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: A mover, right. So, lots of physical activity. And you just noticed these bumps on your shins?
PATIENT: Yep, that's right. Mover. Heavy stuff, mostly. And yeah, I noticed them on my shins. They weren't big at first, just little red spots. But they've gotten… lumpier, I guess you could say. And a little more noticeable. My wife pointed them out, actually. She has a good eye for things. I don't always notice these things myself.
DOCTOR: Hm. And are they just on your shins?
PATIENT: Pretty much just my shins, Doctor. I think I saw one little one startin' on the front of my ankle, but it was so small I wasn't sure. Mostly the shins though, yeah. Both legs. Not one is worse than the other, I don't think. They feel about the same.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Not really. No fever, no chills. They don’t itch, thankfully. Just… sore sometimes when I walk a lot. And they look kinda ugly, but I don't think that's a symptom, is it? I haven't felt sick or anything, just these bumps.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any medical problems, like diabetes or poor circulation?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let's see… No diabetes, no. My wife keeps telling me to watch my sugar, but I'm not diabetic. Poor circulation… not that I know of. I get tired after a long day, but I figured that was just from the work. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for checkups, but they haven't said anything about my circulation being bad. I did have a bad knee a few years back, but that's been fixed with a replacement. It's not botherin' me now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries other than the knee replacement?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think again. No, I don’t think so. Just the knee. Had that done about five years ago, maybe six. Everything went well with that. I don't remember having any other surgeries. Nothing major, at least. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that was a long, long time ago. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That was a long time ago. We're focusing on recent history. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. No, not that I know of. I've taken some pain relievers for the knee, over the years, and never had a problem. And some cold medicine when I’ve been sick, but nothing bad. My wife always asks me that question, and I always tell her no. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. But if you want to be safe, maybe don't give me penicillin? I've heard stories…
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure, Doctor. It’s not too bad, usually around 130 over 80, but the doctor put me on a small dose of lisinopril just to be safe. Been taking it for about a year now. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knee if it's acting up, but that's not every day. That's about it, really. Just the blood pressure medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s take a look at these bumps. If you don’t mind. Could you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Happy to. Hope I'm not too heavy for it! Old bones, you know? But they should hold. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. They're firm, as you said. And a little tender. I see some small red spots around them too. Do these bumps ever bleed or ulcerate?
PATIENT: Bleed? No, never bled. Ulcerate? I don't think so. They just kinda… sit there. Sometimes they get a little more sore when I've been walking a lot, especially uphill. But they don't open up or anything. They’ve always just been… bumps. It's kinda hard to tell when I'm workin', you know? I'm wearin' boots all day.
DOCTOR: Pulses are a little weak, but that could be normal for your age. Given your history and the appearance of these bumps, it’s possible this is a form of stasis dermatitis, perhaps related to some venous insufficiency. It's common with prolonged standing and physical activity. We’ll need to rule out other things, though. I’m going to order some basic blood work – a CBC and a CMP – just to get a baseline. And I'd like to send you for a Doppler ultrasound to assess the blood flow in your legs. It’s the best way to determine if there’s any significant blockage or valve dysfunction. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Whoa, that's a lot of big words, Doctor! Stasis… dermatitis? Venous… insufficiency? Sounds serious! But alright, if you think it’s best. Blood work and… a Doppler ultrasound? Is that painful? I don't mind the blood work, but I don’t want anything too invasive. I just want to get back to work, you know? But if you think it's necessary, I trust your judgment. What's the next step? Do I need to schedule something?
DOCTOR: It's not usually painful, Mr. Aluia. The ultrasound is non-invasive; it just uses sound waves to create an image of your veins. We’ll send you to the radiology department, and they'll schedule an appointment for you. It should be relatively quick. As for the blood work, I'll write you a requisition, and you can get that done at any lab. The results will take a few days. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you elevate your legs whenever possible, especially after work. And I’ll prescribe you a topical steroid cream to help reduce the inflammation. It won't cure the problem, but it may provide some relief. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… better. Elevate my legs… I can do that. I watch a lot of TV anyway, so that’s not a problem. And the cream… topical steroid, you say? Alright. I can put that on. I’m good with that. So, just get the blood work done, go to radiology for the ultrasound, and put on the cream? And elevate my legs? Is there anything else I need to do? Also, will this affect my work? I really need to keep movin', you know? It's how I make a livin'.
DOCTOR: For now, that’s it. We need to get those tests done to understand what’s going on. As for work… I’m not going to tell you to stop completely, but I would advise you to take it easy, especially on long days or uphill climbs. Avoid prolonged standing whenever possible. And listen to your body. If it hurts, stop. We need to rule out anything serious, and pushing yourself too hard could exacerbate the problem. Once we have the test results, we can discuss a more definitive plan. I’ll write everything down for you, including the medication instructions and the requisition for the blood work and ultrasound. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. We'll take it one step at a time.
PATIENT: Okay, one step at a time. I can do that. Listen to my body… easier said than done, but I'll try. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a little better, knowin' we're gettin' it checked out. I appreciate you takin' the time to explain everything, even if it was a lot of big words! I'll be sure to call if I have any questions. And I'll try not to overdo it. Hopefully, it's just somethin' simple. Thank you again. I should get goin' now, I guess. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. You too, Mr. Aluia. Try to rest your legs when you can. And call the office if you experience any changes in your symptoms. .
