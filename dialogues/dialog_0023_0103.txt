DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Albino. It’s my back, mostly. Lower back. Been botherin’ me for a bit now. Feels… weak, I guess. And aches. Lots of aches.
DOCTOR: “Weak” is rather vague, Albino. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Okay. It’s hard to explain. Like… when I bend over to pick somethin’ up, even somethin’ light, it feels like it’s gonna give way. And then the pain shoots down my leg sometimes. Not all the time, just when it bends. It's a sharp pain, not a dull one. Does that make sense? I’m not good with explainin’ these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, shooting pain down the leg with bending… that’s helpful. And where exactly is the pain in your lower back?
PATIENT: Right across here, Doctor. Right in the middle, kinda low. It's not like a spot, it’s more… across the whole area. And sometimes it feels like it goes around to my sides a little. I feel it most when I’ve been standin’ for a long time, or sittin’ for too long, actually. Both of ‘em. It’s a funny thing.
DOCTOR: “Funny” isn’t a clinical term, Albino. Now, have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. Tingling… maybe a little bit sometimes in my toes, but it doesn’t last long. It’s hard to say if it's from the back or just… old age. I get cold feet easily, you know? I’m seventy-seven, Doctor. Things start to go wrong.
DOCTOR: We’ll determine that, Albino. Now, have you had any recent injuries?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. Not recent, anyway. I tripped over the rug maybe a month ago, but I didn’t fall, just kinda stumbled. Didn’t hurt myself then, but… now that you mention it, it kinda feels like it started gettin’ worse around that time. But it wasn't bad at first, just a little stiff. I didn’t think much of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago. And I had some trouble with high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on pills and it’s been okay for years. Apart from that… not much, really. I’ve always been a pretty healthy fella. Oh! And I was told, a few years back, that my bones were a little thin. The doctor said somethin’ about… osteoporosis? Is that right? I don’t remember all the big words. But he didn’t say it was serious, just that I should watch it. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Appendix, hypertension… osteoporosis. Yes, that’s helpful. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not anymore. The doctor took me off ‘em a few years back. He said my numbers were good enough on their own. I stopped takin’ ‘em right away, like he told me to. I’m good about followin’ directions, you see. Unless it comes to rememberin’ names, that is. I’m terrible with names.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's move on to your family history. Is there anyone in your family who has experienced back problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Back problems… my mother, I think. She had trouble with her back when she got older, but I don’t know what kind of trouble. Just that she couldn’t stand for long. And my sister, she had some sort of arthritis in her spine, but she moved to Lebanon a long time ago. I haven't seen her in years. I don't know much about her health these days. We weren't very close, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to conduct a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table for me. We'll start with your range of motion and some neurological checks. It will be a fairly standard assessment, Albino, but it’s important to get a clear picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. Just… give me a moment. My knees aren’t what they used to be, you know. I’ll get on the table here. Is there a step to get up on it?
DOCTOR: There. Now, if you could please lie flat on your back, Albino. I'm going to start by palpating your spine to assess for tenderness. This may be slightly uncomfortable. Please let me know if anything causes significant pain. Now, tell me if you feel any pain here… or here…
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s… a little tender, Doctor. Right there. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a bruise. And… yes, a little bit here too. It's not terrible, but I definitely feel somethin’. Like a dull ache. It’s worse when you press on it. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Mild tenderness is not necessarily alarming, Albino, but it's important to document. Now, can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s… difficult, Doctor. I can’t quite reach my toes. It’s tight. Really tight. And it… kinda shoots pain down my leg when I do that. Not a sharp pain, more like a pullin’ sensation. I can go a little further, but it’s not comfortable. That’s about as far as I can go right now.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion and radicular pain with forward flexion. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs. Please keep your legs relaxed. Can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. A little bit of a prick, but I can feel it. And yes, I can feel that one too. Everything feels… normal, I think. Maybe a little bit numb in my toes, but that’s just usually how my feet feel. I have poor circulation, you know.
DOCTOR: Based on my initial assessment, it appears you’re experiencing lower back pain, likely due to muscular strain or a mild disc issue. The radicular pain – the pain radiating down your leg – suggests possible nerve irritation. However, to rule out more serious conditions, I recommend an X-ray to assess the alignment of your spine and identify any structural abnormalities. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An X-ray… hmm. Is it… dangerous? I’ve heard those things aren’t good for you. And how much will it cost? I don’t have insurance, you see. I’m on a fixed income, and I don't want any big surprises. I’m just worried about the money, mostly.
DOCTOR: The risk associated with a single X-ray is minimal, Albino. The benefits of identifying a potential structural issue far outweigh the negligible risk. As for the cost… I’m aware you’re uninsured. I’ll have the administrative staff provide you with a cost estimate. We may be able to explore options for a payment plan or reduced fees. However, without an X-ray, it’s difficult to provide a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. Are you willing to proceed with the X-ray?
PATIENT: A payment plan… that would be good. If we can work somethin’ out… yes, I guess I’m willing. I don’t want this pain to get worse. It’s just… I’ve never been one for doctors and hospitals and all that. But if it’s the only way to find out what’s wrong… okay. Let’s do the X-ray. But please, let me know the cost before you do it.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the administrative staff schedule the X-ray and provide you with a detailed cost estimate before proceeding. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or naproxen, and avoiding any strenuous activities that exacerbate your pain. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for explainin’ everything. And thank you for bein’ patient with me. I know I ask a lot of questions. I appreciate it. I think I’ll just… take it easy for a bit.
DOCTOR: Very well. The administrative staff will contact you to schedule the X-ray. If your pain worsens significantly, or you experience any new symptoms – such as weakness in your legs, loss of bowel or bladder control, or a fever – please seek immediate medical attention. Have a good day, Albino.
