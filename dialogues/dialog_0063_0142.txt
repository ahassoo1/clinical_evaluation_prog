DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, morning, Doctor. Right, well… headaches, mostly. Bad ones. They come on pretty quick, and I get all sweaty when they do. And my heart kinda races, feels like it’s thumpin’ really hard. It’s been happenin’ on and off for… a while now, I guess. Honestly, I can’t put a finger on when exactly it started. It just… did.
DOCTOR: “A while now,” is not particularly helpful, Mr. Lawther. We need specifics for proper assessment. Can you estimate, perhaps, a timeframe?
PATIENT: Yeah, you're right, sorry. It’s just… things kinda blur together, y’know? Let me think… maybe… six months? Could be a bit longer, could be shorter. It’s hard to say for sure. Definitely not years, though. Not years… I think. It feels like it started around… winter, maybe? Last winter? I'm really not great with dates.
DOCTOR: Winter. Very precise. And these headaches… where are they located?
PATIENT: Everywhere, kinda. It's not like one spot. Usually starts at the front, behind my eyes… but then it spreads. To the sides, back of my head… sometimes even feels like it's in my jaw. It's… a whole head thing, really. Not a little twinge. A proper headache. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A “whole head thing.” I see. And the severity?
PATIENT: Oh, bad. Really bad. Like… I have to lie down. Dark room, quiet. Can’t really do anything. Normal painkillers don’t touch ‘em. And like I said, the sweat… and the thumpin’ heart. It scares me a bit, to be honest. I feel awful, like I'm gonna be sick sometimes, too. Not always, but often enough.
DOCTOR: Are you experiencing any visual disturbances with these headaches?
PATIENT: Visual… disturbances? Like… what do you mean? Everything goes blurry? No, not usually. Sometimes… sometimes things seem a bit… brighter, maybe? Or… like there's little spots in my vision, for a few seconds. But not every time. It's hard to explain. It doesn’t happen with every headache, just sometimes when they’re really bad, I think. I don't know. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a subjective term, Mr. Lawther. Now, have you noticed any triggers for these headaches?
PATIENT: Triggers… Hmm. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I mean, I work in a factory, it's kinda noisy, but I’ve been doin’ that for years. Stress? Maybe. I got divorced a couple of years back, so… there’s been some stress. But they don't always happen when I'm stressed. Food? Drink? No, nothing springs to mind. It just… happens. Randomly, it feels like. Which is what's so frustrating.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief neurological examination. Please follow my finger with your eyes… and do try to keep your gaze steady.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Steady gaze, right. I can do that. Hopefully. Just tell me if I'm doing it wrong. My coordination isn't the best on a good day, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Adequate pursuit. Now, squeeze my hands. Both of them, simultaneously. Strength is… within normal limits. Now, close your eyes. Can you tell me where I am touching?
PATIENT: Okay, closed. Go ahead. Uh… this is gonna be tricky, isn't it? My sense of touch isn’t amazing. Is this… here?
DOCTOR: Close. But imprecise. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please extend your legs.
PATIENT: Okay, legs extended. Go for it. Ouch! That's a bit… jumpy. Is that… normal? They always make me twitch. I've always been a bit… reactive.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… hyperactive. Now, I'd like to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart. Please remain still. Blood pressure is slightly elevated. Heart sounds are… regular, but a bit forceful. Hmm. We will need some lab work to rule out any underlying causes. I will order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. And I want a CT scan of your head, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Is that… serious? What are we looking for? And lab work… okay, I can do that. I don’t have insurance, though. Will that be expensive? I'm a bit worried about all this, to be honest. It sounds… complicated.
DOCTOR: The CT scan is precautionary, Mr. Lawther. We are ruling out any structural abnormalities. As for the cost… I am unaware of your financial situation. The clinic has a billing department that can discuss payment options with you. Now, I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. Headaches of this nature require specialized attention. I will prepare the requisitions for the lab work and the CT scan. Please schedule an appointment with the radiology department and the neurology clinic as soon as possible. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A neurologist… right. Okay. That's… a lot. So, lab work, scan, and a specialist. I guess that's… thorough. I don’t know. I suppose I don’t really have a choice, do I? I just… I wish I knew what was causing this. And I’m worried about the cost. What if I can't afford all of this? I guess… just tell me where to go for the tests. And I’ll try to sort out the rest. .
DOCTOR: Here are the requisitions for the lab work and the CT scan. The addresses and phone numbers of the relevant departments are listed on the forms. As for the neurologist, I will have my secretary schedule an appointment for you. Now, if you will excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
