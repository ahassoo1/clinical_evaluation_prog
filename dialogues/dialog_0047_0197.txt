DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarotta. I’m Dr. Press. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be quite frank, I need to get a card so I can drive for… well, a ride-sharing service. Something about needing a special medical card for commercial driving, that’s what they told me. I hope this won’t take too long, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: A medical card for ride-sharing… Right. Well, that’s… certainly something. It’s not a standard requirement I often deal with, but we can certainly assess your suitability. It essentially comes down to ensuring you're physically and mentally capable of operating a vehicle safely for commercial purposes. First, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you been seen by another doctor recently?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I saw Dr. Nakamura just last month, for my usual check-up. He’s over on Elm Street. Good man, very thorough. He knows I take my medications regularly, and everything was stable then. I can give you his number if you need it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, thank you. Dr. Nakamura's office is quite convenient. We can certainly request records from him, though if you have a list of your medications with you today, that would be helpful. And aside from that routine check-up, have you had any significant health issues in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Significant issues… Hmm. Well, I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago, but that’s been no trouble at all. And I used to have high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication now, like I said. Nothing else that comes to mind, really. I’m pretty healthy for my age, if I do say so myself.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, and controlled hypertension. That’s helpful. And you take medication for the blood pressure currently?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I take Lisinopril, ten milligrams, once a day. Every morning with my breakfast. I haven’t missed a dose in… oh, goodness, must be close to ten years now. Dr. Nakamura checks my blood pressure every visit, and it’s always good. Perfectly stable. Do you need the exact dosage written down? I have a list in my purse.
DOCTOR: No, that's alright for now. Ten milligrams of Lisinopril daily is perfectly reasonable. Now, what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I mean, I get hay fever sometimes in the spring, but that’s just sneezing and a runny nose. Nothing serious. No reactions to any medications, food, or anything like that. I’m very lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Now, family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… That’s a long story. My mother had diabetes, type 2, and she had to have her leg amputated. That was many years ago, though. And my father had heart problems, but he smoked heavily his whole life. I’ve always been very careful about my health, especially after seeing what happened to them. I don’t smoke, never have, and I try to eat a balanced diet. Does that help? I can try to remember more if you need me to.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… relevant. Diabetes and heart disease in the family. And you've been proactive about your health. Now, finally, let's talk about your social habits. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two or three times a week. Nothing excessive, I assure you. And I definitely don't drink and drive, ever. I take that very seriously. Honestly, I mostly just enjoy a quiet evening at home with a good book. Not much of a partier these days.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s all the preliminary questions for now. We need to do a physical exam to assess your overall fitness for this... commercial driving card. It’s fairly standard – blood pressure, vision, reflexes, a listen to your heart and lungs. We'll start with your blood pressure. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds… reasonable. Let’s get it over with, then. I hope this doesn’t take too long. My hip’s been a little stiff lately.
DOCTOR: 140/90. A little elevated, but not alarmingly so. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing is a little wheezy, but again, not immediately concerning. Do you have any history of asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Hmm, not asthma exactly. But I do get bronchitis sometimes, usually in the winter. A bad cough, a lot of mucus. Dr. Nakamura usually gives me something for it, an inhaler I think. I haven’t needed it this year, though. I try to stay indoors when it’s cold and damp. It’s just a little tickle in my chest, really. Nothing to worry about.
DOCTOR: A 'little tickle', you say. We’ll note the history of bronchitis. Now, vision. Can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Okay, let’s see… E… F… P… T… V… alright, I can see those. The next line… uh… L… C… oh, and… B… I think I can still see pretty well for my age. Though I do need reading glasses for close-up work. I left them in the car, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to get a proper vision test done with your glasses. That's crucial. Now, reflexes. Not bad. A little diminished, but within acceptable limits for your age. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart again. I am detecting a slight murmur. Have you been told about this before?
PATIENT: A murmur? Oh… yes, actually. Dr. Nakamura mentioned something about that last month. He said it was… harmless, a little extra flutter. Something about it being common as you get older. He didn't seem too concerned, said it didn't require any treatment. I honestly don't remember the specifics, I'm terrible with medical jargon. Is that bad? I really need this card…
DOCTOR: It could be insignificant, as your doctor said. However, for commercial driving, we need a more thorough assessment. A murmur warrants further investigation. I'm going to recommend an echocardiogram. It's a non-invasive test that will give us a detailed look at your heart function. I can refer you to a cardiologist. Until we have those results, I unfortunately cannot sign off on this medical card. Safety is paramount, and we need to ensure your heart is in optimal condition for this type of work.
PATIENT: Oh dear. An echocardiogram… and a cardiologist? That sounds… expensive. And time-consuming. I really didn’t want to have to go through all of this. Is there… absolutely no way around it? Perhaps if I explained how much I need this job… I just want to drive people around safely, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sciarotta, with all due respect, this isn’t about wanting to do something. It’s about being medically fit to do it safely. Commercial driving carries significant responsibility. Your heart health is non-negotiable. I understand your concerns about cost and time, but I cannot compromise patient safety. I can provide you with a referral to a cardiologist who accepts Medicare, and we can discuss payment options if needed. As for bypassing the echocardiogram… no. That is simply not an option. Here's the referral. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Once you have the results, bring them back to me, and we’ll reassess. Until then, unfortunately, I cannot fulfill your request. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… I suppose not. It seems I’m no closer to getting this card than I was this morning. Thank you… for your time.
