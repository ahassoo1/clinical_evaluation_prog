DOCTOR: Hi Josie, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, finally. Look, it’s this…stuff. Coming up. All the time. It’s just… unpleasant. Been happening for a while now, really. Don’t have time for this, you know? Just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Stuff coming up” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Like…food. Sometimes. Acid, I guess. It just…reappears. Especially after I eat. And when I lie down. It's not…pretty. Honestly, I don’t need to describe it in detail. You're a doctor. You know what “coming up” means. It’s…disgusting. And it burns.
DOCTOR: Right, I do understand. It sounds really unpleasant, and I appreciate you telling me about it, even if it’s difficult. When you say it happens especially after eating and when lying down, about how long after eating does it start, and how often would you say this is happening in a week?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Let me think. Maybe an hour or two after I eat? Sometimes sooner. It’s hard to say exactly. And how often… probably most nights. Four, five times a week, easily. Look, I’m a busy man. I don’t keep a log of my regurgitation, if that’s what you’re asking. Does it really matter how many times? It happens too much. That’s all that matters.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t need to be exact. Four or five times a week gives me a good idea. And you’re right, the frequency is what’s important. You mentioned it burns – is it a burning sensation in your chest, or more in your throat?
PATIENT: Both, honestly. Chest and throat. It feels like…fire. A little bit of heartburn too, I suppose. Not all the time, but sometimes. And it wakes me up at night. That’s the worst part. I need my sleep. Look, I eat normal food. Not anything spicy or anything. It’s just…random. And it's ruining my life, practically.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest and throat burning, waking you up at night… that definitely sounds disruptive. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this—like a sour taste in your mouth, trouble swallowing, or any weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No! Why would I lose weight? I eat plenty. Sour taste…sometimes, yeah. A little bit. Not terrible. And...no, I can swallow alright. It’s not like I'm choking or anything. I just…get this stuff coming up. It’s simple. You're asking too many questions. Are you going to give me something for this or what?
DOCTOR: I apologize if I'm asking a lot of questions, Josie. I just want to get a clear picture of what's going on so I can help you feel better. Okay, so no weight loss, trouble swallowing. Sour taste sometimes. Before we talk about medications, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. It will just involve listening to your chest and feeling your abdomen. It helps me rule out other possibilities. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. I haven’t got all day, you know? But don't poke around too much. And be gentle. I'm a large man. Not fragile, but...sensitive. Just do what you have to do. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, I will be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Okay, everything sounds clear in your chest, and your abdomen feels normal. No obvious tenderness there. Have you ever had anything like this before, or any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No! Never. I'm a healthy man! I eat well, I sleep…when this doesn’t wake me up, obviously. I rarely get sick. This is new. And annoying. Look, my wife makes me go to the doctor for a yearly check-up, but I always tell them I'm fine. They just poke and prod. This is probably just…acid, right? Something I can take a pill for? Don't tell me I need some fancy procedure. I haven't got time for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, you've been generally healthy, this is new, and you're hoping it's something simple like acid reflux. Given your symptoms - the frequent regurgitation, burning in your chest and throat, especially after eating and when lying down – it does sound like gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. The good news is, it's often very manageable with medication and lifestyle changes. Before we start anything, though, I want to be thorough. Do you take any medications regularly—even over-the-counter ones—and do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Medications…just a little something for my blood pressure. A tiny pill. Once a day. That's it. I don't like taking pills. And I certainly don't need any more of them. Look, can we just get a prescription? I'm sure it's nothing serious. My wife worries too much. Just give me something to stop the…stuff coming up. Quickly. I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. You take a medication for blood pressure. We'll keep that in mind. Given your symptoms and the fact that you're already on a medication, I’m going to start you on a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI. It helps reduce the amount of acid your stomach makes. I'll prescribe omeprazole, 20mg once daily, in the morning, 30 minutes before a meal. However, I also want to recommend a few lifestyle changes. Try to avoid eating large meals, especially before bed. Elevate the head of your bed by six to eight inches. And avoid foods that trigger your symptoms—things like caffeine, alcohol, chocolate, and fatty foods. I also want to follow up with you in two weeks to see how you're doing. If your symptoms don’t improve after a week or two, or if they get worse, we may need to consider further testing, like an endoscopy. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Omeprazole. Six inches. No chocolate…this is a lot. And I have a meeting. Look, I’ll try the pills. And I'll try to avoid the chocolate. But don't expect miracles. Two weeks… fine. But if I'm not better by then, I’m coming back and I want something stronger. And I don't want any lectures about lifestyle changes. Understand? Now, where's my prescription? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely, Josie. I’ve made a note of your preferences. Here’s your prescription. You can take it to any pharmacy. And I’ve also printed out a summary of the instructions, as well as some information about GERD. I’m glad we were able to discuss this, and I hope you start feeling better soon. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
PATIENT: .
