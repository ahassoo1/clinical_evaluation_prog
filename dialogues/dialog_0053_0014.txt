DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Limtiaco, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Ronnald Limtiaco. Though, everyone just calls me Ron. It’s… good to meet you, Doctor… Pitmon, was it? My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. I'm here about some paperwork, if I remember correctly. Something about time off? My wife helped me get the appointment set up.
DOCTOR: Pitmon, yes. And paperwork, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. Something for… well, I think it’s to do with needing some time away from work. I work with the church, doing… religious activities and education. It’s been a bit difficult lately, keeping up with everything. I believe it’s called FMLA, or maybe disability? Honestly, my wife handled most of the details. She said I needed to get some forms filled out by a doctor. Do you know about it?
DOCTOR: FMLA… yes, I’m familiar. Family and Medical Leave Act. And possibly short-term disability. Alright. To start, let's focus on why you’re needing this time off. “Difficult lately” isn’t terribly specific, Mr. Limtiaco. Can you elaborate on what's been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Elaborate… right. It’s… hard to put into words. It’s not one big thing, you see. Just… little things. Feeling tired a lot, even after sleeping. Trouble concentrating, remembering names… like I was saying earlier. It makes it hard to do my work, especially the teaching part. I get… flustered, I guess you’d say. And sometimes, I just feel… down. Not sad, exactly, just… low energy. It’s been going on for… a few months, maybe? It’s hard to say for sure. My wife noticed it first, really. She’s a good woman.
DOCTOR: Right. So, fatigue, difficulty with concentration and memory, and… low mood. For a few months. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns besides just feeling tired?
PATIENT: Hmm… appetite… that’s a good question. I think I’ve been eating a little less, maybe? Not a huge amount, but not as much as usual. And sleep… well, I sleep okay, I think. I get to bed at a reasonable hour, but I don’t always feel rested when I wake up. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep right away. Just… lying there. Thinking. It's probably nothing, really. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Probably nothing” rarely requires a doctor’s visit, Mr. Limtiaco. Have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: You’re right, of course. It’s probably best to get it checked out. Let me think… other symptoms… well, my hands sometimes shake a little, especially when I’m trying to write. It’s not bad enough to stop me, but it’s noticeable. And… oh, I get headaches sometimes. Not terrible, just… a dull ache at the back of my head. They come and go. I’ve also been feeling a little… dizzy sometimes. Especially when I stand up too quickly. Is that… is that important?
DOCTOR: Dizziness, tremors, headaches… alright. And you said this has been going on for months?
PATIENT: Yes, months. At least a few months. It's come on gradually, you see. Not like it happened overnight. It started with just feeling tired, and then slowly… everything else started creeping in. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when, though. I’m not very good with dates, unfortunately. My wife keeps a calendar, but I rarely look at it. She'll probably have a better idea of when things started to get worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Let’s get a few vitals, and I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax. Blood pressure is… elevated. 148 over 92. Pulse is a bit irregular, 78 and somewhat thready. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function. I'll need you to follow my finger with your eyes, and I'll be testing your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, I can do that. Follow your finger… right. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be either, if that makes a difference. Reflexes… alright, go ahead. I hope I don’t flinch. I always worry about startling the doctor.
DOCTOR: Balance is… slightly impaired. Reflexes are a little diminished, but symmetrical. Now, let me just take a look at your hands. Tremor is present, as you mentioned. Not severe, but noticeable. Alright. Now, I'm going to need to order some lab work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin D level. We’ll also need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues, so an EKG is necessary. And just to be thorough, I think a brain scan would be prudent to evaluate for any structural abnormalities. It’s a lot, I know, but we need to get a complete picture.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A lot of tests… Yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. My wife will be glad you're being thorough. She worries a lot. Brain scan… that sounds… serious. But if it’s necessary… then yes, let’s do it. When do I need to come back for the results? And… will my insurance cover all of this?
DOCTOR: We’ll get the lab work done today. The EKG can be done here as well. As for the brain scan… we’ll need to schedule that with the radiology department. I’ll have my assistant set that up for you. As for insurance… yes, it should be covered, given your private insurance. However, I can't guarantee it. You'll need to check with your provider. These are the lab requisitions and the radiology order. My assistant, Sarah, will schedule the brain scan for you and can answer any insurance questions you have. She's just outside. We’ll need to follow up once the results are available, likely in a week or so. And Mr. Limtiaco, I'm also going to write you a referral for a neurologist. It’s best to get a specialist’s opinion on this, given the complexity of your symptoms.
PATIENT: A neurologist… alright. That sounds… important. A lot of appointments. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate it. My wife will be relieved to hear we're getting everything checked out. I hope it's not anything too serious. Sarah, you said? I'll look for her. And… about the paperwork I came for? The FMLA or disability forms? Do you need more information before you can fill those out? I don't want to forget what I came for.
DOCTOR: The paperwork, yes. Frankly, Mr. Limtiaco, filling out those forms now would be premature. We need a diagnosis first. And given the current situation… I won’t be completing those forms until we have a clearer understanding of what’s going on. I’m happy to revisit this once we have the results from the neurologist. Don't worry about the forms at the moment. Focus on getting these tests done. That’s the priority. Sarah will be out shortly. She can answer any logistical questions you have. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll wait for Sarah. And… I’ll try not to worry.
