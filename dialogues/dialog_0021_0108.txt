DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. Welcome. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's my stomach, mostly. Been… well, bleeding. Not a good sight, let me tell ya. Happened a couple times now. Not something a man wants to deal with, if you catch my drift. It’s…dark. Real dark. And there’s been some cramping, too. Not terrible, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Dark, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, dark. Like…coffee grounds, almost. You know, not bright red. More…spent. And it ain’t just a little bit, neither. Enough to worry a fella. I’ve seen enough in my line of work to know when something’s wrong, and this…this ain’t right.
DOCTOR: Right. Coffee grounds… that’s good information. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started about a week ago, maybe a little longer. First time, I figured it was something I ate. Bad kebab, maybe. But then it happened again a couple days later, and then…well, just this morning. That’s when I decided I needed to come in. A man can only ignore things for so long, you know? Especially things comin’ out of there.
DOCTOR: A week, alright. And you said cramping… is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Not like a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. Mostly after I eat, if I’m honest. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Could be a sandwich, could be…well, it doesn't seem to make a difference. It just…starts. And then fades away after a bit. Not enough to put me down, but enough to be… irritating. And frankly, worrisome.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… let me think. I've been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But, you know, I'm 51. Things start to go, that's just a fact of life. And… well, I haven't been as hungry. Usually I can put away a good amount of food, but lately, I don't have much of an appetite. Everything just seems… bland.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nah, no vomiting. Lucky me, right? Just the… other stuff. And the tiredness. And the lack of appetite. Honestly, Doc, it feels like my insides are just… off. Like somethin’ ain’t workin’ right. I've seen plenty of bodies come through my place, and I can usually tell when somethin's seriously wrong. And this feels… wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you ever had any issues like this before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a thing. I mean, I’ve had the usual stomach bugs, a bit of heartburn now and then, but nothing like this. This is…different. I've always been a pretty healthy fella, all things considered. Worked hard my whole life, didn't spend much time sittin’ around. And now this? It's just… inconvenient, to be honest. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Well, my father... he died young, heart attack. My mother lived a long life, but she had… well, she had problems with her stomach, later in life. Always complainin’ about indigestion, stuff like that. Never really knew what it was, she didn’t go to doctors much. Yemenis aren't exactly known for rushin’ to the clinic, you know? We tough it out. But she was always a bit… frail.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nah. Don't take nothin'. Never needed to. I figure if you stay active and eat right, you don't need all those pills. And frankly, I don't trust 'em. Too many side effects, too much fuss. I've always been a bit skeptical of doctors, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, go ahead. But don’t expect miracles. I’m a practical man, Doc. Just tell me what you find, and let’s get this sorted. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the table, please. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first, and then I’ll palpate it. Just let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Bowel sounds are…present, though a little quiet. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: A little. Right… there. Not a sharp pain, like I said, just… uncomfortable. Feels a bit… swollen, maybe? It’s hard to tell. I've got a bit of a gut, you know? But yeah, right there feels…off. Don't poke too hard, Doc.
DOCTOR: There is some mild tenderness there, and I do feel a slight fullness. No rebound tenderness, which is good. Okay. Given your symptoms and the physical exam findings, there are a few possibilities. The dark stools are concerning, indicating potential bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. We need to investigate that further. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel, to check for anemia and assess your kidney and liver function. I also want to order a stool test to confirm the presence of blood. Finally, I think we should get an upper endoscopy to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. That’s the best way to determine the cause of the bleeding.
PATIENT: Endo…what now? Look, Doc, I’m a simple man. You want to stick a camera down my throat? That doesn’t sound very pleasant. And all this blood work… is it gonna be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see. A man’s gotta be practical.
DOCTOR: An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached down your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to look for any abnormalities, like ulcers or bleeding. It’s the most accurate way to diagnose the problem. It is the best course of action. As for the cost, I understand your concern. The blood work will be relatively inexpensive, but the endoscopy can be more costly. I will have my staff check the prices for you, and we can discuss options. We might be able to find a facility with a financial assistance program, or we can explore alternative testing options, though they won’t be as accurate. However, ignoring this could lead to serious complications. The bleeding could worsen, leading to anemia and potentially requiring a blood transfusion. I want to be upfront: I strongly recommend the endoscopy. We need to find out what’s causing the bleeding. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?
PATIENT: Look, I appreciate you explainin' it to me, Doc. I really do. But stickin' a camera down my throat… that sounds awful. And expensive. I’m a widower, you see. Got bills to pay. I don’t want to rack up a huge debt just to find out what’s wrong. Can’t you just…give me somethin’ for the stomach? Some pills? Maybe somethin’ to stop the bleedin’? I’m a tough man. I can tough it out. I’ve handled worse. I’m not sayin’ I don’t believe you, but I’m just… hesitant. Real hesitant. What are the chances it's just… somethin’ I ate? Could it just go away on its own?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, while it’s possible it could be something you ate, the dark stools are a significant indicator of bleeding, and we can’t dismiss that. Simply treating the symptoms without finding the cause is not a responsible approach. It might temporarily relieve your discomfort, but it won’t address the underlying problem, and it could even delay a potentially life-threatening diagnosis. I understand your concerns about the cost, and I’ll have my staff explore all possible options for financial assistance. However, I strongly advise against foregoing the endoscopy. Given your hesitation, and your financial situation, here’s what I’m willing to do. We can start with a course of a proton pump inhibitor—a medication to reduce stomach acid—for two weeks. We'll repeat the blood work and stool test after that period. If the bleeding persists or worsens, we must reconsider the endoscopy. But please understand, I'm not comfortable simply treating symptoms without a proper diagnosis, and I’m concerned about the potential risks. Do you agree to this plan?
PATIENT: Two weeks, huh? And more blood work… Alright, Doc. Fine. Two weeks of those pills, and then we see what happens. But if those tests come back okay, I’m not doin’ that camera thing. Understand? I’m a practical man, Doc. I gotta be. And you get your staff workin’ on those prices. I’m not made of money.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. Two weeks of a proton pump inhibitor, then repeat blood work and stool test. And my staff will definitely look into the costs for you. I’m also going to give you some written instructions on dietary modifications to help reduce stomach irritation—avoiding spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, and NSAIDs. If you experience any worsening symptoms—increased bleeding, dizziness, weakness, or severe abdominal pain—seek immediate medical attention. Do not wait for your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that covers it. Just get me those pills, and let’s hope they work. I got things to do, Doc. Things a man’s gotta do. And… thanks. For explainin’ it all, and for lookin’ into those prices. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright. My nurse will be in shortly to give you the prescription and schedule your follow-up appointment. Please, Mr. Gentz, take this seriously. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Take care.
PATIENT: .
