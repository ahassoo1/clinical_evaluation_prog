DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor Seil. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because... well, it is a little embarrassing to talk about, but I have been having a lot of… gas. More than usual, you understand. It is quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Goodstein. There’s no need to be embarrassed; digestive issues are very common. We all experience them from time to time. “More than usual” is a good starting point. Can you tell me more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It started, I believe, about two weeks ago. Perhaps a little longer. It doesn’t really hurt, not exactly… more like a very uncomfortable fullness, and then… the gas comes. It happens several times a day, sometimes after I eat, sometimes even when I am just sitting. It… well, it smells quite strong, if I may be so frank. And it is… loud. Quite loud, at times.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing those details, Mr. Goodstein. It's helpful to have a clear picture. Loudness and odor are important clues. So, it began roughly two weeks ago, associated with a feeling of fullness, and happens several times a day, both after eating and at other times. Does anything seem to trigger it specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question, Doctor. Let me think… I work at the diner, you see, and I eat a little bit of everything there. Burgers, fries… sometimes a slice of pie if it is a slow day. I haven’t changed what I eat, not really. But… I did start drinking more soda, maybe a week before it began. Root beer, mostly. And… the diner got a new batch of beans for the chili. Perhaps it is the beans? I do not know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major dietary changes except increased root beer consumption and a new batch of chili beans at the diner. That’s good information. And you mentioned you work at the diner – are you doing any heavier lifting or different physical activity than usual?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing different at work. Same tables, same customers, same… everything. I carry trays, of course, but I have been doing that for years. It is not heavier lifting, not at all. Just… regular diner work. I do stand a lot, if that makes a difference. Perhaps standing all day is a factor?
DOCTOR: Standing all day could contribute, yes. It can affect digestion. Now, let’s talk about other symptoms. Aside from the gas and fullness, have you noticed any bloating, abdominal pain, changes in your bowel movements – diarrhea, constipation, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Now that you mention it… I have been a little constipated, I believe is the correct term. It is not severe, but… it takes a little more effort, if you understand what I mean. And… yes, some bloating, especially in the evenings. It feels… puffy, around my stomach. It goes away after a while, but it is noticeable. No diarrhea, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so constipation and evening bloating in addition to the gas, fullness, and odor. Let's review a bit of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I do not believe so. I have my Medicare, of course, and I see Doctor Klein for my yearly check-up. He says I am generally healthy, a little high cholesterol, he mentioned, but nothing serious. He puts me on a… a statin, I think it is called. But other than that, no major conditions. I have never had any surgeries or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Generally healthy with mild high cholesterol managed by a statin, and no prior surgeries. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the statin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the statin. I take one pill every morning, with my breakfast. That is all. And I do not take any vitamins or supplements, either. I try to eat a balanced diet, as much as possible, considering where I work. It is a diner, after all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of, Doctor. I have never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I can eat shellfish, peanuts, everything. I have a little bit of a runny nose sometimes in the spring, but that is just… hay fever, I think. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Now, a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had problems with digestive issues, like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. My mother… she always had a sensitive stomach, if that counts. She would get heartburn easily, and she complained of bloating sometimes. But nothing… serious, I do not think. My father… he was a very healthy man. Never had any problems, as far as I know. And I do not really know much about my grandparents’ health. They passed away when I was very young. So, perhaps my mother, but nothing definite.
DOCTOR: Okay. Maternal history of a sensitive stomach. Finally, a few quick questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. It wasn't agreeing with me. And I certainly do not use any… recreational drugs. I prefer a nice cup of tea, if you must know.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. Okay, Mr. Goodstein, thank you for providing all of that information. It gives me a good starting point. Your height and weight are documented as 171 cm and 129 lbs, which is within normal range. And I see your last checkup with Dr. Klein was six months ago, with stable cholesterol levels. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with increased gas production, likely related to dietary factors. The new batch of beans at the diner, coupled with the increased root beer consumption, are likely contributors. The constipation and bloating could also be related. I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if you don't mind. I’ll listen to your abdomen and feel for any tenderness or masses.
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. I am happy to cooperate. The beans and the root beer… it makes sense, really. I suppose I should have thought of that sooner. Yes, please, let us examine my abdomen. I trust your judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Goodstein, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels painful or uncomfortable. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses or significant tenderness. I do hear some increased bowel sounds, which is consistent with increased gas. No guarding or rebound tenderness. All right. Based on the exam, everything seems normal. I don’t think we need any further testing at this time. I suspect this is a functional issue related to diet. I recommend starting with a few dietary changes. Reduce your intake of root beer and try to limit the beans at the diner. You might also consider over-the-counter simethicone, which can help reduce gas. If that doesn't improve your symptoms, we can explore other options. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Less root beer and fewer beans… I can certainly try that. And I will look for this… simethicone. Is that something I can get at any drugstore? I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. It has been a relief to talk about this, and I feel much better knowing what might be causing it. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Yes, simethicone is available over-the-counter at any drugstore. It’s usually sold under brand names like Gas-X or Mylanta Gas. Follow the instructions on the package. And you’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I’m glad I could help. It’s important to remember that digestive issues are common, and often easily addressed with simple lifestyle changes. I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re doing. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve with these changes, please don’t hesitate to call the office sooner. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Two weeks sounds good, Doctor. I will keep that in mind. No, I do not believe I have any other questions at the moment. You have been very helpful and reassuring. Thank you again, Doctor Seil. I appreciate your time and expertise. I think I will go home and… avoid root beer for a while. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I’m glad I could help. And yes, avoiding root beer is a good start! The receptionist will schedule your follow-up appointment on your way out. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
