DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowic. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Chest… feel funny. Like bird flapping. And… head hurt sometimes. Blood pressure… wife say too high. She make appointment. I no like hospital. Waste time.
DOCTOR: "Funny," you say. Can you elaborate on that sensation in your chest?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What mean elaborate? Just… fast beat. Not steady. Like… drum. Bad drum. And… sometimes, when walk upstairs… very tired. Like old man. Which I am old man, but still. Faster than usual. You understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. So, a fast, irregular heartbeat, and fatigue, particularly when climbing stairs. And your wife has noticed your blood pressure is high. When did you first start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… long time. Maybe… six months? Hard to say. Things come and go. Wife always worry. She read too many things on the… the internet. Makes big deal. But… chest… been worse last month. More… flapping. More tired. Now I think maybe… she right.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything specific made the chest palpitations worse – exercise, caffeine, stress, anything like that?
PATIENT: Stress? Always stress! This world… too much! But… no. No special thing. Just… happen. Sometimes when watch TV, very exciting… then flap. Coffee… maybe? I drink one cup in morning. Wife say too much. Everything is too much, she say. She’s a… a character. You understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. One cup of coffee in the morning. Now, let's talk about the headaches. Where exactly do you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Head… all over. Not one spot. Front, back, side… Sometimes feel tight, like band. Not… real bad pain. Annoying pain. Like little insects. You understand? I take… little white pill. Wife give. Helps some. But come back.
DOCTOR: A little white pill, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Little white. She get from… friend. Friend’s husband have same problem. She say good. I no ask questions. She know best. Always know best. Now… can we finish? I have appointment with… with plumber. Very important. Pipe… broken. You understand?
DOCTOR: It’s important to know what that little white pill is, Mr. Sobkowic. We need to ensure it’s not interacting with anything else or causing any unintended side effects. Do you happen to know the name of it?
PATIENT: Name? No! She just… give. Say “take this.” I’m old man. I no need name for everything. Pipe break, house flood. That is important. Not little white pill. I trust wife. She… particular. Now, you help chest? That why I here. Stop talking about pill. You understand?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with an examination, then. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Please sit back and relax. I need accurate readings.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… quick, okay? Pipe… waiting. And… no cold stethoscope. Very cold. You understand? This old man, have sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Of course. Heart rate is… irregular, as you described. Definitely some premature atrial contractions. Not immediately life-threatening, but needs further investigation. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 160 over 95. Elevated. Pulse is weak and irregular. Let’s get an EKG done. And I’d also like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel.
PATIENT: EKG… blood… too much! This is… a lot. Wife… she say I need to… relax. She no like hospital stuff. Pipe… plumber coming. I think I need to go. You understand? I have things… important things. You write down… “chest feel funny” and “wife worry” and that good enough. You understand?
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowic, with all due respect, "chest feels funny" is not a diagnosis. Ignoring these symptoms and elevated blood pressure could lead to serious complications—stroke, heart attack, even death. I understand you're concerned about your plumbing, but your health is paramount. We need to get this checked out properly. I am recommending a cardiology consult. And I insist on the EKG and blood work. I will write the orders now. We can discuss the results when they come back.
PATIENT: Cardiology? No! You want send me to… specialist? She… wife will be very angry. She no like… people poke around. I… I need think about this. I go home. Talk to wife. Maybe… maybe plumber first. You understand? This very stressful! You making me more sick! .
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowic, I understand your reluctance, but I am concerned about your health and strongly advise against delaying these tests. I will leave the orders with the nurse, and she can schedule them for you. Please, reconsider. If you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I wish you well. .
