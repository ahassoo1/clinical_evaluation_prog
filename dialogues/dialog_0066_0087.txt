DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Croonquist, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Condray. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. The usual. Honestly, I can’t quite recall why I need it, but… Medicare sent something. Yes, that's it. Just get that sorted, if you could. The quicker the better, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Medicare paperwork can be a bit confusing, that's perfectly alright. Let me take a look here... Alright, it seems like you're due for your annual wellness checkup, which includes some routine blood work. It’s just a standard check of your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and a few other things – basically making sure everything’s still ticking along nicely. Do you have any specific concerns or things you've noticed lately, even if they seem small?
PATIENT: Ticking along… yes, that sounds about right. Honestly, no. Not really. Everything feels… the same, I suppose. I don’t think anything’s different. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so it’s hard to say. Small things probably. I wouldn’t remember them if they were important, though, would I? Just… the lab work, please.
DOCTOR: You're right, if something was truly concerning you'd likely remember it. We’ll still go through a quick review of your health history just to be thorough. Have you had any changes in your medications recently?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh dear. Now that's a question. I think… no. No changes. I get them sent to the pharmacy, you see. The young man there sorts it all out. I don't bother myself with remembering specifics. It’s all a bit of a blur, really. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It’s good you have a reliable pharmacist! It's helpful to know, and no, it's not immediately important if you have someone managing that for you. Just checking all the boxes. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I… don't believe so. Not that I know of, anyway. I've eaten everything put in front of me for seventy-three years. Never had a problem. Dust makes me sneeze sometimes, does that count? But that's… everyone, isn't it? Just the lab work, if you please.
DOCTOR: Dust is common, yes, not usually a medical allergy we need to document. Alright, no known allergies. And just to be sure, are you currently experiencing any pain anywhere, or have you noticed any new swelling or redness on your body?
PATIENT: Oh, the usual aches and pains, Doctor. Seventy-three years will do that to you, you know. My knees are a bit creaky in the mornings, and my back… well, it’s old. But nothing new. No swelling, no redness… not that I’ve seen. Honestly, I spend most of my time indoors. Wouldn't notice much, I suspect. Can we just get this over with? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. I understand wanting to get this done quickly. Let’s get the lab work started, and then we can discuss the results when they come back. I'm going to need to check your vital signs first—just your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then we'll move to the blood draw. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… be quick about it. I’m not fond of needles. Vital signs… blood pressure… yes, yes. Just get it done, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be as efficient as possible. If you could just have a seat here, please, and extend your arm. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. That’s something we can talk about later. Your pulse is 78 and your temperature is 98.6 – perfectly normal. Now, for the blood draw. We'll just need a few vials. Do you prefer I don’t look at you while it’s happening?
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that bad? Oh, never mind. I don't need to know. Look away if it makes things faster. I don’t… care for watching. Just get it over with, Doctor. Quickly, please. And… try not to poke too much.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Croonquist. I'll be as gentle as possible. This will only take a moment. Alright, all done. Hold pressure there for a few minutes, and try to avoid heavy lifting with that arm for the rest of the day. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh… that wasn’t pleasant. Feels a bit… drained, if that makes sense. And slightly sore, of course. Is it done? Really done? I think I need a cup of tea. Just… yes. Done. Thank you, Doctor. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s completely done, Mr. Croonquist. You’re absolutely right to want a cup of tea – a good idea! I'll send these samples to the lab, and it usually takes a few business days for the results to come back. My staff will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any excessive bleeding, swelling, or pain at the puncture site, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, thank you. Just… the results, when they're ready. And try to call, please. My memory, you know. I’d probably forget to call back. That’s all. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Croonquist. We'll be sure to give you a call. Have a good rest of your day, and please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
