DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shaub, welcome. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, I decided it was time to get checked for… for HIV. It’s something I’ve been meaning to do for a while, now. I just… wanted to know my status, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay. HIV testing. Right. A sensible thing to get done. It's… proactive, I suppose. And you haven't been tested before, to my knowledge?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Never have been. Things were… different when I was younger, you understand. Not as much talk about it. And then, well, life just… happened. It feels better to know now, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, things are different now, thankfully. And you're right to want to know. It’s good you’re taking this seriously. Now, to get a clearer picture, I'm going to ask you a few questions, if that’s alright. Nothing too personal, just information that helps us assess risk. Do you mind if I start with some questions about your sexual history?
PATIENT: Oh. That… that feels a bit awkward, Doctor. But… if it’s necessary, I suppose. Yes, you may ask. Though, please be gentle. I’m a married woman, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. Completely understand. I assure you, everything is confidential and I'll be as sensitive as possible. It’s simply to understand potential exposure. I need to ask about your partners, both past and present. Have you ever had sexual contact with anyone other than your husband?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. Only my husband. We’ve been together… forty years, this year. Forty years. It's just him. Always has been.
DOCTOR: Alright. Forty years is… commendable. And you've never engaged in any activities that might involve shared needles or other potential exposures?
PATIENT: Shared needles? Doctor, I'm a parking attendant. I issue tickets, I don't… Well, no. Absolutely not. I’ve never had any reason to use… needles. Is that a common concern? I confess, I don't understand.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Shaub. We ask everyone. Just covering all bases. Now, let’s move on. Any blood transfusions in the past?
PATIENT: Blood transfusions… Hmm. Let me see. When my son was born, a very long time ago, there was a complication during the delivery. He was… quite small. I believe I did receive a transfusion then. It was a long time ago, though. Nearly fifty years. Does that matter? Is that… risky?
DOCTOR: It’s good you remember that. Yes, it does matter, but it’s not automatically concerning. Transfusion practices have improved dramatically since then. We’ll need to take it into account. Now, just to finish up with the medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections – STIs – like syphilis or gonorrhea?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I've always been very careful. And my husband… he would never. We've always looked after each other. Never. No STIs. I can assure you of that.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s… good to know. Now, before we proceed with the testing, let me ask about your general health. Do you have any chronic conditions – like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: My knees, Doctor. They ache something awful, especially when it rains. The doctor says it’s just old age and arthritis, but… it’s very painful. Other than that… no. Not really. No diabetes, no high blood pressure. Just… old knees. And a bit of trouble sleeping sometimes. That's getting to be a common complaint, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Arthritis and some trouble sleeping. Alright. Any medications you’re currently taking, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen, Doctor. For my knees. When they’re really bad, I take two or three a day. And sometimes a little something to help me sleep, just on very bad nights. A herbal remedy, actually. My sister sends it to me from Nigeria. It has… valerian root in it, I think. That's all. Nothing prescribed, you understand. Just… things to help get by. Is that alright? Should I have told you about the herbal remedy?
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned it. Herbal remedies can interact with other medications, though valerian root is relatively benign. But it’s always best to know everything you're taking. Alright. And do you have any allergies – to medications, food, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I know of. I eat everything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can’t recall ever being allergic to anything in my life, not even as a child. Though, my sister says I'm too stubborn to admit when something doesn't agree with me. She says I’d probably keep eating it even if it made me ill. But truly, no. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shaub. That gives me a good overview. Now, for the HIV testing itself, we have a couple of options. We can do a simple blood draw today, which will take about a week to get the results back. Or, we can do a rapid finger-prick test, which will give us a preliminary result in about 20 minutes, but it’ll need to be confirmed with a blood test later. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: Twenty minutes? The finger-prick test, please, Doctor. If you don't mind. I… I suppose I’d rather just get it over with, if that’s possible. Waiting a week feels… rather long. And if it’s just a preliminary result, I understand it still needs to be confirmed. But twenty minutes… yes, that sounds much better. Is that alright? Will that work?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. It will work. Let's go ahead with the rapid test, then. I'll need to sanitize your finger, then we’ll just take a small sample of blood. It’s barely noticeable, I assure you. Just a quick prick. Afterwards, we'll wait for the results to develop. Now, let me explain a bit about what a positive or negative result means…
