DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Schneer, it says here you're 83 years old. That's... quite a milestone. Now, let's get down to business. Why don't you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Eighty-three, is it? Seems like yesterday I was a young fella. Well, I… I think it's my ears. They don’t seem to be workin’ as good as they used to. People are mumblin’ more, or maybe I’m just gettin’ old! I dunno. It’s hard to say, really.
DOCTOR: “Getting old,” is it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s somethin’ isn’t it? Everything gets a bit… fuzzy. Not just the hearin’, you know. The days all blend together. But the hearin’ is the worst, I suppose. Makes it hard to follow a conversation, especially when there's noise. Used to be able to hear a pin drop, I swear. Now… not so much. Do you… understand what I mean, dear? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I understand perfectly. Vague complaints are… common at your age. It’s just that pinpointing the exact issue is what’s important. So, when did you first start noticing this difficulty?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. It didn't happen all at once, you see. It was… gradual. Maybe a few years ago? Or was it more? I used to work in the shoe factory, lots of noise there, clackin’ and hummin’ all day long. Maybe it started then. I really couldn’t say for sure. It just… got worse over time. Is that helpful, dear? I'm terrible with dates.
DOCTOR: “A few years.” Right. That narrows things down considerably. And the shoe factory… noise exposure. Noted. So, it's been progressively worsening for several years, and you attribute it to your previous occupation. Do you experience any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… Now that you mention it… sometimes. A faint sort of… hum. Not all the time, mind you. Mostly when it's quiet. Like a distant… well, like a distant machine, maybe? It's not painful or anything, just… there. It comes and goes, you know? It’s hard to describe. Is that what you mean by ringin’, dear? Because it’s not a loud ringin’. More of a… subtle somethin’.
DOCTOR: “Subtle somethin’.” Yes, well. It is what I mean by ringing, Mr. Schneer. Tinnitus, we call it. And how is your balance?
PATIENT: Balance? Oh, it’s alright. I haven't fallen or anything, not recently. I get a little… unsteady sometimes, especially when I stand up too quick. But that’s just gettin' old, isn’t it? My knees ain’t what they used to be. I mostly just take my time, you know? Don’t rush things. Is that what you’re askin’ about, dear? I haven't felt dizzy or anything like that. Just… careful.
DOCTOR: “Careful.” Of course. Very good. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Oh dear, that’s… a long time ago. Let me think. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbin’ a tree. And… I had a bit of a bad cold once, real bad, but I don’t think I ever went in the hospital for that. I mostly just stayed in bed with a cup of tea. Nothing serious, I don’t think. Maybe I had my tonsils taken out when I was little? I can't really remember. Does it matter, dear? It was a long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: It always matters, Mr. Schneer. But very well. No significant hospitalizations, as far as you recall. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Now that you mention it, I think I had my appendix out when I was young. A long time ago, though. And… maybe a mole removed from my back? I can’t rightly recall the details. It was small, I think. I don’t remember bein’ in much pain. I mostly just remember my mother fussin’ over me. Is that helpful, dear? I’m afraid my memory ain’t what it used to be. Everything's a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: “A bit hazy.” Right. Appendix, possible mole removal. We’ll note that. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Oh, that's a tricky one. I don't think so. I haven't taken much medicine over the years. Just a bit of aspirin for headaches, and some cough syrup when I have a cold. I never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I recall. But I haven't tried many different kinds of medicine, you see. My mother always said to avoid medicine if you could. Is that helpful, dear? I mostly just drink tea when I'm unwell. It always seems to do the trick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. No known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not really. Like I said, I don't take much. Sometimes I take a little bit of aspirin for my knees, when they're achin’. But that's it, I think. Just the aspirin, now and then. Nothing regularly. I mostly just try to rest and take it easy. Is that what you wanted to know, dear? I don’t want to forget anything important. Everything’s a bit of a blur these days, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. No regular medications, occasional aspirin. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, look in your ears, and check your balance. Just a quick look, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Sounds fine. Whatever you need. My ears, you say? Well, go right ahead. I trust you know what you’re doin’. Just be gentle, alright? Old ears are a bit delicate, you see.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears… cerumen impaction bilaterally, obstructing the canal. That’s likely contributing to your hearing difficulty. Balance is slightly unsteady, but within normal limits for your age. Alright, Mr. Schneer. It appears you have significant wax buildup in both ears, which is likely the cause of your hearing loss. Your balance is a bit shaky, but I don’t think it’s anything to worry about at this point. We can remove the wax and see if that improves your hearing. I'll need to use an irrigation system for this. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Wax, you say? Well, that doesn’t surprise me none. I’ve always had a bit of earwax. Never bothered me much, though, until lately. Irrigation, you say? What does that involve, dear? Will it hurt? I don't like things bein' poked and prodded, you see. Is it a gentle process? Just tell me what it involves, alright? I need to know what I’m gettin’ myself into.
DOCTOR: It’s a very simple procedure, Mr. Schneer. We use a gentle stream of warm water to flush out the wax. It’s not painful, though you might feel a slight pressure. I’ll use a special tool to carefully irrigate each ear. It’s usually quite quick and effective. We'll use a bulb syringe and warm water. I'll tilt your head to the side and gently squirt the water into your ear canal. The wax will drain out into a basin. It should improve your hearing considerably. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Warm water, you say? Squirted… into my ear? That doesn't sound very pleasant, dear. But… if it'll help my hearin’, I suppose I can try it. Is it over quickly? I don’t like bein’ uncomfortable for too long, you see. And… what if it doesn't work? Will I need somethin’ else done? Just tell me everything, alright? I like to be prepared. It's just… old ears are delicate, you see. I worry about makin' things worse.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schneer, it is a very safe procedure. It should only take a few minutes per ear. The vast majority of patients experience significant improvement in their hearing after wax removal. While it’s rare, there’s a small chance it might not completely resolve the problem. In that case, we would consider a referral to an audiologist for further evaluation. They can perform more comprehensive hearing tests and determine if there are any other underlying issues. I will proceed slowly and gently, and stop immediately if you experience any discomfort. Are you ready to proceed, or would you like to think about it?
PATIENT: Well... if you promise to be gentle, dear. And if you'll stop if it hurts. And... if it doesn't work, you'll send me to that... audio-whatsit? Then... alright. Go ahead. But slowly, mind you. Very slowly. And tell me what you're doin' as you go, alright? I like to know what’s happenin'. I trust you, dear, but old ears are… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schneer. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to warm the water to body temperature. Then, I’ll gently tilt your head to the side. I will use a bulb syringe to carefully squirt the warm water into your ear canal. You might feel a slight pressure or fullness. I’ll stop immediately if you experience any pain or discomfort. I'll be watching your ear canal with an otoscope throughout the process. Okay?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. You explained it well enough. Gentle now... and tell me if you see anything… strange. And… what does the water look like when it comes out? Is it… is it going to be messy? I've got my handkerchief, just in case. Just be careful, alright? My ears are all I’ve got left.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. Here we go. Just relax. You might feel a little bit of pressure. See?
PATIENT: Oh! That is a bit of pressure… and… a bit of a cold feeling. Is it supposed to feel like that? It's not painful, exactly, but… disconcerting. What are you seein', dear? Is the wax comin' out? Tell me, tell me! Don't just leave me in the dark! It feels… sloshy. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, the sloshy feeling is normal. That's the water dislodging the wax. I’m seeing a large amount of wax coming out now, Mr. Schneer. Good. That’s exactly what we want to see. It's a brownish-yellow color, and quite thick. We’ll continue for a few more seconds to ensure we remove as much as possible. Alright, that's it for the right ear. Let's take a look. Much better. The canal is significantly clearer now. Now, we'll repeat the process on the left ear. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Clearer, you say? I can't see it myself, of course. But… if you say so. Alright, let's get it over with. Left ear now, is it? Might as well rip off the bandage, as they say. But… please be gentle, dear. I don’t want to make things worse. And… tell me what you’re seein’. Every step of the way, alright? Just keep talkin’ to me, alright? It makes me feel… less nervous.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. I will continue to explain everything as I go. I’m tilting your head to the left now. Now, I’m gently squirting warm water into your ear canal. You might feel a slight pressure, similar to what you felt on the right side. There we go. I am seeing cerumen starting to dislodge. It’s a bit darker in color on this side, but that’s not unusual. Alright, that’s it for the left ear. Let’s take a look. Much better on this side as well. The canal is significantly clearer now. Well, Mr. Schneer, we’ve finished the ear irrigation. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Well… now. That wasn’t so bad, was it? A bit of a cold feeling, and a bit of pressure, but… not terrible. Everything feels… different. A bit… airy? Is that the right word? Now, let’s see if I can hear any better. Can you… say something, dear? Just something… simple. Let's see if I can hear it. Don’t shout, now. Just… talk normally. I need to know if it worked. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. Can you hear me clearly now?
PATIENT: Well, I'll be… Yes! Yes, I can hear you! It's… much clearer. Not perfect, mind you, but… a vast improvement. I didn’t realize how muffled everything was before! I can hear the hum of the machine… and the birds outside! It's… wonderful. You did a good job, dear. A very good job. Thank you. You really did.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I’m glad I could help. It sounds like the wax removal was successful. I recommend avoiding cotton swabs in your ears, as they can push the wax further in. If you experience a buildup again, please come see me. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, dear. Just my ears. And you fixed them! That's more than enough. Actually… now that you mention it… my knees have been achin’ a bit lately. Maybe that’s something we could talk about another time? But for now… I think I’ll just enjoy being able to hear again. Thank you again, dear. You’re a good doctor. A very good doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I’m glad to hear that. And yes, we can certainly discuss your knees at your next appointment. Just call the office to schedule. Have a wonderful day, Mr. Schneer.
