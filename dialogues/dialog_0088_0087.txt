DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I'm Dr. Piet. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. That's what the lady on the phone said, anyway. Honestly, I don’t really remember much beyond that. Just need it done, if that’s alright. Don’t have much time to sit around, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you had some blood work ordered by Dr. Evans. Yes, we can certainly get that done for you. Just to be thorough, even though you don’t remember details, can you tell me if you’ve been feeling any different lately?
PATIENT: Different? Hmm… well, I’m 73, Doctor. Something’s always different. Aches and pains, you know? Nothing specific springs to mind. Is this work important? Because I really don’t recall anything being wrong wrong. Just… old.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Croonquist. It's good you're not experiencing anything acutely concerning. This blood work is just a routine check-up, part of your regular Medicare benefits, to make sure everything is functioning as it should. It helps us catch potential issues early. Just to be complete, have you noticed any fever, chills, unusual fatigue, or any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. Chills… sometimes I get cold, but that’s just the house, you know? Old houses are drafty. Appetite… eat when I’m hungry, don’t when I’m not. Weight… haven't weighed myself in ages, honestly. Look, is this all necessary? I just want the lab work done and get on with my day. Doctor Evans, he… he knows what he's doing, right? He didn’t send me here for nothing?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Croonquist, Dr. Evans is an excellent physician. He ordered these tests as a preventative measure, and I'm simply going through the standard questions to ensure we have a complete picture of your health. It’s just part of the process. To clarify, you haven’t noticed any unexplained weight loss or gain, and your appetite feels normal overall?
PATIENT: Normal, I suppose. Eat a bit less in the winter, more in the summer. You know. Seasonality. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not a complicated case. Just… old. And tired of answering questions. Can we just get to the lab work now? I’ve got things to do. What do I need to do? Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. I understand your frustration. You're right, you've answered my questions thoroughly. We can proceed with the lab work. The lab is just down the hall, first door on the left. They'll need to draw some blood. It shouldn’t take too long. Before you go, could you quickly confirm any allergies you have to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Let me think… I don't recall having any major allergies. Bees, maybe? When I was a boy. But that was ages ago. Nothing serious. No, I don’t think so. Just… old. Can I go now? Really, I'm starting to feel a bit… agitated. Just want this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. No known drug allergies, that’s good. Yes, you can go ahead to the lab now. Just tell them Dr. Piet sent you for the blood work ordered by Dr. Evans. Here’s a requisition form for the lab technician. They will take care of you. Do you have any trouble walking or standing for extended periods?
PATIENT: No, no trouble walking. Still pretty sturdy for an old fella. Bit slow, perhaps. And maybe a little stiff in the mornings. But I can manage. Just… let’s get this done, alright? I appreciate you not keeping me all day. It’s… kind of you. Now, lab, you said? First door on the left?
DOCTOR: Yes, first door on the left. And you’re very welcome, Mr. Croonquist. We’ll get the results back to Dr. Evans as quickly as possible. He will review them with you at your next appointment. If you feel unwell at any point while you’re there, please let the lab technician know immediately. Thank you for coming in today.
PATIENT: Right. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… helpful. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
