DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit… strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really weak and tired lately, and I’ve also been quite yellow, you know, in my skin and eyes. It started a few days after I ate some fava beans. I love fava beans, but now… I’m not so sure.
DOCTOR: Weakness, fatigue… and jaundice, you said – yellowing of the skin and eyes. And this started shortly after consuming fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It wasn’t immediately after, maybe a day or two later. I didn't really connect it at first, but then I remembered something my grandmother used to say… something about beans and… well, I don’t quite remember what she said exactly, but it seemed important. It's just a feeling, I can't be sure. Is that… is that something doctors ever see? I feel a little silly even saying this.
DOCTOR: No, please, don’t feel silly at all. It’s good you’re sharing everything you remember. Your grandmother’s observation is… potentially relevant. There's a condition, quite rare, called Favism. It’s a genetic deficiency where certain individuals have trouble processing a substance in fava beans. It can cause a sudden onset of weakness, fatigue, and jaundice. Let's explore this a bit further. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, wow. Favism… that sounds like what’s happening. I didn't even know that was a thing! Let me think… Well, I’ve been a bit short of breath, especially when I walk up the stairs. And my urine… it’s been very dark, almost brown. And I think I had a bit of a fever last night, a mild one. Does that sound like… part of this Favism? I’m really starting to worry now.
DOCTOR: Dark urine, shortness of breath, mild fever… yes, those are consistent with what we might see with Favism, or with a more general breakdown of red blood cells. We need to run some tests to confirm. I'm going to start with a complete blood count – that will tell us a lot about your red blood cell levels. We’ll also check your liver function and kidney function, and do a urine analysis. Do you have any known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, tests sound good. I'm glad we're figuring things out. Let me see… allergies. Not really. I had a bit of a rash once when I used a new hand cream, but that was years ago. Otherwise, no, I don’t think so. I'm not on any regular medication either. Just over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally for headaches, but nothing consistent. And I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: No known allergies or regular medications. Good to know. Now, have you had any past medical problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major, really. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, that was… a long time ago. And I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but I haven't been seriously ill since. No surgeries other than the appendix, and no chronic conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure. Oh, and I wear glasses, as you can see! Is that important?
DOCTOR: No, glasses aren’t directly relevant at this point. Appendectomy as a teenager, childhood illnesses… and no other significant medical history. Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That’s a good question. My mother… she had some stomach problems when she was older, but I don’t know the details. My father was healthy as a horse, really. And my brother… he’s fine, as far as I know. We don’t see each other very often. No one that I know of ever had anything like this, though. Nothing with the blood or liver or anything. My grandmother... she was very old and always a bit frail, but I don’t know of any specific illnesses she had either, honestly. I wish I knew more about their medical histories. It might be helpful, wouldn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited family history available. We’ll proceed with the tests. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and look for any signs of jaundice. It shouldn’t take long. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds good. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just let me know if you need me to adjust or anything. I’m not very flexible these days!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Haggar. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Heart sounds are normal, but I do detect some mild wheezing in your lungs. Not overly concerning at this point, but worth noting. Your abdomen is soft, but a little tender in the upper right quadrant. I do see clear signs of jaundice in your skin and the whites of your eyes. It's moderate in severity. Okay, that confirms what we suspected. Now, I'll take your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Okay. That all sounds… a little worrying, but I’m glad you’re checking everything. My blood pressure is usually pretty good, I think. I try to eat healthy and walk as much as I can. I get a bit stressed sometimes, though, so maybe that affects it.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90, and your pulse is 92. That could be due to stress, as you mentioned, or it could be related to the underlying condition. We’ll keep an eye on it. Alright, Ms. Haggar, based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, Favism is certainly the most likely explanation for your symptoms. However, we need to confirm this with blood tests to rule out other possibilities. I'm also ordering a liver function panel and a complete blood count. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Favism… so that’s what you think it is? Is it… serious? And what does it mean, exactly? I mean, I’ve never heard of it before. And if it is Favism, will I have to avoid fava beans forever? I really do love them… Is there any treatment? I have so many questions! And… what about working? I have a job, you know. I’m a receptionist, I need to be able to work.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ms. Haggar. It's good you're asking. Favism can be serious, but it’s usually manageable. It's caused by a deficiency in an enzyme called G6PD. This enzyme protects your red blood cells. Without it, they can be destroyed after exposure to triggers like fava beans, certain medications, or infections. Treatment typically involves supportive care – hydration, rest, and avoiding triggers. We’ll also monitor your blood levels closely. Yes, if it is Favism, you'll likely need to avoid fava beans long-term, and we’ll give you a list of medications to avoid as well. Regarding work, it depends on the severity of your symptoms. If you're feeling weak and fatigued, you may need to take some time off until your blood levels improve. I can provide a note for your employer explaining your condition. Let's get the test results back first, and then we'll discuss a more specific plan. I’ll also refer you to a hematologist – a blood specialist – for further evaluation and management. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a little more sense, thank you. Supportive care… avoiding triggers… a hematologist… It’s a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. So, the tests will tell us for sure if it’s Favism, and how bad it is? And then the hematologist will… help me manage it long-term? How long will the tests take? I'm a bit anxious, to be honest. I just want to feel better soon. And I really hope I don't have to stop working. It's… important to me.
DOCTOR: Yes, the tests will confirm the diagnosis and give us a better understanding of the severity. The hematologist will develop a long-term management plan tailored to your needs. They’ll also advise you on how to avoid triggers and monitor your health. The results should be back within 24-48 hours. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available. We can then schedule an appointment with the hematologist. I understand your anxiety, and I want to reassure you that Favism is often manageable with proper care. We’ll do everything we can to help you feel better soon. In the meantime, please rest, stay hydrated, and avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you so much, Doctor Sham. You’ve been very helpful, and you’ve explained everything so clearly. I feel a little less worried, knowing what to expect. I’ll try to rest and stay hydrated, and I’ll wait for your call. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Haggar. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before I call with the results. Get well soon.
