DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepro. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Oh, my… what was I coming in for again? It’s… slipping my mind. Something about… pain? Down there, I think. Yes, that’s it. Pain. It’s been… well, I don’t really recall when it started, exactly. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, discomfort in the pelvic region. It’s perfectly alright that you're having trouble recalling the exact timing; that happens frequently. We’ll take our time to figure things out. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. It’s… it’s a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, thankfully. Just… persistent. Like a… a heaviness, perhaps? It comes and goes, but it’s been more frequent lately, I believe. Does that make any sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things. It’s… difficult to pinpoint, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Stepro. A dull ache, a heaviness... that’s helpful. And you mentioned it’s been more frequent recently. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if anything specifically makes the pain worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… I… honestly, I’m not sure. Nothing immediately springs to mind. Perhaps… walking? Yes, I think long walks seem to aggravate it a little. Not terribly, but… noticeable. And… sitting for extended periods, maybe? It’s… all rather vague, I’m afraid. I do a lot of wood work, so I’m often on my feet, but I can’t say if that’s helping or hurting, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay, so long walks and prolonged sitting may worsen the discomfort. It's good you mentioned the woodwork, as being on your feet is also relevant. Now, besides the pain itself, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Oh dear… let me see. Has my… digestion been different? Yes, I believe so. A little… slower, perhaps? And I’ve been feeling… more tired than usual, certainly. Not debilitatingly so, but… sluggish. It’s hard to say if that’s related, though. I'm getting older, after all.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, Ms. Stepro. Changes in digestion and increased fatigue. It’s good you mentioned the fatigue – it's always important to consider. And it's perfectly reasonable to wonder if these things are related to age; we’ll consider all possibilities. To get a more complete picture of your medical history, would you mind if I asked you a few questions about past illnesses, surgeries, and family history?
PATIENT: Oh, not at all, Doctor. Please, ask away. My memory isn't what it used to be, so you might have to prompt me, if that's alright. I've lived a full life, you see, and things get… muddled over time. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Of course. We can take all the time we need. Let’s start with past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I believe I had… a touch of high blood pressure, many years ago. The doctor put me on medication for a while, but it came down, and he took me off of it. That was… oh, goodness, at least ten years ago, I would imagine. Other than that… no, not that I recall. I’ve been quite healthy, for the most part. A few aches and pains, as one gets older, but nothing… serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of hypertension that has resolved. That's good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, a very long time ago. And… oh! Yes, I broke my wrist when I was younger, clumsily falling from a horse. That required a cast, and a rather lengthy recovery. Other than those two incidents, no, I haven't had any surgeries or been hospitalized.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child and a wrist fracture. And finally, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history. That’s… a bit complicated. My mother lived a long life, but she… suffered from arthritis, quite severely. My father… he passed away rather young, from a heart condition, I believe. He didn’t take very good care of himself, I’m afraid. And I have… a brother, somewhere. We’re not very close, and I haven’t seen him in years. I don't really know anything about his medical history, if that’s alright. It's all a bit hazy, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stepro. Knowing your mother had arthritis and your father had a heart condition is helpful. And it's completely understandable that you don't have information on your brother's medical history. Now, I’d like to ask you about any medications you are currently taking, as well as any allergies you have.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, medications. I take… this one for my cholesterol. A small dose, the doctor prescribed it a few years back. And… that's it, really. Nothing else regularly. As for allergies… I don’t think I have any. I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything. I might get a little itchy around cats, but that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… a dislike, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Okay, cholesterol medication and no known drug allergies. That's good. Now, to get a better understanding of your current symptoms, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Oh, a typical day… Well, I usually wake up fairly early, around six o'clock. I have a small breakfast – usually toast and coffee. Then I spend most of my day in my workshop, woodworking. I build… well, all sorts of things. Furniture, small boxes, decorative items. I enjoy it very much. It keeps me busy, and I like creating things with my hands. I take a break for lunch, a simple sandwich usually, and then work until late afternoon. In the evening, I… read, or watch a little television. It's a quiet life, mostly. Do you need more details?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Stepro. It sounds like you stay quite active! Knowing you spend a lot of time in the workshop helps me understand your situation. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination, if you're comfortable with that. This will help me assess your condition more thoroughly. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Please, go right ahead. I understand it's necessary. I trust your judgement. Do let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable, alright? My memory… it’s not always the best, so I might not realize it right away.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stepro. I will explain everything as I go and absolutely stop if anything causes discomfort. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Is there any tenderness in any particular area?
PATIENT: No, that’s alright. Ooh… yes, a little there, perhaps? Just a mild discomfort. It’s not… sharp, just… sensitive. Lower left side, I believe. It’s been a little achy lately, but I thought it was just… age.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild tenderness to palpation in the lower left quadrant. That's helpful information. I’m now going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Finally, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 135/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary findings of the physical examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing some pelvic discomfort and abdominal tenderness. It's difficult to say definitively what's causing this without further investigation. Do you have any fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No fever, thankfully. No vomiting, either. A little… sluggish digestion, as I mentioned before, but not really… changes in my bowel habits, no. Perhaps a little more… frequent, but nothing alarming. I have been drinking more water lately, so I thought that might be it. It's all rather… vague, isn’t it? I apologize for not being more helpful. My mind isn't what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Ms. Stepro. It's not your fault that the symptoms are vague; it's my job to try and make sense of things. Given your symptoms and the preliminary findings, there are a few possibilities we should consider. It could be related to muscle strain, referred pain from your back, or potentially a mild gastrointestinal issue. To get a clearer picture, I recommend we order some blood tests – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. These will help rule out any underlying infection or other medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood tests… yes, if that will help, then please, go right ahead. I trust your judgement completely. Do I need to make a separate appointment for those? And… will they be painful? I dislike needles, you see.
DOCTOR: No separate appointment is necessary. We can draw the blood samples here in the clinic today. And I understand your aversion to needles; many people feel that way. It’s a quick pinch, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. We’ll take it slowly, and I’ll be right here if you need anything. I will also order a pelvic ultrasound, which is a non-invasive imaging test that can provide more detailed information about your pelvic organs. This will help us rule out any structural abnormalities. We will schedule that for you shortly. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to drink plenty of fluids and avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as fever, severe abdominal pain, or changes in your bowel habits, please contact us immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright, Doctor. Ultrasound, blood tests, plenty of fluids… I can do that. Thank you… thank you very much for listening to me. It's… a relief to have someone looking into this. Will I receive a call with the results of the tests, or should I schedule another appointment? .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stepro. I’m glad I could help. Our office will contact you within 2-3 business days to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of your tests. They will likely call you beforehand to let you know the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Stepo. Have a good day.
