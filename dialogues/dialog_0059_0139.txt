DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s good to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just...fitness check. For referee. Need paper say I okay. Want quick, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. A fitness-for-duty examination for refereeing, understood. We can certainly work towards that. To ensure a thorough assessment, even for a routine check, I'll need to gather some information from you. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Just... ask. I have work later.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been generally healthy, or have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Um... mostly okay. No big sickness. Few small things. I work hard, sometimes back hurt. And... wife, she passed last year. Sad time. Not sure that’s…sickness, but…hard.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Shanor. Losing your wife is a profound loss, and it absolutely impacts your health and well-being. It's perfectly valid to mention that. We'll certainly keep that in mind as we proceed. And regarding your back pain – could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: It's…when I bend a lot. Work is…fixing furnaces, big ovens. Lots of kneeling, lifting. Sometimes feels okay, sometimes…stiff. Been like this…maybe five years. I take… pills. White ones. Don't remember name. Help a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, fixing furnaces and ovens – that’s physically demanding work. And five years of back pain… We'll definitely investigate that further. Let me just check your record here… Ah, yes. I see a prescription for Naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, filled approximately six months ago. Is that the white pill you were referring to?
PATIENT: Naproxen… yeah, that’s it! White pill. Makes it… less hurt. Not gone, just… less. Sometimes I take two. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's good you’re aware of the dosage, Mr. Shanor. Taking more than the prescribed amount of any medication can have potential side effects, even over-the-counter ones. Two Naproxen is above the typical recommended dose, so it's something we should address. Before we proceed, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you may have, or have been treated for in the past?
PATIENT: No… not really. Maybe… high blood pressure? Doctor told me… years ago. Give me pills for that too. Small blue ones. I take them every day, I think. Forgot to refill last month. Not feeling so good when I don’t take them. Head hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially high blood pressure as well. It's important to maintain consistent blood pressure management, especially with your active job. And it sounds like you've noticed symptoms when you miss doses of your medication – that's good awareness. Let me see… Ah, yes. You are prescribed Lisinopril for hypertension. It appears your last refill was indeed last month. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. No problems with food. No bad skin things when I touch plants. Nothing I know of. Wife… she had allergies. But not me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's good to know. Now, could you briefly tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Um… hard to say. Family… mostly in China. Don’t see them much. Wife’s family… her mother had… heart problems. She died young. That's all I know really. Not close. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Shanor. It's common not to have detailed family medical history information readily available. Knowing about your wife’s mother’s heart condition is helpful, though. Finally, before we move on to a physical examination, do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. No smoke. Little bit of beer sometimes. With friends. Maybe one or two. Not every week. No… other things. Never. I need to be strong for work. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Shanor. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and briefly assess your back. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Quick, yeah? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll keep it as efficient as possible. Please have a seat on the examination table and loosen your shirt. First, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 148/92. We’ll need to address that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Your heart sounds are regular, but I can hear some mild crackling in your lower lungs, which could be related to past or current respiratory issues. Now, let's briefly assess your back. Could you point to where you feel the most pain?
PATIENT: Here. When I bend. And… when I lift heavy things. Hurts a lot then. Like… something stuck. Not always. Sometimes okay. Depends.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling some tenderness in your lower back, right side, as you indicated. You also mentioned a “stuck” feeling. Can you describe that sensation a bit more?
PATIENT: Like… can’t get straight. Need to wiggle. Like… something pulled. Not broken, I don’t think. Just… stuck. Hurts to move. Need to take pills then.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. Your range of motion is somewhat limited, and I can appreciate some muscle guarding. It sounds like you may be experiencing a muscle strain or sprain, possibly aggravated by your work. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few tests. An X-ray of your lower back would help rule out any structural issues, and a basic blood panel would give us a clearer picture of your overall health and kidney function, especially considering your blood pressure and medication usage. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… okay. As long as quick. Need paper for referee. How long tests take?
DOCTOR: The tests themselves usually don’t take long – the blood draw will be a few minutes, and the X-ray will be relatively quick as well. The wait time for the results, however, can vary. I'd estimate approximately 2-3 business days for the results to come back. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your Lisinopril as prescribed and avoiding any heavy lifting or strenuous activity that exacerbates your back pain. You can continue to take Naproxen for pain relief, but I advise limiting it to the prescribed dosage – no more than two tablets per day – and only when necessary. Once we have the results, we can discuss a more definitive diagnosis and create a tailored treatment plan. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Okay. Two pills. Three days. Fine. Where I go for tests? Need paper for referee after, right? That’s important.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. The paper for the referee association is a priority, and we'll get that sorted as soon as we have the test results. Here’s the requisition form for the blood work and X-ray. You can take this to the lab at [Clinic Lab Address]. They’re open from [Clinic Lab Opening Time] to [Clinic Lab Closing Time] Monday through Friday. And here’s a note indicating that you are undergoing a medical evaluation for fitness-for-duty purposes. I’ll also include a brief summary of your current condition for the referee association. Once the results are back, my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions about the testing process or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: No. I think… okay. Thank you, Doctor. I go now. Need to work.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Shanor. I understand you have a busy schedule. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and be mindful of your back.
