DOCTOR: Talofa lava, Carmaleta. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I just… I want to get this over with. I lost my husband a few years back, and I’d like to… well, have a baby. Before it’s too late, you know? I don’t want any trouble getting pregnant, if that makes sense. I just want it to work. I’m not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Carmaleta. That’s a very valid and important reason to come in, and it's good you're thinking about this now. It’s completely normal to want things to go smoothly, especially after everything you’ve been through. So, to get a better picture of things, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… I haven’t really thought about it, to be honest. It was… a long time ago. I think… I was pregnant once, but it didn’t… work out. Very early on. That was before I met my husband, actually. I don’t remember much about it. Is that important? I really don’t dwell on things like that. It was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright that you haven’t been dwelling on it, Carmaleta. It’s more important to focus on now and moving forward. And yes, it’s good to know about any previous pregnancies, even if they were early on. It helps us get a complete picture. Do you recall roughly when that pregnancy was?
PATIENT: Ugh, when? Honestly, Doctor, that was… before the turn of the century. Maybe… 1998, 1999? Somewhere around then, I think. It was a very messy breakup, so I’ve blocked a lot of it out. I really don’t want to rehash old relationships. Is this really necessary? It feels like we're digging up a lot of unpleasant things.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Carmaleta, and I apologize if it’s bringing up difficult memories. We’re not trying to dwell on the past, but just gathering information that could be relevant to your fertility. Knowing the approximate timing helps us understand potential factors. Okay, 1998, 1999. That's helpful. Now, besides that pregnancy, have you had any significant medical conditions or surgeries?
PATIENT: Significant… Hmm. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, maybe ten years old? And… I've had the usual things, colds, the flu, a bad sprain once. Nothing major. Honestly, I’m generally healthy. I eat pretty well, mostly. I try to, anyway. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink. Is that good? Should I be listing every little sniffle I’ve ever had?
DOCTOR: No, definitely not every little sniffle! You’re giving me exactly the information I need. Appendix out as a child, otherwise generally healthy, good diet, no smoking, and rarely drink – that’s all excellent. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there a family history of any medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers, or anything related to fertility issues – on either your side or your husband’s side?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That's… complicated. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And her sister, my aunt, had… something with her stomach, a long time ago. Cancer, maybe? It was a while back. And my husband’s side… honestly, I didn’t really know his family. We didn’t get along with them very well, and he didn’t talk much about them. So… probably not? I honestly couldn’t tell you. I’m not the family history expert, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright, Carmaleta. It's perfectly common not to have a detailed family history, especially if relationships were strained. High blood pressure in your mother, possible stomach cancer in your aunt – that’s good to know. And it’s okay that you don’t have information about your husband’s side. Now, a few questions about you personally. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, vitamins… let me think. I take a multivitamin, sometimes. When I remember. And… occasionally, I’ll take something for headaches, ibuprofen, I guess. That’s about it. Really. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. I don’t like feeling… medicated. I try to handle things naturally, if I can. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all! That's good to know, Carmaleta. Multivitamin occasionally, ibuprofen for headaches when needed - that's helpful. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not really. I get a bit of a runny nose in the spring, but that's just… seasonal. Nothing serious. I can eat anything. I’m not one of those picky eaters. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a pretty straightforward case. Healthy, no allergies, no major medical history… Why are we even doing this?
DOCTOR: It’s good to rule things out, Carmaleta. Even being a "straightforward case" means we need to gather this information to make sure everything is as it seems, and to guide any further testing if needed. Alright. Now, to get a better understanding of where you are now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Let’s just get it over with. The sooner I know if there's a problem, the sooner I can… move on. Just… please be quick. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Carmaleta. I'll be as efficient as possible. If you don’t mind, could you please lie down on the table?
PATIENT: Just… hurry, please. This is uncomfortable. And I really don't like doctors. Never have.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re not a fan of doctors, and I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I’m just checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. Everything feels normal so far. No tenderness to the touch. Bowel sounds are present and normal. Blood pressure is 128/78, and pulse is 72. Thyroid feels normal as well. No enlargement or nodules. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. Everything sounds good so far. Physically, everything appears normal. However, to get a clearer picture, I would recommend some basic blood work to check your hormone levels and rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, blood work… Of course. Just what I needed. Look, Doctor, can we just get a list of pills I need to take? Maybe that’s all this is. A vitamin deficiency or something. I don’t want a lot of tests. I really don’t. I just want a baby, or to know if it’s not going to happen, so I can… stop wasting time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. I truly do. We’re not trying to waste your time, and I’m trying to be as efficient as possible. While a vitamin deficiency is possible, it’s important to rule out other potential causes of infertility before starting any treatment. The blood work will give us a much clearer picture of your hormone levels, ovarian reserve, and overall health. It typically includes tests for FSH, LH, estradiol, prolactin, and a complete blood count. It’s a standard panel and relatively quick. Would you be willing to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Fine. But if everything comes back normal, I don’t want any more tests. And I don't want to talk about why those hormones are important. I just want results. Can we at least do the blood work here? I don’t want to have to come back again. This is exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay, Carmaleta, that's perfectly understandable. We can absolutely do the blood work here today to save you another trip. And I promise, we won’t delve into the details of every hormone unless absolutely necessary. We’ll focus on the results and what they mean for you. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now. She’ll explain everything as she goes. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes, and the results should be back in a few days. We'll call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I’m going to write up a prescription for a prenatal vitamin, just to get you started. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry. And please, don't keep me waiting. I have a life to get back to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Carmaleta. I understand. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and explain the process. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Thank you for coming in today.
