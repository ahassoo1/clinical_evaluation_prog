DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovec. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Pavlovec is the name. It’s… well, it’s this cough. Been bothering me for a while now. A dry cough, mostly. Not much… not much else, really. Hard to say how long, though. Time gets away from you, you know?
DOCTOR: I do know, Mr. Pavlovec. It certainly does. A dry cough, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, dry. Not much… phlegm, or anything. Just… a tickle, and then I cough. Happens more when I… when I’m resting, I think. Or maybe not. It’s hard to say for sure. My wife… she always knew best about these things. But she’s… gone now.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Pavlovec. It’s never easy adjusting to such a loss. Let’s focus on this cough for now, and we’ll take our time. So, it’s mostly dry, and you’ve noticed it more when resting, you think?
PATIENT: Yes, resting. Or… maybe when it’s quiet. Hard to tell. I used to work on cars, you know. Body work. Lots of dust and… fumes. Could be something from that, maybe? It’s been a long time, though. A very long time. Don't even remember the last time I really thought about it.
DOCTOR: That's good information, Mr. Pavlovec. Working with cars and being exposed to dust and fumes for a long time definitely could contribute to things. And it’s helpful to know it’s been a long time since you’ve been doing that work. Just to be thorough, have you had any fever, chills, or shortness of breath along with the cough?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I recall. Chills… sometimes I get a little cold, but that’s just old age, I figure. Shortness of breath… no, not really. I get tired easily, but that's… well, I'm ninety years old, Doctor! I don't run around like I used to.
DOCTOR: That's fair enough, Mr. Pavlovec. Ninety years is quite a milestone! No fever, no chills, no shortness of breath… that’s good. And you're right, fatigue is common at your age. Now, just to get a better picture, are you experiencing any chest pain, or any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, not really. Sometimes a little… achey, maybe? But that’s probably just my bones. Swelling… hmm. I haven’t looked at my feet in a while. My daughter usually reminds me to take care of things like that. She's a good girl. I don't think I'm swollen, but I couldn't say for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that, Mr. Pavlovec. It’s helpful to have all this information. Would you mind if I listened to your lungs and checked your heart?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. My lungs… haven’t thought much about them lately. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice, deep breath in… and out… again… good. And one more… Alright, everything sounds clear, but I do hear a little bit of…wheezing in your lower lungs. Not alarming, but something we should keep an eye on. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. Just relax, Mr. Pavlovec. Deep breaths again. Your heart rate is a little slow, which is common at your age, and I don't hear any unusual sounds. Now, let's check your blood pressure and oxygen levels.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Oxygen levels… important, is it? My grandson, he’s a… a scientist, I think. He talks about oxygen all the time. He’s a smart boy, that one. Go ahead, do what you need to. I’m just glad someone is looking into this cough. It’s been… nagging at me.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Pavlovec, and it's wonderful your grandson is a scientist! They often have a good understanding of these things. Alright, your blood pressure is a little on the lower side, which isn’t necessarily a concern given your age, and your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low, but not critically so. Now, to get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any long-term health conditions, like heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… that’s a long time ago. Let me think… My wife, she handled all that. She kept all the papers. I… I think I had high blood pressure, once. A long time ago. They gave me some pills. But I can’t remember much else. No diabetes, I don’t think. And no lung disease… just the cough, of course. I had a bad flu when I was a boy, but that was… a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Pavlovec. It's completely understandable that you don't remember everything. High blood pressure in the past is good to know. And it’s helpful to rule out diabetes or lung disease. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital… hmm. I broke my hip a few years back. Fell in the garden. They fixed it up, though. That was… painful. And I had my appendix out when I was young. That’s all I can really remember. Maybe there was something else… but my mind isn’t what it used to be. It’s like trying to grab smoke.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Pavlovec. Broken hip and appendix out – that’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just a little something for my arthritis. A white pill. I think it’s ibuprofen. Sometimes I take something for sleep, too, when I can’t get to rest. A small blue one. That's about it. Nothing fancy. My daughter usually fills the pill box for me, so I don't have to worry about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen for arthritis and something for sleep. That’s helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. I eat just about anything. My wife used to say I had a cast iron stomach. She’d always make me try new foods. I don’t think I’ve ever had a bad reaction to anything, though. Not that I recall. I get a little itchy sometimes, but that’s just old age, I figure.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's good. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I mostly stay at home now. Too old to do much gardening anymore. I used to love working with my hands, fixing things. Now I mostly watch television and… think. My daughter comes by often, brings me groceries and makes sure I’m okay. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol, just a little wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful, Mr. Pavlovec. Now, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you have a chronic cough, likely related to a combination of factors, including your age, past exposure to dust and fumes, and possibly some mild arthritis and low oxygen levels. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but we should investigate further to rule out anything more concerning. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. My lungs… haven't been checked in a long time. Yes, go ahead with the X-ray. As long as it doesn’t take too long… I get tired easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pavlovec. We'll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I'll have the radiology technician come in and explain the procedure to you. They'll just need you to stand or sit in front of a special machine for a few moments. While we’re waiting, I'm going to write down some initial recommendations. I'd like you to continue taking your arthritis medication as prescribed. I also recommend drinking plenty of fluids to help thin out any mucus. And try to avoid any irritants that might worsen your cough, like smoke or strong perfumes. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Fluids… yes, I can do that. My daughter always reminds me to drink water. And no smoke… I haven’t been around smoke in years. No, I don’t think so. Sounds… reasonable. Just worried about what the X-ray might show, I suppose. Is it… is it usually something bad?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about the X-ray, Mr. Pavlovec. Most of the time, X-rays show nothing concerning. They're just a way for us to get a clearer picture of what's going on inside your lungs. In your case, it’s mainly to rule out things like pneumonia or any other lung issues. We're being proactive, that's all. I'll be sure to explain the results to you thoroughly as soon as they come in. And if anything is found, we’ll discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, let's just focus on getting through the X-ray. Do you think you’d be able to walk down to the radiology department, or would you prefer a wheelchair?
PATIENT: A wheelchair… probably a wheelchair, Doctor. My legs aren’t what they used to be. Don’t want to fall or anything. Yes, a wheelchair would be much appreciated. Thank you. It’s kind of you to ask. I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Not a bother at all, Mr. Pavlovec. We’re here to help. I’ll have a technician bring a wheelchair right away. Once the X-ray is done, they’ll bring you right back, and we can discuss the next steps. To recap, we’re doing an X-ray to rule out any lung issues, you’ll continue taking your arthritis medication, and we’re focusing on staying hydrated and avoiding irritants. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Hydrated, arthritis pills, no smoke… and an X-ray. Yes, that’s right. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old man like me. I appreciate it. I just want to be able to breathe a little easier. That’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Pavlovec. It’s my pleasure. And you’re not just an “old man,” you’re a valued patient. And that’s exactly what we’re aiming for – to help you breathe a little easier. Let me just quickly write down a note for the radiology department about your preference for a wheelchair. The technician should be here any moment now. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Just… waiting for the wheelchair now. Thank you again for your kindness. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I get… a little restless, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll check with the radiology department to make sure they’re ready for you. And I’ll be right here when you get back. Don’t hesitate to ask if you need anything at all while you wait. We’ll get you breathing easier in no time, Mr. Pavlovec.
