DOCTOR: Hi Colt, good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, I suppose. It's these… episodes. My wife, Srey, she’s the one who made the appointment, honestly. She says I get confused. I don’t feel confused, not really. Just… things aren’t always where I expect them to be, or I ask a question I just asked. It’s not a big deal, but she worries.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good she's looking out for you, and it's helpful you're both here to talk about it. It sounds like you're experiencing some changes in your memory or awareness – maybe some difficulty with recall, or a little disorientation. When did you first start noticing these “episodes,” as you call them?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not new new. Probably… six months, maybe? Hard to say exactly. Things just… started feeling off. It's not like I forget everything, mind you. I remember perfectly well how to set tile, been doing it forty years. And I know all my customers. It's just… smaller things. Like where I put my glasses, or what I was saying mid-sentence. Srey says I repeat myself. She's always been one to notice details. Too many details, if you ask me. But, six months, I think. Around the time the monsoon season really started last year. It’s been a bit wetter than usual, you know?
DOCTOR: Six months, okay. And it seems to have started around when the monsoon season began – that's good to know, we can always look for patterns. So, these episodes… can you describe a typical one?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. Usually, it's something small. Like, I'll be in the kitchen, getting a glass of water. And I just… stop. I know I need water, but I can't for the life of me remember why I'm in the kitchen. Or I'll start telling Srey about a job I did, and halfway through, I just… lose the thought. And then I’ll ask her if I told her about it already. She gets frustrated, naturally. Sometimes, if I'm driving, I’ll take a wrong turn and not even realize it until she points it out. It’s not dangerous, not yet anyway, but it's… unsettling. It’s like a little gap in my thinking.
DOCTOR: Okay, so these are more like momentary lapses in recall or awareness, happening throughout the day. They don’t seem to be associated with any major confusion or loss of consciousness, is that right?
PATIENT: No, no. Nothing like that. I’m perfectly aware. It’s just… frustrating. Like trying to grab a thread that keeps slipping through your fingers. And it's not like I’m wandering around lost or anything. Srey would never let that happen. She keeps a close eye on me. A very close eye. It's just... annoying. And she worries, and when she worries, I worry. It’s a whole thing. Is this something serious? Because I still need to work, you know? Can’t just sit around. Tile doesn’t set itself.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it's impacting your daily life and causing stress for both of you, and it's good you're both being proactive. It’s definitely worth investigating to see what might be going on. There are several possibilities, and it's important to rule things out. To get a better picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if that’s okay. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions in the past, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let's see. High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me years ago. I take a little pill for it every morning. Keeps it under control, mostly. Srey makes sure I take it. And… I had some trouble with my knees a few years back, arthritis. Nothing major, just aches and pains. They gave me some cream for it. And… that’s about it, I think. Never been much for going to the doctor, to be honest. Unless something’s broken, I usually just tough it out. What does my blood pressure have to do with… forgetting where I put my glasses?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, thank you. High blood pressure, even when controlled, can sometimes contribute to changes in memory and thinking, so it’s important to consider. And arthritis, while not directly linked, can sometimes affect overall well-being and contribute to difficulty concentrating. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed ‘em. And… no hospital stays, not unless you count when my son was born, many years ago. That was just overnight, Srey needed the help, not me. Otherwise, I’ve been… lucky, I suppose. Always been a strong man. Worked hard my whole life. Didn’t take much sick leave. Tile doesn’t set itself, you know. Keeps you moving. Never been one to sit still. It’s the sitting still that’ll kill you, not the work.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. No surgeries or hospitalizations beyond your son's birth is helpful information. Next, I’d like to ask about your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any memory problems, dementia, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm... that’s a good question. My father… he got a little forgetful towards the end, yes. Just… old age, I think. He didn’t recognize me a few times near the very end. It was sad. But he lived a long life, worked hard his whole life too, farming rice. My mother, she was always sharp as a tack. Never forgot a thing. My brother… he’s still perfectly fine, living in Phnom Penh, running a shop. No, I don’t think so. No one in the family had… what did you call it? Dementia? No, I don’t think so. It’s probably just me getting old. It happens, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It does happen, and family history can be a piece of the puzzle. It sounds like your father experienced some memory loss later in life, but your mother was clear-headed, and your brother is currently well. Okay. Now, I want to ask about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little. Beer, mostly. With dinner sometimes. Not every night, mind you. And not much. One or two bottles, maybe. It helps me relax. After a long day setting tile, it loosens me up. Srey doesn’t like it, says it’s bad for my health, but… a little beer never hurt anyone. I don’t get drunk, not anymore. Just a little to unwind. What’s a little beer got to do with forgetting where I put my glasses?
DOCTOR: Okay, so moderate alcohol consumption. That's good to know. And do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Never had the urge. Srey wouldn’t allow it, even if I did. She's very particular about my health. Says I need to take care of myself, especially now that I’m getting older. She’s always lecturing me about eating right and getting enough sleep. Sometimes I think she worries too much. But, no. Never smoked. Not even a cigarette. Always been a healthy man, mostly. Tile doesn’t set itself, you know. You need strong lungs for that.
DOCTOR: That's good. No smoking is excellent. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Just the one for my blood pressure. And the cream for my knees when they act up, which isn’t often. That’s it. I don’t like taking pills, never have. Unless absolutely necessary. I prefer to tough it out. Tile doesn’t set itself, but it doesn’t require a pharmacy either. Everything I need, I can handle myself. Srey keeps trying to get me to take vitamins, but I refuse. I eat plenty of fish, that’s good enough for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication and occasional knee cream. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a baseline. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological check – just to assess your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Do what you need to do. But I’m telling you, I feel perfectly fine. Just a little forgetful, that’s all. It’s the stress, I think. Running a business, making sure the customers are happy… it takes a lot out of a man. Tile doesn’t set itself, but it does require a sharp mind. Just get it over with, alright? I have a job site to get to this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. It won't take long. If you could just sit here for me... First, let’s check your blood pressure. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated today, but that could be due to stress or being in the clinic. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart and lungs sound good. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and balance... Okay, everything seems within normal limits, but I did notice your gait is a little slower than usual. Do you experience any dizziness or falls?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No, not really. Sometimes I feel a little lightheaded when I stand up quickly, but that’s nothing new. Happens when I’m tired. And falls? No, I haven't fallen. Srey would have my hide if I fell. She's always warning me to be careful. I just… feel a little slower these days, that's all. Getting old, I suppose. It happens, doesn't it? Tile doesn't set itself, but it does require a steady hand, and these days… well, let’s just say my hands aren’t as steady as they used to be. Is that what this is about? Just getting old?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to experience some changes with age, Colt. However, the combination of these episodes, the slightly elevated blood pressure, and the slower gait does warrant further investigation. To get a better picture of what might be going on, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will check your thyroid function, vitamin levels , and rule out any underlying infections or other medical conditions. I also think a brain scan, like an MRI, would be helpful to get a clearer view of your brain structure and rule out any concerning issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Brain scan? Now hold on a minute. That sounds… serious. Is something wrong? Is this about my brain? Because I feel perfectly fine. I may forget where I put my glasses sometimes, but my brain is working just fine. Tile doesn't set itself, but it requires a sharp mind, and I still have that! I don’t like the sound of a brain scan at all. What exactly are you looking for? And what if it shows something bad? Srey is going to have a fit if she finds out I’m getting a brain scan. She'll worry herself sick. Maybe we should just stick to the blood tests. Those don’t sound so… invasive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Colt. It is a bit unsettling to think about getting a brain scan. And you're right to ask what we're looking for. The purpose of the scan isn't to look for anything specific at this point – it’s more of a precautionary measure. It helps us rule out any structural issues that could be contributing to your symptoms, like small strokes, tumors, or fluid buildup. Think of it like getting an oil change for your car. You don't necessarily expect to find anything wrong, but it's good to check to make sure everything is running smoothly. And it’s important to remember that most of the time, these scans come back normal. We can certainly start with the blood tests, and we can discuss the brain scan further after we get the results. Would that make you feel more comfortable?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Blood tests first. But if those come back normal, I’m not getting any brain scan. Not happening. Srey can worry all she wants, but I’m not putting myself through that. Tile doesn't set itself, but it doesn't require unnecessary poking and prodding either. Just get it over with. Where do I go for the blood tests? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a job site to get back to, you know. I can't just sit around waiting for tests.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like a good plan, Colt. We'll start with the blood tests. I'll write you a requisition, and you can get them done at the lab just across the street. They're open until 5 pm today. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I’d like to discuss some lifestyle modifications that might help. Ensuring you're getting enough sleep, staying hydrated, and managing stress levels are all important. We can also talk about fall prevention strategies to keep you safe. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Alright. Sleep, water, less stress… I hear you. Easier said than done, though. Running a business is stressful, and sometimes those early mornings are rough. Fall prevention… Srey already lectures me about that enough. She’s always telling me to hold onto the railing, watch my step, and so on. Just get me the requisition for the blood tests, alright? And tell your nurse to call me as soon as the results are in. I have tile to set, you know. Can’t just sit around waiting for tests.
DOCTOR: Of course, Colt. Here’s the requisition form, and this pamphlet has some helpful tips for preventing falls. And my nurse will definitely call you as soon as the results are in. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – any dizziness, confusion, or weakness – please don’t hesitate to call the office right away. And remember, we're here to help you every step of the way. Take care, Colt, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you. I suppose. Just… let me know when those results are in. I have work to do. And tell your nurse to make it quick, alright? I don’t have time for this. .
