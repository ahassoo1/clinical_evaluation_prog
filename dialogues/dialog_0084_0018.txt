DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I seem to be going to the bathroom… a great deal. More than usual, certainly. I’m not quite sure when it started, precisely. Perhaps a few weeks ago? It's just... frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay. Frequent urination. I understand it can be bothersome, and you're right, it's good you brought it up. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Though, truthfully, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It could be a little longer. I just know it’s… noticeable. It’s disrupting things a bit. I don't recall any pain, though. Or burning. Just… going often. And a fair amount each time, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain or burning, just increased frequency and volume. Okay. To get a better picture, can you tell me roughly how often you're going throughout the day?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. I don’t really keep track, you see. Perhaps every couple of hours during the day? Maybe more. It's hard to say precisely. I do find myself getting up once or twice during the night as well, which is new. I usually sleep quite soundly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so several times during the day, and waking up one or two times at night to urinate. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t believe so. It looks… normal, I suppose. The usual color. Not cloudy. No blood, as far as I can tell. It’s just… there, more of it, more often. I haven't really examined it closely, if that makes sense. I just… go.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. No noticeable changes in color or clarity. Okay. Now, let's talk about other things. Do you have any other symptoms at all – like increased thirst, fatigue, or any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Increased thirst… now that you mention it, perhaps a little. I have been drinking more water than usual, yes. I just assumed it was the weather. It's been rather warm, you see. Fatigue… I am a bit tired, generally. But I am 56, Doctor, so that hardly seems noteworthy. No swelling, though. My shoes fit as they always have.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst and some fatigue, but no swelling. And you're 56. Good to know. Do you have any history of diabetes, or has anyone in your family had diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes… I don’t believe so. Not that I am aware of, anyway. My parents… my mother, I believe she had some issues with her blood sugar later in life, but I don’t recall it being formally diagnosed as diabetes. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very involved in her healthcare, I’m afraid. I just know she was always a bit weak. My father… I don't recall any specific health issues, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history is unclear regarding diabetes. Do you take any medications currently, Mr. Verbos?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any regular medications. Just the occasional aspirin for a headache, perhaps. Nothing prescribed, nothing ongoing. I try to stay healthy, you see. I eat a reasonable diet, and I walk when the weather permits. I believe in a good, simple life.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Good. And do you have any allergies to anything – medications, foods, environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything. I’m not particularly sensitive, I don’t believe. Perhaps a slight sniffle with pollen in the spring, but nothing serious. I’ve always been quite robust, health-wise. At least, until this recent… issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mr. Verbos. I'd like to do a quick physical exam and then order a urine test. The urine test will help us check for infection or sugar in your urine. During the exam, I'll listen to your heart and lungs and feel your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A physical exam and a urine test. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you see. It's rather unsettling, this constant… need to go. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please sit up and relax your arm. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I don’t feel any masses. Now, let's collect a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup, and I'll leave you a little privacy. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample, if you can. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. A mid-stream sample… I remember something about that from years ago. Just… relax and try to get a clean sample. Yes. Thank you. Where should I… leave the cup? And how long do I have? I don't want to be a bother. It's just… sometimes these things are a little awkward, you see.
DOCTOR: No bother at all, Mr. Verbos. There's a little shelf just outside the door. Once you’ve collected the sample, just leave it there, and I’ll come get it. Don’t worry about rushing. Just take your time. And I’ll be right outside if you need anything.
PATIENT: Very good. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll just… excuse myself for a moment. .
DOCTOR:
