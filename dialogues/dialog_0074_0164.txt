DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and…yellow. Like, my skin and eyes are a bit yellow, and it started after I ate some fava beans. I love fava beans, but then I started feeling awful a couple of days later. It’s just… worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Haggar. That is concerning, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. Yellowing of the skin and eyes – that's what we call jaundice – and the timing with the fava beans is definitely something we need to explore. Just to be clear, when you say “a couple of days later,” can you give me a rough estimate of how many days after eating the fava beans did you start noticing the yellowing and feeling unwell?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… I had them on Saturday, and I think I started noticing the yellowing on Monday. So, maybe two days? It wasn’t super obvious at first, just a little bit off, and then it got worse throughout Tuesday. The tiredness came on more gradually, but it was definitely noticeable by Monday as well. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Two days is important information. And you mentioned feeling tired – can you describe that tiredness a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not just regular tired, you know? Like after a long day. It's… everything feels like a huge effort. Even getting out of bed is hard. And I feel weak, sort of shaky sometimes. I’ve also been a bit short of breath just doing simple things, like walking up the stairs. I didn’t think much of it at first, just figured I was getting old, but then I noticed the yellowing and started to worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Haggar. Weakness, shakiness, and shortness of breath along with the jaundice and fatigue… that’s quite a constellation of symptoms. Given the connection with the fava beans, we need to consider a few possibilities. Do you have any known allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can remember. I eat pretty much everything. I haven’t changed anything in my diet recently, except for… well, the fava beans, of course. My mother always warned me about them, now that I think about it…something about being sensitive, but I never paid much attention.
DOCTOR: Hmm, interesting. Your mother's warning is certainly relevant. Okay, and are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I try to stay away from medications if I can. Just a multivitamin every now and then, but I haven’t taken one in weeks. I really pride myself on being healthy, which is why this is so strange. I eat well, I exercise… I just don’t understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Haggar. It is concerning when someone who generally feels well experiences something like this. Given your symptoms and the timing with the fava beans, I'm concerned about the possibility of G6PD deficiency, which can cause a reaction after eating certain foods, like fava beans. To investigate further, I'd like to do a physical exam and then order some blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A physical exam and blood tests… yes, please. I just want to find out what’s going on and get it sorted out. Is it something serious? I’m a little scared, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be scared, Ms. Haggar, and I appreciate you being so open with me. We’ll take things one step at a time. G6PD deficiency can cause a range of symptoms, and while it can be serious, it’s often manageable with certain precautions. The blood tests will help us determine if that’s what’s going on. If you’ll just have a seat here, I’ll start with a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take a look at your skin and eyes more closely. Then, we’ll draw some blood. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better knowing we’re figuring things out. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start then. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No enlargement or masses. Now, I see the jaundice in your sclera – definitely yellowish discoloration. Your skin also appears slightly jaundiced. And I notice some slight pallor. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 88 and regular. Okay, Ms. Haggar. Based on the exam, the jaundice is present, and there's some pallor. That further supports the need for blood tests to determine the cause. I'm going to order a complete blood count , a liver panel, a bilirubin level , a reticulocyte count, and a G6PD enzyme level. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. All those tests… I’m happy to have them done, if it will help us figure out what’s going on. CBC, liver panel, bilirubin… G6PD… yes, please. How long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back again? I hope it’s not something too serious. I have a small garden I really need to tend to!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Haggar, and I assure you we’ll get to the bottom of this. The lab usually takes about 24-48 hours to process these tests, so we should have the results by tomorrow or the day after. You will need to come back for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and plan further treatment, if needed. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that for you before you leave. While we wait for the results, I want to advise you to avoid fava beans and any other foods that might trigger a reaction. I’ll provide you with a list of those. And, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe weakness, shortness of breath, dark urine, or confusion – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That’s very helpful, thank you, Doctor. A list of foods to avoid… yes, please. And I will definitely keep an eye out for those worsening symptoms. It's good to know what to look for. Um… is this something I could pass on to my children? They both enjoy gardening too, and I wouldn’t want them to eat something dangerous. Is it hereditary?
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Ms. Haggar, and I’m glad you asked. G6PD deficiency is an inherited condition, meaning it can be passed down from parents to children. It’s carried on the X chromosome, so it affects males more severely than females. If you are diagnosed with G6PD deficiency, your children would be at risk of inheriting it. We can discuss genetic testing for your children if you wish. It’s important to note that not everyone who inherits the gene will have symptoms, but they would be carriers and need to be aware of potential triggers. For now, it's best to focus on getting your diagnosis confirmed and then we can discuss genetic testing options if you are interested. I will have the lab include information about genetic counseling with the test request. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be alright, thank you. Genetic counseling sounds… sensible. It’s good to know all the options. I hadn't even thought about that. So, avoiding fava beans, watching for worsening symptoms, and genetic counseling… okay. I think that's all I need to know for now. When will the receptionist schedule the follow-up? I want to make sure I can get in quickly once the results are back. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. I feel much less anxious now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Haggar. I’m glad I could ease your anxiety. The receptionist will schedule the follow-up appointment before you leave, and she will prioritize getting you in as soon as the results are available – likely within a few days. It looks like Sarah at the front desk has already scheduled you for a follow-up appointment on August 7th at 10:00 AM. Does that time work for you?
PATIENT: August 7th at 10:00 AM… yes, that’s perfect. That gives me time to avoid any questionable beans! Thank you so much, Doctor. I really appreciate your help. I think that’s everything. I’ll go see Sarah now, I suppose?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, please see Sarah at the front desk. She'll provide you with the list of foods to avoid and answer any other questions you might have. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Haggar. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, if you experience any worsening symptoms, go to the emergency room immediately. I wish you all the best.
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you too, Doctor Reisig. Thank you again for everything. .
