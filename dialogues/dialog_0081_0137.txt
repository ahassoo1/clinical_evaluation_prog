DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My… how you say… the place for old people? My family want me to go live there. They say I need… checkup first. For the place. They want to make sure I am okay.
DOCTOR: A checkup for a potential move to assisted living, alright. I understand. So, it sounds like your family is being proactive, wanting to ensure you're in good health before making any decisions. That's… sensible, I suppose. Let’s start with why you are here today. Are you experiencing any specific health concerns that prompted this visit, or is this primarily to satisfy their requirements?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not… much. I feel okay, mostly. Sometimes my knees hurt when I walk too much. And I forget things… but everyone forgets, yes? It’s just… getting older. My daughter, she worry too much. She make the appointment. I think she just want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Right. "Everyone forgets," yes. A common sentiment. But we need to determine how much forgetting, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s important to differentiate between normal age-related changes and something more… concerning. And the knee pain, we’ll certainly address that. Now, regarding this forgetting… can you give me a specific example?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Like… yesterday, I make coffee for my husband, but I forget to give it to him! He was reading the paper, and the coffee… just sit there. He found it later, cold. And sometimes… names. I know the face, but the name… gone. It's little things. Not big.
DOCTOR: Alright. Forgetting a cup of coffee, misplacing names… those can be normal. But we need a clearer picture. Has this been happening gradually, or did it seem to start suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Not… boom, all at once. Maybe… six months now? It's hard to say exactly. Things… just slip away. Like sand. I used to remember everything, you know? Everything my children did, every recipe… now… not so much. It worry me a little, yes.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned, Ms. Abdollahi. And it's good you're acknowledging that. Now, let's move on to other things. Do you have any other medical problems—diabetes, high blood pressure, heart trouble, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. The doctor… before, he say my blood pressure was a little high. He give me a little white pill. I take it every morning. And my knees, like I say. Old knees. No… no heart trouble. I think. My husband, he knows more about those things. He keeps the papers.
DOCTOR: Alright, hypertension, managed with medication. And knee pain. It's helpful that your husband keeps track of things. Do you know the name of the medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No… no, I don't remember. It's a little white pill. I take it with my breakfast. My husband, he fill the bottle. I just… take the pill. I'm sorry. I'm not good with names, even for pills! Is that okay?
DOCTOR: It’s… less than ideal, Ms. Abdollahi. But we’ll figure it out. We have your records here, I’m sure it’s listed. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… many years ago, when I was young, I have my tonsils out. And… when my daughter was born, I stay in the hospital, of course. That was… a long time ago. No… no other surgeries. No other hospital stays. I’m pretty healthy, usually. Just old.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, childbirth… alright. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? I don't think so. I eat everything. Sometimes I get a little… itchy, when I touch some flowers. But that's not an allergy, right? Just… sensitive skin. My mother had sensitive skin too. It's in the family. I never have… reaction to food, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia… anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she get sick when she was old. She forget things, like me. But… I don't know what the doctor say. She just… get weak, and then she was gone. My father, he was strong. Never sick. My brother, he has the… the sugar sickness? Diabetes, my daughter say. But… that's all I remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Maternal history of cognitive decline, paternal history unremarkable, brother with diabetes. Now, before we proceed, let me ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, no. I never smoke. Never. And I don't drink. Not anymore. My husband, he used to drink a little beer sometimes. But not now. And… drugs? Oh no, never. I am a good woman. I go to church every Sunday.
DOCTOR: Alright. Non-smoker, no alcohol use, no recreational drug use. Very good. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can stand. But… be careful. My knees… they complain.
DOCTOR: Alright, easy now. That's it. Let's check your blood pressure. 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not unexpected. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, I can follow. Is that okay? I sometimes have trouble with my… focus. Like… the television. I need to turn it up loud.
DOCTOR: Alright. A little slow, but within normal limits for your age. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, also within expected range. And finally, let’s do a quick cognitive assessment. I’m going to ask you a few simple questions. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today's date? Hmm… Is it… August? Yes, August. But what is the number? My granddaughter, she always tell me the number. I forget. Is it the 2nd? Maybe. It’s August, I know that much. I'm sorry, Doctor. The numbers… they escape me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Difficulty recalling the exact date. Now, can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Okay. What are the words?
DOCTOR: Apple, table, penny. Repeat those for me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. Is that right? Now, do you remember them?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you to subtract 7 from 100, and then 7 from that answer, and continue subtracting 7 until I tell you to stop. Let's see how you do.
PATIENT: Okay… 100 minus 7 is… hmm. 93. Yes, 93. Now, 93 minus 7 is… Oh… oh dear. I… I'm losing my numbers again. Is that bad, Doctor? I'm trying, I promise. It just… slips away. Like sand through my fingers.
DOCTOR: Alright. Difficulty with serial subtraction. Ms. Abdollahi, based on the examination and your history, it appears you are experiencing some cognitive impairment. It's too early to say definitively what’s causing it, but it warrants further investigation. I’m going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also want you to get an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Finally, I’m referring you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: MRI? Blood work? Neurologist? Oh dear… is it… is it bad, Doctor? Am I… very sick? My granddaughter, she told me about those tests. They are for… bad things, right? I just wanted to get checked for the old people place. I didn't want trouble. I just want to live quietly with my husband. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Abdollahi, please. It’s important to be thorough. These tests are to rule things out, not necessarily to confirm a diagnosis. We need to determine the cause of your memory and cognitive difficulties before we can make any conclusions. It’s quite possible it’s something treatable. The neurologist will be able to provide a more detailed assessment and discuss your options. I’m also going to prescribe you a medication to help with your blood pressure, since it was slightly elevated today. Now, I will have my nurse schedule these appointments for you. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No… no allergies to medicine. I take the little white pill for my blood pressure, like I said. But… this is all so much, Doctor. My granddaughter will be angry with me for worrying her. She will want to come with me to all these appointments. I just wanted a simple checkup. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Abdollahi, I understand your concerns. It's never pleasant to have unexpected medical findings. I'm not dismissing your anxiety. However, it's my responsibility to ensure you receive the best possible care, and that includes investigating these cognitive changes. Your granddaughter’s support is understandable, and she is welcome to attend the appointments with you, if you wish. I will have the nurse explain the medication instructions and schedule the necessary tests. Now, do you have any questions for me before I leave the room?
PATIENT: No… no questions right now. Just… please be quick. I don’t like feeling… confused. And scared. Tell my granddaughter I'm okay. Tell her it's just… old age.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll speak with your granddaughter. The nurse will be in shortly.
