DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my skin. It’s just… off. Not right, you understand? There are patches, different shades, and it's really quite bothersome. It's not like a rash, not bumpy or itchy, just… discoloration.
DOCTOR: Discoloration, okay. And you said patches… can you tell me where these patches are located on your body?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Everywhere, practically. Though, it’s most noticeable on my hands, the backs of them, and on my forearms. And… a bit on my chest, though thankfully it's not too bad there. It’s… uneven, you see? Like someone took a paintbrush to me with different tones. Not a pleasing effect, I assure you.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, mostly hands and forearms, some on the chest… and it’s been developing… how long would you say this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started subtly, really. Probably… six months ago? At first, I barely noticed it, just thought it was the light, or maybe I was imagining things. But it’s definitely gotten worse in the last few months, particularly with the summer heat. It's… distracting, to say the least. It clashes terribly with my good silks.
DOCTOR: Six months… and worsening with the heat. Okay. Has anything specific triggered it, as far as you can recall?
PATIENT: Triggered? Well, no. Not that I’m aware of. I haven’t changed anything in my routine. The same soaps, the same lotions… I do garden, of course. But I always wear gloves! Proper gardening gloves. So, it shouldn’t be that. It's just… appeared. It’s very puzzling, and frankly, a little unsettling. You’d think at my age, one wouldn’t start developing… things.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It is unsettling when something new develops. And you wear gloves when gardening, good. Let's go through a quick review of your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions – anything you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me see. Nothing major. I have a touch of the arthritis, in my hands mostly, hence the gardening gloves. It flares up sometimes, but nothing debilitating. And… my blood pressure runs a little high, but I take medication for that. A small dose, the doctor says it’s well-controlled. Other than that, I’m quite healthy, really. I always have been. Good genes, you know. Ukrainian stock. Very resilient.
DOCTOR: Arthritis in the hands, managed with gloves, and high blood pressure, well-controlled with medication. Good. And what medication are you taking for your blood pressure, if you recall the name?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s… Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril. A small pink pill. I take it every morning with my tea. And I do try to be good about my diet. Not too much salt, mostly vegetables. Though, a little pastry never hurt anyone, does it? But I do try. Honestly, a bit of indulgence is necessary for a happy life.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril. Okay. And do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Not really. I’ve always been very fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, take anything… well, almost anything. I did have a slight reaction to a face cream once, years ago, caused a bit of itching, but that was it. Nothing serious. Mostly I just avoid anything with too many chemicals. You never know what they’re putting in these things. It’s best to stick to simpler things, you know? Natural is always better.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. When I was a young girl, I had my tonsils removed. That was… unpleasant. And I was briefly hospitalized when I broke my wrist, skiing, many years ago. But that was a simple fracture, healed up nicely. Other than that, no. No serious illnesses, no major surgeries. I've been quite lucky, honestly. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. Though, this skin thing is rather concerning, isn't it? It’s not like me to have… blemishes.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's good to know your history. Now, just to round things out, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – anything like skin problems, autoimmune diseases…?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… well, she had a sort of rash, actually. On her arms. The doctor said it was eczema, I think. And my uncle, he suffered from something… an ailment of the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis, perhaps? It was rather debilitating. He spent a great deal of time in hospitals. Other than that, no. My family is generally quite healthy. Robust, you see? We don’t tend to fall ill easily. Though, you never know what can crop up, do you? It’s worrying, to think about.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to take a look at the areas you've mentioned. If you don't mind, please remove your sleeves so I can get a better look at your forearms and hands. We'll also take a quick look at your chest. Just to document what we're seeing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I suppose so. It’s… not my favorite thing, to be examined, but if it’s necessary… sighs Very well. Just be gentle, Doctor. My skin is rather sensitive. And please, don’t be alarmed if it feels a bit cool. It often does. There. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Bartock. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay. I see some areas of hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation – different shades of skin tone. It's not raised, no scaling… feels smooth. Similar findings on your hands. The skin does feel slightly cool to the touch. And let’s have a look at your chest… Some patchy discoloration here as well, less pronounced than on your arms and hands. Alright. Thank you. We'll need to consider a few possibilities.
PATIENT: Possibilities? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound promising. What sort of possibilities, Doctor? Is it something… serious? I do hope it’s not contagious. I’ve a bridge club meeting next week, and I certainly wouldn’t want to alarm anyone. And my grandson, he visits every Sunday… Please, do tell me. I prefer to know the worst, you know. It’s better to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, let's not jump to conclusions. It doesn't necessarily mean it's serious. Several things could cause this. One possibility is vitiligo – it’s a condition where you lose pigment in patches of skin. It’s not contagious, and it's not typically dangerous, but it can be aesthetically bothersome. Another possibility, given your family history, could be a form of dermatitis, perhaps triggered by something environmental. And, less likely, but we need to rule it out, could be a fungal infection, although that usually presents differently. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests – just to check for underlying autoimmune conditions and rule out any systemic issues. I'd also like to do a skin scraping – a very quick and painless procedure – to check for any fungal presence. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Vitiligo… I’ve heard of that. Isn’t that what Michael Jackson had? Oh dear. And blood tests… I do hate needles. And a scraping… is that… unpleasant? I suppose it's necessary, if you think it's best, Doctor. But honestly, I do hope it’s not something too… alarming. I’ve always taken such good care of my skin. Proper creams, avoiding the sun… It’s just terribly frustrating. And I really mustn’t miss bridge club. Very well. Let’s get it over with. But please, be quick. And gentle.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Bartock. We'll be as efficient and gentle as possible. The blood draw will be relatively quick, and the skin scraping is very superficial – just a gentle collection of some skin cells. It shouldn't cause any discomfort. I’ll write the orders now. My nurse, Sarah, will come in and explain the process to you, and then draw the blood and perform the scraping. It will take about fifteen minutes, all told. While we're waiting, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… please, do try to find out what it is. It's unsettling, not knowing. And I do hope it’s not something contagious. My grandson… he has such a sensitive immune system. Fifteen minutes, you say? I suppose I can endure fifteen minutes. As long as it doesn’t involve too much… poking and prodding. Very well. Let’s get it over with. Perhaps a cup of tea afterwards would be nice? A little something to calm my nerves.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Bartock. I'll speak to Sarah about getting you a cup of tea afterwards. And I assure you, we'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Sarah will be in shortly to explain everything. I will also make a note to check on the results as soon as they come in and let you know what we find. In the meantime, try to relax. It’s important not to stress too much. Is there anything else I can assist you with before Sarah arrives?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all, Doctor. Thank you. You’ve been… well, you’ve been reassuring, at least. Though I do wish there was a simpler explanation. Very well. I shall try to relax. Though it's difficult, not knowing. If you'll excuse me, I shall just sit here and try to… compose myself. And I do hope Sarah is gentle. .
