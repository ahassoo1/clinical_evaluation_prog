DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… what brings me in? It’s… well, it’s hard to say exactly. I just… I find myself sighing a lot these days. Big, deep breaths, you know? Not painful, just… a lot of them. It happens throughout the day. My daughter, she said I should come get it checked. She worries, that one.
DOCTOR: Sighing a lot, alright. And when did you start noticing this increased sighing, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. Time… it gets away from you, doesn’t it? I think… maybe a few months now? It started slowly, I suppose. I didn’t really pay attention at first. Just thought I was… tired, maybe. Now it seems like I do it without even realizing it. Is that… normal? I don't rightly know.
DOCTOR: A few months. And is it constant throughout the day, or are there times when you notice it more?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… when I’m sitting quiet. Watching television, or… just remembering things. Old things. It happens more then, I think. When I'm busy, doing something, I don’t notice it as much. Though my daughter says she hears it even then! She’s got good ears, that one.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned remembering things. Are you having any difficulty with your memory, or is it just that the memories themselves trigger the sighing?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not difficulty exactly. It’s just… things aren’t as clear as they used to be. Names… faces… dates. They slip away. It’s frustrating, but… it happens, doesn’t it? It’s been a long life, a lot of things to remember. The sighing… I think it’s when I’m trying to hold onto them, maybe? It’s like… a sadness, sometimes. But not a bad sadness, you understand? More like… a longing. Is that making any sense?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Vantine. A longing... alright. Now, besides the sighing and some memory changes, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. Well, I get tired easier now. Not all the time, but… after I do something. Even something small. And… my appetite isn't what it used to be. I don’t really feel sick, just… not as hungry. And… I sleep okay, but I wake up a lot. Just… little things, you know? I'm an old man, Doctor. Old things happen to old men.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no chest pain. Thank goodness for that. And… no, not really shortness of breath, no. I walk a little slower now, but that’s just the age, I reckon. And no swelling in my legs… not that I’ve noticed. My daughter checks on me, she’d say something if I did. She's very thorough.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Vantine. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take your blood pressure and pulse. Just a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. It's a little chilly in here, isn't it? Though, that might just be me getting old. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. I'll just need you to remove your shirt and lie back. It is a little cool in here; we try to keep it that way for the equipment. Your heart sounds a bit… distant. Breathing is a little shallow, but clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 78. Regular rhythm. No swelling in the ankles. Alright, Mr. Vantine. Everything seems relatively normal, but I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying issues.
PATIENT: Blood work, you say? Alright. If that's what you think is best, Doctor. I don't mind a little poking and prodding if it helps. I just hope it's not too much trouble. My daughter always says I'm a difficult patient, always asking questions. Will it take long to get the results? And… is it expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see. Things are… tight these days.
DOCTOR: It's a standard blood panel, Mr. Vantine. It shouldn’t take more than a few days for the results to come back. As for the cost… I understand you don’t have insurance. The clinic does have a sliding scale fee, and we can discuss that with the billing department after the blood draw. It will likely be… a few hundred dollars, depending on the specific tests. It’s important to rule out anything serious, even if it's just to put your mind at ease. We'll need to check your thyroid levels, vitamin D, and a complete blood count. And perhaps a basic metabolic panel. It’s just a precaution, Mr. Vantine.
PATIENT: A few hundred dollars… Oh dear. That is… a bit more than I was hoping for. But… I suppose you’re right. It’s better to know, isn’t it? My daughter will be relieved. She worries so. Alright, Doctor. Do what you need to do. Thyroid… and vitamins… and… A complete what now? But yes, please. Let’s get it done. Where do I go for the blood draw? Is it here at the clinic? And… will it hurt much? I’m not good with needles.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. It shouldn’t hurt much, Mr. Vantine. A quick pinch, and then it's over. The phlebotomist is very experienced. And frankly, a little discomfort is a small price to pay for peace of mind. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to get some rest and eat a balanced diet. And if your symptoms worsen – if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or any significant dizziness – go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions, or shall we proceed?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s everything. A balanced diet… yes, I’ll try. My daughter makes me soup, usually. She’s very good at soup. And… soup is balanced, isn't it? Alright then. Lead the way. And thank you, Doctor. For everything. It’s… comforting to know someone is looking out for me. Even if it means a pinch and a few hundred dollars. Though I really don't like needles…
