DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It’s Velda Squiers, yes. I’m needing a wee bit of paperwork filled out, if you don’t mind. I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one, actually – and they require some medical information before I can go. Just a standard thing, I expect.
DOCTOR: A cruise, you say. Right. Standard paperwork… yes. Well, “standard” doesn't usually involve me filling it out. It’s generally a form your primary care physician completes. Do you have a regular doctor?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a bit of a bother, isn't it? No, I don’t, not exactly. My husband… well, he always handled the doctor’s appointments and such. He passed away just last year, and I haven’t really gotten around to finding a new one. I just thought… as you’re a doctor, you could maybe help with the form. Is that terribly forward of me? I didn't mean to be a nuisance.
DOCTOR: It's… less than ideal, Ms. Squiers. Honestly, I’m an internal medicine specialist. Filling out cruise paperwork isn't really within my scope of practice, especially without having any established medical history for you. It’s a liability issue, frankly. But… tell you what. We can go through a fairly thorough questionnaire, and if I feel comfortable, I can attest to having done a basic health assessment. It won’t be the same as your primary care doctor, but it's better than nothing, I suppose. Are you alright with that?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be ever so kind of you, Doctor. Truly. A questionnaire sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand about the liability, of course. I wouldn’t want to cause any trouble. Yes, a questionnaire is grand. Do you have one ready, or…? I’m happy to answer anything you need. I’m quite a good rememberer, you see, so hopefully I won’t have trouble with the details.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with the basics. I’ll pull up a standard health history form. First, date of birth, please?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s the 14th of March, 1980. That makes me… forty-five, come March. Though I don't feel forty-five, mind you!
DOCTOR: Forty-five. Right. And your race, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Scottish, Doctor. Born and bred, though I’ve done a bit of travelling in my time. Mostly around Europe, though. A lovely continent, Europe is. But there's no place like Scotland, really.
DOCTOR: Scottish. And your height and weight, if you don’t mind?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Weight… well, I’m around 109 pounds, give or take. And my height is 171 centimetres, I believe. I had it measured not too long ago, for a new coat I was having made. It’s important to get it right, you see, for the fit.
DOCTOR: 171 centimetres… that’s about five foot seven. And 109 pounds?
PATIENT: Yes, that's correct. Five foot seven and… well, roughly fifty kilograms, I suppose. Is that… unusual, Doctor? I’ve always been quite slender, naturally. I eat a good diet, though. Lots of fish and vegetables. My husband always said I was too thin, but I feel perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: It's… low. Significantly low, actually, for your height. Are you actively trying to lose weight?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Losing weight is the last thing I want. I'm perfectly happy with my size, thank you very much. I just… don't have a large appetite, I suppose. And I keep quite busy, so I burn off whatever I do eat. It's never bothered me before, and my husband… well, he was just a worrier, you see. He worried about everything. I haven't been sick a day in my life, Doctor, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’re going to need to explore this a bit further. Have you experienced any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. It’s been like this for as long as I can remember. Certainly not recently. Last year was difficult, of course, with my husband… I may have lost a wee bit of appetite then, due to the grief, but I’ve been eating normally since. Fish and chips on a Friday, a nice roast on a Sunday… all the usual. I assure you, I haven't been unwell. Is there something you're concerned about, Doctor? You're starting to make me feel rather anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s just… your body mass index is quite low, Ms. Squiers. It raises a few flags. Have you noticed any fatigue?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Oh, well, I get a bit tired at the end of the day, naturally. I do a lot of walking, you see, and I spend my days arranging displays in shops. It’s rather physical work, actually. But it's a good sort of tired, if you understand me. Not unwell tired, just… pleasantly weary. I sleep well enough, though. Eight hours a night, usually. I don’t believe I’ve ever suffered from actual fatigue. Is this about the cruise, Doctor? Are you worried I won’t be fit enough to travel?
DOCTOR: Let’s move on. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none at all, Doctor. Not a single one. I can eat anything, take any medication if I need it… I've never had a reaction to anything. It's rather convenient, really. My husband was terribly allergic to pollen, poor man. Always sneezing and wheezing. But me? Perfectly fine. I suppose everyone has their crosses to bear, and mine is just being too slender! It's hardly a hardship, is it?
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. Not a single pill, potion, or cream. I pride myself on being a very healthy person, you see. I don’t believe in loading up on unnecessary things. A bit of cod liver oil in the winter, perhaps, for the vitamin D, but that’s it. Honestly, I barely visit the chemist, and I certainly don't have a medicine cabinet overflowing with remedies. No, nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single night. I've always been remarkably lucky, I suppose. My husband had his appendix out when he was a boy, and he broke his arm once falling off a bicycle, but I've never had so much as a broken bone. I've always been very careful, you see. And I think a good constitution has a lot to do with it. Not a night in hospital, no. Not ever. Is this usual, Doctor, to ask so many questions about someone's health before filling out a simple form for a cruise?
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, with all due respect, this isn’t about filling out a “simple form”. Your BMI is dangerously low, you have no recorded medical history, you take no medications, have had no hospitalizations… frankly, it’s… unusual. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You make it sound as if I’m some sort of… specimen! No, Doctor, I haven’t been diagnosed with anything. Never. My husband… well, he had a touch of high blood pressure towards the end, but I haven’t. I feel perfectly well, I assure you. Perfectly normal. Perhaps I’m just… a very healthy person? Is that so difficult to believe? I’m beginning to feel quite distressed, Doctor. I came here for a form, not an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, I need to be frank. I'm concerned about the lack of any medical record. A healthy person generally has a history. Check-ups, vaccinations, even minor illnesses. The fact that you have absolutely none is… perplexing. And, quite honestly, raises red flags. Do you have any family history of significant illness?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… my mother, God rest her soul, she had a bit of trouble with her digestion in her later years. And my father… he was a smoker, you see, and he… well, he passed away from lung cancer when I was quite young. But that was a long time ago, and I’ve never smoked a day in my life. As for vaccinations… I had the usual childhood ones, I expect. I went to school, you see. But I don’t recall the specifics. It was a long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, my family wasn’t one for fussing over doctors and ailments. We just… got on with things. Is that so terribly wrong?
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, this is becoming increasingly concerning. A family history of lung cancer, combined with a completely blank medical record and a dangerously low BMI… I cannot, in good conscience, sign off on this form without further investigation. I strongly recommend a full blood panel, a chest X-ray, and a thorough physical examination. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions before you embark on this cruise.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness me. That sounds… rather drastic, doesn’t it? A blood panel and a chest X-ray? For a simple cruise? I… I don't think I want all that fuss. Honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly fine. Perfectly well. I just want to enjoy a nice holiday, not spend my time worrying about tests and scans. I appreciate your concern, but… perhaps I’ll just speak to the cruise company and explain the situation. Maybe they’ll make an exception. I really don’t think this is necessary. Is there… is there anything else I need to do? Or can we just… forget about the form?
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, I understand your reluctance, but I am ethically obligated to ensure your well-being. I cannot knowingly allow you to travel without addressing these significant concerns. A full medical workup is not optional; it’s responsible care. I’m concerned about potential malnutrition, underlying infection, or even… other possibilities. Look, I’ll be frank: with this low of a BMI and no medical record, I suspect something is going on. I’m not comfortable signing off on this form, and frankly, I wouldn’t be doing my job if I did. I strongly advise you to reconsider. If you refuse a full workup, I will not be able to provide you with any documentation for your cruise.
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. That’s… terribly disappointing. And rather upsetting, actually. I just wanted a simple form, and now… now it’s all become so complicated. Very well, Doctor. If you insist. But I must say, I’m not at all happy about this. What… what does this entail? And how long will it take? And… and will it be expensive? Perhaps… perhaps I should just cancel the cruise. It’s all become too much trouble.
