DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paulino. It’s… well, it’s my weight. I’ve gained quite a bit recently, and I haven’t changed anything about my eating or exercise habits. It’s rather unsettling, to be frank. I’d like to understand why this is happening, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Unexplained weight gain, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. It's been… noticeable over the last six months, perhaps? I don’t have the exact numbers, I haven’t been formally tracking it, but my clothes are fitting differently. And I feel… sluggish. It’s not a comfortable feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Six months is a reasonable timeframe to investigate. And you say no changes in diet or exercise?
PATIENT: No changes at all, Doctor. I work as an orderly at the hospital, so I’m on my feet most of the day. It’s not a sedentary job, certainly. And my husband cooks – always the same sorts of things, honestly. Mostly potatoes, some meat, vegetables… typical Lithuanian fare, you might say. Nothing extravagant, and certainly nothing more than we’ve had for years.
DOCTOR: “Typical Lithuanian fare,” as you put it, can be quite… hearty. While not necessarily bad, it’s important to consider the composition of those meals. But let’s not jump to conclusions. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I’ve consciously observed. I sleep alright, maybe a little more tired than usual, but I attribute that to the work. Perhaps a bit more thirsty, but it’s been quite warm lately. No… no, I can’t think of anything else significant. It’s mostly just the weight, and the fatigue that seems to come with it. It’s all rather… baffling.
DOCTOR: "Baffling," is one word for it. Fatigue and increased thirst can be indicative of several things. Before we proceed, let's get a more complete picture. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing that I'm aware of. I've always been a fairly healthy person, honestly. Regular check-ups with my family doctor back in Vilnius, and everything was always in order. I haven’t seen a doctor consistently since moving here, I suppose. Just the usual… colds, flus, nothing serious. And I don’t take any medications regularly.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pre-existing conditions, no medications. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any need for surgery, thankfully. Just a few stitches here and there as a child – a scraped knee, that sort of thing. Nothing major, certainly. I’ve always been… lucky, I suppose, when it comes to illness and injury. This weight gain feels… different, though. It’s not an injury, it’s not a cold. It's… concerning.
DOCTOR: Concerning, yes. It’s good you’re addressing it. Now, family history. Are there any instances of diabetes, thyroid issues, or significant weight problems in your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she had some problems with her thyroid, later in life. It caused some swelling, and she was quite tired a lot. She had treatment for it, I believe. And… my grandfather on my father’s side, he struggled with his weight towards the end of his life. He wasn’t very active, and enjoyed his food, shall we say. But that’s all I can recall, honestly. Nothing immediate in my father's side, and my mother's side was fairly healthy overall. It was mostly my mother's thyroid issue, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Thyroid issues and a family history of weight gain… that's helpful. Now, a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smokes, occasionally, but he does it outside, away from me. I find the smell quite unpleasant, to be honest. I strongly discourage him from it, whenever possible. He's been trying to cut back, thankfully. It's a bad habit, we both agree.
DOCTOR: Alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh… well, occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on a weekend. Or a small glass of vodka during special occasions, like holidays. But nothing excessive, Doctor. I’m not a heavy drinker, not at all. Perhaps one or two glasses a week, if that. It’s mostly for social purposes, you understand. Or to accompany a nice meal. Nothing more than that.
DOCTOR: Very well. Finally, allergies?
PATIENT: Just hay fever, Doctor. During the springtime, mostly. Sneezing, itchy eyes… the usual. Nothing serious, easily managed with over-the-counter medication. I haven’t had any food allergies, or any other significant reactions, thankfully. That’s all I can think of, honestly. Is that everything? I do hope we can get to the bottom of this weight gain soon. It's quite unsettling, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Selbitschka. That provides a reasonably complete picture. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. We’ll check your thyroid, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Just routine, to rule out any obvious causes. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment. Please let me know if there's anything I should do or be aware of during the examination. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a deep breath… and exhale. Good. Your lungs sound clear. Heart rate is regular. Blood pressure is… slightly elevated, 140/90. Not alarming, but something to monitor. Now, let's palpate your thyroid… Hmm. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, and there’s a small nodule on the left side. It’s not particularly large, but it warrants further investigation. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. No signs of ascites. Reflexes are normal. Overall, the physical exam reveals a slightly enlarged thyroid with a nodule and elevated blood pressure. We’ll need to run some blood tests to assess your thyroid function and rule out other potential causes for your weight gain and fatigue. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test.
PATIENT: A nodule? That doesn’t sound very good, Doctor. Is it… serious? And what does the TSH test involve? I understand a complete blood count, but I’m unfamiliar with that particular test. Will it be painful? I do hope it’s not something too concerning. My husband will be quite worried, if I tell him about a nodule.
DOCTOR: Ms. Selbitschka, a nodule doesn't automatically equate to anything serious. Many thyroid nodules are benign. The TSH test is a simple blood draw – no more painful than any other blood test. It measures the level of thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood, which helps assess your thyroid function. The complete blood count checks your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets – it’s a general health screening. I've sent the orders to the lab. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment for the blood draw. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the next course of action. It’s possible we’ll need to schedule a thyroid ultrasound to get a clearer image of the nodule. Try not to worry unnecessarily. We’re simply gathering information at this point. It's best to have a clear understanding of the situation before jumping to conclusions.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. Gathering information… that’s sensible. I shall try to remain calm, as you suggest. An ultrasound… I suppose that's to be expected. And I will schedule the blood draw as soon as possible. When should I expect to receive the results? And is there anything I should avoid in the meantime? Any particular foods or activities I should refrain from? I just want to be prepared, and to avoid anything that might interfere with the tests.
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes 2-3 business days to return the results. There are no specific dietary restrictions or activities you need to avoid. Continue your normal routine. However, it would be prudent to limit your caffeine intake, as it can sometimes affect thyroid hormone levels. And I would advise against strenuous exercise until we have a clearer diagnosis. Honestly, Ms. Selbitschka, I don't want to alarm you unnecessarily. The most likely scenario is a benign nodule and slightly elevated blood pressure. But it's important to rule out any other possibilities. Once the results are in, we’ll discuss them thoroughly and formulate a treatment plan if necessary. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. Limit caffeine, avoid strenuous exercise… and wait for the results. I shall follow your instructions carefully. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your patience. I shall contact the lab tomorrow to schedule the blood draw. I hope everything turns out to be… benign, as you suggest.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll see. Don’t hesitate to contact the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Have a good day, Ms. Selbitschka.
