DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve noticed a lump in my lower abdomen. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it's… there. And it’s a little concerning, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Raghunathan. A new lump is always something we want to investigate. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It feels… fairly firm, not squishy. About the size of a plum, I’d say. I first noticed it maybe three or four weeks ago, while I was showering. I haven’t… hit it or anything, and it hasn’t grown noticeably larger, as far as I can tell. It just is. It’s mostly just a worry, really. I try to ignore it, but as a choreographer, I'm very aware of my body, you see.
DOCTOR: I see. Being a choreographer, you’re certainly attuned to changes in your body – that’s good. And it’s wise to get these things checked out. When you say it’s in your lower abdomen, could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s… lower down, on my right side, I believe. Not right on the hip bone, but a few inches in. Sort of… where your stomach is, but a little lower and to the right. It’s hard to explain precisely.
DOCTOR: So, lower right quadrant of your abdomen. Alright. And has there been any change in your bowel habits – any constipation, diarrhea, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, nothing like that. My bowel habits have been… normal, I suppose. No blood, no changes in frequency or consistency. Just… the lump. It's a relief to hear you say it's good I came in. My wife suggested it, of course. She's always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: It’s always good to have a supportive spouse. And you did the right thing coming in. To get a better understanding, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Let me see… No pain, as I said. No fever, no nausea, no loss of appetite. I haven’t felt any… weight loss, either. I have been a little more tired than usual, perhaps. But I’ve been working long hours on a new piece, so I just assumed it was the stress. It's hard to say if that’s related or not.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue can have many causes, so we’ll keep that in mind. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I'm generally quite healthy. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing major. No diabetes, no heart problems, no asthma. I did have my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was a long time ago. And I'm currently taking no medications.
DOCTOR: Okay, and no previous surgeries besides your appendectomy, correct?
PATIENT: That is correct. Just the appendix when I was younger. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a little harder. My mother passed away a few years ago from pneumonia, I believe. My father is still alive, but he lives in Palestine, and we don’t speak often. He’s… always been fairly healthy, as far as I know. I don’t recall any major illnesses on either side of the family, like cancer or anything like that. We weren’t really a family to talk about medical things, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It's common for families not to discuss those things openly. Okay. And could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. As you know, I’m a choreographer, so I'm very active – long hours in the studio, lots of physical activity. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to eat a healthy diet, lots of fruits and vegetables, though it's sometimes difficult with my schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, take any medication without issue.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Raghunathan. Thank you for providing that information. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then, I’ll gently palpate – that means feel – your abdomen to assess the lump. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable or painful. I’m listening for any unusual sounds. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. I’m noting a firm, non-tender mass in the lower right quadrant. It's approximately the size of a plum, as you described. It does appear to be fixed – meaning it doesn't move easily under my fingers. No rebound tenderness – that means pressing and releasing doesn't cause sharp pain.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… thorough. It doesn’t hurt, as I said, but it is a little unsettling to hear you say it’s fixed. What does that… imply?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be unsettled, Mr. Raghunathan. When a mass is fixed, it doesn't move as easily under the skin, which can suggest it's deeper or attached to underlying tissues. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it does warrant further investigation to determine its cause. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. I also recommend an abdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound will allow us to visualize the mass and determine its characteristics – whether it’s solid or fluid-filled, its size, and its location in relation to other organs. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work and an ultrasound. That makes sense. I would like to know what’s going on, of course. Will the ultrasound require… preparation? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s good to get some answers. The ultrasound usually doesn't require extensive preparation, but the radiology department will likely ask you to fast for a few hours beforehand – typically, nothing to eat or drink for six to eight hours prior to the appointment. They will give you specific instructions when you schedule it. As for the results, it usually takes a day or two for the radiologist to interpret the images and send the report to me. Once I have the results, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – such as pain, fever, nausea, or changes in your bowel habits – please contact the clinic immediately.
PATIENT: Alright. Fasting for six to eight hours, and contact you if anything changes. I’ve got that. Thank you, Doctor. That explains everything very clearly. I believe that’s all for now, then. Unless you think of anything else?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. I'm glad I could clarify things. No, I don't think there’s anything else at this point. We’ll take it one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly to give you the lab requisition and schedule your ultrasound appointment. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. I wish you a good day, and we’ll talk soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You too.
