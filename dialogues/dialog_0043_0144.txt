DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski, and I'll be your doctor today. It's August 2nd, 2025. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Kalinski, is it? Yes, yes. Well, honestly, I just… thought I’d come by. My neighbor, Martha, she keeps going on and on about how important check-ups are. Honestly, I haven't been to a doctor in… goodness, I don't even remember. Just thought I’d see what all the fuss is about, I suppose. It’s not like I feel sick or anything.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise of you, Ms. Calvery. Preventative care is incredibly important, even when you're feeling well. It’s good you’re taking this step. And it’s perfectly alright that it's been some time since your last visit. We’ll get everything updated. To start, could you tell me a little bit more about your general health?
PATIENT: General health… hmm. Well, I mostly keep to myself. I used to be a surgical tech, you know? Lots of standing, lots of… things. Now I mostly just watch my dramas. I get tired easily, I suppose. But doesn’t everyone? And my knees… they ache sometimes. Old age, I reckon. I’m a widow, you see. My husband, bless his soul, he passed a few years back. I don’t really do much these days. Does that count as health? It all feels very… vague, honestly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Calvery. That gives me a good starting point. It sounds like you were very active in your previous profession, and it's understandable that you've slowed down a bit since your husband's passing. Feeling tired easily and having knee pain are definitely things we should explore further. Just to clarify, when you say tired easily, is that a new development, or has that been ongoing for some time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. New… old… Honestly, it all blurs together, Doctor. I think it’s been getting worse lately. It used to be just at the end of the day, you know? Now it feels like it’s just… there all the time. Even after a full night’s sleep. Not that I sleep well, mind you. Always waking up. Little things bother me more, too. Like… bright lights. And loud noises. My neighbor’s dog, for instance. A tiny thing, but it sets my nerves on edge. Does that make sense? It's all very… irritating.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Calvery, that makes perfect sense. Fatigue that's worsening, even after sleep, and increased sensitivity to things like bright lights and noise are important details. It sounds like there may be more going on than just general aging. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… oh dear. That’s a long time ago. I had… the usual childhood things, I suppose. Measles, mumps… nothing serious. When I was a surgical tech, I had to get all sorts of vaccinations, you know. Tetnus, I think. And… something for hepatitis. When my husband was sick, I went with him to all sorts of doctors. Cancer, it was. A terrible thing. I mostly remember paperwork and waiting rooms. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. That’s… about all I can recall, honestly. I wasn’t ever a sickly person, if that makes sense. I was always too busy taking care of people to worry about myself.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Calvery. And it's admirable that you were so dedicated to caring for others. So, no major chronic illnesses of your own, just the gallbladder removal and the vaccinations as a surgical tech. Do you recall the approximate year of your gallbladder surgery?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The year… now you’re asking. It was… a long time ago. Before my husband got sick, definitely. I think… maybe the early nineties? Or was it the late eighties? I really can't say. It feels like a lifetime ago. It wasn’t a big deal, really. In and out, a few days of recovery. Honestly, I mostly remember the hospital food being terrible. And the nurses kept wanting me to walk around. I was so uncomfortable! It was… a long time ago, Doctor. A very long time. My memory just isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. Don't worry about precise dates; an approximate timeframe is sufficient. We can always look into records if necessary. Now, regarding medications—are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I take a little something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. The doctor prescribed it a few years back. It’s… amlodipine, maybe? Something like that. And I take a multivitamin sometimes, when I remember. Just a cheap one from the drugstore. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, when they’re really bothering me. That’s about it, I think. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. They always make me feel… strange.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Calvery. Amlodipine, a multivitamin occasionally, and ibuprofen as needed. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. I’ve never had a problem with bees or pollen or anything like that. My husband, he was allergic to cats, but I wasn’t. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to allergies. It seems like everyone is allergic to something these days. I suppose I’m just lucky, I’ve never had to worry about it. Or maybe I just haven’t encountered anything I’m allergic to yet. It’s all very… perplexing.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Calvery. No known allergies. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh dear. What does that even mean? I mostly keep to myself, as I said. My husband and I didn't have any children. He was a… quiet man. After he passed, I just… stayed here. Martha, my neighbor, she tries to get me to join her book club, but I’m not much of a reader. I used to enjoy gardening, but my knees… well, you know. I don't drink or smoke. Never have. I suppose I'm just… a homebody. Is that what you mean? It’s a rather dull history, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It's not about having an exciting story, it's about understanding your lifestyle. So, you're a homebody, you don’t smoke or drink, and you live alone. That's very helpful. Now, to get a better picture of things, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and just do a general assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam? Well… alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t involve anything… unpleasant. I’m not fond of needles, as you might have guessed. And I’m rather sensitive. But if you think it’s necessary, I’ll cooperate. Just… be gentle, alright? And please, tell me what you’re doing as you go along. I don’t like surprises. It’s just… I’m not used to being poked and prodded. It feels… invasive. But I suppose that’s what doctors do, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. I understand your concerns, and I will explain everything as I go along. We'll take things slowly, and I promise to be as gentle as possible. No surprises, I assure you. And no needles at this stage—just a basic assessment. First, let’s check your blood pressure. I’m just going to wrap this cuff around your arm. It will tighten for a moment, and then relax. It’s perfectly normal.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That doesn’t sound too bad. Oh! That is tight. Are you sure that’s supposed to feel like that? It’s… squeezing the life out of my arm. But alright, I’ll try to relax. I used to be able to handle a little discomfort. When I was a surgical tech, I saw… well, never mind. Just… hurry up, alright? It’s making me a little nervous. And what did you say your name was again? Doctor… Kalinsky? It’s a bit of a mouthful.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Kalinski. It is a bit of a mouthful. I apologize for the discomfort with the cuff. It needs to be snug to get an accurate reading. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. It's slightly elevated, but not critically high. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally, in and out. Do you have any history of asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Asthma or bronchitis… hmm. No, not that I recall. I’ve always had a pretty strong constitution. I used to get the occasional cold, of course, but nothing serious. My husband, he had a cough every winter, but that was probably from his smoking. I always told him to quit, but… well, you know. Sometimes I have a little tickle in my throat, especially when it’s dry. But nothing that requires a doctor, I assure you. Is everything alright? You're listening for a long time. Are my lungs… rattling? It sounds rather ominous.
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound clear, Ms. Calvery. I was listening to make sure there weren’t any unusual sounds, but everything sounds perfectly normal. The tickle in your throat is something we can discuss further. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Your ears look clear. Say “Ahhh…”
PATIENT: “Ahhh…” Oh, that’s bright! It’s making my eyes water. And please, be careful with that little… stick. I always thought those things looked rather menacing. Is everything alright? Do you see anything… unusual? I always worry about those tonsils. My mother used to tell me they were always trouble. Are they swollen? Do I need them taken out? I’ve always been a bit squeamish about things going down my throat. It’s just… a rather vulnerable place, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Everything looks perfectly normal, Ms. Calvery. Your tonsils are a bit small, which is perfectly fine. No swelling or any other concerns. Your throat looks healthy. Now, just a quick check of your pulse. Your pulse is 78, which is within the normal range. And finally, I’m going to check your reflexes. Just relax your leg.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Relax my leg… that’s easier said than done. I always feel rather tense around doctors. It’s just… all those instruments. Oh! That startled me! Is that normal? It felt rather… violent. Do I have a problem with my nerves? Is something wrong? My husband always said I was a bit jumpy. He used to tease me about it. But I don't think it's funny. Is that a bad reflex? Are my nerves… deteriorating? I’ve always worried about my memory, you know. And now this. It’s all very… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: That was a perfectly normal reflex, Ms. Calvery. It’s good that you have a reaction – it means your nerves are functioning correctly. A diminished reflex would be the concern. And it’s perfectly alright to be a little jumpy—many people feel anxious during a physical exam. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears normal overall, but your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you mentioned fatigue and increased sensitivity to light and noise. Now, could you tell me a little bit more about your day-to-day activities?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That’s… a relief. I was starting to worry there for a moment. Day-to-day activities… well, not much, to be honest. I wake up, I have a cup of tea. I watch my dramas, mostly. I used to enjoy gardening, but my knees… well, you know. I go to the grocery store once a week, when I have to. Martha, my neighbor, she sometimes brings me over for tea. We chat, mostly about… nothing. I don’t really do anything exciting. It’s a rather dull existence, to be honest. I suppose I’m just… waiting. Waiting for what, I’m not quite sure. It’s all very… uneventful. Is that what you wanted to know? I don’t think my life is very interesting, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It's not about having an exciting life, it’s about understanding your routines. Your lifestyle sounds quite restful, but perhaps a little too sedentary. And the fatigue you're experiencing, combined with the slightly elevated blood pressure, suggests we should investigate a bit further. I'd like to order some blood tests, just to get a baseline and rule out any underlying issues. We'll check your thyroid function, your vitamin levels, and do a complete blood count. It’s a simple procedure, just a little blood draw. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests? Well… alright. As long as it doesn’t involve too much poking and prodding. I always get a little faint when I see needles. But if you think it’s necessary, I suppose I can cooperate. Are you going to have to draw a lot of blood? And will it hurt? I always bruise easily, you know. My husband used to tease me about that too. He said I was a delicate flower. But I don’t feel delicate. Just… anxious. And where will you be drawing the blood? From my arm? I always get dizzy when they bend my arm. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Do I need to fast? I haven’t eaten anything since breakfast. It’s all very… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be anxious, Ms. Calvery. We'll take it slow. It’s just a small amount of blood, usually a few vials. We’ll draw it from your arm, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. It will be a quick pinch, and then it’s over. You shouldn’t feel any lasting discomfort. And yes, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours before the test, so no food or drinks besides water. Since you had breakfast, we'll reschedule the blood draw for tomorrow morning. You can have water, but no food until after the test. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results. In the meantime, I recommend trying to incorporate a little more physical activity into your routine, if you’re able. Even a short walk each day can make a difference. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Tomorrow morning, then. No food until after the test. I can manage that, I suppose. As for the walking… well, my knees… But I'll try. I always liked being outdoors. Maybe just a little stroll around the block. And a follow-up appointment in a week. Yes, that sounds… alright. Is there anything else I need to do? Any special preparations? Should I bring anything with me to the appointment? My glasses? My insurance card? I always forget something. And will you be explaining the results to me personally? Or will someone else be doing that? I always prefer to hear things directly from the doctor. It’s just… I get confused easily. And I don’t want to misunderstand anything. It’s all very… stressful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. Don’t worry, we'll make sure everything is clear. Yes, please bring your insurance card and a list of your medications, if you have one. And please bring your glasses. I will personally explain the results to you at the follow-up appointment. I wouldn’t have it any other way. There’s no need to fast today, since we’re rescheduling the blood draw. Just try to rest and relax. And if you experience any sudden or severe symptoms—like chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness—please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Emergency room… that sounds rather frightening. No, I don’t think so. No sudden or severe symptoms, thankfully. Just… tired. And a little jumpy. No, I don't think I have any questions, Doctor. You've explained everything very thoroughly. I suppose I should be going, then. I don't want to take up too much of your time. You have other patients, I’m sure. And I need to go home and… rest. And prepare for the blood test tomorrow. Thank you for seeing me, Doctor Kalinsky. I appreciate your patience. And your kindness. You're a very… reassuring doctor. Even if blood tests are a little frightening.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Calvery. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please, don't worry about the blood tests—we’ll get through it together. If you think of any questions before tomorrow, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a restful evening, and I’ll see you tomorrow morning.
