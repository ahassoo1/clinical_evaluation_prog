DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, okay? It's... my stomach. Feels puffed up. Been happening for a bit now. Honestly, it's annoying. That's it, really. Just bloated. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I understand your time is valuable, and we’ll get right to it. “Bloated” is a good starting point. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this bloating?
PATIENT: Ugh, more details? Fine. It… it just feels full, even when I haven’t eaten much. It's uncomfortable, like I swallowed a balloon. And it doesn’t go away easily, you know? Like, I'll… I’ll try to, uh, pass gas, but it doesn’t always help. Honestly, I don’t remember when it started, exactly. A while ago, I guess. Does that help? It's just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. You mentioned it feels full even after eating little and doesn’t resolve easily with gas. Can you describe when you typically notice this bloating?
PATIENT: Look, I work construction, okay? Pile driver operator. It's physical. I don’t sit around thinking about my stomach all day. It happens… after I eat, usually. Doesn't matter what I eat, really. Sometimes worse than others, but… pretty consistently after meals. And it lingers. I just want it to stop. Is that what you need to know? Honestly, I don't recall specifics. It’s not like I keep a diary of my gas.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. It's certainly frustrating when something is consistently uncomfortable, and you don't have a clear idea of what's causing it. Since it happens consistently after meals, regardless of what you eat, that gives us a starting point. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Diet? Seriously? I eat. Look, it’s not fancy. Whatever’s quick, keeps me going. Sandwiches, sometimes. Burgers. Whatever the guys are getting for lunch on the site. I don't… measure things. I eat when I'm hungry. I wouldn't know what a 'typical' meal even is. Do I need to list everything I’ve ever put in my mouth? It’s food. Fuel. You know? I just want this… puffiness to go away. I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. It sounds like a fairly standard diet for someone with a physically demanding job. No need to list everything you’ve eaten! To help me rule out any underlying medical conditions, could you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms alongside the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Look, I work with heavy machinery all day. I’m usually tired, aches and pains, you know? Standard stuff. I don’t… I haven’t noticed anything specific related to the stomach other than it feeling full and uncomfortable. No… I don’t think so. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but that’s it. And that’s not new, honestly. I get that sometimes after a long day and a quick meal. Is this going somewhere? I really don't have time for a whole medical investigation over a bit of gas.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Mr. Kristofik. The heartburn is good to know. It does help me build a picture. To clarify, when you say "sometimes" with the heartburn, how often would you estimate that occurs?
PATIENT: Ugh, look. Maybe once a week? Maybe less? It's not constant, okay? It’s… after I eat a big meal, usually. And it’s not severe, just… a burning feeling in my chest. I usually just ignore it. I take something for it if it’s really bad. Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. Is this getting us anywhere? I’ve got a job to get back to. I feel like I'm being interrogated over… a bloated stomach. Really?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I apologize if it feels like an interrogation. I assure you, I am trying to gather enough information to determine the best course of action. It's important to rule out any serious underlying causes, even for seemingly minor symptoms. To continue, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with, or any surgeries you've had?
PATIENT: Look, my wife… she passed away a few years back. Cancer. That’s… that’s about it. I don't really… go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to. No surgeries. I broke my wrist once when I was a kid, but that healed. Honestly, I don’t have a long medical history. I’ve been relatively healthy, until… well, until recently with this stomach thing. I just want it fixed. It’s annoying and uncomfortable, and I don’t have time to spend all day talking about it.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. That must have been incredibly difficult. And thank you for sharing that information with me. Given your history, and the symptoms you’ve described—bloating after meals, occasional heartburn, and no significant past medical history—it sounds like we could be dealing with something relatively common, such as irritable bowel syndrome or a mild form of gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, to be certain, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, a physical exam? For gas? Really? I just… I don’t have the patience for this. I feel perfectly fine, aside from the… puffiness. I’m a pile driver operator, I’m built like a brick wall. I don’t need poking and prodding. Honestly, if you can’t help me without it, I’ll just go back to work and deal with it. I don’t have time for… tests and examinations over a bloated stomach. It’s a waste of my time and yours. Can you at least tell me what I can do about it? Something quick and easy? Or do I just need to suffer in silence?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. You're right, a full examination might not be necessary at this stage. Given your concerns about time and your physical condition, we can try a conservative approach first. Several things can help alleviate bloating. We can discuss dietary modifications—perhaps avoiding carbonated beverages or foods known to cause gas—and over-the-counter remedies like simethicone or activated charcoal. I also recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals rather than large ones. However, if the bloating persists, worsens, or is accompanied by other symptoms such as weight loss, blood in your stool, or severe abdominal pain, it's important to seek further medical attention. Would you like me to provide you with some information on dietary changes and over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Fine. Yeah, give me the information. A list or something. Anything to get this over with. And look, if it gets worse, I’ll… I’ll figure it out. I always do. Just… give me the list. And honestly, if it’s too complicated, I’m not bothering. I’m a construction worker, not a nutritionist. Just keep it simple. Thank you. I think that's enough for today. Let's just wrap this up. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. Here is a simple list of things that may help with bloating: Dietary Changes: Smaller Meals: Eat smaller, more frequent meals instead of large ones. Avoid Carbonated Beverages: These can introduce excess gas into your system. Limit Gas-Producing Foods: Common culprits include beans, broccoli, cabbage, onions, and carbonated drinks. Eat Slowly: This can help reduce the amount of air you swallow. Avoid Artificial Sweeteners: Some can contribute to bloating. Over-the-Counter Remedies: Simethicone: Helps break up gas bubbles . Activated Charcoal: May help absorb gas . If these measures don't provide relief, or if your symptoms worsen—particularly if you experience weight loss, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool—please schedule a follow-up appointment or see another physician promptly. I've also sent a digital copy of this information to your patient portal. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
