DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Vanochten, is it? A nice name. Well, honestly, I’m not really sick. My daughter just thought I should…get checked. You know how they are. Always fussing. I just figured I’d see what all the commotion is about, I suppose. It's not like I feel any different.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery, that's perfectly fine. It’s good to be proactive. Even without specific complaints, a general check-up is always a good idea. Just to be thorough, let's start with a little bit about why your daughter suggested you come in. Was there something specific she noticed, or is she just generally concerned?
PATIENT: Oh, she's always been a worrier, that one. She said I was…forgetful. Can’t remember where I put my keys, or what I had for lunch. Things like that. Honestly, I think that comes with age, doesn't it? I'm not exactly a spring chicken anymore, you know. It’s not like I'm losing my mind or anything. I just... misplace things sometimes. And sometimes I don't recall exactly what I ate. Big deal.
DOCTOR: Okay, forgetfulness…misplacing items, difficulty recalling recent meals. And has this been a gradual change, or did it seem to start suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. Hmm… I honestly couldn't tell you. Probably gradual, I guess. It's hard to say, really. One day you're remembering things perfectly fine, the next… not so much. It’s not like there was a moment where I thought, "Oh dear, my memory is gone!" It just…happened. You know? Things slip my mind. It’s frustrating, I will say that. But I wouldn’t say it’s sudden. It's just... life, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any difficulty with other things, besides just remembering where you put things or what you ate?
PATIENT: Other things? Like what? I… I don’t know. Honestly, Doctor, I just try to get through the day. I haven't really been paying attention to anything else. I watch my stories, I keep the house tidy… I used to do a lot of gardening, but it's too hot for that these days. Does that count as something? I don’t know what you mean by ‘other things’. Are you looking for something specific?
DOCTOR: I understand. Let me be more specific. Have you noticed any difficulty with speaking—finding the right words, for example?
PATIENT: Oh! Now that… yes, actually. Sometimes… the word just won't come. You know? It’s on the tip of my tongue, but I can’t quite grasp it. It’s more common when I’m talking to… well, younger people, I suppose. They use such slang these days. It makes it harder to follow what they’re saying, and then I stumble trying to respond. But it’s not constant, thankfully. It’s just… annoying. Is that what you were asking? It doesn’t happen all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional difficulty finding words, particularly when interacting with younger people. Alright. And has anyone mentioned any changes in your personality or behavior?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My daughter probably has opinions on that, I’m sure. She always thinks I’m too… blunt. She says I don’t “sugarcoat” things enough. But that’s just how I am! I tell it like it is. I don't see what's wrong with that. It's not like I'm being mean, I just… speak my mind. I doubt she’d call it a change, more like she wishes I was… softer, I guess. She worries too much. What do you think?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any difficulties with tasks you normally find easy, like managing finances, cooking, or using the telephone?
PATIENT: Oh, the telephone is a nightmare. All those buttons! I mostly have my daughter handle that. Finances… well, I used to be very good with numbers, but that was a long time ago. Now I just let the bank take care of everything. It's easier that way. Cooking… I can still make a few simple dishes. Soup, mostly. But I don't really enjoy it anymore. It’s a lot of fuss for one person. I wouldn't say I’m having difficulties exactly, more like… I just don't bother anymore. Does that make sense? I avoid things that are troublesome.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like there have been some changes, gradually, in your memory, word-finding, and some daily tasks. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out any other potential causes for these changes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam? Well… I suppose so. I haven't had one of those in… goodness, I can’t even remember. It’s not my favorite thing, poking and prodding and all that. But if you think it's necessary, I guess. Just… don’t take too long, alright? And nothing too…invasive, if you don't mind. I’m a delicate flower, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We'll start with your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam – checking your reflexes and balance. It shouldn't be too uncomfortable. First, let's just sit here for a few minutes while I take your blood pressure. Can you tell me if you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. I had a rash once, years ago, from some lotion, but that was a long time ago. And I can’t take penicillin, I know that much. My mother was allergic, and it seems I inherited it. Other than that, I don't believe so. Though, honestly, Doctor, I don’t really pay attention to those things. My daughter handles the medications, you know. She’s very careful. Is penicillin the only thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug allergies except for penicillin. Good. Now, let me check your blood pressure. 138 over 82. Not bad. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Just look at it and track it as I move it.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Is this…necessary? It’s a little dizzying, to be honest. I don’t like moving my head around like that. Are you seeing something wrong? You’re awfully quiet. Is everything okay? I’m just following the finger, like you said. It's a little hard to focus, if I’m being honest. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery, let’s stop there for a moment. You’re right, it’s okay to stop. I noticed some slight difficulty with smooth pursuit—tracking the finger—and you are a little unsteady. That, combined with what you’ve told me about your memory and other changes, warrants further investigation. I want to order some blood work—a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a Vitamin B12 level—just to rule out any underlying medical causes for these symptoms. And I also recommend a brain scan—an MRI—to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It's important to figure out what's causing these changes so we can determine the best course of action. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work and a brain scan? That sounds…serious. A brain scan! Is something wrong? You think I have something… bad? My daughter is going to be terribly worried. I don’t like this at all. I just came in for a little check-up, and now you’re talking about brain scans. I… I don’t know. Is there anything else we can do? I really don’t like the sound of that scan. Are you sure it’s necessary? Maybe it's just…old age? It could just be that, couldn’t it? It’s not like I’m sick, I just forget things sometimes. I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: Please, do sit down. I understand your anxiety, Ms. Calvery, and I want to assure you that we're not jumping to conclusions. The tests are simply to rule things out and get a complete picture of your health. It doesn’t mean you have anything serious, but it's important to be thorough. There are many possible causes for these symptoms, and some of them are easily treatable. The brain scan—an MRI—is a non-invasive test. You lie inside a machine, and it takes detailed pictures of your brain. It doesn't involve any radiation or pain. I’m recommending it because it can help us identify any changes in your brain structure that might be contributing to your symptoms. It will help me understand the cause, and better advise you. As for the blood work, that's a simple procedure and can be done here in the clinic. Would you like me to explain these tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… a non-invasive scan, you say? No radiation? That’s… slightly better, I suppose. But lying in a machine… I don’t like small spaces. It sounds awfully claustrophobic. And blood work… I always bruise so easily. It’s such a mess afterward. My daughter will have to deal with it all. Honestly, Doctor, I just don’t know. Is there a reason why you suspect something is wrong? What are you looking for, exactly? It’s just… a lot to take in. I came here thinking I was perfectly fine, and now you’re talking about machines and blood and… I need a cup of tea. Do you have tea here? A nice, strong cup of tea would help. Perhaps then I can think straight.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let me get you a cup of tea right away. While we wait, let me explain why I’m recommending these tests. Your symptoms—forgetfulness, difficulty finding words, and slight unsteadiness—can be caused by a variety of things. It could be something as simple as a Vitamin deficiency or a side effect of medication. However, it’s also important to rule out more serious conditions, such as a small stroke, a build-up of fluid in the brain, or early signs of dementia. The brain scan and blood work will help us narrow down the possibilities. It's important to remember that these tests don't necessarily mean you have any of these conditions. They're simply a precaution to ensure we're providing you with the best possible care. We'll get a proper diagnosis, and formulate a plan. It's perfectly normal to be anxious about these things, and I’m here to answer any questions you may have. And if you’re uncomfortable with any of the tests, we can discuss alternative options. I want you to feel safe and comfortable every step of the way. Let's see if the tea helps.
