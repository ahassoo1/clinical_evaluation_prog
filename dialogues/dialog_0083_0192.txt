DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good morning to you too. Look, I don't usually do doctors, but the army… they want me to get this exam done. Says it’s required. Something about making sure I’m… fit enough. Seems a waste of time, honestly. But here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand. These required exams are quite common, and often a standard part of service. No problem at all, we'll get it done as efficiently as possible. “Fit enough” is a broad term, so let's try to narrow it down. Can you tell me a little more about what specifically the army is requesting you be evaluated for?
PATIENT: Well, they just handed me a paper. Lots of boxes to tick. Eyes, ears, heart… usual stuff, I guess. Didn’t say why they need to know all this, just that I gotta do it. Look, I’ve been building engines my whole life, alright? Strong back, good hands. I can see just fine, and I hear everything I need to. What more do they want? It's not like I'm applying to be a… a dancer.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Hartness. It's good to know you’re physically active and have a demanding job. While you feel well, the exam is designed to be a comprehensive assessment. It helps ensure there are no underlying issues that might affect your ability to perform your duties safely, even if you don’t notice them yourself. Let’s start with a bit more detail about your current health. Have you been experiencing any pain, discomfort, or unusual symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Pain? Nah. Not really. Maybe a little ache in my lower back sometimes, after a long day bending over those engines. But that’s just… being old, I suppose. Fifty-one years takes its toll. Unusual symptoms… well, I get tired. Don’t we all? I work long hours, alright? It's a demanding job, like I said. It’s not like I’m sitting around drinking tea all day.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. That lower back pain is worth noting, and we'll explore that a little further. And fatigue can have many causes, so it's good you mentioned it. Just to clarify, would you describe this fatigue as something new, or has it been a consistent issue?
PATIENT: Consistent. It’s been… well, for a few years now, I reckon. Gets worse in the winter, maybe. Hard to say. It just means I need a bit more sleep, that’s all. I don’t bother with doctors normally, so I haven’t exactly been keeping track of it. It’s not stopping me from working. I’m telling you, I’m fine. This whole thing feels… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. It sounds like you’ve been managing this fatigue for a while and haven’t found it significantly impacting your work, which is good. However, even if it's not interfering significantly, it's still important to investigate potential causes, especially given the army's requirements. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Hmm. Not much to tell, really. Had the usual childhood stuff – measles, mumps, chickenpox. Nothing serious. Broke my arm once when I was a kid, fell out of a tree. Had my appendix taken out when I was about twenty. Other than that… nothing. Never been a sickly person. Don’t smoke, hardly drink. Eat alright, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. So, no major illnesses, surgeries aside from your appendix, and a healthy lifestyle. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I mean, I get a bit of a sniffle sometimes when the pollen is bad in the spring, but everyone does, don't they? Nothing serious. Never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. I don't go around eating weird stuff, so I wouldn't expect to.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah. Not a fan of all those pills. Don't believe in 'em much. Maybe a painkiller if I really need it, for a bad backache, but that’s it. Nothing regular. I prefer to just… deal with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a bit about your family history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family—things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a tricky one. My mother… she had something with her heart, I think. She was always a bit frail. Died when I was young, so I don’t really remember much about it. My father was a strong, healthy man, lived to be eighty. No real problems. My sister… she’s got high blood pressure, I think, but that’s about it. Nothing major, as far as I know. We weren’t exactly a family that talked about illnesses much.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Hartness. It's helpful to have even a general idea. So, a history of heart issues with your mother and high blood pressure with your sister. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I want to ask about your social history. Do you currently work, and if so, what do you do?
PATIENT: You just asked me that! I told you, I’m an engine assembler. Been doing it my whole life. It’s hard work, alright? Lots of bending, lifting… keeps me fit, I suppose. I work long hours at the factory down by the docks. It’s not glamorous, but it pays the bills.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, my apologies, Mr. Hartness. I seem to be repeating myself. I appreciate your patience. I sometimes get caught up in the standard questions. It’s important for documentation purposes, and I'm trying to get a complete picture of your health. Now, to continue, do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Like I said, hardly drink. Maybe a beer with dinner now and then, but that’s it. Never smoked, never will. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. What do you take me for? I’m a working man, got responsibilities.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so upfront, Mr. Hartness. I appreciate your honesty. Now, to begin the physical exam, would you mind stepping up onto the scale so I can get your height and weight?
PATIENT: Fine. Scale's scale, I suppose. Don't expect any miracles.
DOCTOR: Alright, 187 centimeters and 53 kilograms. That’s noted. Now, would you mind standing still so I can check your blood pressure and pulse?
PATIENT: Five-three kilograms? Are you sure? That seems… low. I’m a big guy, alright? Used to be heavier, maybe, but… still. Check again, why don't you?
DOCTOR: You are right to question me, Mr. Hartness. The scale does read 53 kilograms. That is quite low for your height. It's possible there's an issue with the scale, or perhaps a previous miscalculation. I will recalibrate the scale to be sure, and we can re-weigh you in a moment. However, I want to note this discrepancy for now. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72, both within normal range. Now, let me just listen to your heart and lungs…
PATIENT: Well, someone needs to check their equipment! I told you, I'm a big guy. 53 kilograms… ridiculous. I eat good, alright? Don't go thinking I'm wasting away or something. And just get on with it. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: You are right, the scale is functioning correctly, and the weight remains consistent. This is… concerning. Your weight is significantly lower than expected for your height and build. I want to ask you a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Unintentional… weight loss? Now you’re just talking nonsense. I haven’t been trying to lose weight! I eat what I always eat, alright? Big portions. Meat, potatoes, the usual. Maybe I’ve been a bit stressed lately with the army stuff, but that wouldn’t make me disappear, would it? I’m telling you, something’s wrong with your equipment, or you’re reading it wrong.
DOCTOR: You are right to be concerned, Mr. Hartness. This weight reading is unexpected and warrants further investigation. It's good you haven't noticed a change in appetite. Let me ask, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Diarrhea, constipation… Look, I don't discuss those things with doctors! That's… private. But no, nothing unusual. Everything’s been… normal. Relatively normal, anyway. I'm a working man, alright? Things go in, things come out. What's the point of asking these questions? It's just embarrassing!
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions are making you uncomfortable, Mr. Hartness. I understand this is private, and I assure you, everything you tell me is confidential. I’m only asking these questions because of the significantly low weight reading. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Now, have you noticed any excessive thirst or frequent urination?
PATIENT: Excessive thirst… not really. I drink water when I’m thirsty, like anyone else. And frequent urination… well, I work outside, alright? You gotta go when you gotta go. Nothing unusual. This is ridiculous. I came here for an army exam, not a… a medical interrogation!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. It is becoming clear that your weight reading is a significant anomaly, and I apologize for the line of questioning, but it's important to investigate the cause. Given the unexpected weight loss, changes in appetite and bowel habits, and the discrepancies in weight, I am concerned about the possibility of an underlying medical condition. I recommend we run some blood tests and a urine analysis to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Tests? Urine analysis? Look, I told you, I don’t do doctors. I came here to get a piece of paper for the army, not to get poked and prodded and have my insides examined. This is… this is absurd. I’m a perfectly healthy man. I’ve been working hard my whole life. I don't need your tests!
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your reluctance. However, given the discrepancies in your weight and the potential for an underlying medical issue, I strongly recommend these tests. Ignoring this could potentially lead to more serious health problems down the line. I can order a basic blood panel to check your overall health and a urine analysis to assess your kidney function. These are relatively simple tests, and they can provide valuable information. If you are unwilling to proceed with these tests, I can complete the army exam form, but I will need to document my concerns regarding your low weight and my recommendation for further investigation. However, this may require you to seek a second opinion or undergo further testing at another facility. What would you like to do?
PATIENT: Fine! Do the tests! But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time. Just get it over with. But don’t go sticking needles in me if you don’t have to. And don’t tell anyone about this! I don’t want the guys at the factory knowing I’m… wasting my time in a doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, I will minimize any discomfort during the tests. I will also maintain your confidentiality. I will have the nurse draw blood for a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We'll also collect a urine sample. I'll explain each step as we go. The results should be available in a few days. In the meantime, I will complete the initial parts of the army exam form based on the physical exam findings and your reported medical history. Once we have the lab results, we can finalize the form. Would you like me to call the nurse in to start the blood work now?
PATIENT: Yeah, just get it over with. The sooner I'm out of here, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I'll have the nurse in momentarily. She'll explain the blood draw process and answer any questions you may have. Thank you for your cooperation. We will do our best to get you through this as quickly and comfortably as possible.
