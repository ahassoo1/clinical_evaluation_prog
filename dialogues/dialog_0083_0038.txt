DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I believe I requested information regarding… planning for the future? Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… well, should something happen. I apologize, my memory isn't what it used to be. I think it’s called an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I’m a little confused about the difference, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It's very thoughtful of you to be proactive about this, Ms. Buoniconti. Planning for the future and ensuring your wishes are known is incredibly important. You are right to inquire about Advance Directives and POLST forms – they are both ways to document your healthcare preferences, but they serve different purposes. Before we delve into the specifics, let me just get a bit of background. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: That’s a… a good question. Honestly, Doctor, it’s difficult for me to recall. I’ve seen a few specialists over the years, mostly for… aches and pains, I suppose. Nothing major, as far as I remember. My divorce was rather… stressful, and I think I neglected my health for quite some time. I don’t believe I have any ongoing illnesses currently, but I truly couldn’t say with certainty. Is there a way to check my records? Perhaps from previous doctors? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s perfectly understandable to have gaps in your medical history, especially during a stressful period. Let me see what we have here… It appears you’ve had visits with Dr. Ramirez, a rheumatologist, about three years ago for some joint pain, and Dr. Chen, a general practitioner, for routine check-ups until about five years ago. There's also a note from a physical therapist regarding back pain. We can certainly request those records if you'd like. Would you be comfortable with me doing that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… immensely helpful. Dr. Ramirez… that name sounds familiar. I recall feeling quite stiff then, but it seemed to come and go. I mostly managed it with… stretching, I think. And heat packs. It's good to know it was something, even if I couldn’t recall the specifics. Thank you for looking that up, Doctor. It puts my mind at ease a little.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. That's good to know about the stretching and heat packs – it’s always helpful to understand what’s worked for you in the past. While we wait for those records to arrive – which usually takes a few business days – let's talk a little more about why you’re interested in Advance Directives and POLST forms now. Has something specific prompted this consideration, or is it more of a general desire to be prepared?
PATIENT: It's… difficult to explain. Perhaps a bit of both? My divorce finalized a little over a year ago, and it really made me re-evaluate things. I realized… I hadn’t really thought about what I wanted, for a long time. Everything was… focused on my former spouse. Now, I'm trying to be more proactive about my own well-being. And… I don't have any family nearby. No children. Just… a few distant cousins I rarely see. The thought of… not being able to communicate my wishes… it worries me. I suppose that’s the core of it.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s incredibly responsible of you to think ahead and make plans, especially given your circumstances. It's perfectly reasonable to want to ensure your wishes are respected, regardless of family proximity. Let’s clarify the difference between the Advance Directive and the POLST form. An Advance Directive – also known as a Living Will – outlines your general healthcare wishes, like whether you want life-sustaining treatment, and who you’d like to make decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to. A POLST form, or Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment, is a medical order that specifically details what treatments you do or do not want, and is usually for people with a serious illness or frailty. Given what you’ve told me, starting with an Advance Directive would likely be the most appropriate step. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. An Advance Directive… outlining my wishes generally. That feels more… encompassing, I suppose. The POLST form sounds a bit… specific for my current situation. I don’t believe I’m seriously ill, thankfully. So, what exactly does filling out this Advance Directive entail? Is it a long document? Will I need a lawyer? I apologize again for all the questions. I just want to be sure I understand everything before proceeding.
DOCTOR: You’re not imposing at all, Ms. Buoniconti. These are important questions, and it’s good you’re asking them. An Advance Directive doesn't necessarily need to be a long document. It can be quite simple, outlining your preferences for things like resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition. And no, you generally don't need a lawyer to complete one. Most states have standard forms available online or through hospitals. We can provide you with a form here at the clinic, and I can guide you through the process. I can explain each section and answer any questions you have. However, if you feel more comfortable having legal counsel, that’s perfectly acceptable. It’s always best to feel confident in your decisions. Before we get to the form itself, let's quickly cover your current health status a little more thoroughly. Just a quick review of systems, to get a better overall picture. Have you experienced any significant changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: That’s good to know. Not needing a lawyer is… a relief, frankly. The thought of additional expenses is… daunting. Significant changes… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, precisely. I’ve been feeling… rather tired lately, more so than usual. I attribute it to adjusting to being on my own, and… the stress of everything. And my back has been bothering me again, a dull ache that comes and goes. Nothing debilitating, but… persistent. I’ve been using heat packs, as I mentioned before, and that seems to help a little. I also have a bit of trouble sleeping, sometimes. Mostly just… restless. I don’t think any of it is serious, but it’s all been rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, recurrent back pain, and some difficulty sleeping. That gives us a little more to work with. It’s good you've been managing the back pain with heat packs, but we should explore the fatigue and sleep issues a bit further. It's always worth investigating, even if it turns out to be stress-related. Let’s start with the fatigue. Can you describe what you mean by "tired"?
PATIENT: It’s… not just physical exhaustion, though I do feel physically drained sometimes. It's more… a lack of energy, a sort of… mental weariness, I suppose. It’s difficult to concentrate, and I find myself needing to nap during the day, which is unusual for me. Even simple tasks feel… overwhelming. Like grocery shopping, or even just watching television. It’s a bit like… being weighed down by something, though I can’t quite put my finger on what. And it’s been going on for several months now, gradually getting worse. I initially thought it was just… adjusting to a new routine, but it hasn’t improved. I've also noticed I'm less interested in things I used to enjoy, like my etching work. That’s… concerning, to be honest. I used to find it so relaxing and fulfilling. Now… it feels like a chore.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue with a significant mental component, difficulty concentrating, daytime napping, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities… That's helpful information. It sounds like it’s more than just simple adjustment stress. We should rule out any underlying medical causes for this. Let’s briefly go through a review of systems, just to get a fuller picture. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, or night sweats. Nothing like that. My temperature has been perfectly normal, as far as I know. I haven't even felt particularly warm or cold, really. Just… tired. And a bit… listless, I suppose. I’ve been eating regularly, though my appetite hasn’t been what it used to be. Mostly just… smaller portions. And I’ve noticed I’m… thirstier than usual, but I’ve been trying to drink more water to compensate. I haven't had any changes in my bowel habits, and no unexplained weight loss, as far as I can tell. Oh, and my vision has been a bit blurry lately, but I’ve always had slightly poor eyesight, so I assumed it was just my glasses needing an adjustment. I haven't scheduled an appointment with the optometrist yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, night sweats, normal temperature. Decreased appetite, increased thirst, no changes in bowel habits, no unexplained weight loss, and blurry vision. It's good you've noticed these details. Given the fatigue, increased thirst, and blurry vision, it might be worthwhile to check your blood sugar levels. It could be a sign of pre-diabetes or diabetes, though it’s too early to say for certain. We can do a quick finger-prick test here in the office, or schedule a blood draw at the lab. Would you prefer one or the other?
PATIENT: A finger-prick test here in the office would be… preferable, I think. Less… daunting than a full blood draw. I always get a bit anxious about needles, to be honest. If you think it’s worthwhile, then please, let’s proceed with the finger-prick test. I trust your judgment, Doctor. And thank you for being so thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. Perhaps we can revisit the Advance Directive after we have some results?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconti. That’s a very reasonable approach. We’ll get some results quickly, and then we can discuss the next steps. And yes, we can absolutely revisit the Advance Directive once we have a better understanding of what’s going on. This will just be a quick prick on your finger to obtain a small blood sample. It might sting for a moment, but it shouldn’t be painful. Do you have any allergies to latex or alcohol swabs?
PATIENT: No allergies to latex or alcohol swabs, thankfully. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. Just… proceed when you’re ready, Doctor. I trust you. And thank you again for your patience. It's… a relief to finally be addressing these concerns. I’ve been putting it off for too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Buoniconti, that's all done. Just a small prick, as promised. Now we just need to wait a few minutes for the results to come back. While we wait, let me ask you about your etching work. What kind of things do you usually create?
PATIENT: It’s mostly landscapes, I suppose. And floral patterns. I find them… calming to create. I used to spend hours in my studio, completely lost in the process. It was my escape, my sanctuary. But lately… I haven't been able to muster the motivation. It feels like… a chore, as I mentioned before. I’ll start a piece, get a few lines down, and then just… lose interest. It’s frustrating, to be honest. I used to be so passionate about it. It was more than just a hobby; it was… part of who I am. I used to sell my work at local art fairs, but I haven’t done that in years. I just haven’t had the energy. It feels… pointless, somehow.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a significant loss of enjoyment, and it’s completely understandable that you’re frustrated. Alright, Ms. Buoniconti, the results are back. Your blood glucose level is… 135 mg/dL. That’s slightly elevated. A normal fasting glucose level is typically between 70 and 100 mg/dL. This result alone isn’t a definitive diagnosis, but it’s enough to warrant further investigation. We should repeat the test on a different day, preferably after an overnight fast, to confirm the results. It’s possible you may have pre-diabetes, or even type 2 diabetes. But we won’t know for sure until we get a more accurate reading. Would you be comfortable scheduling a follow-up appointment next week to repeat the test?
PATIENT: 135… Slightly elevated. That… doesn’t sound good, does it? No, it doesn’t. I suppose not. Yes, scheduling a follow-up appointment next week would be… appropriate. I trust your judgment, Doctor. It's better to know for certain, I suppose. And if it is diabetes… what does that entail? What kind of treatment is involved? I apologize for all the questions, but I’m rather… apprehensive. This is… a lot to process.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to process, Ms. Buoniconti, and you're right to be asking questions. It’s good you’re taking it seriously. A diagnosis of pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes isn’t the end of the world, but it does require lifestyle changes and potentially medication. With pre-diabetes, we’d focus on diet and exercise to try to prevent it from progressing to full-blown diabetes. That typically involves reducing your sugar and carbohydrate intake, increasing your physical activity, and losing a small amount of weight. If it is type 2 diabetes, we’d have a similar approach, but potentially with medication to help manage your blood sugar levels. There are several different medications available, and we'd choose the one that’s best suited for you. We would also monitor your blood sugar levels regularly, and educate you on how to manage your condition. It requires commitment, but many people live long, healthy lives with diabetes. Before we schedule that follow-up appointment, let’s revisit the Advance Directive. Given these new developments, perhaps we should postpone it for now?
PATIENT: Postponing the Advance Directive… yes, that seems prudent. It feels… difficult to make such important decisions when I’m still trying to process all of this. I need to… gather my thoughts, and understand what’s going on first. It feels like… a lot to deal with, all at once. Perhaps, once I have a clearer understanding of my health situation, we can revisit it. For now, focusing on managing my blood sugar levels seems like the most sensible course of action. Thank you, Doctor. For your patience, and your honesty. It's… a relief to finally have some answers, even if they aren’t what I was hoping for.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Let’s schedule that follow-up appointment for next week. Would Tuesday afternoon work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday afternoon would be… acceptable, yes. That would give me some time to… adjust, and gather information. Tuesday afternoon works. And thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I… feel a little less anxious now, knowing I have a plan. Perhaps I should start looking into… dietary changes, and exercise routines? Do you have any recommendations, or resources I can consult? I suppose I should start preparing myself for… the possibility of medication, as well? This is… a lot to take in. But I’m grateful for your guidance.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconti. I’m glad you’re feeling a little less anxious. I can provide you with a handout on dietary changes for managing blood sugar levels, and some resources for finding healthy recipes. There are also several excellent websites and apps that can help you track your food intake and exercise. As for exercise, starting with a brisk 30-minute walk each day is a good goal. Here’s that handout. It includes a list of foods to avoid, foods to prioritize, and some sample meal plans. I'll also email you links to some helpful websites. As for medication, let’s wait until we get the results of the repeat test before discussing that further. There are many different options available, and we'll choose the one that’s best suited for your individual needs. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. That’s… very thorough, and helpful. The handout is… appreciated. It gives me something to… focus on, and a starting point. I think… I think I’ll take some time to review this information, and try to adjust my lifestyle accordingly. Thank you again, Doctor Alanes. For your patience, your honesty, and your guidance. I… feel a little more hopeful now, knowing I have a plan. And knowing I’m not alone in this. I believe that’s all for now. Perhaps I’ll see you on Tuesday?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. And you’re definitely not alone in this. I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Yes, I’ll see you on Tuesday. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and have a good weekend. And remember, small changes can make a big difference. .
PATIENT: . Thank you, Doctor. You too. And… I will try. .
