DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Blim, was it? Yes, well, honestly… I’m not entirely sure. My daughter just thought I should… get checked out. She worries too much, that girl. I feel fine, mostly. Just… old, I suppose. It’s just curiosity, really. Though, I did have a little trouble remembering where I parked… now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: “Just old,” is it?
PATIENT: Well, isn't that what happens when you live a long life? I’ve been a surgical tech for… oh, goodness, decades. You see a lot, you do a lot. It wears on a person, I imagine. Not that I’m complaining! Just… things aren’t as sharp as they used to be, you know? It’s not like I’m expecting a miracle, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Decades, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Forty-two years, come October. At St. Luke’s, mostly. Though I did a stint at Mercy when my husband… well, never mind about that. Point is, I’ve seen a lot of young doctors come and go. You’re probably one of the newer ones, aren't you? Not that that's a bad thing. Just… a lot of years on my feet, that's all.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Calvery, while I appreciate your… history, we need to be a bit more specific. Forty-two years is a long time, and “not as sharp” is rather vague. Let’s start with this difficulty remembering where you parked. Has this been a recent development, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Gradual, I suppose. It's not like I forget everything, you understand. Just… little things. Like names, sometimes. And where I put my glasses. It's frustrating, more than anything. And now the car… Honestly, my daughter made a whole fuss about it. Said it could be… something serious. She always jumps to the worst conclusions, that one. I told her I just need a good nap.
DOCTOR: Names and glasses… typical. And a daughter prone to hyperbole. Alright. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. Well, I do seem to get tired more easily these days. It's not like I can work a double shift like I used to. And my hands… they ache, sometimes. Especially after I’ve been… well, doing things. Sewing, mostly. I like to make quilts for the grandkids. But the arthritis, you know? It's just old age, I’m sure. It’s not like I expect you to fix me up like new.
DOCTOR: Sewing… and arthritis. Do you have any trouble with balance, Ms. Calvery?
PATIENT: Balance? Not particularly. Though… now that you mention it, I did stumble a bit on the stairs the other day. Just a little wobble, really. I caught myself. My daughter, of course, made that into a near-death experience too. “Mom almost broke her hip!” Honestly, she dramatizes everything. I just get a little dizzy sometimes, I think. It passes quickly. It's probably just… low blood sugar. I skip breakfast sometimes.
DOCTOR: “Sometimes skip breakfast,” you say?
PATIENT: Well, yes. I’m not much of a morning person, you see. Coffee is all I need. And sometimes I get busy… with the grandkids, or sewing, or… things. I just forget to eat, really. It’s not a habit, Doctor, just… a little oversight. I'm perfectly healthy otherwise, mostly. A bit forgetful, a little tired, a little achy… but who isn't at my age? It's not like I need a full workup or anything, is it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, with all due respect, “not like I need a full workup” is not a medical assessment. I’ve reviewed your EHR – your daughter did provide quite a detailed account, I see – and given your age, your symptoms, and your… dietary habits, a basic assessment is absolutely necessary. We’ll start with a neurological exam and some blood work. Routine, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. A neurological exam? That sounds… excessive. My daughter really went overboard, didn’t she? I told her I was just fine. Honestly, Doctor, are you sure this is necessary? I've been a perfectly capable surgical tech for forty-two years. I think I know when something’s wrong with me. And I assure you, my brain is still functioning, thank you very much. It's just… a bit slower sometimes. Is there really no other way?
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, it's my professional responsibility to assess your condition thoroughly. Your daughter’s concerns, combined with your own account of memory lapses, fatigue, and dietary irregularities, warrant a neurological examination. It’s a simple assessment, and it will either confirm your well-being or identify any underlying issues that require attention. I assure you, I am not attempting to inconvenience you, but rather to provide the best possible care. Now, if you'll please follow me to the exam room… we’ll start with your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But I’m warning you, Doctor, don’t be surprised if I ace it. I've spent my life assisting surgeons. I know a thing or two about reflexes. And my daughter really does worry too much. It's just… a bit of aging, that's all. Lead the way, I suppose. But I’m holding you personally responsible if I get a headache from all this poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll proceed. And I assure you, I am not attempting to “poke and prod” unnecessarily. Now, if you could please sit on the examination table…
PATIENT: Honestly, this is like being a patient myself. I've seen this table used for far more serious things. Don't go expecting any miracles, Doctor. My brain might be a little foggy, but I'm still perfectly capable of telling you if something doesn't feel right. And please, be gentle. My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with your deep tendon reflexes. Please relax your leg and let it dangle freely. I’m going to tap just below your kneecap. It may be slightly uncomfortable. And now the other leg… Moderate response bilaterally. Now, let’s test your plantar reflex. And the other foot… Normal plantar reflexes bilaterally. Now, let's check your pupillary response. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Minimal nystagmus. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. It’s a little blurry, Doctor. Are you sure this light isn’t too bright? My eyes aren’t what they used to be. Honestly, I’ve been staring at surgical lights for decades. They probably fried my retinas. Is that a thing? And please, don't expect perfect tracking. My head gets a little dizzy sometimes, you know? It’s not like I’m a young athlete. Is this going to take much longer? I have a quilt to finish.
DOCTOR: Minimal nystagmus bilaterally. Okay. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions. Just to assess your cognitive function. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date…? Oh dear. Let me think… It’s… August, isn’t it? Yes, August. The second… or is it the third? Oh, goodness. It’s one of those early days. I always get confused with the early days of the month. My daughter keeps a very detailed calendar, you know. I should really ask her. Is it important? It's not like I’m balancing the national budget.
DOCTOR: Just trying to get a baseline, Ms. Calvery. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake, Doctor. Honestly, are you testing me? It’s… 2025, isn't it? Yes, 2025. Though, to be honest, all the years are starting to blend together. Forty-two years at St. Luke’s… you lose track, you know? It's like a blur of surgeries and patients and… well, everything. Is this really necessary? It's not like I'm suffering from amnesia.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. Let's try a simple recall test. I'm going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me after I finish. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But if they’re complicated medical terms, I’m warning you now, I won’t remember them. I’m a surgical tech, not a surgeon. Go ahead, then. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Apple, Table, Penny. Now, please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Hmm… Something with money… a coin, perhaps? Oh dear. This is awful. I knew I shouldn't have skipped breakfast. My brain isn't working properly. Is it okay if I take a guess? Apple… Table… and… Nickel? No, that’s not right… It was something shiny…
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, based on the results of this brief assessment, I am concerned about your short-term memory and cognitive function. I recommend further evaluation, including an MRI and a comprehensive neurological workup. We also need to discuss your dietary habits and ensure you are receiving adequate nutrition. I’m going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Finally, I suggest a consultation with a neurologist. I’ll have my nurse schedule the appointments for you. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An MRI? A neurologist? Are you telling me something is wrong with my brain? Honestly, Doctor, I told you I was fine! I just forget a few things sometimes. It’s called aging, not a medical emergency. My daughter will be thrilled. She always wants me to have every test imaginable. And a comprehensive workup? That sounds… expensive. And frankly, a little insulting. I’ve spent my life assisting surgeons. I think I’d know if something was seriously wrong with me. Is this really necessary, Doctor? Or is my daughter just… overreacting?
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, I understand your concerns, but it is my professional responsibility to investigate any potential cognitive decline, regardless of whether it’s attributed to aging or other factors. While I acknowledge your extensive experience in the medical field, self-assessment is not a substitute for a thorough evaluation. The tests I’ve ordered are standard procedures for ruling out various conditions that can affect cognitive function. I assure you, we’re not jumping to conclusions, but rather taking a proactive approach to ensure your well-being. The consultation with a neurologist will provide further clarity and guide us in determining the best course of action. I will have my nurse explain the costs associated with these tests and explore potential insurance coverage options. I strongly advise you to schedule these appointments as soon as possible. Do you have any questions regarding the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No. I… I suppose not. I mean, what’s the point of asking? You’ve already made up your mind. It’s just… a lot. An MRI, a neurologist… It all sounds so… serious. And frankly, a little frightening. My daughter will be insufferable. She'll tell everyone I'm "finally getting the help I need." Honestly, I just want to go home and finish my quilt. And maybe take a nap. Just… get me the information. And I’ll… I’ll talk to my daughter. But I’m not promising anything. I think I’ve had enough poking and prodding for one day.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Calvery. My nurse will bring the information to you before you leave. She can also answer any questions you may have regarding the appointments and the tests. I understand this is a lot to process, and I want to assure you that I am here to support you every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I’ll have her schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results once they are available. For now, I recommend getting some rest, as you mentioned. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… let my daughter know when the appointments are scheduled. She’ll handle the rest. Honestly, I just want to go home. Thank you, Doctor… I suppose. And please, tell your nurse to be gentle with my daughter. She worries too much. .
