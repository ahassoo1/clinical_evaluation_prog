DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's...nice to meet you as well. Well, it's my hearing, you see. It comes and goes. And sometimes, when it goes, the room just…spins. It’s a bit unsettling, to be honest. My daughter, bless her heart, she said I really ought to get it checked out. And then there's...family history, she mentioned something about that when she made the appointment. I don't rightly recall all the details, though. It was a while ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Mayhugh. It sounds concerning, and it's good you came in to have it looked at, and very thoughtful of your daughter to encourage you to seek care. The dizziness along with the fluctuating hearing is certainly something we want to investigate. Let's start with the hearing. When did you first notice it coming and going?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. It's not like it was a sudden thing. It's been...gradual, I suppose. Maybe a few months now? It's hard to say exactly. Sometimes it's just a muffled sound, like someone put cotton in my ears. Other times, it's like...nothing at all. Then it comes back again. It's just…random. Does that make sense? I wish I could be more precise, but my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Mayhugh. Fluctuating symptoms like that can be difficult to pinpoint. And it's perfectly normal for memory to change over time. We'll work through it together. You mentioned the dizziness. Does this dizziness happen at the same time as the hearing loss, or does it occur separately?
PATIENT: Hmmm. That’s a good question. I think...most of the time it is when my hearing goes. Like, I notice my ears feel funny, then everything starts to spin. But I… I can’t be certain. There was that one time, I think, when I was just walking in the garden and felt dizzy all of a sudden. But maybe that wasn’t related? It all gets a bit muddled, you see. My daughter would probably remember better. She has a very good memory.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s very common for these things to be difficult to recall precisely, and it’s helpful to know your daughter has a good memory – we may want to speak with her if you’re comfortable with that. To help me understand a bit more, can you describe what the dizziness feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not a nice feeling, Doctor. It’s like the room is spinning around and around. And I feel like I’m going to fall over. Not every time, but sometimes. It makes me feel very unsteady on my feet. And a bit nauseous, sometimes. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few minutes. But it’s very frightening when it happens. I usually have to sit down until it passes. I don’t like it at all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Mayhugh. That sounds very unsettling indeed. It’s good you sit down when it happens, that’s a sensible precaution. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, I have Medicare, so I must have something, right? Let me think... The doctor, a few years back, mentioned my blood pressure was a little high, but he put me on some pills for it. I think I still take them. And…I had a bad bout of the flu a couple of winters ago, and they said my heart was beating a bit fast then. Other than that… not much, I don’t think. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat my vegetables and all that. It’s just this hearing and dizziness that’s bothering me now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a history of a fast heartbeat during a bout of the flu. Do you happen to know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I don’t, Doctor. I just…I have a little pill organizer, and I take the ones labeled “BP” every morning. My daughter helps me refill it. I’m not very good with remembering names, you see. I apologize. It's probably written down somewhere but I haven't a clue where. I just know I take them every day and hope for the best!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Mayhugh. Don't apologize at all. Many people have difficulty remembering medication names. We can certainly look up your medications in our system with your Medicare information if you’re comfortable with that. Now, aside from the high blood pressure, have you ever had any other serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Surgeries… I had my appendix out when I was a little girl. A very long time ago! And… oh! I had a cataract removed from one eye a few years back. That went well, thankfully. My vision's a bit blurry still, which is why I wear these glasses. Other than that… I don’t think so. I’ve been fairly lucky, all things considered. I’ve never broken any bones or had anything major happen. It’s mostly just aches and pains from getting old, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, so appendix removal as a child and cataract surgery a few years ago. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as hearing loss, dizziness, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s… a difficult one. My mother…she had some trouble with her balance when she got older. She fell a few times. And my brother, bless his soul, he had a heart condition. He passed away a few years ago. As for hearing loss… I think my father was a bit hard of hearing towards the end, but I don't remember the specifics. There were a lot of family gatherings and people talking over each other. It's all a bit hazy, to be honest. My daughter would know more. She’s very good at remembering those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of balance issues in your mother, heart condition in your brother, and possible hearing loss in your father. Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Mayhugh. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband, God rest his soul, he used to smoke, but I always hated it. I made him smoke outside, even in the rain! I always believed it was a terrible habit. And I try to encourage everyone around me to stay away from it as well. It's just not good for you.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Mayhugh. Very good for you. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. Just a small glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Nothing excessive, I assure you. Mostly on special occasions, or if I'm feeling a bit down. It helps me relax, you know? But I don't drink every day. Not at all. My husband used to enjoy a beer or two, but I never really got into it. It’s just a little treat now and then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Mayhugh. Thank you for answering all my questions so thoroughly. Now, I’d like to ask about any allergies you might have, to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…Hmm. Let me think. I don’t think I have any serious allergies. I get a bit of a rash sometimes if I touch certain plants in the garden, but it's not too bad. A little bit of itching, that's all. And I think I had a reaction to a bee sting when I was a child, but it was a long time ago. No known allergies to food or medications, as far as I know. My daughter always checks when they give me new pills, though. She's very careful.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And finally, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I take a multivitamin every day. Just a little one, to keep me healthy, you know? And sometimes, when my joints are feeling particularly achy, I take some glucosamine and chondroitin. My daughter bought it for me, she said it would help. Other than that… I don’t think so. I try not to take too many pills. It makes me feel…foggy, you know? I like to keep things simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Mayhugh. Thank you so much for sharing all of that information with me. That gives me a good understanding of your medical background and current health status. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then, I'd like to take a look in your ears and do a few simple tests to assess your balance and hearing. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust your judgment. I'm ready when you are. Just… please be gentle, alright? My bones aren't what they used to be. And… it might be best to explain what you're doing as you go, if you don't mind. It helps me feel less…anxious.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Mayhugh. I will absolutely explain everything as I go, and I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure. I will wrap this cuff around your arm and inflate it briefly. It will feel a bit tight, but it shouldn't be painful. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little bit elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Good. Now, I'm going to look in your ears with an otoscope. This will help me check for any signs of infection or wax buildup. It might feel a little cool. I see a small amount of cerumen in both ears, but nothing significant. The ear canals appear clear. Now, let’s check your balance. I’d like you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Just try to maintain your balance for as long as possible. I’ll be right here to steady you if you need me.
PATIENT: Okay. Oh dear. This is a bit tricky. I can feel myself swaying. It’s…hard to keep my balance when my eyes are closed. Oh, I think I’m going to fall. Whew! That was close. I told you my balance isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Mayhugh. It's perfectly normal to feel unsteady, and it’s good you reached out. No harm done at all. It’s important to know your limits. Now, I’d like to do a quick hearing test. I will place these headphones over your ears, and you will hear a series of beeps at different pitches and volumes. Just indicate when you hear a beep by raising your hand. We’ll do each ear separately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. Just… please don’t make the beeps too loud, alright? My ears are a bit sensitive today. And… if I don't hear anything, I'll just tell you, right? I don't want to pretend to hear something if I don't. I want to be honest.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Mayhugh. We’ll start with a very low volume and gradually increase it. And you are perfectly right to tell me if you don’t hear anything - honesty is the best policy. Alright, I'm going to start now. Just let me know when you hear a beep. It may be a high-pitched tone, or a lower rumble. Okay, we’ve completed the hearing test for both ears. The results show mild to moderate hearing loss in both ears, particularly at higher frequencies. This is consistent with age-related hearing loss, but it's something we need to investigate further to rule out other potential causes.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Hearing loss, you say? That’s… not surprising, I suppose. But… is it bad? Will I need a hearing aid? My mother had one, and she always said it was very difficult to get used to. And what about the dizziness? Is that connected to the hearing loss? I’m getting a bit worried now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Ms. Mayhugh, and I appreciate you sharing your concerns. Let's take things one step at a time. The hearing loss is mild to moderate, which means you may have difficulty hearing quieter sounds or understanding speech in noisy environments. A hearing aid could certainly be helpful, and the technology has improved significantly since your mother's time. We can discuss the different options available and see if it's something you'd like to explore. We would start with a formal audiological evaluation with our audiologist to confirm the degree and type of hearing loss. As for the dizziness, it's possible it's connected to the hearing loss, particularly if it’s related to the inner ear. However, dizziness can have many causes, so we need to rule out other possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few further investigations. First, I'd like to order a blood test to check your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Second, I’d like you to see an ENT specialist for a more comprehensive evaluation of your ears and inner ear. They may recommend further testing, such as a CT scan or MRI. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Blood tests and an ENT specialist… Yes, alright. If that’s what you recommend, Doctor. It sounds… thorough. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you know? And… I'm glad you're taking it seriously. Will the ENT specialist be at this clinic? And… will I need a referral? I’m not very good at navigating these things, you see. My daughter usually handles all the appointments and paperwork. But she’s busy with work right now, and I didn’t want to bother her unless it was absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. I understand it can be overwhelming, and I'm happy to help you navigate this process. The ENT specialist is not located at this clinic, but I work closely with Dr. Eleanor Vance at City General Hospital. She’s an excellent doctor and very experienced in diagnosing and treating ear and dizziness problems. Yes, you will need a referral from me to see her. I will prepare that for you right now, along with the order for the blood tests. The referral will include all the necessary information, including her contact details and instructions on how to schedule an appointment. I will also make a note to have the results sent directly to her office. I can also call her office to expedite the scheduling process if you’d like. And don’t worry, I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have along the way. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor. Thank you so much. You’re taking so much weight off my shoulders. Yes, if you could call her office to schedule the appointment, that would be fantastic. And if you could send the results directly to her, even better. I really appreciate your help. Will I need to fast before the blood tests? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a bridge club meeting next week, and I don’t want to miss it. It’s the only thing I look forward to all week, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. I'm happy to help in any way I can. Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests. That means no food or drinks, except for water. The lab will give you specific instructions when you schedule the appointment. The blood test results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. I will notify you as soon as they are available. I will also call Dr. Vance's office to schedule your appointment with her at your earliest convenience. And don't worry about missing your bridge club meeting. We’ll do everything we can to get this sorted out as quickly and efficiently as possible. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You've been so thorough and kind. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns and explain everything so clearly. Oh, one more thing. Would it be alright if I called you if I have any questions before my appointment with the ENT specialist? I tend to worry, you see, and it would be reassuring to know I can reach out if I need to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. Please do not hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. My staff will be happy to assist you, and if they can't answer your questions, they will forward your call to me. I'm here to help in any way I can. Here are the documents. The referral has Dr. Vance’s contact information and instructions for scheduling the appointment. The blood test order is for the lab at City General Hospital. I will call Dr. Vance’s office now to get you scheduled. Do you have any other concerns before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your kindness and patience. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old woman like me. It means a lot. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Ms. Mayhugh. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. And please, don’t think of yourself as just "an old woman." You are a valued patient, and your health and well-being are very important to me. .
