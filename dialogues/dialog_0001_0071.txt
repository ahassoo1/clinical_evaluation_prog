DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Skarbek. I'm Dr. Pehrson. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you. Well, it’s about getting some shots. My daughter… she’s trying to get her papers right to come live here, and I understand there are certain vaccinations she needs for that. I want to make sure she has everything taken care of, you see. It’s a bit confusing, all the requirements.
DOCTOR: Vaccinations, right. Immigration paperwork. Yes, I get a lot of that. Okay. How old is your daughter?
PATIENT: She’s 28. Just turned 28 in May, actually. She’s a good girl, very responsible. But she hasn’t… well, she hasn’t had a lot of chances for regular doctor visits, if you understand. Living in a different country and all.
DOCTOR: Twenty-eight. Alright. So, we're likely looking at a fairly comprehensive update then, not just a quick booster. Do you have any records of her previous vaccinations?
PATIENT: That’s what I figured. Comprehensive… yes, that sounds right. And no, I don't have anything. She brought a few papers from the doctors over there, but they’re not… in English, and even then, they don't seem to list everything. I’m afraid we’ll have to start from scratch, mostly. Is that alright? I just want to be sure she’s covered and doesn’t need to worry about anything while she’s here.
DOCTOR: Alright, starting from scratch it is. Look, I'm going to need to ask a lot of questions, and frankly, if you don’t know the specifics, we’ll just have to run some titers. It's the safest way. We'll start with the basics. Has she ever had measles, mumps, or rubella?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good idea about the tests. I’m not sure about those. She was a little girl when she left, and my memory… well, it isn’t what it used to be. I remember her being sick once with something with spots, but I couldn’t tell you what it was. It was a long time ago. She was maybe five or six? Does that help at all? It was before we… before her mother passed. I’m sorry, I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Skarbek. Details are hard to recall. Spots…could be anything. Okay. How about chickenpox?
PATIENT: Chickenpox… now, that one I think I remember. She had chickenpox, yes. A bad case, as I recall. Lots of little bumps everywhere. She was miserable for a good week, her mother had to keep her home from school. It was… oh, I'd say when she was around eight years old? I remember having to put calamine lotion on her constantly. It was a summer, I’m pretty sure. Warm weather.
DOCTOR: Okay, chickenpox, likely immune. Good. Now, this is important. Has she ever had a tetanus shot?
PATIENT: Tetanus… Oh goodness. That one… I honestly don't know. I remember getting shots when I was a child, and I’m sure she had some when she was little, but I have no record and I can’t recall specifically if she had a tetanus shot. I’m sorry. It’s just… so long ago, and things were different then. We didn’t keep such careful track of these things. Does she need to have one regardless? I just want to be certain she’s safe.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Skarbek, it’s fine. It's just that tetanus is serious. Without knowing her history, we have to assume she hasn't had one. We’ll give her a booster today, just to be safe. It's a quick shot, really. Now, let's move on. Has she ever had a flu shot?
PATIENT: Oh, well, if that’s what’s best, then yes, please. I trust your judgment, Doctor. A quick shot is better than taking any chances. As for the flu shot… no, I don’t think she’s ever had one. She always said she tried to stay healthy, and we didn't have much access to those things where she was. She’s a strong girl, but… illnesses spread quickly, don't they? Should she get one today as well? I don't want her to be sick when she first arrives. It would be a terrible first impression.
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll give her a flu shot today. It's October, it's the right time. Okay, now let’s talk about hepatitis A and B. Any idea if she’s ever been vaccinated against those?
PATIENT: Hepatitis… Oh, goodness. Those sound like… serious diseases. No, Doctor, I honestly don’t know anything about those. Never had any discussions about them, and I don’t recall her ever receiving those shots. She was always very careful about what she ate and drank, but… I suppose that doesn’t mean anything. Should she get those as well? I'm starting to feel a little overwhelmed, to be honest. Is this… normal for someone coming from another country? I just want her to be healthy and safe, and I'm trying to do everything right.
DOCTOR: Mr. Skarbek, it's standard procedure. You're right to be concerned, and yes, this is typical when someone is relocating from a different part of the world. We just need to cover all the bases. We'll go ahead and order a panel of blood tests to check her immunity levels for everything. It will tell us exactly what she needs. Now, before we proceed with the shots, do you have any allergies we need to be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, that makes me feel a little better, Doctor. Knowing it's normal… thank you. Blood tests… yes, that sounds sensible. As for allergies… let me see. She doesn't have any food allergies, as far as I know. And no known allergies to medications. But… she used to get a rash sometimes when she was a little girl, if she spent too much time in the sun. Just a little redness, nothing serious. And one time, she got a little itchy after playing with a cat. Is that something we need to worry about? I’m so sorry if I’m being a bother. I just want to be thorough.
DOCTOR: A mild sun rash and a little itchiness from a cat… unlikely to be significant allergies, but I'll make a note. Alright, let's get her some lab work ordered. Could we get a Hep A/B panel, tetanus titers, and a flu shot drawn for Mr. Skarbek’s daughter?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Thank you, Doctor. And… what happens next? Will she need to come back for more shots? How long will the results take? I have a feeling I'm going to be asking a lot of questions, and I apologize for that. I just want to understand everything and make sure she’s fully protected before she starts her new life here. It means so much to her, and to me.
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days. Depending on what those results show, she may need a series of boosters. We'll go over everything carefully when they come back. In the meantime, I’m going to go ahead and administer the flu shot and a tetanus booster, just as a precaution. Do you have any other questions for me right now, before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. If I think of anything, I'll be sure to ask. Thank you for being so patient with me. It's a weight off my mind knowing she’s getting the care she needs. Please, let's just get the shots done. The sooner she’s protected, the better. I trust your judgment completely.
DOCTOR: Alright. Nurse, can you prepare a flu vaccine and a tetanus booster for Mr. Skarbek's daughter?
