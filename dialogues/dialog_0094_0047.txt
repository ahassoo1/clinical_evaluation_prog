DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, it's about getting some help with... long-term care, I think? My daughter, she set this up. I don't remember all the details, to be honest. It's something about insurance, I believe. She said it was important.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s perfectly alright if you’re not sure of all the details, that’s what I’m here for. It sounds like your daughter is very thoughtful, wanting to get things sorted out for you. Let's take our time and figure things out together. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health... hmm. Well, I work down at the docks, unloading stuff. Been doin' that a long time. It keeps me movin', I guess. I get tired easier now than I used to. And my back... my back ain't what it used to be, either. Mostly just aches, you know? Nothing bad, usually. I see a chiropractor now and then for it. I don't get sick much, though. Just... old, I reckon. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: That gives me a good starting point, thank you. It’s good you're still active, even with the aches and pains. And it’s helpful to know you see a chiropractor. When you say your back "aches," could you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Well... it's not a sharp pain, not usually. More like a... heavy feelin'. Like somethin's weighin' on it all the time. Sometimes it goes down my leg a little, that left one. Not all the way to my foot, just kinda in the thigh. It's worse after I've been liftin' heavy stuff, or if I bend over too much. And sittin' for too long don't help none. It just gets stiffer, you know? Hard to explain... it just hurts to move sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds like it could be a few different things, and it's helpful to know it radiates down your leg and is worse with certain activities. It’s good you’re describing it so well. To get a better picture, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your leg or foot at all, even briefly?
PATIENT: Numbness... hmm. Now that you mention it... yeah, sometimes. Not all the time, and it don't last long. It's in my foot, mostly. Like it's fallin' asleep, kinda. Happens when I've been on my feet all day, I think. Or after I've been bendin' a lot. It goes away pretty quick, though. Usually just when I sit down and rest for a bit. I didn't really think much of it, just figured it was my feet gettin' tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's important information. Numbness and tingling, even if brief, can be helpful in understanding what's going on. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical conditions... let me think. The doctor told me I had high blood pressure a few years back, but he put me on some pills for it. I take 'em every day. And... I think I had something with my cholesterol, too? He said it was high, and gave me pills for that as well. I can't remember the names of 'em, sorry. I don't really keep track of that stuff. And... that's about it, I think. I've broken a bone or two workin', but they healed up just fine. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: That's alright, don't worry about the names of the medications. It’s good to know you’ve been diagnosed with high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and that you’re taking medication for those. Do you know what your current dosages are for those medications?
PATIENT: Oh... uh... no, not really. My daughter handles refillin' 'em, and I just take 'em like she tells me. Little white pill and a blue one, I think? I don't look at the bottles too close. Sorry. I'm not good with rememberin' numbers and stuff. It's always been her job to keep track of all that. I just know I gotta take 'em every mornin'.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Rover. It’s very common for family members to help with medication management. We can certainly look up the specifics in your records if you'd like. Okay, I see here you are taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for your blood pressure and Atorvastatin 40mg daily for your cholesterol. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries... hmm. Let me think... Oh! I had my appendix out when I was a kid. A long time ago. And... I had somethin' done on my shoulder a few years back. It was hurtin' real bad from liftin' stuff, so the doctor fixed it. I don't remember what he did exactly, somethin' with the muscles, I think. It helped a lot, though. I used to have trouble liftin' my arm, but not anymore. That was maybe five, six years ago? It was at the hospital here in town.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Appendectomy as a child and shoulder surgery about five or six years ago. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history... that's a tough one. My mom... she had heart trouble, I think. She passed away when I was pretty young. And my dad... he worked hard all his life, down at the docks like me. He had bad knees when he got older, couldn't walk too good. And my sister... she's still alive, lives up north. She has... I think it was diabetes? She has to take shots for it. That's about all I remember, to be honest. We weren't a family that talked a lot about health stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good start. History of heart trouble in your mother, knee problems in your father, and diabetes in your sister. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Smoke... no, never smoked a day in my life. My dad used to, but I always hated it. Alcohol... I used to have a beer now and then, but not anymore. My doctor told me to stop, somethin' about interactin' with the pills. So I quit. And... no, don't use any other substances, never have. Just coffee, to get me goin' in the mornin'. That's about it. I mostly just work and try to stay busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No smoking, no current alcohol use, and no other substance use. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies... hmm. Not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anythin'. Sometimes I get a little itchy when I'm around cats, but that's just a mild allergy. Not serious. And... no, don't think I have any allergies to medications or food. I can eat pretty much anythin'. My daughter always asks, but I always tell her no. I guess I just haven't found anythin' I'm allergic to yet. Is that good?
DOCTOR: That is good, Mr. Rover. No known allergies is helpful. Okay, I think I have a good understanding of your medical history now. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your back and legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just let me know if it's gonna hurt or somethin'. My back's been a little sensitive lately, so try to be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 142/88, pulse is 78 and regular. Now, let’s take a look at your back. Can you point to where you’re feeling the most pain?
PATIENT: It's kinda all over, but mostly right here... ...and it goes down my leg a little, like I said. Not all the way to my foot, but kinda in the thigh. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, it kinda moves around sometimes. But that's where it's worst, usually. It's tender to the touch too, if you press on it. Careful now, it might hurt a little.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do feel some tenderness in your lower back, particularly on the left side. There’s some muscle guarding as well. Okay, bending forward causes some discomfort, and your range of motion is slightly limited. Now, let's check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Strength is 5/5 in all muscle groups, meaning full strength. And finally, the straight leg raise test is positive on the left side at about 30 degrees, which indicates some nerve irritation. Okay, based on the physical exam and your history, it appears you have some lower back pain with possible nerve irritation, likely sciatica. The muscle guarding and limited range of motion suggest a muscle strain component as well. We’ll need to get some imaging done to rule out any other causes, like a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. I’m going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. We’ll also want to get some blood work to check your inflammatory markers. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: MRI... blood work... sounds like a lot. Is it somethin' serious, Doctor? I just thought it was my back actin' up. I've had aches and pains for years, you know? I don't want to get into any big trouble. Sciatica... what's that mean? Is it gonna be painful? I hope I don't need surgery. I'm not good with surgery.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Rover. It sounds like a lot, but these tests are just to get a clearer picture of what's going on and rule out anything serious. Most likely, it is a muscle strain and some nerve irritation, as I mentioned. Sciatica refers to pain that radiates along the sciatic nerve, which runs from your lower back down your legs. It can cause pain, numbness, and tingling. The pain level can vary quite a bit – some people experience mild discomfort, while others have more severe pain. As for surgery, that is very unlikely at this point. We’ll start with conservative treatment – physical therapy, pain medication if needed, and rest. Surgery is only considered if those measures don't provide relief. Let’s focus on getting the MRI and blood work done first. We can discuss the results and a treatment plan once we have them. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: Yeah... that sounds better. Conservative treatment... I like that. No surgery right off the bat. Physical therapy... I can try that. I guess I can do some stretchin' and stuff. Okay... how do we get this MRI done? And the blood work... where do I go for that? Do I need to fast for the blood work? My daughter usually handles all this stuff, but she's away on a trip right now. I'm kinda on my own for a bit. I don't wanna mess anything up.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Rover. I’ll walk you through everything. I’m going to write you a referral for the MRI. You can schedule the appointment at [Name of Imaging Center] - their number is [Phone Number]. You’ll need to bring your insurance card with you. They will let you know if there is any specific preparation needed. For the blood work, I’ll give you a lab slip. You can go to [Name of Lab] - they have several locations, and you don’t need an appointment. And yes, you do need to fast for 12 hours before the blood work. That means no food or drinks, except water. You can have your last meal after midnight tonight. I’ll also send the results to my office, and my nurse will contact you once they are available. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… midnight tonight… no food… got it. [Name of Imaging Center] and [Name of Lab]… I’ll write that down. My nurse will call… good. Um… I think that’s everything. What if… what if the MRI shows somethin' bad? What if it is a herniated disc or somethin'? I get worried easy, you know. And I don’t wanna bother my daughter while she's on her trip. She gets stressed out enough as it is.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Rover. It's perfectly normal to feel worried when facing uncertainty. If the MRI shows something more serious, like a herniated disc or spinal stenosis, we’ll discuss all your options thoroughly. We’ll look at things like the severity of the condition, your symptoms, and your overall health. Options could include physical therapy, pain management, injections, or, in rare cases, surgery. I will explain everything in detail and answer all your questions. And I’ll make sure you feel comfortable with the treatment plan. You won’t be alone in this. I’ll also be happy to contact your daughter if you’d like, even just to let her know the results of the tests. But if you’d prefer to handle it yourself, that’s perfectly fine too. Let's focus on getting the tests done first, and then we can address any concerns once we have the results. In the meantime, try to rest, avoid heavy lifting, and let me know if your symptoms worsen. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No... I think that's everything. You explained it all real good, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen to my worries. I'll try to rest and not lift nothin' heavy. And I'll get those tests done as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Rover. I’m glad I could help. Remember, I’m here for you, so don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
