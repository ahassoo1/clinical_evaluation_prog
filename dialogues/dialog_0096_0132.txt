DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby, welcome. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Heat intolerance, you say? Honestly, it's about time someone looked into this. I’ve been dealing with it for… well, a long time now. It’s just getting worse, and it's not like I can just stop working, you know? I'm a painter, mostly, construction work when I can get it. Can't exactly do that indoors all day. It’s ridiculous, really. I just feel… overheated all the time, even when it’s not that hot.
DOCTOR: Right. "A long time," you say. And it's impacting your work. Well, that's certainly… inconvenient. Construction work is strenuous. And you say you feel overheated even when it’s not particularly warm?
PATIENT: Inconvenient? It's more than inconvenient, Doctor. It's affecting my livelihood! I’m a hard worker, always have been. And yes, overheated. Like, everyone else is fine, maybe a little warm, and I’m sweating buckets, feel dizzy, just… awful. Even in the shade. It’s embarrassing, frankly. People look at me like I’m weak. I'm not weak. I built houses, for goodness sake!
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, no need to get defensive, Mr. Coby. I understand it's frustrating. "Sweating buckets, dizzy," you say. And it happens even in the shade. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the overheating and dizziness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Well, I get a bit of a headache sometimes, right behind my eyes. And my legs… they feel heavy, like I've been walking uphill all day. Not always, but when I’m really hot. And I've been… thirsty. Really, really thirsty. Like I can’t drink enough water, even then it doesn't help much. Is that important? It seems silly.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Coby, that’s not silly at all. Headache, heavy legs, and excessive thirst – those are all pertinent details. And they all point to… well, a number of things. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, frequency, anything like that?
PATIENT: Urine? Doctor, really? You want to talk about my… urine? Look, I'm a practical man. I deal with paint, concrete, wood. I don’t spend my days analyzing my… waste products. It looks like urine, mostly. Maybe a bit darker when I’m really hot and thirsty, I suppose. Honestly, I haven't paid much attention. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, with all due respect, assessing changes in urine is a basic part of medical evaluation. It can tell us a lot about hydration and kidney function. But alright, we can move on from that for now. Let’s talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, anything at all?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Well, I take a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor gave it to me a few years back. Lisinopril, I think it's called. Small dose. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind. Otherwise, no. I try to avoid all that stuff if I can. Natural remedies are better, if you ask me. Though they aren't helping with this heat problem, obviously.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril and ibuprofen. Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I've always been a pretty sturdy fellow. Maybe a little sniffly when the pollen is bad in the spring, but that's all. Nothing serious. I eat everything, mostly. Though I try to stay away from those fancy processed foods, if you want my opinion. They're just… not good for you. But allergies? No. Never had a problem with allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let's talk about your family history. Has anyone in your family had problems with heat sensitivity, kidney issues, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Family history… well, my father, he had high blood pressure too, towards the end. And my mother… she always complained about being cold, which seems the opposite of my problem, doesn’t it? And my brother, he had some trouble with his kidneys when he was younger, I think. Not serious, though. He recovered. It’s a big family, you know? Hard to keep track of everything. Mostly healthy people, if you ask me. Rugged Nepalese stock.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your overall condition. It's probably nothing serious, but we need to rule out a few things. If you don't mind.
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. Though I doubt you’ll find anything. I told you, I'm a sturdy fellow. But I suppose I should cooperate. Just… don't take too long, alright? I have work to get back to. And frankly, I'd rather not be poked and prodded all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you'll just have a seat here. I'll start with your blood pressure. Hmm. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 148 over 92. Not drastically, but something to be aware of given your father’s history. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Capillary refill is a little slow, about three seconds. Skin is warm and dry, with normal turgor. No rash or discoloration. Alright. Everything seems… within normal limits, frankly. Though the slightly slow capillary refill and elevated blood pressure are things we need to investigate further. I think we should order some blood work to get a better picture. Complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function tests, and a basic metabolic panel. That should give us a clearer understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work? Honestly, Doctor, it seems a bit excessive, doesn’t it? I’m telling you, I’m fine. Just a little overheated. But alright, if you insist. I suppose it can’t hurt. But I’m warning you, if it’s just a waste of time and money, I'm going to say so. And where do I even go to get this blood work done?
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand your frustration, but due diligence is necessary. It’s not a waste of time if it rules things out. And it's standard procedure, frankly. There's a lab just down the street at 14 Elm Avenue. Take this requisition form with you, and they'll take care of it. It's covered by Medicare, so there shouldn't be any issues. The results should be back in a couple of days. And I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss them. How does Tuesday afternoon sound?
PATIENT: Tuesday afternoon… alright, fine. But if this doesn’t lead to anything, I’m not coming back. I have work to do, Doctor, and I don’t have time for… unnecessary tests. 14 Elm Avenue, you say? And Medicare covers it? Good. I’ll go get this blood work done, then. But I'm telling you, I feel perfectly fine. Just a bit warm.
DOCTOR: Alright. Very well. The lab will contact you when the results are available. And I’ll see you on Tuesday. Here’s a copy of the instructions, just in case you forget anything. Drink plenty of fluids, avoid strenuous activity in the heat, and if you experience any worsening symptoms – dizziness, confusion, severe headache – go to the emergency room immediately. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
