DOCTOR: Good morning, Deloris. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, well, it's about this letter... for a pet. Honestly, the whole thing is a bit ridiculous, if you ask me. People and their animals these days. I need a letter saying I can have one, I think? Something about...rules? I don't really follow all that. My daughter said I need it, though, so here I am. It's for a… a little dog. A fluffy one.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your daughter has advised you to obtain a letter verifying the necessity of having a companion animal, specifically a dog, due to some rules or regulations she’s aware of?
PATIENT: Regulations… yes, that sounds right. Honestly, the whole thing is a lot. She's very particular, my daughter. Always has been. It’s… for her apartment, I think? The landlord, maybe? She just said I need a letter from a doctor saying it would be good for my… well, for my general wellbeing to have a dog. Something about loneliness, I think she mentioned. Honestly, I don't really need a dog, but she's paying for everything, so… here I am, jumping through hoops. It's a small dog, though. Very small. Wouldn't cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your daughter believes a companion animal would be beneficial for your emotional wellbeing, and the landlord requires documentation from a healthcare professional. Just to clarify, are you experiencing any feelings of loneliness or social isolation that led your daughter to suggest this?
PATIENT: Oh, loneliness… well, I wouldn't say I'm lonely. I mean, my husband… well, we're divorced. Been divorced for a few years now. And the children are grown, you know? They have their own lives. It's… quiet sometimes. But I manage. I have my soaps, and I see my friends occasionally. It's not like I'm sitting around crying all day, if that's what you're asking. She just… she worries. Always has. And a fluffy little dog is rather nice, I suppose. I just don’t understand why it needs a doctor’s note!
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like while you're managing, the change in your living situation and family dynamics has led to a quieter lifestyle, and your daughter is proactively ensuring you have companionship and support. To properly address her concerns and fulfill the request for documentation, I'd like to ask a few questions, if you don't mind. This will help me to write a letter that accurately reflects your situation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn't take all day. I have my hair appointment later, you know. And I really need to be on time. Ask away, Doctor. But I'm warning you, I don't remember things very well these days. So, if I repeat myself, please don't get annoyed.
DOCTOR: Of course not, please don't worry at all. We'll take our time, and I'm happy to repeat questions if needed. Let's start with your overall mood. On a typical day, how would you describe how you're feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, my mood… well, it's usually… fine. Just fine. Not particularly happy, not particularly sad. Just… neutral, I suppose. I mean, there are days when I feel a bit… down, of course. When I think about… things. But mostly fine. I get through the day, you know? I watch my shows, I keep the house tidy, I talk to my friends. It's not like I'm in distress or anything. Just… regular. Is that a good enough answer? I really don’t like being asked about my feelings. It’s…personal, isn't it?
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly good answer, and I apologize if I'm asking personal questions. I understand it can be uncomfortable. It sounds like you’ve developed a routine that helps you manage day-to-day life. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep… well, it comes and goes. Sometimes I sleep like a log, other times I'm up half the night. It's been like that for ages, to be honest. And appetite… I eat when I'm hungry, I suppose. I don't really have much of a sweet tooth, and I try to eat healthy. Nothing fancy, just… normal food. I wouldn’t say anything has changed drastically, no. I have my routines, you know? I like my routines. It's the uncertainty I don't like. All these questions… is this getting us anywhere? I’m starting to feel a bit flustered now. And I really do need to be on time for my hair appointment. They get very annoyed if you’re late.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to speak up, and I apologize if this is becoming stressful. We are getting somewhere, and I want to be respectful of your time. It sounds like your sleep and appetite are relatively stable, despite occasional fluctuations. Just one more quick question, if you don't mind. Have you been feeling more withdrawn from social activities or hobbies that you usually enjoy?
PATIENT: Withdrawn… hmmm. Well, I used to go to that book club, you know? But it got a bit… gossipy. And frankly, the books weren’t very good. And the bridge group… well, Mabel started cheating, I swear. So, I stopped going. And I used to volunteer at the library, but then they changed the hours, and it just didn’t fit anymore. It’s not that I’m withdrawing, exactly. It’s just… things changed. And I’ve found other things to do. Like my soaps. And tidying the house. I like a tidy house. Is that good enough? Honestly, this whole thing is ridiculous. A doctor’s note for a fluffy little dog? It's just…preposterous. .
DOCTOR: Yes, that is perfectly good enough. It sounds like you've adapted to changes in your routine and found ways to maintain a comfortable lifestyle. Given our conversation, I can write a letter stating that having a companion animal may provide emotional support and contribute to your overall wellbeing. I wouldn’t necessarily characterize it as a medical necessity, but rather a positive addition to your life. Would that be acceptable to you?
