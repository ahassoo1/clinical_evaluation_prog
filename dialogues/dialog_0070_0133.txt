DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I just need some papers signed, really. Some health forms... for a thing. I don't really understand all the details, to be honest. I just need a notary to say they're real, I guess. Is that something you can do here?
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re referring to completing medical forms, perhaps for a program or assistance application. Yes, I can certainly verify and sign those for you, as long as they don't require a full medical examination or my professional medical opinion on your health status. Before I proceed, however, I do want to make sure I have a basic understanding of your current health. It’s standard practice, even for simple form completions. Would you mind if I ask a few quick questions about how you’ve been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds fair. Just a few quick ones is good, though. I don’t have a lot of time, you see. I have a bingo game this afternoon. What kind of questions are we talking about?
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. We’ll keep it brief. Just a few questions about any recent illnesses, any pain you might be experiencing, and a general check-in on how you're feeling overall. Nothing too detailed. Let's start with this: have you been feeling unwell recently – a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a little sniffle a few weeks back, but it didn’t last. Nothing serious. Just the usual old lady stuff, you know? A little achy sometimes, but that's just getting old. I mostly feel alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And are you experiencing any pain currently?
PATIENT: Well, my knees bother me sometimes, especially when it’s cold. And my back… oh, don’t even get me started on my back! It’s just old age, I tell you. I try not to complain too much. It comes and goes, you know? Is this important for the papers? I just need them signed, really.
DOCTOR: It's helpful for me to have a complete picture, even for simple form completions, Melvenia. It allows me to ensure the information is accurate and that there are no underlying issues I should be aware of. Regarding your knees and back, can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Well, the knees… it’s more of a dull ache, mostly when I walk a lot. Or when the weather changes. And the back… it’s more of a sharp pain, comes and goes. Sometimes it shoots down my leg. I don’t know what it is. Probably just arthritis, the doctor before said something about that, but I don’t remember exactly. I mostly just take some over-the-counter pain relievers. Is that important for the papers?
DOCTOR: That is helpful information, Melvenia. The pain radiating down your leg is something we should note. And it's good to know you've been using over-the-counter pain relievers. Just to clarify, are you currently taking any other medications, prescription or over-the-counter, besides the pain relievers?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Just the pain relievers when I need them. Oh! Wait. I take a little something for my blood pressure, sometimes. But it’s not very often. The nurse just gives it to me when she checks it at the bingo hall. I don't even remember what it's called. It's a little white pill. Does that help? I really don’t keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little white pill for your blood pressure. That's important to know. Do you know approximately how often the nurse gives you this medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not very often, I don't think. Maybe once a month? Or when my pressure is high, which doesn't happen all the time. Honestly, Doctor, I just let her handle it. She’s a nice nurse. I don't bother asking too many questions. I just want to play bingo! Look, can we just get these papers signed? I’m really starting to worry about being late.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about being late for bingo, Melvenia, and I certainly don't want to keep you. However, it's important for me to understand your medical history to ensure these forms are accurate and don't create any issues for you. Since you are receiving medication for your blood pressure, even infrequently, it's important we document it correctly. Before I sign the forms, would you mind if I quickly check your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Really? Do you have to? It's just a little check-up, right? Won't take long? It’s just that bingo starts soon, and I always get a good seat… I don’t want to lose it. But alright, I guess. If it’s important. But make it quick, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, it will be very quick. Just a standard check to get a baseline reading. It's always best to be thorough, even with a simple form completion. Just relax your arm, Melvenia. Deep breaths.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just hurry, please. I'm not good with doctors, you know. All these things make me nervous. And my bingo card is waiting!
DOCTOR: Alright, Melvenia, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, reading 160 over 95. It’s good that we checked it. Now, I can sign these forms for you, but given your elevated blood pressure and infrequent medication management, I strongly recommend you follow up with a primary care physician for a more comprehensive evaluation. We need to ensure your blood pressure is controlled to prevent any potential health complications. I can provide you with a list of local doctors who accept uninsured patients, if you’d like. Would you like me to proceed with signing the forms now, knowing this recommendation?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Elevated? That doesn't sound good. I... I don't know. I haven't been to a real doctor in ages. I just go to the bingo hall nurse. A list of doctors? That sounds... complicated. But alright, I guess. If it's really important. Can you just sign the papers first, please? I need them for the thing, and I really don’t want to miss out. And then maybe we can talk about the doctors later?
DOCTOR: Alright, Melvenia. I can certainly sign these forms for you. However, I want to reiterate my strong recommendation for a follow-up with a primary care physician. Your health is important, and managing your blood pressure is crucial. Here you are. Now, regarding that list of doctors… I have some pamphlets here with local resources, including clinics that offer financial assistance. I can also help you schedule an appointment if you’d like. It’s okay if you’re not ready now, but please consider it. Do you have any questions about the forms themselves before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. No, I don’t think I have any questions about the papers. I just needed them signed. I really appreciate you signing them so quickly. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have a bingo game to get to. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Melvenia. I'm glad I could help. Please, take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to prioritize your health. If you change your mind about seeing a doctor, or have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to help. Have a wonderful time at bingo! .
