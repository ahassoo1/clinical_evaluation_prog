DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. Have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Batara. It is… well, it is a little embarrassing to speak about. But, I have… much gas. More than usual, you understand? It happens all the time, now. It started, I think, maybe two weeks ago?
DOCTOR: Gas. Excessive gas, you say. Two weeks. Hmm. And is this… consistently throughout the day?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Pretty much all day. It does not matter if I have just eaten, or… a long time ago. Sometimes it wakes me up at night, even. It is… disruptive, to say the least. I have tried some things, but nothing helps much.
DOCTOR: Right. Disruptive. And what “things” have you tried, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: Well, my neighbor, Mrs. Gable, she suggested peppermint tea. I drink a lot of peppermint tea, now. And… I stopped drinking the fizzy drinks. The orange soda. But the gas… it still happens. I also tried… not eating beans. I like beans, very much. But I stopped. For two weeks. Nothing changed.
DOCTOR: Peppermint tea, no fizzy drinks, no beans… interesting. And what about what you are eating, generally?
PATIENT: Mostly… simple things, Doctor. Bread, sometimes with cheese. Soup, if it is cold. Chicken, when I can. I do not eat a lot, you understand. I am not a big eater. Mostly things from the… the grocery store. Not fancy things. I make my own food, mostly.
DOCTOR: And when you say “soup,” what kind of soup?
PATIENT: Oh. Uh… sometimes tomato soup. Sometimes chicken noodle. Sometimes… vegetable soup? From the can, Doctor. It is easy. I put bread in it, sometimes. It is a quick lunch. I do not cook very much, you understand. Just simple things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And… do you experience any bloating?
PATIENT: Bloating… yes, Doctor. Sometimes. My stomach… it feels full, even when I have not eaten much. And hard. Like… a balloon, maybe? It is uncomfortable. Especially after lunch. But not always. Just sometimes. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Do you have any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes… you mean…? Well, yes, Doctor. A little. I… go to the bathroom more often, now. And… sometimes it is hard to… push it out. Other times it is… loose. It is not regular, you understand? It changes all the time. Very confusing.
DOCTOR: "Confusing." Right. And, Mr. Goodstein, are you experiencing any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really pain. Uncomfortable, yes. Like… pressure. Like the balloon is too full. But not pain, exactly. It just… feels bad. And the gas… it smells very strong, sometimes. That is embarrassing. I have to open the window. Even in the winter.
DOCTOR: Alright. We're getting somewhere. Now, have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I have not weighed myself, but… my clothes still fit. I have always been… small. But I have not lost weight. I eat enough, you understand? Maybe not a lot, but enough. I do not go hungry.
DOCTOR: And what about… any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood…? Oh! No, Doctor. No! I… I have not seen any blood. Absolutely not. That would be… very bad, yes? No blood. I am very sure. I would… I would notice. Definitely not. No blood.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a listen to your abdomen, then. If you’ll just lie down on the table for me. And, honestly, Mr. Goodstein, your concerns are valid, but frankly, I suspect this is likely a matter of diet and perhaps some mild digestive upset. But we'll rule out anything more serious, just to be safe.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is… very good to hear. I am glad you are checking. I will… I will lie down now. Thank you for listening to me. It is a… a relief to speak about it. I hope it is just something simple.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness here, on the left side. And… some mild distention. Okay, Mr. Goodstein, I’m just going to listen to your bowel sounds now. Active, but… somewhat hyperactive.
PATIENT: Ouch. Yes, that is… uncomfortable. A little bit painful, there. But only a little. I am… nervous, you understand? It makes my stomach feel… tight. Is that normal? Are the sounds… bad? I do not understand what “hyperactive” means.
DOCTOR: “Hyperactive” means your bowels are moving… quickly. Too quickly, perhaps. Alright, let’s run a simple blood test. CBC, CMP, and a stool sample to rule out any infection or… issues. I’ll also order a colonoscopy to get a closer look. While I don’t suspect anything serious, it’s best to be thorough, given your concerns and these findings.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy…? Oh! That sounds… very serious, Doctor! Is something very wrong? I thought you said it was probably just diet! A colonoscopy sounds… painful. And… what if you find something bad? I am very scared now. Is there… is there another way to check? Perhaps more tea? I can try more peppermint tea! .
DOCTOR: Mr. Goodstein, please. Peppermint tea is not going to address a potentially serious underlying issue. A colonoscopy is a standard preventative procedure. It allows us to visualize the colon and detect any abnormalities early on. We'll prep you properly, and it is not as painful as you imagine. It’s far better to be proactive than reactive. And honestly, your insistence on self-treating with tea while ignoring these findings is… frankly, irresponsible. We need to rule out anything serious. I'm ordering the tests. That’s final. .
