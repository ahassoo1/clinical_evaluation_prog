DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm Dr. Deschane. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Stoffregen, yes, that's me. Hmm… what did bring me in? My… my water, it’s hard to… go. Yes. Hard to push it all out. It's been… a little bit now. Not a big problem, but… annoying. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. So you're experiencing difficulty with urination – specifically, difficulty emptying your bladder completely?
PATIENT: Emptying… yes, that sounds right. Like it doesn't all come out. And I have to… push, a little. Not painful, just… effort. It's funny, I don't remember it being this way before. Or maybe I just don't remember things very well anymore. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s not uncommon to experience changes in urinary function as we age, Ms. Stoffregen. And memory can certainly fluctuate. But let’s focus on the urinary issue first. You said this has been happening for “a little bit now” – could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh dear… specific. That’s… hard. Maybe a month? Or two? It all feels like yesterday, and also… a long time ago. My husband, he might know better. He notices things. I mostly just feel… uncomfortable. It wakes me up sometimes at night, too. I have to go, then it's hard to… you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, approximately a month or two of difficulty emptying your bladder, requiring effort to urinate, and this is occasionally disrupting your sleep. Do you feel like you are able to start the stream of urine easily, or is that difficult as well?
PATIENT: Hmm… starting is okay, I think. It’s not like I can’t go, it just… doesn't feel like it all comes out. Like there's still some left in there. And then I have to wait a bit before trying again. It's a little silly, really. I don't want to bother you with old lady problems.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stoffregen, these are not "silly" problems. These are valid concerns that impact your quality of life, and that’s what I’m here for. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the color? Or smell? Oh, goodness. I don't really pay attention to those things. It looks like… pee. I mean, it's yellow, usually. Sometimes lighter, sometimes darker, depending on how much water I drink, I guess. My daughter always tells me to drink more water. I try. But… no, I haven't noticed anything different different. No blood, no burning, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. No blood, no burning sensation, color is generally normal, varying with hydration. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever… no. I don’t think so. I haven't felt hot. And chills… no. We keep the house pretty warm. And my tummy… no pain. Just… that uncomfortable feeling. Like something's still there, you know? It’s not sharp, or bad, just… present. I hope that makes sense. I’m not very good at explaining things. My husband would be better at this. He remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain, just a sensation of incomplete bladder emptying. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical… hmm. I used to have… something with my heart, I think. A long time ago. But the doctor fixed it. Or… it got better on its own. And… arthritis, I suppose. My hands ache sometimes, but not too bad. And I take a little pill for my blood pressure. That’s all I can remember, really. Old age, you know? It steals things from you. I used to be so sharp. What was I saying?
DOCTOR: You mentioned a prior heart condition, now resolved, arthritis, and medication for blood pressure. Do you know the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a good question. I just take the little white pill every morning. My husband gets it for me, from the drugstore. I don’t… I don’t really pay attention to the names. It's a small white pill... that's all I know. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. I used to be so organized! Now… it's all a blur. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know, Ms. Stoffregen, but not critical at this moment. We can likely obtain the information from your pharmacy records. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the heart issue you mentioned?
PATIENT: Hmm... surgeries... let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. A very long time ago! And... I think I had a hysterectomy. Yes, that's it. A long time ago, too. Maybe forty, fifty years ago? I don't remember much about it. Just… a long hospital stay. And… I think that's it. Maybe? I sometimes forget. My memory is just… patchy. Is my husband allowed to talk to you? He remembers everything.
DOCTOR: A tonsillectomy and a hysterectomy. Alright. We can certainly speak with your husband if you would like, but it’s important for me to get as much information as possible directly from you, as well. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… vitamins! Yes. I take a multivitamin every day. The one for seniors, with extra Vitamin D. And sometimes I take something for my joints, when they're really aching. It's… a brown pill. I think. It smells a little funny. And… that’s it, I think. My daughter brings them over when she visits. She's very good at looking after me. I hope I haven't forgotten anything. This is a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Alright. Multivitamin with extra Vitamin D and a brown pill for your joints. We’re making progress. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had any bad reactions to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I eat shellfish, but nothing serious. My husband eats shellfish all the time, and he's fine. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, really. Just getting old, I suppose. Everything aches and itches sometimes. Is that an allergy?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, before we proceed to a physical examination, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness. No, no, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother always said it was a terrible habit. And I don't drink alcohol either. Not since… well, not for a very long time. And… recreational drugs? Goodness no. I’m a church lady, Doctor! I volunteer with the choir and bake cookies for the bake sale. No, I don't do any of those things.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Now, Ms. Stoffregen, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a neurological exam to assess your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just… be gentle, my bones are a little brittle, you know? And… it might take me a moment to understand what you’re asking me to do sometimes. My brain doesn't work as fast as it used to. But I’ll try my best. Are you going to poke me with needles? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles at this time, Ms. Stoffregen. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the examination table, and I’ll begin. Just relax, and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Oh dear, this is harder than it looks! There. Is that alright? My back isn't as flexible as it used to be. Just let me know if I need to adjust. And… where is the little paper sheet they give you? I always forget to ask for that. It feels strange lying here without it.
DOCTOR: There you go. That's better. Now, just relax. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart rate is a little fast, but it sounds regular. I'm hearing some mild crackling in your lungs, which could be due to a number of things. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some slight tenderness in the lower quadrant.
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a little uncomfortable. Not pain, exactly, just… a little tender there. Like a dull ache. I get that sometimes. Maybe it's from… eating too much? Or maybe it’s just my age. Everything aches, you know? Is something wrong, Doctor? You look… concerned.
DOCTOR: It's too early to say anything definitive, Ms. Stoffregen. The tenderness is mild, but it's something we need to investigate further. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, but they are present. Now, can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that strong enough? My hands aren't as strong as they used to be. Arthritis, you know. It makes everything difficult. Is something seriously wrong, Doctor? You’re being very quiet. Am I sick? My husband will be worried.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stoffregen, I’m not going to alarm you. Your examination findings are consistent with your age, but some of your symptoms – the difficulty with urination, the mild tenderness in your abdomen, and the diminished reflexes – warrant further investigation. I'd like to order a urine analysis to rule out any infection, and a complete blood count to assess your overall health. Additionally, given your urinary symptoms, I would like to refer you to a urologist for a more specialized evaluation.
PATIENT: A urologist? What’s a urologist? Is that… a bad doctor? And a blood test? I hate needles! And… infection? Oh dear, I knew it. I am sick. My husband is going to be so worried. What’s wrong with me, Doctor? Just tell me straight. Is it serious? Is it… cancer?
DOCTOR: Ms. Stoffregen, please try to remain calm. A urologist is a doctor who specializes in the urinary system – bladder, kidneys, etc. It doesn’t mean there’s anything seriously wrong, it just means we want to get a more thorough evaluation of your urinary symptoms. A blood test will give us a more detailed picture of your overall health. And no, it does not mean you have cancer. We need to rule out common causes first, like infection. I am ordering these tests as a precaution, to ensure we get you the right diagnosis and treatment. It’s better to be safe than sorry. I understand your concerns, and I will explain everything every step of the way. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A little… yes. But it’s all so much to take in. And needles… I really hate needles. My husband… he’ll be so upset. He worries about everything. Will it hurt? Will it take long? And what if… what if it is something bad? Can we… can we call him? I just… I need to talk to him. He always knows what to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. We can certainly call your husband. It’s perfectly alright to have him join us. As for the blood test, it will be a small sample and shouldn’t hurt much – just a quick pinch. The entire process will only take a few minutes. And I understand your concerns about a serious diagnosis, but please try not to jump to conclusions. We are taking all the necessary steps to determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure you receive the best possible care. Let me get a nurse to assist you with calling your husband. Would you like me to step out for a moment while you speak with him?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be lovely. And… thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. Just… give me a moment to compose myself. He always calms me down.
