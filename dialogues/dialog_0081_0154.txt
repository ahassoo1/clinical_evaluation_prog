DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I am Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor Paulino. It’s… well, it’s my waterworks again, I suppose. They’ve been giving me trouble. Not constant trouble, you understand, but… frequent. And uncomfortable. It’s been happening on and off for… a while now. I don't really keep track of dates, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Frequent and uncomfortable… alright. “On and off” can mean a lot of things. Can you describe what "uncomfortable" feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s… a burning. A stinging, really. When I go to the bathroom. And sometimes… sometimes it feels like I have to go, even when I haven’t had much to drink. It’s just… irritating. Is that… good enough? I'm not very good at explaining these things. It’s not painful, exactly, just… a nuisance. A big nuisance.
DOCTOR: A stinging, burning sensation with urination, and a sense of urgency… even with minimal fluid intake. Alright. And how often would you say this “frequent” urination is occurring?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Frequent… Let me think. It’s… hard to say. Maybe… three or four times a night? And then… well, quite a bit during the day, too. More than usual, certainly. I used to be able to go hours without needing to go, you know? Now… now it’s every couple of hours, at least. I haven’t been keeping a list, if that's what you’re asking. I just know it’s… more than I like. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: More than you like is… noted. Three to four times at night is… significant. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any changes in the color or smell?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. No blood. Not that I’ve seen. And the… the smell is probably normal. I haven't been paying close attention, to be honest. I just know it feels wrong, you understand? Not… not a bad smell, just… different, maybe? But I couldn't tell you how. I’m not really one for noticing things like smells.
DOCTOR: Alright. No blood, potentially a slight change in odor but you haven't specifically noticed anything. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Oh, no fever, no chills. Definitely no fever. And my back… well, I get aches sometimes. Being my age, you know? But no pain pain. Just the usual old lady aches. Nothing that would make me think it’s connected to… to the waterworks. I'm pretty sure. It’s just… getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh! Well… no, Doctor. Not anymore. My husband… he passed some years ago. And… well, I haven't been with anyone since. That’s… a very personal question, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Of course. Just routine, Ms. Wease. It’s important to gather all the necessary information. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure once, years ago, but the doctor put me on a pill, and that seemed to fix it. I don't take it anymore, though. And… no, I don’t think I have diabetes. Never been told I do. I don't really go to the doctor much, to be honest. Only when something really bothers me. I'm not sure about kidney problems… I don’t even know what that feels like.
DOCTOR: Alright. Previously treated hypertension, but not currently on medication. No known diabetes. And no history of kidney problems. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. That’s… I think that’s it. And… I was in the hospital when I broke my wrist, but that was a long time ago. Just a simple break, nothing serious. Nothing… complicated. I’m trying to remember if there was anything else… but my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Cholecystectomy, fractured wrist. Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no allergies, Doctor. None that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. And I haven't had a bad reaction to any medication, as far as I recall. I’m not one for taking a lot of pills, you see. Just the blood pressure pill for a while, but that was ages ago. I mostly just drink tea, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Nothing. I told you, I don't take pills. Just tea. Occasionally I’ll take a little something for a headache, but it’s just… aspirin, I think? Or maybe ibuprofen. I forget. It’s not regular, just when I really need it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications. Now, let’s talk a bit about your family. Do you have a history of kidney disease, bladder problems, or any other medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. My mother… she had trouble with her heart, I think? And my brother… he had high blood pressure, like I did. But I don’t recall anyone having trouble with their… waterworks. Or kidneys. We weren't really ones for talking about these things, you see? It was… a different time.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. Now, before we move on, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don’t drink, Doctor. Never have. And… well, I certainly don't do that. I'm a respectable woman! Just tea, as I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. Now, Ms. Wease, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your abdomen and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That’s… that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just get it over with, if you don't mind. I haven't got all day, you know?
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table, and I'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. I'm detecting some tenderness in your lower abdomen, specifically over your bladder area. No masses are palpable. Let's take a look at a urine sample to get a better idea of what's going on. I'll have the nurse bring a collection cup.
PATIENT: Oh. Tender, you say? That… doesn’t surprise me, I suppose. It feels irritated down there. All the time. Just get it over with, Doctor. I don't like being poked and prodded. The sooner we know what's wrong, the better. I've got errands to run, you know.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be right back. While we wait, I’d like to ask one final question. Have you experienced any fever, nausea, vomiting, or back pain in the last few days?
PATIENT: Oh, no fever, no nausea, and definitely no vomiting. And I told you, just the usual old aches, no real back pain. Nothing that would make me think it’s connected to… well, to anything serious. I just want to feel normal again, Doctor. That’s all. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Wease, that’s not too much to ask at all. We’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Here’s the cup. Please collect a sample for me when you’re able. We’ll send it off to the lab, and I’ll have the results back to you as soon as possible. In the meantime, based on your symptoms and what I’ve found during the exam, I suspect a possible urinary tract infection. However, we need the lab results to confirm this. I'm going to prescribe you a short course of antibiotics, just in case. It's better to be safe than sorry.
PATIENT: Oh. Antibiotics, you say? Is it… serious? I don't like taking pills, Doctor, you know. I just want this to go away. And quickly. Is it… contagious? Will I need to stay home? I’ve got a bridge club meeting on Friday.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious at this point, Ms. Wease, but a UTI can become more problematic if left untreated. That’s why I'm prescribing the antibiotics. As for contagion, no, a UTI isn’t contagious. You can certainly continue with your bridge club meeting. It’s simply a matter of getting the infection cleared up. I'm going to prescribe you nitrofurantoin 100mg twice a day for five days. Complete the full course, even if you start feeling better before it's finished. Here's the prescription. And I'd like you to drink plenty of fluids—water is best—and try to urinate frequently to flush out your system. Also, if your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, chills, or back pain, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Five days… alright. Plenty of fluids, you say? I can do that. Water… and not to stop taking them if I feel better. I'll remember that. No, I don't think I have any more questions. Just… get rid of it, Doctor. That’s all I want. Thank you. I suppose I’ll be going then?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Wease. We’ll follow up once we get the lab results. If you have any concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call. Get well soon. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Oh. Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. I really will.
