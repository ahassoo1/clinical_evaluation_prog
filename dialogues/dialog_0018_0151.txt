DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s nice to meet you as well. It’s this tingling. It’s in my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for… oh, I don’t know, a few weeks now, maybe a month? It’s not painful, exactly, just… annoying. Like pins and needles, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Tingling, like pins and needles… a few weeks to a month, you said. That certainly sounds bothersome. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well… it comes and goes. Sometimes it's just in my fingertips, other times it’s all the way up to my wrists. And my toes… same thing. It’s worse at night, I think. Or maybe I just notice it more then, when I’m trying to sleep. I’m a mail carrier, you see. Been doing it for… well, a long time. Lots of walking. Could it be that?
DOCTOR: I see. So, it comes and goes, affecting both your hands and feet, and is perhaps more noticeable at night. And you're a mail carrier – that is good information to have, thank you. Repetitive motions and being on your feet for long periods can certainly contribute to these types of sensations. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the tingling itself?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… hard to explain. It’s not like a sharp pain, like if you hit your funny bone. It’s more… buzzy. And sometimes… numb. Like my fingers aren’t really there, you know? Not completely, just… less sensitive. It’s hard to hold things sometimes, like letters. I’ve dropped a few. I didn’t want to mention it, but… it’s getting a little worrying.
DOCTOR: "Buzzy" and sometimes numb… and difficulty holding things, dropping letters… Yes, that gives me a better idea. It is good you mentioned the difficulty with holding things; that's important. Now, Ms. Uzarski, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. This will help me rule out other potential causes. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, thyroid problems, or kidney disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, not that I know of. The doctor back home, he used to check everything, but I haven’t been to a doctor regularly since… well, since my husband passed. He took care of all that. I just… haven't really had any problems, until this tingling started. No diabetes, no thyroid… nothing. I don't think so, anyway. I’m not very good with remembering those things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Uzarski. It's understandable to not recall everything offhand, and we can certainly review your records if you've seen other physicians in the past. And thank you for sharing that. Have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, never. I've been lucky that way. Just a few broken bones when I was a little girl, running around being silly. But nothing major, nothing that would… you know, need a hospital. Honestly, I’ve always been a pretty healthy person. This tingling is… unsettling. I just want to know what it is and how to make it stop.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's certainly unsettling when something new arises, especially when it impacts your daily activities. No surgeries or hospitalizations—that's good to know. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Do any of your close relatives—parents, siblings, children—have any conditions like diabetes, nerve problems, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a hard one. My mother… she had arthritis, badly. Her hands were all gnarled. And my brother, he had something with his feet, always complaining of numbness… but I don’t know what it was. He never really talked about it. No one else that I can recall. My father was healthy as a horse, and my sister… well, I haven’t seen her in years. It’s not a family that talks much about their health, if you know what I mean. Mostly just keep things to themselves.
DOCTOR: That’s quite common, Ms. Uzarski. It’s often difficult to gather detailed family history, especially when relatives aren't forthcoming with information. Arthritis in your mother and your brother’s foot issues—that's helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh no, never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he tried it once, didn't like it. And no, no alcohol either. Never had a taste for it. I drink plenty of water, though. And tea. Lots of tea. It helps with… everything. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Soups, vegetables, things like that. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Uzarski. Avoiding smoking and alcohol and staying hydrated are both very good for your overall health. Now, finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Like I said, I don't really have much need for them. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, just because it's cloudy, but that’s about it. I used to take something for my joints, but that was years ago, and it didn’t really help much anyway. I try to get by without taking too many pills, if you know what I mean. I prefer to let my body do its own work, as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Uzarski. That’s all the information I need for the initial history. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to further assess your condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on with my hands and feet. The sooner, the better, really. It’s just… unsettling, like something’s not right.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It’s understandable to be anxious when experiencing new symptoms. Let’s start with a neurological exam. I’ll be checking your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. First, could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: There you go, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything else. I'm a little nervous, I have to admit. This tingling… it worries me, you know? It feels like it’s getting worse, slowly but surely.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Uzarski. I'm checking your reflexes now. Just relax your arms. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Now, I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can.
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It feels a little… weak, maybe? I used to be able to squeeze much harder. Working with mail, you know, you have to have a good grip.
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. You're right; your grip strength is a little weaker than expected, bilaterally. Now, I’m going to test your sensation. I’m going to lightly touch different areas of your hands and feet with this cotton swab, and I’d like you to tell me when you feel it. Please say “yes” when you feel the touch. Can you feel this when I touch here?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I feel it. It’s a little… faint, though. Like a light tickle, hardly noticeable. Is that normal? It doesn't feel as strong as it should, does it?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not entirely unexpected to have some diminished sensation with your symptoms, Ms. Uzarski. We're gathering information to determine the cause. Your sensation is reduced in both hands and feet, more pronounced distally—meaning in your fingertips and toes. Now, I'm going to perform a brief Romberg test. Please stand with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Close your eyes and try to maintain your balance for 30 seconds. I will be here to steady you if needed.
PATIENT: Oh dear… I’m not very good at this. I feel like I'm going to fall. I'm a little dizzy, Doctor. Maybe I shouldn't have gotten out of bed this morning.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Uzarski. It's perfectly safe to open your eyes. And thank you for letting me know. That's helpful information. It seems your balance is slightly affected. Based on the neurological exam, we're seeing some reduced reflexes, decreased grip strength, diminished sensation, and a slight balance impairment in both hands and feet. Now, I'd like to discuss some possible causes and next steps. It’s difficult to say definitively what’s going on without further investigation, but based on your symptoms and the exam findings, several possibilities come to mind. These include peripheral neuropathy – damage to the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord – vitamin deficiencies, and less commonly, other medical conditions. It could also be related to your occupation as a mail carrier, with repetitive strain contributing to nerve compression. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, including B12 and D, and to rule out other underlying conditions. I'm also going to recommend an electromyography and nerve conduction study, which will help assess the function of the nerves in your hands and feet. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that sounds… complicated. Peripheral… what was that again? And an electro… something study? It sounds… painful. I just want to know what’s wrong, Doctor. I don’t want a lot of tests if it’s something simple. But if you think it’s necessary… I suppose I can do whatever you think is best. But please, explain everything to me in plain English. I don't understand all those medical terms. And… will the tests be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see. I’m a little worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Uzarski. I understand your concerns completely. Let me explain everything in plain English. "Peripheral neuropathy" simply means damage to the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. These nerves are responsible for sensation – feeling things like touch, temperature, and pain – and movement. The EMG and nerve conduction study is a non-invasive test – meaning we don’t need to make any incisions – that measures the electrical activity of your nerves and muscles. It can help pinpoint the location and severity of any nerve damage. It might feel like a mild shock, but it shouldn’t be painful. We will use a small electrode to stimulate the nerves and record the response. It takes about 30-60 minutes to complete. Regarding the cost, I understand that being uninsured can be a financial burden. Let me write down a few places that offer financial assistance programs for these tests. I can also speak with our billing department to see if they can offer a discount or payment plan. We do not want your financial situation to prevent you from getting the care you need. Here are a few resources that may be helpful. I’m also going to order a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar levels, which can also contribute to neuropathy. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s good. Thank you. Financial assistance… that would be a blessing. I just don’t want to get into a lot of debt over this. Will the tests tell me exactly what’s wrong? Will it tell me if it’s something serious? And… if it is neuropathy, can it be fixed? Or will I just have to live with this tingling forever? That’s what I’m really worried about. I like my job, you know. I don’t want to have to stop working.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ms. Uzarski. Let me address them as best as I can. The tests will help us narrow down the cause of your symptoms and determine the severity of any nerve damage. It won’t necessarily give us a definitive “yes” or “no” answer, but it will give us a much clearer picture. If the tests confirm neuropathy, the treatment will depend on the underlying cause. In some cases, it’s reversible – for example, if it’s caused by a vitamin deficiency, we can simply supplement those vitamins. In other cases, it may be more chronic, and the goal of treatment would be to manage the symptoms and prevent further nerve damage. We can discuss options like medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications. We will also work to address any contributing factors, such as repetitive strain. In many cases, people with neuropathy can continue to work, especially with appropriate accommodations and management. I want you to know that we will work together to find the best possible solution for you. We won't rush into anything, and we will discuss all of your options before making any decisions. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests scheduled. I’ll write you a referral for the EMG and nerve conduction study, and you can call to schedule an appointment at your convenience. Do you have a preferred lab or testing center?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have a preferred lab. Any place that’s… reasonable. And not too expensive, if that’s possible. I guess… I guess scheduling the tests is a good first step. It’s just… a lot to take in. I’m an old lady, you know. I don’t handle change very well. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. And for being so patient with me. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Uzarski. It’s my job to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes taking the time to explain things clearly and address your concerns. And please, don’t think of yourself as an "old lady"—you are a valued patient, and your health is important to me. Here is the referral. This lab is close to the clinic and has a good reputation. They also offer financial assistance programs, which you can inquire about when you schedule your appointment. Now, while you are waiting for the test results, it’s important to avoid activities that aggravate your symptoms. If you’re experiencing pain or discomfort, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. I also recommend keeping your feet warm and dry, and wearing comfortable shoes. I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the test results and develop a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that sounds alright. That gives me time to… prepare, I suppose. And try to avoid dropping any more letters. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing we have a plan. It’s still scary, but… a little less scary. I guess I’ll go call and schedule those tests. And try not to worry too much. Easier said than done, though.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Uzarski. Please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.
