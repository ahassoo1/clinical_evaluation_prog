DOCTOR: Hi Aldine, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. It’s this headache I’ve been havin’. Right at the back of my head, you know? Been botherin’ me for a little bit now. Not constant, but… it’s there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head. And you said “a little bit now” – can you tell me roughly how long you’ve been noticing this headache?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started… oh, maybe about three weeks ago? Around the time that big storm came through. Not right during the storm, but a few days after, I reckon. It comes and goes, doesn’t last all day, thankfully. Sometimes it's just a dull ache, other times it feels… tighter, if you understand what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. Three weeks, starting after the storm… that’s helpful. And you describe it as a dull ache sometimes, and tighter at other times. On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, what number would you give it when it’s at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I don’t like pain much, so everything feels worse than it is, maybe? When it’s really bad… I’d say a 6, maybe 7. It doesn’t stop me from doin’ things, mind you, but it’s definitely noticeable. It’s not like a throbbing headache, more like… pressure. A heavy pressure, right at the base of my skull.
DOCTOR: Okay, a 6 or 7 with a heavy pressure at the base of your skull. And no throbbing, that’s good to know. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… bein’ out in the sun seems to make it worse. I do a little gardenin’, you see, and if I’m out there too long, it’ll definitely flare up. And… a good lie-down usually helps. Just restin’ quiet. Not much else, really. I haven’t tried takin’ anything for it yet, just tryin’ to ignore it, but it’s gettin’ harder to, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I do. Sun exposure makes it worse, rest helps. Have you had any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No fever, no dizziness. My vision's been alright, I think. Now, I have been a little more tired than usual, but I put that down to my age, you know? I'm not as spry as I used to be! But… now that I'm thinkin' on it, I might be a bit more forgetful lately. Not serious forgetfulness, just… misplacin’ things more often. Like my glasses, or where I put the remote. Little things. My wife keeps tellin' me I'm losin' it! But I think she's just teasin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no dizziness, vision is okay, increased tiredness, and some mild forgetfulness. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. Now, have you had headaches like this before, or is this a new experience?
PATIENT: This is new, Doctor. I get the occasional headache, like anyone, but it's usually just a bit of tension, from workin' too long over the nails, you know? Nothing like this pressure at the back of my head. Never lasted this long either. Usually, a little rest and a cup of tea and I’m right as rain. This… this is different. It’s worryin’ me a little, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not as far as I know, Doctor. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, for my age. I go to the doctor for my yearly check-ups, but they always say I’m doin’ alright. They tell me to watch my salt intake, that’s about it. Never been told I have high blood pressure or diabetes, or anythin’ like that. I used to work really hard, standin’ on my feet all day, so I've always been active, I suppose. My wife does worry about me, though, always fussin' over my health. She's a good woman.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And no history of high blood pressure or diabetes is helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix taken out when I was a young man, a long time ago. Other than that, no, nothin’ major. I broke my arm once, fallin’ off a ladder while I was repairin' the roof, but that was years and years ago. No hospital stays for anything serious, thankfully. Mostly just the usual sniffles and coughs, you know? A good cup of ginger tea usually fixes me right up. My wife always says I’m too stubborn to go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal as a young man, broken arm, otherwise healthy. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothin’ at all. I don’t like takin’ pills if I can help it. Just a little liniment for my achin’ joints sometimes, but that’s it. I try to eat healthy, and get enough rest, and that’s usually enough to keep me goin’. I do drink a lot of water, my wife makes sure of that. She says it's good for my skin, keepin’ it young! I reckon she’s right. I don’t believe in loadin’ up on medications unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. I eat just about anything. My wife makes a lovely curry goat, sometimes a little spicy, but I can handle it! Never had any reactions to anything, not even insect bites. I'm pretty lucky, I tell you. I always say a good strong constitution is the best medicine. Although, I do get a bit of a sniffle when the pollen's high, but that’s just a seasonal thing, not an allergy, as far as I'm concerned. Just a bit of dust in the air, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's very helpful. So, no known allergies, no medications, no significant medical history, aside from the appendix removal and a broken arm. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Go right ahead. I trust your judgement. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I've always been a practical man, and if you think it's necessary, then I'm all for it. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? My wife will be askin' if you poked me too hard! She worries so.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… Okay, that's 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs… Take a nice, deep breath for me… Good. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'm going to check your pulse… Steady and regular. And finally, I’ll do a quick neurological exam. Could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can do that. There you go. Easy enough. My eyesight isn't what it used to be, but I can still follow a finger. My wife says I've got the eyes of a hawk when it comes to bargainin' for a good price, though! It's gettin' a bit harder to read small print, but everything else seems alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And now, I’m going to check your reflexes… Good reflexes. And finally, I'll check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: There you go, Doctor. I still got a good grip, even at my age. Used to work with my hands a lot, you see. Manicurist work, gotta have a strong grip to hold the files and buffers. My wife says I squeeze too hard sometimes when we're dancin', but I can't help it! Old habits, you know? It’s good to feel I still have some strength left.
DOCTOR: Okay, Aldine. Everything looks generally good. Your neurological exam is normal, your reflexes are intact, and your strength is good. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing a tension headache, possibly brought on by stress or muscle tension in your neck and shoulders. The sun exposure could be exacerbating it. However, given your age and the recent forgetfulness you’ve mentioned, I want to be thorough. I’d like to order a few blood tests just to rule out any underlying causes. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid function, vitamin B12 levels, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. I trust your judgement. If it puts my mind at ease, and rules things out, then go right ahead. I don't mind a little blood draw if it means gettin' to the bottom of things. My wife will be pleased you're bein' so thorough, she's always worryin’ about me. Better to be safe than sorry, as they say. When can we get these tests done? Is it here at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can do them right here at the clinic. The phlebotomist will be available this afternoon. We'll just need a small sample of blood. It should only take a few minutes. Once we have the results, which usually takes a few days, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying to manage your stress, getting adequate rest, and staying hydrated. You could also try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the headache, if you’re comfortable with that. And I’d advise limiting your sun exposure as much as possible. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I can do all of that. Rest, hydration, stay out of the sun… easy enough. And I’ll try to take it easy, though that’s not always simple! My wife keeps me busy, bless her heart. And I'll think about those pain relievers, maybe if it gets really bad. I prefer to just tough it out, but… a little help might be good. So, afternoon then, for the blood draw? Will I need to fast or anything? And thank you, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease already, just by listenin’ and bein’ so thorough.
DOCTOR: Yes, afternoon for the blood draw. And no, you don’t need to fast. You can eat and drink as usual. I’ll have the nurse schedule that for you before you leave. She’ll also give you a printout of the instructions for the blood tests and some information about managing tension headaches. You're very welcome, Aldine. My pleasure. It's important to me that my patients feel heard and understood. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful and patient with me, and I appreciate it a lot. I’ll see the nurse now, get that blood draw scheduled, and then I’ll be on my way. Thank you again for takin’ the time to listen and explain things so clearly. It’s a weight off my mind, to be honest. I’ll be sure to follow your advice, and get some rest. And stay out of the sun! My wife will be happy to hear that, at least.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aldine. It was a pleasure meeting you. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’ll see you then. And tell your wife I said hello! The nurse will be right with you. Have a good afternoon. .
