DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it's a bit hard to explain, really. I’ve just been so sensitive to the light lately. It's not like a pain, exactly, more… uncomfortable. And it's been getting worse these past few weeks.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Sensitive to light, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Like, even on a cloudy day, I find myself squinting a lot. And bright sunlight? Forget about it. It feels like… like my eyes are burning, but not a painful burn, just… really bothered. It's making it hard to even go outside.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when did you first notice this sensitivity?
PATIENT: Let me think… It started, I guess, around the beginning of July. Maybe mid-July? It was gradual, you know? Didn’t just happen overnight. At first I just thought I was tired, but it's not going away. It feels… different now, more intense.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other changes with your vision – blurry spots, floaters, double vision, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. My eyesight itself seems okay. I can read just fine, and things don’t look blurry or anything. It’s just the light bothering me. It doesn't feel like something in my eyes is wrong, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any headaches along with this sensitivity?
PATIENT: Sometimes, yeah. Not all the time, but if I'm out in the sun for too long, or even staring at a screen for a while, I get a bit of a headache. It’s usually a dull ache, nothing too bad, but it’s there. It usually goes away if I rest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk a little bit about your past health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I’ve always been pretty healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. And... well, I lost my wife a couple of years ago, so I’ve been seeing a therapist since then, but no physical health issues, really. I have Medicare, if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any. I've just been lucky, I guess. Just the regular check-ups, you know? And the visits with the therapist. Nothing like having a procedure or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. How about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… My mother had high blood pressure, but that’s about it, really. My father was healthy as a horse. And my wife’s side of the family, as far as I know, everyone was okay. Nothing major that I can think of. Does that help? I’m not really one for keeping track of all that stuff, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. Never have. And I don’t drink much either, just a glass of wine with dinner maybe once or twice a week. Nothing heavy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just the stuff the therapist prescribed, for… you know, anxiety. It’s a low dose, doesn’t really have any side effects, as far as I can tell. Nothing for anything physical. I can tell you the name if you need it, it’s… escitalopram, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. I’m going to check your eyes, and then maybe take your blood pressure, just to get a baseline. Do you wear glasses or contacts?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. My eyesight’s always been pretty good. That’s why this whole light sensitivity thing is so strange. It’s not like I'm used to dealing with vision problems. Okay, whatever you need to do is fine with me.
DOCTOR: Alright, eyes look clear externally. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light... though a bit constricted. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is fine. Let me check your visual fields. Follow my finger with your eyes, and tell me when you can no longer see it.
PATIENT: Okay, I'm following your finger. That's... still seeing it. And... yep, still there. Uh-huh. It's getting a little harder to see on this side, I think. Just a bit though. Still seeing it... Yes, that's about where it disappears. Everything looks a little... hazy now. Is that normal? I'm trying to be helpful, but I don't really know what I'm looking for.
DOCTOR: Okay. A little bit of constriction and some minor visual field defects... It's not alarming, but it's enough to warrant further investigation. Have you had any recent head trauma?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. Nothing like that. I haven't bumped my head or anything. I'm a dental assistant, so I’m pretty careful, you know? Definitely haven't had any injuries recently. And I haven't fallen or anything either. It's just been gradually getting worse, like I said. It’s puzzling, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to order some tests. I want to rule out anything serious. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel, just to get a baseline. But I’m most concerned about a possible optic neuritis, so I’m going to refer you to an ophthalmologist for a more thorough examination, including a visual evoked potential test. They'll be able to get a better look at your optic nerve. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds... a lot. But yeah, alright. If that's what you think is best, Doctor. Optic… what was it? Neuritis? Is that… serious? I don't want to scare my sister, she's the one who drives me to these appointments. I don't really know anything about… nerves and stuff. What does that test involve? And the blood work… is that just a regular draw? I’m trusting you, Doctor, but… it's a little overwhelming, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve. It can be serious, but it's often treatable, and early diagnosis is key. It can cause vision loss, but not always permanent. The visual evoked potential test—VEP—is non-invasive. They put electrodes on your scalp and flash lights in your eyes to measure how quickly your brain is responding to visual stimuli. It’s a bit uncomfortable, but painless. The blood work is a standard draw; they’ll take a sample from your arm. I'm ordering it to rule out other possible causes for your symptoms. It’s all precautionary, Mr. Komarov. I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but we need to investigate. I will give you a referral slip for Dr. Anya Sharma, she’s a very good ophthalmologist. She's located downtown. Can you make an appointment within the next week or so?
PATIENT: Okay… Okay, that makes a little more sense. Downtown, you said? I think I can manage that. My sister will probably help me with the appointment. She's good at things like that. And it's… painless, you said? That’s good. Honestly, I just want to figure out what's going on. It’s scary not knowing. So, yes, I’ll try to get an appointment with Dr. Sharma as soon as possible. Within a week, definitely. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate it. Do I need to fast for the blood work?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood work. No food or drinks except water. I’m going to print out these instructions for you, and a copy for your sister. And here is Dr. Sharma’s referral slip. I will also send the lab orders to the lab downtown electronically. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain things so clearly. I'll get the appointment scheduled with Dr. Sharma and make sure I follow the fasting instructions. Thank you again. I… I feel a little better, just knowing we're trying to figure it out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov. That’s good to hear. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And remember, try to limit your exposure to bright light until we know what’s going on. Take care, and I’ll see you again after you see Dr. Sharma.
