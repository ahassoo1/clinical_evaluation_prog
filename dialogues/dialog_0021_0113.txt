DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto, good to see you. Though, frankly, at your age, everyone’s got something going on. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about... going to the bathroom. A lot. More than I used to, you understand. It's a nuisance, really. Wakes me up at night, too. Not pleasant. I don't rightly remember when it started, just... always seems to be happening lately. My wife, bless her heart, keeps telling me to come in. Says I'm disrupting her sleep.
DOCTOR: Right, increased urinary frequency. And nighttime trips, disrupting sleep… yes, that is a nuisance. It’s good your wife is encouraging you to get it checked out. Now, is it painful when you go?
PATIENT: Painful? Not exactly painful. It's more of a... a burning feeling sometimes. Not every time, mind you. And it doesn't last long. Just a little sting, really. Honestly, I've had worse things in my life. Back in the old country... well, never you mind. It's just... annoying, that's all. And I have to go so often! It’s ridiculous. Is this something serious, Doctor? I haven’t got time for serious.
DOCTOR: A burning sensation… intermittent, not severe. Alright. And you said it’s a recent change?
PATIENT: Recent... well, what is recent? Time flies when you're getting on, you know. I suppose it's been... a few months, maybe? Longer? Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. My wife probably knows better. She worries about everything. It just gradually got worse, I suppose. I just thought it was old age catching up with me, to be perfectly frank. Is that what it is? Just getting old?
DOCTOR: Well, getting older can certainly contribute to changes in urinary habits. But we need to rule out other things, just to be safe. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, goodness, no! Not that I've seen. I... I wouldn't miss that, would I? My eyesight isn't what it used to be, but I think I'd notice blood. No, definitely no blood. Though, sometimes it's a little... cloudy, maybe? But that could just be… you know… the way things are. I don’t pay much attention to it.
DOCTOR: Cloudy urine… alright. And have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. I'm a hardy Ukrainian, you know. Don't get sick easily. Chills... well, it gets cold in this house sometimes. My wife likes it cool. Back pain? A little. I've always had a little ache in my back. Comes with the farming, you see. Spent years bending over fields. It’s just… old age. I don’t think it's related to the… bathroom business. Honestly, Doctor, you're asking a lot of questions. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Segretto. It’s just important to gather as much information as possible. Now, do you have any difficulty starting the stream of urine, or is it a strong, steady flow once you begin?
PATIENT: Difficulty... well, sometimes it takes a moment. A little hesitation. Not a problem, exactly. Just... doesn't come rushing out like it used to. It’s weaker, I suppose. But it eventually gets going. I don't sit there struggling for hours, if that's what you're asking. It’s just… slower. And I have to push a little sometimes, to get it all out. Now, are we going to do something about this, or just talk about it all day? I have things to do, you know. The garden needs tending.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s have a quick listen to your abdomen and do a quick prostate exam. It'll give me a better idea of what's going on. It's standard procedure for these symptoms, Mr. Segretto. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll explain everything as I go. It won’t take long. Now, I'm going to gently press here, and tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort...
PATIENT: A prostate exam, you say? At my age? Honestly. Well, I suppose you're the doctor. Just... be gentle, alright? I haven’t had one of those in… well, a long time. And don't go poking around too much. I've got sensitive parts, you know. Just get it over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can get back to my garden. Honestly, young people and their procedures… always something.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's done. Prostate feels slightly enlarged, but not acutely tender. Nothing immediately alarming, but it does explain some of your symptoms. Now, I'd like to order a urinalysis and a urine culture, just to rule out any infection. We'll also check your prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, level with a blood test. That will give us a baseline for future comparison. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests, tests, always more tests. Well, alright. If you think it's necessary. But I tell you, all these poking and prodding and drawing of blood… it's not pleasant. And how long will these results take? I don't want to be coming back here every other day. My wife will be furious if I'm not home to help with supper. And what if it’s something serious? You're not telling me anything, Doctor. Just saying “tests.” Honestly, I’d rather just know if I'm going to be alright. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, I understand your anxiety. The tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. The most likely scenario is benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH—an enlarged prostate, which is common in men your age. That can cause frequent urination, a weak stream, and difficulty starting or stopping. That's what I suspect, but we need the tests to confirm. The results should be back within a few days. If it is BPH, there are several effective treatments—medications and, if necessary, minimally invasive procedures. I assure you, we’ll discuss all options thoroughly if the tests confirm that diagnosis. But let’s not jump to conclusions. It is more likely something manageable. Now, I'll give you a referral to the lab, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Benign… what did you call it? BPH? Sounds complicated. Well, alright. Tests and follow-ups. It’s always something, isn’t it? Just… don’t keep me waiting too long. And make sure your nurse is gentle when she draws the blood. I don’t like needles. And don’t spring any surprises on me. I want to know everything up front. Honestly, young people and their… medical jargon. Alright, give me the referral. Let’s get this over with. I have tomatoes to stake.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Here's the referral, and this sheet has instructions for the lab. The nurse will be gentle, I assure you. And we’ll discuss everything thoroughly at your follow-up appointment. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or experience any worsening symptoms before then. Now, have a good day, and enjoy your tomatoes. .
