DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you. Well, it’s rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been…experimenting with diets, shall we say. A bit foolishly, in retrospect. I thought I’d have a professional opinion on whether I’m doing myself any harm, and if you might have some…suggestions for a more sensible approach. It all started with a rather insistent grandson, you see. He’s convinced the cabbage soup diet is the answer to everything.
DOCTOR: Cabbage soup, you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. A rather large quantity of cabbage soup, for several days. Before that there was a…grapefruit one, and, oh dear, I believe I also tried a rather restrictive…biscuit-based regime. My dear late wife always said I was a bit of a magpie for trends, and I suppose she was right. I do apologize for taking up your time with this nonsense. It's just…one reads so much, and it all sounds so promising at the time.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, these…fads, as you call them, are rarely sustainable, or frankly, healthy. Let's start with the basics. How long ago did you finish the cabbage soup diet?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It was…approximately three weeks ago, Doctor. I finished it on the 13th of July, I believe. I kept a rather meticulous log, actually. A habit from my animation days – one must document everything. Although, admittedly, the reasons for documentation were rather different then. It was to ensure the correct number of frames per second, not…soup consumption.
DOCTOR: And prior to that, you mentioned a grapefruit diet and something biscuit-based. Can you recall approximately when you were on those, and for how long?
PATIENT: Certainly. The grapefruit one was… April of this year. Perhaps a fortnight. Not terribly long, thankfully. It was dreadfully tart, I must say. And the biscuit one… that was in February. A week, I believe. One of those “eat six biscuits a day” schemes. They were surprisingly dry biscuits, and I found myself quite…distracted by the lack of flavour. I do enjoy a good digestive, you see. Always have. It's all very muddled, though, isn't it? It’s rather a catalogue of regrettable decisions, when one lays it all out like this.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, multiple restrictive diets in a relatively short period. Let's move on to current symptoms. Are you experiencing any weight loss, fatigue, dizziness, or any other changes in your health that you’ve noticed since starting these diets?
PATIENT: Well, the weight loss has been…inconsistent, shall we say. I lost a few pounds on the cabbage soup, naturally. And regained them all, and a little extra, rather promptly. I have been feeling a bit more tired lately, yes. Not debilitating, but…a general lack of pep, you might say. And… I’ve been rather prone to feeling the cold, particularly in my extremities. My fingers get quite numb, and I find myself reaching for a cardigan more often than usual. It’s August, after all! A rather unusual state of affairs, I assure you.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s…rather a direct question, Doctor. Well, yes, actually. A bit…irregular, shall we say. Not entirely unpleasant, but…less predictable than usual. And, if I'm being entirely honest, a little…urgent at times. I do apologize for such a blunt description, but you asked. It's all rather embarrassing, of course. I haven't discussed this with anyone until today. It simply didn’t seem…appropriate dinner party conversation.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Doctor?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. I've always been rather fortunate with my health, generally. A bit of a cold now and again, the usual aches and pains of getting on in years, but nothing that requires…intervention. My late wife, bless her soul, was the one who always required medication. A complicated history, that was. But myself? No, nothing at all. Just a bit of foolishness with diets, I assure you. I rather pride myself on being independent, you see. Taking medication feels…defeatist, somehow. Although, I am beginning to suspect this independence may have led me down a rather misguided path.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, then we can discuss some options. If you don't mind. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. . No problem at all. Though I must warn you, I’m rather tall. Six foot two, exactly. My mother always said I inherited it from my grandfather, who was a lighthouse keeper. Apparently, it’s advantageous to have a good vantage point when scanning the horizon. Though I suspect it’s more trouble than it’s worth, navigating doorways and low ceilings. Proceed as you wish, Doctor. I’m entirely at your disposal.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, if a little distant. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no acute tenderness. Pulses are weak, particularly in the feet. Reflexes are diminished. Your blood pressure is a bit low, 108/65. And your temperature is normal. Given your history of restrictive diets and current symptoms – fatigue, cold intolerance, bowel changes, and weak pulses – and the diminished reflexes, it sounds like you are exhibiting some signs of mild malnutrition and potential dehydration. It's not alarming, but needs to be addressed.
PATIENT: Mild malnutrition? Dehydration? Good heavens. I hadn't thought...I simply thought I was a bit…run down. It's rather unsettling to hear it put so clinically, Doctor. Is it serious? Will I require…special attention? I do apologize for being so naive. I suppose I should have listened to my late wife. She always said I worried too much about appearances and not enough about…substance. A very sensible woman, she was. What do you recommend, Doctor? I’m quite willing to follow your instructions.
DOCTOR: It’s not immediately serious, no, but ignoring it will become serious. Your body is clearly not getting the nutrients it needs, and the dehydration isn't helping. We need to get you back on a balanced diet, and make sure you’re properly hydrated. I’m going to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, electrolyte balance, and rule out any underlying conditions. In the meantime, I want you to focus on eating small, frequent meals, and include plenty of protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates. Avoid restrictive diets completely. And drink plenty of fluids – water, broth, herbal teas. Avoid sugary drinks. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly. Small, frequent meals. Protein, healthy fats, complex carbohydrates. No restrictive diets. Plenty of fluids, water and broth, not sugary drinks. I shall endeavour to follow those instructions to the letter. Blood work, you say? Certainly. Whatever is necessary to get me back on track. I must confess, the thought of abandoning all dietary “regimes” is…rather liberating, actually. Though I suspect my grandson may not be entirely pleased. He’s a rather enthusiastic proponent of the latest fads. Perhaps I shall tell him it’s a doctor’s order. That should settle that.
DOCTOR: That is an excellent idea. I will write a note for him as well. Let me see…I'm also going to refer you to a registered dietitian. They can help you create a meal plan that’s tailored to your needs and preferences. They are quite skilled at working with individuals with complex histories like yours. And I want to see you back in two weeks for a follow-up appointment. We’ll review the blood work results and assess your progress. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds entirely acceptable. A registered dietitian…excellent. Someone to steer me towards sensible eating, rather than allowing me to succumb to the whims of internet trends. I shall be most grateful for their guidance. And two weeks…perfectly reasonable. You are very thorough, Doctor. I must say, I feel considerably reassured. It’s rather a relief to have a plan of action, and to be taking positive steps. I believe I owe my late wife an apology. She warned me about this, you know. About chasing shadows and neglecting substance. A very wise woman, indeed. Thank you, Doctor Korrell. I appreciate your…directness, and your kindness.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to print out the lab requisition and the referral information for the dietitian. The lab is just down the hall, and they take walk-ins. And please, if your symptoms worsen at any time, don’t hesitate to contact the office. I want to make sure you are doing alright. Here you are. Do you have any further questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything admirably. These documents are most helpful. I shall schedule the blood work immediately and look into contacting the dietitian. I truly appreciate your thoroughness and patience. It's comforting to know I'm in such capable hands. I suspect my late wife would approve. Thank you again, Doctor Korrell. I shall see you in two weeks. And, if I may say so, your clinic is…quite charming. A peaceful setting, which is most welcome. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mr. Vantine. I expect you’ll be feeling much better soon. Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns.
