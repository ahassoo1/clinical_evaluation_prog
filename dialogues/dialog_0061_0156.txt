DOCTOR: Talofa, Jase. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Dr. Kimm. It’s nice to meet you too. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure… something about my stomach? It's been… off. Really off, for a bit now. Lots of… well, you know. Diarrhea. It’s been going on for a while, and my husband thought I should come in. I don’t really remember exactly when it started, or what triggered it. Everything feels a bit fuzzy lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, “off” and diarrhea for a while… that’s a good starting point. It’s perfectly alright that the timing is fuzzy, we can try to narrow it down. When you say "a while", would you estimate it’s been less than a week, a couple of weeks, or longer than that?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Definitely longer than a week. Maybe… a month? Or even two? It comes and goes, you know? Not constant, but… frequently. It’s hard to keep track, I guess. I’ve just been trying to manage it. It's just… annoying, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent diarrhea for potentially a month or two. That helps. And you said it’s mostly annoying – is there any pain with it?
PATIENT: Pain… not really pain, exactly. More like cramping? Sometimes before it happens, and sometimes during. It's not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a really bad period cramp, maybe? And a lot of bloating. Definitely bloating. It makes me feel really full, even when I haven't eaten much.
DOCTOR: Alright, cramping and bloating alongside the diarrhea. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or a change in the color – anything darker or more pale than usual?
PATIENT: Oh… um. I think… maybe once or twice? Just a little bit of red. It didn't seem like a lot, and it was a while ago. It scared me, but it didn't happen again. As for the color… honestly, I don’t really pay much attention. It looks… normal, usually? Sometimes a little softer than it should be, I guess. It's not something I usually check, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That's alright, many people don’t routinely check. Seeing a little bit of red is good to know, even if it was just once or twice. And softer stools are common with diarrhea. Now, have you noticed any fever, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss along with all of this?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. I haven’t felt sick, just… tired. And no vomiting. Nausea, maybe a little bit sometimes, but not enough to actually be sick. As for weight loss… I feel like I’ve lost a bit, but I haven’t weighed myself recently. My husband keeps saying I should eat more, so maybe he’s noticed? It's hard to say. Everything's a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, potential slight weight loss, no fever or vomiting, intermittent nausea, and the diarrhea, cramping, and occasional small amount of red in your stool. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, thyroid issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… well, my husband says I have something with my stomach… I think he mentioned something about IBD? Or… celiac? He’s the one who usually deals with doctor stuff. I was diagnosed with it a few years ago, but I don’t really remember the details. It’s… complicated. I just try to eat what he tells me to, to keep everything okay. It’s hard to keep track of everything, and honestly, it all feels a bit far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a diagnosis of either IBD or celiac disease a few years ago. That’s important information. Do you know which one it was specifically?
PATIENT: No, I really don’t. He just… told me what to eat. Gluten-free stuff, mostly? And avoiding certain things. He handles the appointments and explains everything to me. I just… follow his instructions. It's been a while since the diagnosis, and I haven't had to think about it much until now. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. Everything’s just a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Jase. It sounds like your husband has been very supportive in managing your health. We can certainly look into your records to confirm the specific diagnosis. Let me just pull up your chart here... Okay, it looks like you were diagnosed with Celiac Disease approximately three years ago. Are you currently following a strict gluten-free diet?
PATIENT: Celiac… okay, that rings a bell. And yes, I try to. My husband is very careful about it. He checks everything before I eat it, and we mostly cook at home. It’s difficult when we go out, but we try to find places that have gluten-free options. I sometimes… slip up, maybe? A tiny bit of something with gluten? It doesn't happen often, but I'm not perfect. Could that be causing this?
DOCTOR: It’s very possible that occasional gluten exposure could be contributing to your symptoms. Even small amounts can sometimes trigger a flare-up, especially if you’ve been sensitive to gluten in the past. Let's do a quick physical exam, and then we can talk about some possible tests to rule out other causes and confirm if this is a flare-up of your Celiac Disease. Would you mind if I listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness or unusual sounds?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… okay. Yes, go ahead. Just… try to be gentle, please? My stomach’s been pretty sensitive lately.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay. I’m noticing some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, mostly on the left side. I’m also hearing some increased bowel sounds, which isn’t surprising given the diarrhea. No signs of any rebound tenderness or guarding, which is good. Your abdomen is soft, but there's definitely some discomfort with palpation. Based on the exam, it does seem like there’s some inflammation in your digestive system. Now, let's talk about some tests to help us figure out what's going on. I’d like to order a stool test to check for infection and inflammation, and a blood test to check your Celiac antibody levels. That will give us a better idea if this is a flare-up of your Celiac Disease, or if something else is going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Tests sound helpful. Whatever you think is best. A stool test and a blood test… okay. Will they be… painful? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: The stool test is completely non-invasive - you'll just need to collect a small sample. The collection kit will have clear instructions. As for the blood test, it’s just a standard blood draw, so a little pinch – nothing major. Regarding results, the blood test typically takes 2-3 business days to come back. The stool test may take a bit longer, around 3-5 business days. We can review the results together as soon as they are available. In the meantime, continue to follow your gluten-free diet as strictly as possible. Stay hydrated with plenty of fluids, and try to avoid any foods that you know typically trigger your symptoms. If your diarrhea worsens, or you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or bloody stools, please contact me immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that all sound clear?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that sounds clear. Stool sample, blood test, follow the diet, stay hydrated… and contact you if it gets worse. I can do that. Thank you, Dr. Kimm. It’s nice to finally have some direction. I feel like I’ve been wandering around in the dark.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. I’m glad I could help. It’s completely understandable to feel lost and confused when dealing with digestive issues. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to give you the lab requisition forms and instructions for the stool sample collection. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Dr. Kimm. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I really appreciate it. I think I'll just go home and rest now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could help. Please take care of yourself and get some rest. And remember, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
