DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, it's a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and kind of yellow… my skin and eyes, anyway. It started after I ate some fava beans, which I haven't had in years. I didn't even think it could cause something like this.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tired and yellowing of the skin and eyes…that’s jaundice, essentially. And it started after consuming fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely after. I had them with dinner a couple of nights ago, and then the next day I just felt…off. Weak, mostly. And then I noticed the color change in the mirror. It’s not a lot of yellow, but it’s noticeable. I figured it was something I ate, but then I remembered my grandmother mentioning something about fava beans being bad for some people, a long time ago. I didn’t pay much attention then, but now… I'm worried.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's good you remembered that. It is possible. It sounds like you might be experiencing something called favism, which is a reaction to a deficiency in an enzyme – G6PD – and triggered by fava beans. But we need to confirm that. Have you ever had any issues with anemia, or have you ever been told you were low on iron?
PATIENT: Anemia… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never been specifically told I was anemic, no. I mean, I get tired sometimes, who doesn’t? But nothing serious enough for a doctor to say anything about it. And I’ve always been pretty healthy, as far as I know. I eat a reasonable diet, try to get enough sleep… although lately, that’s been hard, with feeling so weak. Is this enzyme thing… serious? I'm sorry, I'm probably asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to ask questions. It’s good you are. G6PD deficiency itself isn’t usually serious, but it can cause problems when exposed to triggers like fava beans, certain medications, or even infections. It can lead to a sudden breakdown of red blood cells, which is what causes the jaundice and fatigue. Alright, let’s do a quick exam and then I'll order some blood work to check your G6PD levels and see if your red blood cells are being affected. Just routine, to be sure. Can you describe the fatigue a bit more?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Routine is good. As for the fatigue… it's not like a normal tired after a long day. It’s… heavy. Like my limbs are weighed down. It’s hard to explain. I feel breathless easily too, even just walking around the house. And I just don't have any energy to do anything. It's not just physical, either. I feel… mentally foggy, like I can't concentrate. It started gradually after the beans, and then it just got worse each day. It's definitely interfering with my work. I'm a receptionist, so I need to be sharp and alert.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds quite debilitating. Mental fogginess is important to note. Let’s have a listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and I’ll take a look at your skin color more closely. Then we’ll get that blood work ordered. If you don't mind, please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Of course, no problem. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I hope it's nothing too serious. I really rely on my job, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Breathing sounds are a little diminished, but not significantly abnormal. Heart sounds are regular. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. I am noting mild jaundice to the sclera and skin, particularly noticeable in the palms. It's not severe, but definitely present. Now, let me just check your vital signs. Blood pressure is 128/82, pulse is 80, temperature is 98.6. Okay. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a reticulocyte count, a direct and indirect bilirubin level, and a G6PD enzyme assay. We'll also check your liver function tests just to rule out anything else. That should give us a clearer picture of what's going on.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking everything so seriously. How long will it take to get the results? And is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Like, should I avoid certain foods or… anything? I know you probably said avoid fava beans already, but just checking. I feel a little silly asking.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome. It’s important to be thorough. And no, you're not silly asking. It's good you're being proactive. The lab results should be back within 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, absolutely avoid fava beans. And, to be safe, I would also advise avoiding medications containing sulfonamides – those are often found in certain antibiotics, and can also trigger a reaction in people with G6PD deficiency. I’ll give you a list of those to avoid. For now, just rest, stay hydrated, and let me know if your symptoms worsen – particularly if you develop any abdominal pain, dark urine, or shortness of breath. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they come in, and figure out a plan from there. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: That's good to know about the sulfonamides. I'll make sure to check everything. No allergies to medications, thankfully. Just… a general dislike of taking pills, but that’s not a medical issue, is it? This has been really helpful, Doctor. Thank you. I feel a little less anxious now, just knowing what we're looking for. I’ll definitely let you know if anything changes. I guess I’ll just… wait for the results then. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Paperwork or something?
DOCTOR: No, no allergies is good. And no, a dislike of medication isn't a medical issue. No, there’s no paperwork. I’ll have the nurse give you a copy of the lab orders, and a list of medications to avoid. Just rest, and we’ll talk soon. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms before then, go to the nearest urgent care or emergency room. It’s always better to be safe. Alright, you can get dressed, and I'll see you in a couple of days.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. I appreciate your time. Have a good day. .
