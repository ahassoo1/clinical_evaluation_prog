DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about this medical marijuana. My niece, she has some…troubles, and she suggested I look into it. Frankly, I thought it was all rather…nonsense, but she was quite insistent. And she said a proper doctor could certify me for it. I’m not entirely sure what that means, but here I am.
DOCTOR: Medical marijuana, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes. I understand it's… becoming more acceptable. Though I still have my doubts. It just seems…undignified, really. But she said it might help with my…sleep. It's not terrible, mind you, just… not as restful as it used to be. And frankly, I’m willing to try something if it means I don’t have to listen to her lecture me anymore. She’s very…determined, that girl.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you’re considering medical marijuana primarily for sleep issues. And it was your niece's suggestion. Let’s talk about this sleep problem a bit more, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, quite. It's not as if I'm suffering terribly, Doctor. It’s just… I used to fall asleep the moment my head hit the pillow. Now, I toss and turn. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and have a bit of trouble getting back to sleep. It’s more… irritating than anything. My husband doesn’t seem to notice, he sleeps like a log, the lucky man. Though he does complain if I get up too early and start puttering around.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it’s been… well, it’s probably been at least six months, maybe longer. It started gradually, you see. I didn’t really pay much attention at first. It’s just… gotten worse as time went on, I suppose. It's not like I haven't tried things, either. Warm milk, chamomile tea… all those old wives’ tales. Nothing seems to make much of a difference, honestly. It’s rather frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me see… well, I’ve been a little… more forgetful lately, perhaps. Though at my age, I suppose that’s to be expected. It’s not like I’m losing my mind, mind you. Just… sometimes I misplace my glasses, or I forget what I was saying mid-sentence. Nothing major, really. And I suppose I'm not as energetic as I used to be, but that’s likely just the years catching up with me. My niece keeps telling me I need to exercise more, but honestly, I find that rather… taxing.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, some forgetfulness and decreased energy. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, not really. My appetite is… perfectly normal, thank you very much. I enjoy my meals. My husband is a wonderful cook, you see. He makes a lovely roast chicken. I haven't lost any weight, and I certainly haven't been feeling less hungry. It's just… this sleep. It’s disrupting my routine, really. I like to get up early and putter around the garden, but I can't do that if I haven't had a decent night's sleep. It’s all very… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: And what about daytime fatigue?
PATIENT: Well, yes, I am a little tired during the day, now that you mention it. Not exhausted, mind you. But I don't have the same… pep as I used to. I find myself needing to sit down more often, and I don't have the energy for long walks like I used to enjoy. It's not debilitating, but it’s… noticeable. It’s just… everything seems to require a little more effort than it used to. Honestly, I think it’s just old age catching up with me. But my niece insists it's something more. She’s always been a bit dramatic, that girl.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, nothing serious, Doctor. I had a touch of the flu a few years back, but I recovered quickly. And I’ve always had slightly high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. My regular doctor keeps a close eye on it. I see him twice a year for check-ups. Other than that, I’m quite healthy, thank you very much. I’ve always been careful about my diet and exercise – well, relatively careful. And I certainly haven’t had any… major illnesses. My husband always says I'm as strong as an ox. Though he also says I’m stubborn as one, which may be why I’ve avoided the doctor for so long.
DOCTOR: And what medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it’s… Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril. A small dose, mind you. Just enough to keep things under control. I’ve been taking it for… oh, goodness, I must have been on it for at least five years now. My regular doctor adjusts the dosage as needed. I’m very good about taking my medication, I assure you. I have a little pill organizer, you see, so I don’t forget. Though sometimes I misplace the organizer itself… but that’s neither here nor there.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, not a single one, thank heavens. I’ve always been very careful about my health, you see. I avoid risky activities, and I eat a balanced diet. I’ve always believed in preventative care, so I’ve never had the need for surgery. My husband once had his appendix out, but that was many years ago, and he recovered quite well. Honestly, the thought of surgery terrifies me. All those… instruments and… and everything. No, I’ve managed to avoid that particular fate, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 88, so I suppose good genes are on my side. She had a bit of arthritis in her later years, but other than that, she was quite healthy. My father passed away when I was young, from a heart condition, I believe. And my sister has some…troubles with her digestion, but that’s neither here nor there. Honestly, my family wasn’t particularly prone to serious illnesses. They were a hardy bunch, you see. Though my niece is always going to doctors for every little sniffle… honestly, I think she enjoys the attention. But as far as serious conditions go, no, my family history isn’t particularly concerning.
DOCTOR: And finally, what about allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Hmm… Well, I don’t think I have any serious allergies, Doctor. I get a bit of a sniffle sometimes during pollen season, but that’s hardly anything to worry about. I certainly haven’t had any severe reactions to anything, and I can eat all sorts of foods without any trouble. My niece is allergic to shellfish, which is a shame, because she loves lobster. But other than that, no, I’m not particularly prone to allergies. Honestly, I think people exaggerate their allergies these days. It’s just a way to get attention, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you're 74 years old, healthy overall, taking Lisinopril for blood pressure, no surgeries, no known allergies. And you're seeking a certification for medical marijuana primarily for sleep disturbances, at the urging of your niece. I must say, I’m still skeptical about the benefits of medical marijuana, but we can discuss the potential risks and benefits. However, before we proceed, I think it's important to rule out any other underlying causes for your sleep problems. We should run some basic blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any other medical conditions that could be affecting your sleep. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Well, that sounds… reasonable, Doctor. I suppose it’s best to be thorough. I certainly don’t want to go around taking things without knowing what’s causing the problem in the first place. Blood tests… I suppose I can manage that. I do dislike needles, but… if it’s necessary. And frankly, if it gets my niece off my back, I’m willing to do it. Yes, go ahead and schedule the blood tests. But I must say, I still think this is all a bit… much. But I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood for a basic metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin D and B12 levels. We'll also check your iron levels, as iron deficiency can also cause fatigue and sleep disturbances. I’ll order the tests now, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in about a week. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed, and ensuring your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… quite acceptable, Doctor. A regular sleep schedule… I suppose I can try that. Though it’s easier said than done when my husband decides to watch television until all hours of the night. But I’ll do my best. And avoid caffeine and alcohol… I rarely drink alcohol anyway, and I only have one cup of coffee in the morning. So, that shouldn’t be too difficult. Yes, a week sounds fine. Hopefully, the results will be quick. And hopefully, they won’t show anything too… alarming. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… thorough. And patient. Especially considering. All of this.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ellan. It’s my job. And it’s always best to be cautious. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She'll explain the procedure. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Have a good day, Ellan. And try to get some rest.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. You as well. Thank you again. I shall try to rest. And I will call if… well, if anything arises.
