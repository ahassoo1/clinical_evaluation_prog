DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um… hello. It’s… a visit, yes? My husband said I should come. Something about… learning? I don’t really remember what he said. He just said the doctor needs to… tell me things.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s perfectly alright. Sometimes it’s hard to keep everything straight. We can take our time. So, your husband suggested this visit… and you’re not entirely sure what it’s about?
PATIENT: No. He said… something about my work. That it's… not good for me? I work with metal. Sheets of it. Big ones. It’s… dusty, I guess. And loud. He worries. He always worries.
DOCTOR: Okay. Metal work… dusty and loud. That gives me a little something to work with. And you’ve been doing this work for… how long, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh… a long time. Maybe… ten years? Or more? It’s hard to say. Time goes by. I don’t keep track of things like that. It’s just… work. You know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Ten years or more… alright. And have you noticed any changes in how you feel since starting this work?
PATIENT: Changes…? I… sometimes I cough. A lot. Especially at night. And… my chest feels tight. Like something is squeezing it. But that happens anyway, you know? It’s… old. I always feel a little… stuffy. It’s nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay. Coughing, especially at night, and chest tightness… even if it's something you've felt for a while, it's good to get it checked out. Do you have any trouble breathing, Airam?
PATIENT: Trouble…? Not… really. I mean, sometimes after I lift the big metal sheets, I get… winded. Like I ran a race. But I just rest a bit, and it goes away. It’s not trouble. Everyone gets tired, right?
DOCTOR: You’re right, everyone gets tired. But it's important to rule things out. I'd like to listen to your lungs just to get a better idea of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… listen? You mean… with that cold thing? I don’t like that cold thing. It makes me… uncomfortable. Do you have to?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Airam. It’s not usually a comfortable experience, but it gives me important information. It will only take a moment. It’s a quick listen to your breathing – to hear if there's anything unusual. We can go slowly, and you can tell me to stop at any time. How about we just start with listening to your back, and then you can decide if you're comfortable continuing?
PATIENT: Fine. But… be quick. And don’t put it too cold. It feels… awful. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, just breathing normally… that’s good. I do hear some… wheezing. And your breathing sounds a little bit restricted. It's subtle, but it's worth noting. Now, let’s listen to the front of your chest. Just a quick listen, alright?
PATIENT: No! Stop. That’s enough. I don’t like this. You said quick. This isn’t quick. It feels… wrong. I want to go home. I told my husband I didn’t want to come.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. You’re absolutely right to tell me when you’re uncomfortable. We can stop immediately. I apologize. I didn’t realize it was causing you this much distress. It sounds like we haven’t gathered enough information to proceed comfortably. Considering your work environment – metal work with dust and noise – and your symptoms of coughing and chest tightness, I’m concerned about the possibility of occupational lung issues. However, I also recognize that you’re very distressed with the examination, and that’s important. I think the best course of action would be to recommend a referral to a pulmonologist, a lung specialist. They have more specialized equipment and expertise to evaluate your breathing and determine the cause of your symptoms. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A… a what? A lung… person? I don’t want to see another doctor. This is too much. I just came here because my husband told me to. He worries too much. I feel fine. Mostly. Can I just… go home now?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Airam. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed, and that's perfectly valid. Seeing multiple doctors can be exhausting. I won't force you to see anyone. However, I am concerned about the potential impact of your work on your lungs. Even if you feel “mostly” fine, it’s better to be proactive and rule out any serious issues. Perhaps… we can start with a simple chest X-ray?
PATIENT: An… X-ray? Like at the airport? I don’t like those machines. They… feel… strange. And I don't want to pay for anything. I don't have insurance. No. I just want to go home. My husband can worry. He always worries. I think I'm done here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Airam. I respect your decision. I won’t push you to do anything you’re not comfortable with. However, I strongly recommend that you discuss these symptoms with your husband, and consider whether getting some basic lung function testing, even if it’s just a simple spirometry test, might be beneficial. There are some resources available that can help you find low-cost or free testing options. I can provide you with information on those if you’d like. I’ll document our conversation today, and I encourage you to monitor your symptoms. If you experience any worsening shortness of breath, significant chest pain, or a high fever, please seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. Just… thank you. I think. I need to go home now. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Document everything. Occupational exposure, patient distress, refusal of testing. Emphasize the importance of follow-up with her husband and offer resources for low-cost care. It’s a difficult situation… .
