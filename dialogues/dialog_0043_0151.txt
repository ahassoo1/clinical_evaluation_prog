DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Teretha. Well, it's this tingling. It started a few weeks ago, I think. In my hands and feet, mostly. It's… annoying, to be honest. I just want it to stop. I got a lot of mail to deliver, you know? Don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Teretha. Annoying is a perfectly good way to describe it, and wanting it to stop is certainly reasonable. A few weeks ago… can you describe the tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not painful, exactly. More like… pins and needles? Like when your foot falls asleep, but not as bad, and it doesn't go away when I move it. Sometimes it feels numb, too. It comes and goes, mostly when I'm walking my route, but it’s been happening even when I'm sitting now, which is new. It’s in both hands and feet, but the left hand is worse, I think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Teretha. "Pins and needles" and numbness, affecting both hands and feet, with the left hand being more pronounced… and now occurring even at rest. That's helpful information. When you say walking your route, approximately how far do you walk each day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It varies, of course, depending on the neighborhood, but usually about eight to ten miles. It's a big route. Been doing it for… well, a long time. Thirty years, I guess. Before my husband… well, never mind. It’s a lot of walking, and a lot of carrying. That's probably it, isn’t it? Just tired feet?
DOCTOR: It could be related to your activity level, Teretha, certainly. Thirty years on a route of that length is significant. However, we need to explore other possibilities to be certain. Before we jump to conclusions, let’s delve a bit deeper into your medical history. Have you had any other health issues in the past?
PATIENT: Well… not really. I had the flu a few times, like everyone does. And my arthritis acts up in the winter, mostly in my knees. But that’s it. Nothing serious. My husband… he had some heart trouble, but that was him. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. I try to eat well, you know? Mostly. No big surgeries, no major illnesses… just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Teretha. No major illnesses or surgeries, arthritis primarily affecting your knees… And you mentioned your husband’s heart trouble. Was there any family history of heart disease, diabetes, or nerve problems on either side of your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother, she had high blood pressure, I think. And her sister… she had something with her sugar, diabetes maybe? It was a long time ago, I don’t remember the details. My father’s side… they were mostly farmers, pretty rugged people. Don't think they had much trouble with anything other than hard work. No one I remember having problems with their nerves or anything like that. Honestly, we didn’t talk about health much back then. Just toughed things out.
DOCTOR: I understand, Teretha. Those details are still helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis cream when my knees bother me. And sometimes I take an antacid if I eat something… spicy. That's it. Nothing regularly. No pills, no fancy vitamins… I don’t really believe in all that stuff, to be honest. Natural is best, I always say. So, no, no medications. Just the cream and the occasional antacid. Can we get to finding out what's wrong with my hands now? This tingling is really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Teretha. We will get to that. I just want to be thorough. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergy in my life. Not even to poison ivy. Lucky, I guess. Always been able to eat anything and everything. So, no allergies. Can we please get to the tests now? I have a lot of mail to deliver tomorrow. It’s a new route, too, and I need to get used to it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Teretha. We can move on to the physical exam. I'd like to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. We'll also check your circulation. It shouldn't take long. First, I'm going to test your reflexes. Please relax your arm… excellent. Now, I’m going to gently tap this area… and then your leg… Okay, good. Now, let's check your strength. Can you squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Just get it over with. There. Is that strong enough? I used to be able to lift heavy boxes, you know. Before… well, never mind. Just hurry up. This is making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Yes, that was good strength, Teretha. Very good. Now, I'm going to test your sensation. I'm going to lightly touch your hands and feet with this… Please tell me when you feel it. Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I feel that. A little bit numb, though. It’s hard to tell how much pressure it is. Like… a dull feeling? Not sharp. More like… a vibration, maybe? And here… yes, I feel that one too. But it's not a normal feeling. It’s… muffled. Like when your hand is asleep. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Teretha. “Muffled” and “a dull feeling” is important information. Now, I’m going to check your circulation. I’m just going to feel for a pulse in your feet and ankles. Your pulses are present, but slightly diminished compared to what I’d expect. Overall, your reflexes are normal, your strength is good, but there is reduced sensation and diminished pulses in your feet and ankles, with some numbness. Based on what you’ve told me and the findings of the exam, it’s possible this could be related to peripheral neuropathy – nerve damage affecting your hands and feet. However, we need to rule out other causes. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar, vitamin B12 levels, and thyroid function. I also recommend an electromyography and nerve conduction study to assess the function of the nerves in your hands and feet. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and what did you call it? Electro-something? Honestly, Doctor, this sounds complicated. I just want to know if it’s my arthritis or not. Is it something serious? I have mail to deliver! I don’t want to have to stop working. I can’t afford to. And I don't want to be poked and prodded with things. Is there anything else I can do? Maybe just some cream for my hands?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Teretha, and I want to assure you we’ll take things one step at a time. It's good you’re asking these questions. The blood tests and the EMG study will help us determine the cause of the tingling and numbness, and then we can decide on the best course of treatment. It's unlikely to be arthritis alone, given the diminished sensation and pulses. The EMG study involves small needles to measure electrical activity in your muscles, and it's not usually very painful. It's much like a routine blood draw, just a little more involved. For now, we can try some over-the-counter pain relief cream, but that will only address the symptoms. Without knowing the cause, we can’t offer an effective long-term solution. I'm also concerned about the possibility of underlying conditions like diabetes or vitamin deficiencies, which can cause nerve damage. It’s important to rule those out. Would you be comfortable with getting the blood tests done today?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood tests, I guess. But no poking and prodding today. I’m not doing any of that. Just the blood tests. And can you tell me, honestly, is it something serious? Could I lose my job? I really need to know. I depend on that job, Doctor. It’s all I have.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Teretha, and I will be honest with you. The tingling and numbness could be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, but it's also possible it's something less concerning. That's why the tests are so important. Whether it could affect your job depends on the cause and the severity. If it is something treatable, like a vitamin deficiency or poorly controlled blood sugar, we can manage it with medication and lifestyle changes. If it’s more serious, we’ll discuss all your options, and I’ll do everything I can to help you continue working. We’ll start with the blood tests, and I’ll explain the results as soon as they’re available. We can then discuss the next steps, which may include the EMG study. I’ll write you a referral to the lab, and the nurse will come in to draw your blood. In the meantime, try to avoid activities that aggravate the tingling, and we can talk about some over-the-counter creams that might provide some temporary relief. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… please hurry. I have mail to deliver. Let’s just get it over with. And tell the nurse to be gentle, okay? I don’t like needles. .
