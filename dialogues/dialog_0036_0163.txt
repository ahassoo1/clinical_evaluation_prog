DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It's August 2nd, 2025. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you. Well, to put it simply, I’ve been… experimenting, shall we say, with some rather drastic dietary changes lately. And I thought it prudent to have a professional opinion before I go any further. It’s all a bit silly, really, but my daughter insisted. She worries, you see.
DOCTOR: It's good of your daughter to encourage you to come in. It’s never silly to check in with a doctor when you're making changes to your routine, especially with your diet. “Drastic dietary changes” – could you tell me more about what those changes have been?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, it began with a rather enthusiastic endorsement of the “Breatharian Diet”, you know, living on air. That proved… unsustainable. Then I moved onto a strict carnivore regime for a fortnight – far too much red meat, if I may say so. Most recently, I’ve been attempting a version of the “Coppen Method”, largely fruit-based, though I confess I succumbed to a rather lovely piece of shortbread yesterday. It’s all terribly confusing, to be honest. And, frankly, I’m not entirely sure I feel any better.
DOCTOR: “Breatharian Diet”, a strict carnivore diet, and now a fruit-based diet with… occasional shortbread. That is quite a series of changes in a short time, Mr. Vantine. And you're right to question whether you feel better. It sounds like your body is having a hard time adjusting. To get a better picture of what's going on, let’s start with a little bit of your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions that I should be aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Goodness, let me see. I believe I’m reasonably sound, all things considered. Though I had a rather unpleasant bout of gout some years ago, which I manage with… careful choices. My doctor at the time, Dr. Abernathy, he was quite firm about avoiding port and rich sauces. Aside from that, nothing of significance, I believe. I’ve always been rather slender, you see. Perhaps too slender these days, if I’m honest. And I do get a bit breathless on the stairs, but that’s probably just the age, wouldn’t you say?
DOCTOR: Okay, history of gout, managed with diet, and some breathlessness. That's helpful. And you said Dr. Abernathy managed the gout – do you remember approximately when that was diagnosed?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it must have been… goodness, nearly twenty years ago now. Perhaps 2005 or 2006. I was working on a particularly demanding special effects sequence for a historical drama, terribly stressful. I recall the diagnosis coinciding with a rather lavish wrap party, which felt somewhat ironic. Dr. Abernathy was quite insistent on a full blood workup and a rather restrictive diet. He was a very thorough man, Dr. Abernathy. A bit stern, but thorough nonetheless.
DOCTOR: Alright, diagnosed with gout around 2005-2006. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the gout?
PATIENT: No, nothing of that sort. No surgeries, no extended hospital stays. I’ve always prided myself on maintaining a healthy constitution, despite my… eccentricities. A touch of influenza now and then, a sprained ankle when I was rather younger and more adventurous… but nothing requiring serious intervention. I did once break a finger whilst attempting to construct a miniature dragon for a film, but that was dealt with at home with a splint and a rather strong cup of tea. Rather amateurish, really. But I was keen to avoid any time off, you see. The show must go on, as they say.
DOCTOR: I understand. Avoiding downtime is important, especially in your field. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or Alzheimer's?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a tricky one. My father was a rather reserved man, and didn't much discuss ailments. I believe he suffered from a touch of high blood pressure in his later years, managed with… well, I believe it involved a good deal of brisk walking and a reduction in sherry consumption. My mother was remarkably robust, living well into her nineties. She attributed her longevity to a strict adherence to gardening and a complete avoidance of modern conveniences. As for anything more… significant, I’m not entirely sure. There was a great-aunt on my mother’s side who was… “peculiar”, prone to fits of melancholy, but I don’t believe it was ever properly diagnosed. A rather sad case, really. Nothing terribly alarming, I suspect. Though, now that I mention it, my cousin Arthur has a rather wobbly gait. Perhaps something neurological. I’d have to ask my daughter. She keeps meticulous records, you see. A very sensible girl.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. High blood pressure in your father, and the possibility of a neurological issue with your cousin Arthur. We can explore that further if needed. Now, regarding social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Never smoked a day in my life. Far too detrimental to one’s complexion, you see. Alcohol… I occasionally enjoy a glass of port with my dinner, though as I mentioned, I’m rather careful these days. And recreational drugs… absolutely not. I’ve always maintained a rather… disciplined lifestyle, particularly in my work. A clear head is essential for special effects, you know. Though I confess to a rather unhealthy addiction to strong Earl Grey tea. Does that count? I do have a rather extravagant collection of teapots, if you’re interested. Perhaps a bit excessive, to be honest. But it's a harmless vice, surely?
DOCTOR: A fondness for Earl Grey tea doesn't quite qualify, Mr. Vantine. And no, I won't pry into your teapot collection! Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. Though I once experienced a rather unpleasant reaction to a shellfish platter at a film premiere. It was terribly embarrassing. But I suspect it was simply a case of… freshness. Not a true allergy, you see. Aside from that, nothing springs to mind. I'm remarkably resilient, all things considered. Though, now that I think about it, I do get a slight rash if I handle certain types of artificial flowers. It's rather inconvenient, as they often feature prominently in my work. But it's a minor annoyance, really. Nothing to worry about. Is that all for now, Doctor? I do have a rather pressing appointment with a model-making supplier later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies aside from a mild reaction to certain artificial flowers. Thank you, Mr. Vantine, that’s a very thorough overview. Now, I think it would be helpful to do a brief physical exam. Just a quick check of your heart, lungs, and a look at your general condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A physical exam sounds perfectly reasonable. Though I must warn you, my joints occasionally creak a bit. The price of years spent hunched over miniature sets, you see. Do let me know if I need to adjust my position. And if you could avoid shining the light directly into my eyes for too long, I'd be most grateful. I’m rather sensitive to glare these days. Lead on, as they say. I trust you have a comfortable examining table?
DOCTOR: Yes, we do. And I will be mindful of the light and your joints. Please, if anything is uncomfortable at all, let me know immediately. Alright, if you could please lie down on your back, we’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. I'll need to place the stethoscope on your chest. Heart sounds are regular, slightly diminished, but that can be normal with age. Lungs are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Pulses are weak but present in all extremities. Gait appears slightly unsteady, as you mentioned. Alright, Mr. Vantine, that's all for the physical exam. It confirms some expected findings for your age, and some slight unsteadiness in your gait. Given your history of recent and drastic dietary changes, and the breathlessness you mentioned, I’d like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, electrolytes, kidney function, and a complete blood count. I also think it would be helpful to rule out any underlying thyroid issues. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Blood work and a check for thyroid issues… a prudent course of action indeed. I fully concur. And if you happen to discover a deficiency in some exotic vitamin that requires a particularly rare fruit, I do know a supplier… just in case. As for the rare fruit, perhaps a Mangosteen? A delightfully subtle flavour, you see. But please, don’t go to any undue trouble. I’m not entirely convinced this dietary experimentation has been a success, to be honest. Are there any preparations I need to make before the blood work? Fasting, perhaps? Or avoiding shortbread for a week?
DOCTOR: No need to avoid shortbread entirely, Mr. Vantine. But for the most accurate results, I would recommend fasting for 12 hours beforehand. So, no breakfast tomorrow, and ideally nothing after 8 PM tonight. We’ll send you a lab requisition with detailed instructions. The lab is just down the hall, and they’re very efficient. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and create a plan. In the meantime, I do think it's important to consider a more balanced diet. Drastic changes often do more harm than good. Would you be open to discussing a referral to a registered dietitian?
PATIENT: A registered dietitian… yes, that does sound… advisable. I confess I’m not entirely skilled in the art of balanced nutrition. I tend to focus on the aesthetic qualities of food, rather than its… physiological benefits. A dietitian could certainly steer me in the right direction. Yes, please, a referral would be most appreciated. And thank you, Doctor, for your patience and understanding. It’s rather embarrassing to admit I’ve been so… impulsive with my diet. One gets carried away, you see, chasing after the latest trend. But I do believe a sensible approach is the way forward. Now, shall we schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the blood work results? Perhaps in a fortnight?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Vantine. I've put in a referral to Sarah Chen, a registered dietitian who’s very experienced in helping people find sustainable eating plans. I’m scheduling a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, on August 16th, at 10:30 AM. That will give the lab plenty of time to process your results and Sarah time to review them before we meet. Here’s a summary of today’s visit, the lab requisition, and the contact information for Sarah Chen. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Excellent. August 16th at 10:30 AM… noted. And thank you for the information. This is all most helpful. No, I believe that covers everything. Though, if you ever happen to stumble across a particularly rare species of truffle, do let me know. It’s a culinary obsession, you see. But otherwise, no. I’m most grateful for your assistance, Doctor. And thank you, again, for your patience. It seems I’ve taken up rather a lot of your time. .
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Vantine. It was my pleasure. And I will certainly keep an eye out for any rare truffles! Take care, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day!
