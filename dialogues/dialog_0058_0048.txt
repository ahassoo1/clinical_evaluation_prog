DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Well, it's... these little spells I've been having. Confusing spells, you might say. Not a good feeling, let me tell you. My wife, she’s been worried, says I ask the same questions five times in an hour. It’s… irritating, frankly.
DOCTOR: Right. “Spells,” you say. And how long have these… spells been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... it's been… maybe three months now? It started subtly, forgetting where I put my tools, things like that. A good tile man doesn't forget where his tools are, you know. Then it got worse. Asking about the same things, not remembering what I had for breakfast... small things, building up. My wife keeps a calendar now, writes everything down. It’s… a bit much, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to clarify, you're saying this is mostly memory issues?
PATIENT: Mostly. It’s not like I’m wandering off or anything. It's just... things aren’t sticking. Like I hear someone tell me something, and five minutes later it’s gone. Poof. And I get… flustered, I suppose you’d say. Like I should know something, and it’s right there, but… it isn’t. It’s very… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the memory issues?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well… not really. I’m tired, I suppose. But who isn't? I’m 66 years old, you know. Tile setting is hard work, even now. My appetite’s been a bit off, maybe. Not eating as much as I used to, but I just figured that was the age too. No headaches, no dizziness, no… falling or anything dramatic. Just… this. This forgetfulness.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any family history of memory problems, or anything like Alzheimer’s or dementia?
PATIENT: Oh, now that's a question. Let me see… my mother, she got a bit… vague towards the end. But that was old age, right? Everyone gets a little fuzzy when they get really old. My father was sharp as a tack until the day he died. No, I don’t recall anyone being officially diagnosed with anything like that. A bit of forgetfulness, yes, but who doesn’t forget things?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Well, just the one. For my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Been on it for years, Doctor. Doc gave it to me when I turned 60. That's it. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing fancy. I prefer to eat well, that's my medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. Never had a problem with anything. I eat everything. Khmer food is quite spicy, you know. If I was allergic to something, I'd know it by now. My wife always asks, but no, nothing. Clean bill of health in that department.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Lason, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll check your reflexes, your balance, and do a brief cognitive assessment. It’s just a few simple questions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Questions? Well… I suppose. It’s not like I’m afraid of a few questions. But I expect you to be quick about it. I have work to do, you know. Tile doesn’t lay itself. And I'm not fond of being poked and prodded, if you don't mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your ears. Just going to take a quick look. Please remain still. Pulse is 72, regular. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your age and… recent stress, perhaps. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please extend your arms. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, stand up slowly for me, if you can. We’ll check your balance.
PATIENT: There. Done. Perfectly fine balance, I assure you. I’ve been climbing ladders for fifty years. It's these questions I don't like. Makes a man feel… tested.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and cognitive function. Just answer to the best of your ability. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today's date? Really? You're asking me the date? It’s August 2nd, 2025. Don’t you have calendars in this office? Honestly, Doctor, this is… insulting.
DOCTOR: Right. And can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Well, obviously, we're in your office. Doctor's office. Suburban, judging by the parking lot. Is this some kind of trick question? I'm a tile man, not a geography expert.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? Very well. Let’s get this over with. What are the words? Don’t make me wait all day.
DOCTOR: The words are… apple, table, penny. Remember those, and I'll ask you to recall them later. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: The year… It’s… 2025, isn't it? You just said it was August. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I’m being deliberately tested. It’s… demeaning.
DOCTOR: Right. And now, I'm going to ask you a simple math problem. If I have 10 apples and I give 3 away, how many apples do I have left?
PATIENT: This is ridiculous. Ten apples, give away three… seven! Seven apples left. Is this what you do all day? Giving tile men simple math problems? It’s a waste of everyone’s time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, can you recall the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Words… words… Let me see… there was an apple… and… something to do with eating… a table, maybe? And… a coin? A penny? Yes, a penny! Apple, table, penny. There. Done. Are we finished now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Based on my brief assessment, and your description of symptoms, I suspect you may be experiencing early signs of cognitive impairment. It could be a number of things, and further testing is needed to determine the cause. I’m referring you to a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation. They will likely order some blood work and possibly a brain scan. Here is the referral. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Cognitive impairment? What are you implying? I build things! Beautiful things! Tile work requires precision, focus… not something someone with… “impairment” can do. A neurologist? Brain scan? This is… preposterous. A waste of my time and money, I assure you. And frankly, a bit insulting. I don’t appreciate this, Doctor. Not one bit. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your concerns. However, it’s important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I strongly advise you to follow up with the neurologist. I’ve also scheduled a follow-up appointment for you in one month to discuss the results of the neurological evaluation. If you experience any sudden changes in your condition, such as confusion, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please seek immediate medical attention. Have a good day.
