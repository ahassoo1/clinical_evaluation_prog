DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Cleo. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doc. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, somethin' about insurance. Long-term care, I think? My… someone told me I needed to get checked out for it. It's kinda blurry, to be honest. My wife… she used to handle all this stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It can be a bit confusing navigating insurance, especially with long-term care. And it's completely alright if the details are fuzzy – that’s what I’m here for. It sounds like you might be needing a general health assessment to qualify for certain benefits. Let’s start with you. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little about what’s been going on with your health recently?
PATIENT: Well… I work down at the docks, movin' freight. It’s honest work. Been doin’ it a long time. Lately… my back’s been botherin’ me some. And I get tired quicker, I guess. Not like… sick tired, just… worn out. I don’t know if that makes sense. Used to be able to work all day, now I need to sit down a bit more. And… hmm… I forget things sometimes. Small stuff, mostly. Like where I put my keys. It's gettin' old, I reckon.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Cleo. Physical jobs can certainly take a toll over time, and fatigue and memory lapses can be caused by a number of things. It’s good you’re bringing this up. So, regarding your back pain, can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly lower back. Sort of a dull ache, most of the time. But when I lift somethin’ heavy, or bend over too quick, it can really shoot down my leg. Not all the way to my foot, but… kinda in the back of my thigh. Happens a few times a week, I’d say. It usually gets better if I rest, but… it keeps comin’ back. It’s just a part of the job, I always figured.
DOCTOR: I see. Pain radiating down the leg like that suggests it could be something affecting a nerve. And you’re right to mention it, even if you thought it was just part of the job. We want to rule out anything that needs specific attention. Now, you mentioned fatigue and forgetfulness. Can you describe the forgetfulness a little more?
PATIENT: Well… it's not like… I don’t know who people are, or where I live. It’s more… little things. Like… I’ll go into a room and forget why I went in there. Or someone will tell me somethin’ and I’ll blank on it five minutes later. It's annoyin', mostly. Makes my daughter worry, I think. She keeps askin’ if I’m okay. It’s happened… I dunno, more often in the last year maybe? Hard to say for sure. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Recent onset and fluctuating forgetfulness is something we should definitely investigate. It’s good your daughter is looking out for you. Let's do a quick review of your overall health history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The doc back home, he said my blood pressure was a little high a few years back. Put me on a pill for it. I take it every day, I think. And… I got a bad knee when I was younger, playin’ football. Had surgery on it. Other than that… nothin’ I can really think of. I've never been a sickly man. Mostly just hard work and a few aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a previous knee surgery. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Uh… that's a tough one. It’s… a little white pill. I think it starts with an “A”? Or maybe a “V”? My wife… she always filled the prescription and made sure I had enough. I just take it every mornin’. I honestly can’t remember the name. Sorry. It's kinda embarassin', to be honest. I should probably know.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Cleo. Medications can be tricky to keep track of, and it's perfectly alright that you don’t remember. We can look it up in your records if you've had previous visits documented here, or we can confirm with your pharmacy. Let's move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Never had a bad reaction to anythin'. Sometimes I get a little itchy when I'm around cats, but I don't think that's an allergy. I just... don't like 'em much. My wife loved 'em, though. So we had a few around the house. Never bothered me too bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good to know. And you mentioned your wife… I'm sorry for your loss, if I may ask. It sounds like she played a big role in managing your health. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doc. It’s been a few years now. She was a good woman. Always lookin' after me. Lifestyle… well, I work. Long hours down at the docks. Not much time for fancy things. I used to fish a bit, when I had more energy. And I like to watch the baseball games on TV. I don't drink much anymore, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. I don't smoke. Just… workin' mostly. Simple life.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a hardworking life, and it’s admirable that you've kept active for as long as you have. Now, just to get a full picture, have you noticed any other changes recently, things like weight loss, changes in your appetite, problems with sleep, or any unusual pains or discomfort anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, I think I have lost a little weight. Not a lot, but my clothes feel a bit looser. And I don't have much of an appetite these days, not like I used to. Sleep… I sleep okay, I guess. Maybe not as deep as I used to. I wake up a few times during the night sometimes, but nothin’ major. And my hands… they get kinda stiff in the mornin'. Been thinkin' it’s just arthritis, gettin' old. It’s not too bad, though. Just a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, weight loss, decreased appetite, some sleep disturbances, and morning stiffness in your hands. That gives me a better understanding of what’s going on. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination. Just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and assess the stiffness in your hands and your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine, Doc. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it’s gonna hurt. I'm a tough old sea dog.
DOCTOR: Alright, Cleo. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 145 over 90. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit strong. Your lungs are clear, but you're taking some slightly deeper breaths than usual. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Your reflexes are a bit diminished. Now, let’s check your back. Can you bend forward for me?
PATIENT: Oof. That’s a little uncomfortable, Doc. It feels tight down there. And when I bend back up, it kinda shoots down my leg a little bit. Not too bad, but… noticeable. It always feels worse after I’ve been sittin' for a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. You have some limited range of motion in your lower back, and there is some tenderness to palpation. The pain radiating down your leg, as you mentioned, suggests possible nerve involvement. Your hands also show some mild swelling and stiffness, particularly in the joints. Alright, Cleo. That gives me a good initial picture. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I’m concerned about a few things. Your symptoms could be due to several factors, including a possible lumbar radiculopathy – that's a pinched nerve in your back – as well as some possible osteoarthritis in your hands. The fatigue, weight loss and memory issues are also something we need to investigate further. To get a clearer diagnosis, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin D levels. I'd also like to order an X-ray of your lower back. And, given your recent memory concerns, I think it would be prudent to schedule an MRI of your brain. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Wow. That's… a lot of tests, Doc. Sounds serious. MRI of my brain… I never thought I’d need somethin’ like that. But… if you think it’s necessary, I guess. I trust your judgement. I just… I don’t want a lot of fuss. I just want to feel normal again. Yeah, go ahead with the tests. Whatever you think is best. And… how long will it take to get the results? And will my insurance cover all this?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Cleo. It does seem like a lot, but it's important to rule out any serious underlying causes for your symptoms. The tests will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on, so we can develop the best treatment plan for you. As for the timing, the blood tests should be back within a few days, and the X-ray results usually take 24-48 hours. The MRI will take a little longer, usually 3-5 business days, as it requires a radiologist to review the images. Regarding insurance coverage, we will submit all the tests to your insurance provider. We’ve verified that your plan covers these tests, but there may be some copays or deductibles that you will be responsible for. Our billing department will contact you with any specific cost estimates or payment information. In the meantime, I recommend taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen for the back pain, and continuing to rest and avoid any strenuous activities. I also advise you to write down any new or worsening symptoms you experience. Here are the orders for the lab tests and the MRI. The lab is located just down the street, and the MRI facility is in the medical park. Do you have any questions about the orders, or would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: Okay, that's good to know about the insurance. And I'll try the ibuprofen. My daughter always tells me to take somethin' for the pain. I guess I should listen to her more. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now, Doc. You explained everything pretty clearly. I’ll try to get the tests done as soon as possible. Thank you for takin' the time to listen to me, Doc. I appreciate it. It’s been a long time since someone really listened to what I had to say. I guess… I’ll see you when the results come back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Cleo. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And remember, taking care of your health is a team effort. Don't hesitate to reach out to your daughter for support, and please follow up with me as soon as the results are available. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you soon. .
