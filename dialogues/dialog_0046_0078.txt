DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a little…jumpstart, I suppose. I'm not feeling unwell, exactly, but not well either. Just…blah, for lack of a better word. I’m hoping you can help me figure out what that means, and how to feel more like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Blah” is a perfectly valid description, and it’s good you're seeking to address it. It takes courage to acknowledge when something isn't quite right, even if it's hard to pinpoint. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this feeling?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s…difficult to explain. It’s not a constant thing, you see. Some days are better than others. But generally, I have very little energy. Even getting through the workday is a struggle, and I enjoy my work! I’m a molder, a shaper – I work with clay, mostly. It requires a lot of focus, and frankly, lately my focus has been…wandering. And my sleep isn't the best. I wake up feeling tired, even after a full night. It’s just…a general sense of being worn down, I think. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Low energy, difficulty concentrating, and poor sleep quality – those can all be interconnected. It sounds frustrating to have your energy and focus affected, especially when you enjoy your work so much. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me roughly how long you’ve been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It’s…gradual, you see? It wasn’t a sudden thing. Perhaps… six months, maybe? It started slowly, just a little more tired than usual. Then the focus started to slip. The sleep…that’s been getting worse for the last three or four months, I’d say. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, because it crept up on me. I kept thinking it was just a busy period at work, or stress, but it hasn’t really gone away.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of gradually worsening symptoms, with the sleep issues becoming more prominent in the last three to four months. That’s helpful to know. And you mentioned you initially attributed it to work and stress. Have there been any major life changes or particularly stressful events during that time, besides your work?
PATIENT: Well… hmm. Not major, not in the traditional sense. My daughter, Sofia, just started university. She's always been a very independent young woman, and she's thriving, which is wonderful, of course. But it’s…different, having an empty nest, even a partially empty one. My husband, Ricardo, and I have been married for twenty-five years, and we’re very close. He’s been supportive, absolutely, but he travels a bit for work, so there are times when I’m on my own. I don’t think of it as stressful, exactly, but perhaps…a shift in routine? I’m not sure if that makes sense. Nothing dramatic, just…life changing, in a small way.
DOCTOR: That absolutely makes sense, Ms. Pitzel. Significant life transitions, even positive ones like your daughter starting university, can certainly have an impact on our well-being. Adjusting to new routines and navigating changes in family dynamics can be surprisingly challenging. Now, to get a broader picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Of course. I’ve generally been very healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. No major surgeries, no chronic conditions. I see my dentist regularly, and I had a mammogram last year, which was all clear. My blood pressure is usually good, a little high sometimes, but nothing my doctor was overly concerned about. I have Medicare, so I have regular check-ups, but it's mostly just routine things. My husband has a history of diabetes, but I don’t. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly. Does that help? I'm not very good at remembering details.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. No major medical history, a clear mammogram last year, and generally good health. That’s excellent. And it's good you're proactive about your regular check-ups. Knowing your husband has diabetes is also good information to have. Now, I’d like to ask about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements. Also, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Right, medications. Let me think… I take a multivitamin every day, just a standard one. And occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take ibuprofen. Nothing regular, really. No prescription medications at all. And allergies… hmm. I’m allergic to penicillin, I discovered that when I was a child. It gives me a rash. Apart from that, I don’t have any known allergies. Nothing to food, or pollen, or anything like that. I'm pretty lucky, I suppose. I try to avoid taking anything unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, a daily multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed for headaches, and a penicillin allergy. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle – your diet, exercise habits, and any tobacco or alcohol use. It’s okay if you prefer not to answer anything you’re not comfortable with. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That's perfectly alright. I have no problem answering. I eat a fairly balanced diet, I think. Lots of vegetables, fruit, lean protein. I enjoy cooking, so I usually make meals from scratch. We don't eat a lot of processed food. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps two or three times a week. And as for exercise… well, that’s where I struggle. I used to go for walks regularly, but lately I haven’t been as motivated. I try to stay active, gardening mostly, but it’s not the same. I’ve never smoked, and I don't use any other substances. I suppose I should be more diligent about the exercise, though. It’s just…hard.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Pitzel. A balanced diet with occasional wine, no smoking, and a desire to increase your exercise. It's common for exercise to fall by the wayside when we're feeling less energetic. Now, would you mind if I conducted a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Please, go ahead. I'm ready when you are. I hope it doesn't take too long. I have a pottery class this afternoon. A small one, thankfully, but still. I don't want to be late!
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll keep it as brief as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular and I don't hear any unusual sounds. Your lungs are clear as well, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning given your usual readings. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your thyroid feels normal to the touch. Finally, I’m just going to briefly examine your throat and ears. Everything looks normal in your throat and ears as well. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. However, the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we'll want to keep an eye on.
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear that everything seems normal. I was a little worried it would be something serious. The blood pressure doesn't surprise me, honestly. It sometimes goes up when I’m anxious. I suppose it’s good to know it's not dramatically high. What do you think is going on, Doctor? Do you have any ideas about why I'm feeling so…blah?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Pitzel. Based on what you've told me, and the unremarkable physical exam, it doesn't sound like there's a clear-cut medical explanation for your symptoms. We’ve ruled out some immediate concerns. Several factors could be contributing to how you’re feeling. The life changes you’ve experienced – your daughter starting university, your husband’s travel – can be surprisingly impactful. The lack of consistent exercise and potential for mild stress also play a role. It's possible you're experiencing a combination of factors, perhaps some mild adjustment disorder or even early signs of burnout. To get a clearer picture, and to rule out any underlying medical causes, I’d like to order some blood tests. A complete blood count, a thyroid panel, Vitamin D levels, and a basic metabolic panel will help us assess your overall health and identify any potential deficiencies. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Blood tests seem sensible. I’m happy to have them done. I'd like to know one way or the other, if possible. The thought of burnout… well, that's not surprising. I do pour a lot of energy into my work, and into my family. Perhaps I’m just running on empty. And the idea of a Vitamin D deficiency… I don’t get much sun these days. Alright, let’s do the blood tests. How do we proceed? Do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I agree, a combination of factors is likely, and addressing potential deficiencies is a good first step. Yes, for the basic metabolic panel, you will need to fast for 12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, just water. We can schedule those tests for tomorrow morning at the lab here in the clinic. They’ll send the results to me, and I’ll contact you as soon as they’re available, usually within a few days. In the meantime, I’d like to suggest a few things you can start doing to help improve how you’re feeling. First, try to prioritize some self-care activities. Even small things, like taking a relaxing bath or reading a book, can make a difference. Second, try to incorporate some regular, gentle exercise into your routine, even if it's just a short walk each day. And third, try to get some more sunlight, if possible. Would you like me to provide you with a written list of these suggestions, and a note for the lab regarding the fasting requirement?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please! A written list would be wonderful. My memory isn't what it used to be, as you've probably noticed. And a note for the lab would be very helpful, I wouldn’t want to accidentally ruin the test by forgetting the fasting. Thank you, Doctor Glowka. You’ve been very thorough and reassuring. I feel much better just having a plan of action. Hopefully, we can figure out what's going on and get me feeling like myself again. I appreciate your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. It was my pleasure. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance and a plan of action. I'll print out these notes for you now. Here you are. This includes a list of our discussion points, and a note for the lab regarding the fasting requirement. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We'll review the blood test results together when they’re available, and we can discuss further steps at that time. If your symptoms worsen significantly before then, or if you develop any new symptoms, please contact us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your kindness and attention. I really appreciate it. I suppose I should head off to pottery class now, before I’m late! Have a lovely day, Doctor Glowka.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I’m glad I could help. Enjoy your pottery class! It sounds like a wonderful way to relax and express your creativity. You have a lovely day as well. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. It was lovely meeting you.
