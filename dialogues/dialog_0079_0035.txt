DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it's these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… goodness, I don’t know exactly how long, but a good while now. Not constantly, mind you, but they pop up at the strangest times. It's a bit of a bother, really.
DOCTOR: A bother, yes, I can imagine. And when you say “a good while,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, I believe, right after my grandson, Ben, left for Australia. That was… oh, July 10th, I think? Yes, July 10th. So, maybe three weeks? Give or take a few days. I’m usually quite good with dates, but things do get a bit mixed up sometimes, don't they? Especially when you get to be my age. They aren't constant, like I said. More… come and go. A few here, a few there. Mostly after I eat, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, alright. And they seem to be triggered by eating, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Though not everything I eat. It seems to be… richer foods, I suppose? Like, I had a bit of pavlova last week, and that set them off something fierce! And a nice bit of fish and chips, too. Nothing too spicy, mind you. Just… good, tasty things. Though I've had them even with just a piece of toast sometimes, so it's not a sure thing, you see. It's rather puzzling.
DOCTOR: Puzzling indeed. And apart from the hiccups, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing else at all. Just the hiccups. No pain, no trouble breathing, no… well, nothing else. I'm feeling alright otherwise, actually. Still getting out for my walks, still managing the garden. My appetite is good, even with the hiccups! It's just… annoying, you know? A bit embarrassing, too, when you’re out with friends.
DOCTOR: Alright. No other symptoms, good appetite, maintaining your activities. Now, let’s go over your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, years ago, when I was still living in Fiji, I had a bit of trouble with my gallbladder. Needed to have it removed, that was. Must be… oh, forty years ago now? More than. And I had a touch of pneumonia once, years and years ago. But other than that… no, not really. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting old, I suppose. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, forty years ago, and a bout of pneumonia. And no other significant medical issues?
PATIENT: No, nothing else that I can recall. Though I did have a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. But that healed up just fine. Nothing chronic, nothing ongoing. I try to stay active, you see. Keeps me going. And I eat a good diet, mostly. Oh! And I had my appendix out when I was a young girl, but that was ages and ages ago. Hardly counts now, does it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendix removal, childhood, broken wrist a few years ago, gallbladder removal, forty years ago, and pneumonia. Have you had any surgeries besides those?
PATIENT: No, no other surgeries. Those were all the ones I’ve had, I’m quite sure. I haven’t been one for hospitals, if you know what I mean! I always preferred to stay healthy and avoid them if at all possible. I've always been lucky, I suppose. Not needing a lot of medical attention.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, just the one. I take a small tablet for my blood pressure. The doctor prescribed it a few years back. It's… losartan, I think it’s called? Keeps it nice and steady. Other than that, nothing. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Losartan for blood pressure. And no other medications?
PATIENT: No, that's it. Just the losartan. And I take it every morning, like clockwork. It's a small dose, thankfully. I do take a vitamin D supplement in the winter months, though. Just because the sun isn't as strong, you see. But that's not a medication, is it? Just a little boost.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not a concern. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of! Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had any trouble. I'm not even bothered by mosquito bites, which is a blessing living in this area! No, I don't have any allergies at all.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright, Ms. Sucich. And finally, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. My mother, she had a bit of trouble with her heart later in life. And my brother, he was diagnosed with diabetes a few years back. But other than that… not really. My father was as strong as an ox, lived to be ninety-five. And my grandparents were all pretty healthy, too. It's not a family that's prone to a lot of illness, if you know what I mean. There was an aunt, on my father's side, who had arthritis, but that was a long time ago. It's not a very helpful history, I'm afraid. Mostly healthy people.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, maternal history of heart trouble, brother with diabetes, and aunt with arthritis. Now, before we move on, let me just ask… are there any lifestyle factors that might be contributing to these hiccups?
PATIENT: Lifestyle factors? Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, I do enjoy a little glass of sherry with my dinner sometimes. Nothing too much, mind you, just a small one. And I used to smoke, years ago, but I gave that up ages and ages ago. Decades ago, in fact. And I don’t do a lot of strenuous exercise, but I enjoy my walks, as I said. Mostly just a quiet life, really. Oh! And I do get a little anxious sometimes, if my grandson is traveling. Ben's in Australia, you see, and it's a long way away. But I wouldn't say it's severe anxiety. Just… worrying, you know? A grandmother's worry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Sucich, thank you for providing me with that information. It's… helpful. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever I can to get to the bottom of these hiccups. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’ll just take a look at your throat. Open wide, please. Throat is clear, no obvious signs of irritation or inflammation. And finally, I'll just palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses or organomegaly detected. Alright, Ms. Sucich, everything appears to be normal on physical examination.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was quick! Well, that’s reassuring, isn’t it? Everything sounds alright. So, what do you think it could be, Doctor? These hiccups are still a bit of a bother, you see.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sucich, given your age, your medical history, and the unremarkable physical examination, these hiccups are most likely benign and idiopathic – meaning we don't have a clear cause. It's often just a temporary irritation of the phrenic nerve, which controls the diaphragm. It’s frustrating when there isn’t a clear answer, I understand. However, given the duration, and to rule out anything more serious, I would like to order a chest X-ray and some basic blood work – just a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. This will help us ensure there are no underlying infections, electrolyte imbalances, or other issues contributing to the hiccups. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A chest X-ray and blood work… well, alright, if you think it’s best, Doctor. I don't particularly like going to the hospital, but I trust your judgment. If it will put my mind at ease, then yes, let’s go ahead and do it. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll write you a requisition for both tests. You can have them done at the hospital just down the road. They don't require an appointment. Just take the requisition form with you. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – my receptionist will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, you can try a few things at home. Sipping water slowly, holding your breath for a short period, or eating a teaspoon of sugar. These sometimes help to reset the phrenic nerve. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, Doctor. A teaspoon of sugar… I might try that! My grandmother used to swear by that for everything. And I will definitely try sipping the water slowly. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. You've explained everything very clearly. Just let me know when the results are back. Thank you so much for your time and help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sucich. It was a pleasure meeting you. And don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms or develop any new concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Oh, you too, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I will. Good bye.
