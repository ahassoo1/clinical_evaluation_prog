DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Could you please tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Yes. The… the paper said something about… learning? I don’t really remember. My husband, he made the appointment. Something about… making sure I know things. I work with metal, you know. Lots of… sharp stuff. Is that it?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your husband scheduled this appointment for a cognitive assessment, just to ensure everything is functioning as it should be, particularly given your work with metal and the potential for injury. It’s very proactive of him. To clarify, are you experiencing any difficulties with your memory, concentration, or any changes in your ability to think or process information?
PATIENT: Changes? I… I don’t know. Sometimes I forget where I put my tools. And… names. Lots of names. But everyone forgets names, right? My work is hard. It makes me tired. Maybe that’s it. I don’t feel different. Just… old, sometimes. Is that a change? I don’t know what you mean by “process information”. Explain.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s common to experience occasional forgetfulness, especially with a demanding job like yours. And feeling tired is certainly a reason to investigate. When I say “process information,” I mean things like being able to follow conversations, solve problems, or recall recent events. It’s not about intelligence, but rather how easily and efficiently your brain is working. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed these difficulties with names and tools?
PATIENT: Hmm. Difficulties… It’s been… a while. Maybe a year? Longer? It’s hard to say. Things just… started to feel… fuzzier. Like when you try to remember a dream, but it slips away. I mostly notice it at work. Someone asks me for a wrench, and I… I stare for a moment. Then I find it, usually. My coworkers, they just laugh it off. They say I’m getting old. But… sometimes I worry. Especially with the… cutters. Those are sharp. And… dangerous. Is this bad? Am I going to… forget everything?
DOCTOR: It's good that you're expressing your concerns, Ms. Fontanazza. It's definitely worthwhile to investigate these changes, and it's smart to be cautious, particularly given the nature of your work. Feeling worried is perfectly normal when you're experiencing something new and uncertain. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask you some questions about your past medical history, as well as your family history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Not really. I had the flu once, a long time ago. And… my back hurts sometimes from bending over the metal all day. But that’s just from work. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And… my grandfather, on my father’s side, he… he got confused towards the end. He didn’t know who anyone was. But that was very old. He was like… ninety. That doesn’t count, does it? I don’t really know much about it. My husband handles all that stuff. He says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s helpful to know. Your grandfather's history is relevant, even if it occurred later in life. We're gathering information to get a complete picture. Now, could you tell me a little about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don't take anything. I don't like taking pills. My husband tries to give me something for my back sometimes, but I always refuse. I just… rub it with ointment. And rest. He gets upset when I don’t take them, says I should listen to the doctor. But I feel fine, mostly. Just tired. And forgetful, I guess. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Fontanazza. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, to get a better understanding of your current cognitive function, I'd like to conduct a brief cognitive assessment. This will involve a few simple questions and tasks to assess your memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. It’s nothing to be concerned about, just a standard procedure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tasks? Like… work tasks? I do a lot of tasks. Cutting, bending, welding… I’m good at tasks. But… I don’t want to be bad at your tasks. What if I forget something? My husband will be mad. And… what if it’s something I’m supposed to already know? I don’t want to look stupid. Is it a test? I don't like tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Fontanazza. This isn’t a test, and there are no right or wrong answers. It's not about judging your skills or intelligence. It’s simply a way for me to get a baseline understanding of how your brain is functioning right now. The tasks are very simple – things like remembering a few words, naming objects, and doing some basic calculations. It will take only about 15-20 minutes, and it will help me determine if any further evaluation is needed. We can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Would you like me to explain any of the tasks before we begin?
PATIENT: Fifteen minutes… okay. But you promise it's not a test? And you won't get mad if I forget things? My husband… he gets very frustrated easily. He says I don't pay attention. What kind of words will it be? Hard words? I don't know many fancy words. Can we do it quickly? I have to get back to work. I have a deadline. I don't want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: I absolutely promise it’s not a test, Ms. Fontanazza. And I won't be frustrated if you forget anything at all. Everyone forgets things sometimes, and that’s perfectly normal. We will use very simple, everyday words. No fancy words, I assure you. We can absolutely do it quickly. We’ll move at your pace, and if you need a break, we'll take one. I'm here to help, not to judge. Let’s start with just three words, okay?
PATIENT: Three words… okay. But if I get them wrong, don’t tell my husband. He’ll… he’ll make me do extra chores. What are the words? Quickly, please. I have to finish bending that sheet metal today. It’s a big order. And the boss is already angry.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Fontanazza. Your privacy is very important to me. I will not discuss your results with anyone without your permission. Okay, listen carefully. The first word is “apple.” The second word is “table.” And the third word is “penny.” Now, I’m going to ask you a few unrelated questions, and then I’ll ask you to repeat those three words back to me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Okay. Ask your questions. But… what kind of questions? Are they about math? I’m not good at math. I always mess up the angles. And the measurements. It's very complicated. Hurry, please. My hands are starting to itch. I need to get back to work. I hate being idle.
DOCTOR: No math at all, Ms. Fontanazza. These are just simple, general knowledge questions. Nothing complicated. First question: What is today's date?
PATIENT: Today's date…? Oh dear. Is it… is it Tuesday? No… wait. My husband tells me the days. But I always forget. It’s… August? Yes, it’s August. But what date is it? Ugh. The second… is it the 2nd? I think it's the 2nd. But I'm not sure. I always mix up the dates. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Fontanazza. Dates can be tricky. Don't worry about it. The second question: Can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where… where are we? Oh, goodness. Is this… a doctor’s office? Yes, it’s a doctor’s office. But what city? Is it… the one near the mall? No, not that one. It's… further away. My husband drives. I don't pay attention to where we go. I just look out the window. Is that bad? I’m always getting lost. Even in my own neighborhood! I need to concentrate… I hate feeling like this.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Fontanazza. It's understandable to get confused sometimes. Now, if you can remember, I asked you to repeat three words back to me. Could you tell me what those words were?
PATIENT: Three words… oh dear. This is terrible. I… I can’t remember. I really can’t. I had the words… but they’ve just… disappeared. I think one was a fruit? Like… a banana? No… it wasn't a banana. It was… smaller. Red? No, green! I’m so confused. I feel so stupid. I knew them just a minute ago! My husband is going to be very angry. He always says I have a bad memory. He said I need to concentrate more. But I am trying! I really am! I… I don’t know the words. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Fontanazza. Don’t apologize. It’s perfectly normal to have difficulty recalling things sometimes, especially when you're feeling anxious. Based on this brief assessment, it appears there may be some cognitive changes that warrant further evaluation. I recommend a more comprehensive neuropsychological assessment to get a clearer understanding of your memory and other cognitive functions. I want to assure you that this doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s important to rule out any underlying causes. Would you be open to scheduling an appointment with a neuropsychologist?
PATIENT: A… a neuro… what? Is that another doctor? More tests? I don’t want more tests! My husband is going to be so angry if I tell him I failed the word test. He’ll say I’m useless. He’ll… he’ll make me clean the whole garage! I just want to go home. I have to finish bending that sheet metal. It’s a big order. I don’t want to go to another doctor. I hate doctors. They just poke and prod and ask silly questions. I’m tired. I just want to rest. No, I don't want to see another doctor. Please, can I just go home? I'll try to remember the words. I promise. I'll concentrate harder. Just… let me go home.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, I understand your anxiety and your desire to go home. It’s clear you're feeling overwhelmed, and I respect that. While I strongly recommend the neuropsychological assessment, I won’t force you to do anything you’re not comfortable with. However, I am concerned about the potential for a more serious underlying issue. I would like to at least discuss some resources available to you, such as a referral to a general practitioner for a full medical workup to rule out any other contributing factors. Additionally, I can provide you with information on support groups for individuals experiencing memory difficulties. Would you be open to discussing these options with me?
PATIENT: A general… what? Is that more poking and prodding? No, thank you. I just want to go home. My husband will be very angry if I keep him waiting. He gets very impatient. He’ll say I’m wasting his time. He handles all the doctor stuff anyway. I don’t want to bother him. He’s very busy. And… I don’t want to talk about support groups. I don’t need support. I just need to remember the words! I’ll concentrate harder. I promise. Just… please, can I just go home? I'll try to take better care of myself. I'll get more rest. I'll… I'll try to remember the days of the week. Please. Can I just go? I have to finish bending that sheet metal. It’s a big order. And… I’m tired. Really tired.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, I understand. It’s clear you’re feeling overwhelmed and uncomfortable, and I respect your decision. I won’t push you to do anything you don’t want to do. However, I strongly urge you to discuss your concerns with your husband. It’s important for him to be aware of your anxieties and difficulties, and it’s crucial that you both work together to ensure your well-being. I will document my findings and concerns in your chart, and I will be happy to provide your husband with a summary of our conversation if you give me your permission. For now, I recommend prioritizing rest and minimizing stress. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, or if you become concerned about your safety, please seek medical attention immediately. Here’s a card with my contact information. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. I wish you all the best. You’re free to go home now.
PATIENT: .
