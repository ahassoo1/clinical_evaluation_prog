DOCTOR: Good morning, Yamir. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, yes. I need… check for referee. For sports. Fitness. I think? They said I need this check. For… working.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sports physical, or pre-participation exam. That’s perfectly alright. It sounds like your employer or a sports league requires a check-up before you begin. To make sure we cover everything, let's start with a little more detail. What sport or type of fitness activity are you planning to participate in?
PATIENT: Referee. Basketball. High school games. I… fix the… the court things. And… tell players. You know. Not play. Fix and tell. That’s all. It’s… important to be okay, I guess. They want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re a basketball referee – ensuring fair play and the safety of the players, not a player yourself. That’s very important work! And yes, it is important to be in good health for that. It requires a good deal of stamina and quick reactions. To get started, let’s go through a quick history. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past – anything that’s required hospitalization or ongoing treatment?
PATIENT: Hospital… not really. Years ago, maybe. When I was small. Broken arm. Playing… never mind. Nothing now. I… my wife… she took care of everything. Now… just little things. Sometimes back hurts from bending. From work. But not big. Not hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child and occasional back pain from work – that's helpful to know. So, no major ongoing medical conditions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat… everything. Well, not spicy. But not allergy. Wife… she always asked. I always said no. She… checked. Very careful.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. It sounds like your wife is very thorough, which is excellent. And you don’t have any known medication allergies, that’s important. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. She… she had the pills. For her. But I… never take anything. Just water. Sometimes tea. That’s all. Really. No pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications at all. That simplifies things. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your immediate family – parents, siblings – has any significant medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or cancer?
PATIENT: My… father. Heart. Years ago. Very sick. He… didn’t… take care. My mother… she was okay. Just old. My sister… she lives far away. I don’t know. We don’t talk much. She probably okay too. Nothing big. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father had heart disease, and your mother was generally healthy. It's alright that you don't have detailed information about your sister’s health. Knowing about your father is helpful. Now, let’s briefly touch on your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. No smoking. Never. My wife… she didn’t like. Alcohol… sometimes beer. Very little. Special occasion. That’s all. Never… other things. Never. I work. I fix. That’s enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you don’t smoke, you drink very little alcohol on occasion, and you don’t use any recreational drugs. That’s excellent. And your work keeps you busy. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, are you experiencing any current symptoms – anything at all that’s bothering you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Just… tired. Sometimes. After work. Long day. Bending, fixing… hard. And… lonely. But… that’s not… medical. Just tired. And… back hurts sometimes, like I said. Not bad. Just… old. I think. Is that enough? Can we… finish?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Yamir. Feeling tired after work and occasional back pain are good things to mention. We'll definitely address those. And it's alright to acknowledge feeling lonely – while that's not a medical issue we'll treat directly today, it's important to be aware of your overall well-being. Let’s do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of how things are. I'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your back and joints. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Blood pressure… okay. Quick is good. I… have things to do. After this. So quick is good. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. We'll be as efficient as possible. Please have a seat on the exam table. Okay, your blood pressure is 128/78, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your temperature is 98.6, also normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay. Breathing. I will breathe. My wife… she always said I breathe too loud. But I am breathing. Okay. Is everything okay? Can I sit up now?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles detected. Everything sounds good so far. Yes, you can sit up whenever you're ready. Now, I’m going to gently examine your back. Could you please bend forward slightly and touch your toes, if you're comfortable?
PATIENT: Ow. A little bit. Not very far. Old. Like I said. It’s… the bending. Long day. Is that bad? Should I stop?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There's some tenderness in your lower back, particularly on the left side. It doesn't appear to be anything acute, but it does indicate some muscle strain. It's not necessarily something you need to stop doing immediately, but we'll want to address it to prevent it from getting worse. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and range of motion in your legs. Just relax, and I’ll let you know what to do.
PATIENT: Okay. Relax. I… try to relax. But… work is hard. Always bending. And… lonely. But relax. I will try. Do what you need. Quick is good.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Your range of motion is slightly limited in your lower back, as expected, but otherwise good. There's no sign of any neurological issues. Based on what we’ve discussed and the physical exam, it appears you have some muscle strain in your lower back, likely related to the physical demands of your work. It’s not an emergency, but it’s important to manage it to prevent further injury and discomfort. Do you have any questions for me before we discuss a plan?
PATIENT: A plan? Okay. Plan is good. No… not really. Just… can I go to work? Is it okay to keep working? I need to work. Is it bad if I just… ignore it? Like I always do?
DOCTOR: You can continue to work, but ignoring it isn’t the best approach. It could lead to a more significant injury that takes longer to heal. We want to avoid that. Here’s what I recommend. First, let’s try some over-the-counter pain relief – ibuprofen or naproxen can help reduce inflammation and discomfort. Second, gentle stretching exercises can improve your flexibility and strengthen your back muscles. I can provide you with a handout detailing some appropriate stretches. Third, be mindful of your posture and lifting techniques at work. And finally, if the pain doesn't improve after a week or two, or if it gets worse, please come back, and we can consider other options, like physical therapy. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay. Pain pills. Stretching. Careful. Yes. I can try. Stretching… I forget things. Can you… write it down? Please? For me to remember. And… thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. I… just want to work. And… not hurt.
DOCTOR: Of course. Here you go. This handout includes illustrations and detailed instructions for some gentle stretches you can do at home. It also has some tips for lifting properly at work – keep your back straight, bend your knees, and avoid twisting. I’m happy to help. It’s important to take care of your health so you can continue to work and enjoy your life. We’ll also put a note in your chart about the back pain. Do you have any other questions or concerns for me today?
PATIENT: No. I think that is all. Pain pills. Stretching. Careful. Write it down. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You are very good. I… I should go now. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Yamir. I’m glad I could help. Remember to take it easy, listen to your body, and don’t hesitate to come back if you have any concerns. Have a good day as well, and please take care of yourself. .
