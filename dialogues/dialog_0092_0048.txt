DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Giganti, you said? Yes, well, it’s… troublesome. I’ve been having these little… spells, I guess you’d call them. Moments where I just… don’t quite know where I am, or what I’m doing. It’s not all the time, thankfully. My wife, she’s been noticing it more than I have, to be honest. She insisted I come.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Lason. It’s good that your wife is looking out for you, and it's certainly wise to get these things checked out. “Spells” is a good way to describe it. To help me understand a bit better, could you tell me more about these moments?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I faint or anything dramatic. It’s more… a blankness. Like a few minutes just… disappear. I might be in the middle of something – fixing a tile, or making coffee – and then suddenly I’m looking around and I can’t remember what I was doing. Or I’ll be talking to someone, and the words just… stop. Then I sort of snap back, and I usually know who I'm with, but not necessarily why I was talking to them. It’s frustrating, really. And embarrassing. I've always had a good memory for details, you know? Especially with the tile work… measurements, patterns, everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Lason. It sounds unsettling to experience those gaps in your memory, especially when you're usually so sharp. And it’s good you’re able to recognize the changes. To get a clearer picture, let’s try to pinpoint some details. Roughly how long have these episodes been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? At first, it was just once in a while, maybe once a month. I’d chalk it up to being tired, or not getting enough sleep. But in the last couple of months, it’s been happening more frequently. Now it’s… at least once a week. Sometimes more, if I'm really busy. My wife keeps a calendar now, writing down when she notices them. Honestly, it’s a bit insulting, but she says she wants to be accurate.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Lason, and it’s good your wife is keeping track. Increasing frequency is definitely something we need to investigate. Now, when these episodes happen, do you experience any other symptoms at the same time?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. No… no dizziness, not usually. Sometimes a bit of a headache afterwards, but that could just be from the stress of having the episode, you know? I wouldn’t say it's a proper headache, more like a… pressure. And… now that I think about it, sometimes my vision gets a little blurry right before it happens. Just for a moment. But it’s hard to say if that’s related. It happens when I've been staring at tile grout for too long, so I always dismissed it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. A little pressure and blurry vision are good things to note. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my prostate acting up a few years back, but that was taken care of. Nothing major. High blood pressure, the doctor told me, but it's been under control with medication for… oh, must be fifteen years now. And I broke my wrist a long time ago, when I was still learning the trade, but that healed fine. Otherwise… no. I’ve always been a strong, healthy man. Worked hard my whole life. I don't go to the doctor unless absolutely necessary, to be frank.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Lason. Knowing you have a history of high blood pressure, even if it’s controlled, is important. And I understand not wanting to come to the doctor unless needed. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Yes, I take a pill every morning. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Small white one. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back. Tile work is hard on the body, you know? But just when it’s really bothering me. Not every day. And… that’s it. Really. I don’t believe in filling my body with unnecessary things.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Lisinopril is helpful to know. And occasional ibuprofen is good to be aware of. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. My wife always asks me that question, and I always tell her the same thing. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things, no problems. Dust, maybe, when I’m cutting tile, but that’s not an allergy, just common sense to wear a mask.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My parents… they both lived long lives, but they didn’t really go to the doctor much either. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. But she didn’t talk about it much. My father… he just got old, mostly. A bit of arthritis. My sister… she had diabetes, but she lived in Phnom Penh and I haven’t seen her in years. So… not really. Nothing significant, that I know of.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful, Mr. Lason. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean by that? I’ve been married to my wife, Srey, for forty years. We have two grown children, both living nearby. I work six days a week, laying tile. I like to watch Khmer dramas on television in the evenings. I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. And I don’t smoke. Is that what you want to know? I’m a simple man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Lason, that is exactly what I want to know. Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you have a full and active life. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Well… I suppose. I’m not a fan of doctors poking around, but if you think it’s necessary… alright. But don’t expect much. I’m a practical man, not a delicate flower. Just tell me what you’re doing as you go along, alright? And don't take too long, I have a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I'll explain everything as I go along, and we'll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a very faint murmur. It’s likely benign, but something to note. Lungs are clear. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Reflexes are normal. Your balance seems good. Coordination is normal. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, I’d like to check your gait and observe you walking. Would you mind walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it over with. Walking a few steps… no problem. But don't expect me to do any fancy dancing. I’m a tile setter, not a gymnast. There. Done. Is that enough walking for you? I have tiles to lay, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. You have a slightly wide-based gait, but nothing overly concerning. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, the episodes you’re experiencing, along with the slightly elevated blood pressure and the faint heart murmur, could be a few things. It could be related to medication side effects, fluctuations in blood pressure, or something more neurological. It’s still too early to say for certain. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests and an EKG to check your heart function. I’d also recommend a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Of my brain? Now hold on a minute. That sounds… serious. What are you looking for, exactly? And all those tests… will they cost a lot of money? My Medicare… it doesn't cover everything, you know. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding, but I don’t want to end up with a bill the size of a house.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. It’s perfectly reasonable to be worried about the cost and the implications of these tests. A CT scan allows us to look for any signs of stroke, tumor, or other structural abnormalities that could be causing your episodes. It’s a precautionary measure to rule out anything serious. The blood tests will give us a baseline of your overall health, check your kidney and liver function, and rule out any electrolyte imbalances. The EKG is a simple test that records the electrical activity of your heart to ensure it's functioning normally. I’ll have my nurse check with Medicare to determine your coverage for each test. We can also discuss alternatives if the costs are prohibitive. It’s important to get to the bottom of this, but we’ll work within your financial means. Would you like me to explain any of the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Alright… explaining it more wouldn’t hurt, I suppose. I don’t understand all this medical jargon. So, this CT scan… is it painful? Will I have to lie in one of those narrow tubes? My wife always complains about those things. And what about the blood tests? Do you need a lot? I don’t like needles. And the EKG… is that the one with the sticky things on my chest? I saw it on television once. Honestly, Doctor, it all sounds very… unsettling. Just tell me, straight and simple, what each one involves, and how long it will take. And the cost, of course. That’s the most important thing.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Lason. Let’s break it down, straight and simple. CT Scan: This involves lying on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It's not narrow like an MRI, it’s more open. It doesn't hurt, but you'll need to lie very still for a few minutes while the machine takes pictures. We can provide a mild sedative if you’re feeling anxious. It will likely take about 30-45 minutes in total. Blood Tests: Yes, it involves a needle, unfortunately. We’ll need about two vials of blood, drawn from your arm. It’s a quick procedure, usually less than five minutes. EKG: You're right, it involves sticky pads called electrodes placed on your chest, arms, and legs. These pads record your heart’s electrical activity. It's painless and takes only about ten minutes. As for the cost, my nurse will contact Medicare and give you a clear estimate before proceeding with any tests. We can also discuss a payment plan if needed. I want to assure you that we'll do everything we can to make this process as comfortable and stress-free as possible. These tests are just a precaution, and hopefully, we'll find nothing serious. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Alright… that doesn’t sound too bad, I suppose. Not the narrow tube, that’s good. And a sedative… maybe. Depends on how nervous I am. My wife will have to come with me, definitely. She’s better at dealing with doctors than I am. So, the nurse will call Medicare… and then what? Do I have to make an appointment for all these tests? And where do I go? This clinic is a little crowded as it is. I’m still worried about the cost, but if the nurse can sort that out… alright. Let’s see what Medicare says first. And make sure they know I have to get back to work, you know? I can’t be away for days.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad to hear you’re feeling a little more comfortable with the plan. Yes, my nurse, Maria, will contact Medicare right away to determine your coverage and estimated costs. Once she has that information, she’ll schedule appointments for you. The tests can be done at the imaging center across the street – it’s a separate facility, more spacious and less crowded than the clinic. They’re very efficient. We’ll try to get everything scheduled as quickly as possible, taking your work schedule into account. We can also arrange for a ride if needed. The whole process should take no more than a couple of hours, and we’ll keep you informed every step of the way. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions before we conclude today's consultation?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Just let Maria call about the Medicare. And make sure the appointments are in the morning, if possible. I need to get back to work, you know. Tile work doesn’t lay itself. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you to your nurse, Maria. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious. I suppose I’ll be seeing you again soon, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lason. I understand the importance of getting back to work. I’ll make a note to have Maria schedule the appointments for the morning. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this quickly and efficiently. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Thank you for coming in today. We’ll see you soon.
