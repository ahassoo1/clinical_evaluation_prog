DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, it's nice to meet you too. Right, well... it's about getting surgery. Weight loss surgery. My wife, she helped me set up the appointment. Honestly, I don't remember all the details, but it's... for my health, I guess? I know I need to lose weight.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Kochubey. It takes courage to address these concerns. It’s perfectly alright if you don't recall all the specifics – that’s what I’m here for. Just to clarify, your wife scheduled this appointment specifically to discuss weight loss surgery options?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. She did a lot of the research and talking to people, I think. I just... agreed it was a good idea. She's really good at that stuff. I'm not very good at remembering things, to be honest. Is this… is this a long process?
DOCTOR: That's quite alright, Mr. Kochubey. Many patients find the process a bit overwhelming, and it's wonderful that you have your wife's support. And yes, it is a process. It involves a thorough evaluation to determine if you're a suitable candidate for surgery, and preparation both before and after. To start, let's gather some information. I'll be asking you some questions about your medical history, current health, and lifestyle. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Questions are good. I guess... what do you want to know first? I'll try my best to remember, but like I said, it’s not always easy.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let's begin with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. I think the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once, a few years ago. But I don’t remember taking anything for it long-term. And… I think my wife mentioned something about my sugar levels being a bit off, but I didn't really pay attention. I’ve never been told I had anything with my heart. Does that make sense? It's all a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Kochubey. It's common for details to be a little unclear. So, to clarify, you recall being told your blood pressure was elevated at some point, and your wife mentioned potential concerns with your blood sugar. We'll need to verify those with some testing. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Never been in the hospital. No surgeries… wait. I broke my arm when I was a kid, maybe eight years old? But that was… a long time ago. That doesn't really count, does it? It healed up fine.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t count, Mr. Kochubey. We’re looking for more significant surgical procedures or hospital stays as an adult. Good to know about the broken arm, though. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… um… My dad, he had… heart problems. I think. He passed away when I was pretty young. And my mom, she… she had diabetes, I think. Yeah, definitely diabetes. She had to take shots all the time. I don't know much about anyone else, honestly. My family, we aren’t very close. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Mr. Kochubey. Knowing about your father’s heart problems and your mother’s diabetes is important. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's talk a bit about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Never even tried it. My wife, she wouldn't allow it. She’s very health-conscious. I do… I drink sometimes. A few beers on the weekend. Nothing too crazy. I used to drink more, but I cut back.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kochubey. That's good to know. And how about exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise… Not much, honestly. I used to walk a little bit, but I haven’t been doing that lately. I work a lot of hours at the store, and when I get home, I’m pretty tired. I mostly just sit. I know I should do more. My wife says the same thing.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to find it difficult to prioritize exercise with a demanding work schedule. And it’s good you’re aware of the importance of it. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Uh… that's a tough one. I eat a lot of… fast food. When I'm at work, it's easy. Burgers, fries, that kind of thing. My wife tries to cook healthy meals when she can, but I don't always have a big appetite. And sometimes… sometimes I just grab something on the way home. It’s not very good, I know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for your honesty, Mr. Kochubey. It's helpful for me to have a clear understanding of your current habits. Alright, let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had a reaction to anything. I mean, I'm allergic to dust, maybe? Like, I sneeze a lot, but that’s just normal, right? Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing right now. I used to take something for heartburn, a long time ago. But I stopped. It didn't really seem to help, and my wife said it wasn’t good to take stuff like that all the time. That’s all, I think. Unless… does vitamins count? I take a multivitamin sometimes, but not every day.
DOCTOR: Yes, vitamins do count. Thank you for letting me know. Alright, Mr. Kochubey, that gives me a good overview of your medical history and current health. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I hope it doesn't take too long, though. I have to get back to the store later.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It won't take long. First, I'll check your height and weight. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. I’ll also palpate your abdomen. Alright, your height is 155 centimeters, and your weight is 139 kilograms. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with some mild obesity noted. Do you have any discomfort when I press here, on your abdomen?
PATIENT: No, that’s okay. Doesn’t hurt. Just feels… normal, I guess. Like you said, a little bit of a tummy. I haven't really paid attention to it, to be honest. My wife worries about it more than I do.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything feels within normal limits. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health and to determine if you are a good candidate for weight loss surgery, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will check your blood sugar levels, cholesterol, liver function, and other important markers. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever tests you think I need. When can I get those done? I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have to work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can draw the blood right here in the clinic today. It will only take a few minutes. The results should be back in about 3-5 business days. We'll contact you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. While we’re waiting for the results, I also recommend a consultation with a registered dietitian. They can help you develop a healthy eating plan, which is an important part of the weight loss process. Would you be interested in a referral to a dietitian?
PATIENT: Yeah, a dietitian sounds good. If my wife thinks it’s a good idea, then I’m happy to try it. She’s really good at finding people like that. Can you just… give her the information? She handles all that stuff for me. I don't remember names or numbers very well.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kochubey. I will provide your wife with the contact information for a few registered dietitians in the area. To summarize, we’ve drawn some blood today, and I've arranged a referral to a registered dietitian, which I’ll give to your wife. Once the blood results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your options further. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very helpful, Doctor. Honestly, I'm just glad to be getting this sorted out. It's been hanging over my head for a while.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please give my best to your wife. .
