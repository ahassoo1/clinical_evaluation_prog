DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Honestly, I just… well, a friend suggested I look into this PrEP thing. She said it's good to be careful, you know? I’m not really sure all the details, that’s why I’m here. I want to understand what it is and if it's right for me. I don't want to waste your time, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Trefren. It’s excellent that you’re being proactive about your health and seeking information. It's never a waste of time to discuss preventative measures. PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis – is a very good topic to explore. It’s a medication taken to prevent HIV infection, and it's a perfectly legitimate reason to be seen. To best advise you, I’d like to gather some information. Would you mind if I ask you a few questions about your medical history and lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, that makes sense. “Pre-exposure prophylaxis” – that's a mouthful! But yeah, ask away, Doctor. I’ll answer what I can. I don’t really have a complicated medical history, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, I guess. And… well, I’m single, haven’t been with anyone long-term in a while. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It absolutely does matter, Ms. Trefren, and thank you for sharing that. It helps me understand your risk factors. The “usual aches and pains” are good to note as well; we want a full picture. To clarify, when you say “single,” are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Not regularly, but… occasionally. It’s not like a committed thing, just… when it happens. Look, it’s a little embarrassing to talk about, but I want to be honest so you can give me the best advice, okay? I just… want to be safe. It’s harder getting older and meeting people, and you hear stories, you know? It’s scary.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Trefren. Your honesty is very much appreciated, and you have no reason to be embarrassed. It's responsible to discuss these things openly, and you're right to be thinking about safety. It's better to be informed and prepared. To get a clearer understanding of your risk, could you tell me a little more about the nature of these encounters?
PATIENT: Well… they’re usually just… casual. Met online, or through friends of friends. It’s not like I’m going to parties every weekend or anything. And I always… try to use protection. But you never really know the other person, right? That’s the scary part. I guess I worry about… well, everything. STIs, obviously, but… I just want to be careful. This friend of mine, she said PrEP could take a lot of that worry away. Is that true?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Ms. Trefren, and you're right to think proactively. Your friend is correct; PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV infection, and can significantly reduce your anxiety about sexual encounters. It does require a prescription and regular follow-up, including testing, but it’s a very safe and well-studied medication. Before we discuss if PrEP is right for you, I’d like to go through a bit of your medical history and a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any known allergies. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that's it. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And… oh! I used to take something for heartburn, but I stopped a few years ago. It didn't really help much anyway. I’m generally pretty healthy, honestly. I try to eat right and walk when I can, you know? Just getting old is the hardest part.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Ms. Trefren. Staying active and mindful of your health is wonderful. Lisinopril is good to know – thank you for mentioning that. Now, to get a complete picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses, like diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, never. Doctors always tell me my cholesterol is a little high, but it’s not bad enough to need medication, they say. And I had a really bad flu a few years back, but I recovered fully. Honestly, that’s about it. I'm pretty lucky, health-wise. I’ve always been a bit of a worrier, so I go to the doctor regularly, just to make sure everything’s okay. My mother… she had some trouble with her kidneys when she got older. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t think I inherited anything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about your cholesterol and the regular check-ups. And thank you for mentioning your mother’s kidney issues; it’s helpful to have that family history information. Knowing about potential predispositions is important. Now, let's move on to past surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Nothing major, ever. I broke my arm when I was a kid – a silly fall from a tree – but that’s it. Just a cast for a few weeks. And I had my tonsils out when I was young, but that was ages ago. I'm not really a surgical person, if that makes sense. I avoid hospitals whenever possible. They just smell… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Trefren. Most people prefer to avoid hospitals if they can! No surgeries to worry about is excellent. Now, to complete the history, let’s discuss your family history a bit further. Besides your mother’s kidney issues, are there any other significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father… he had high blood pressure, like me. And he had a stroke when he was older, unfortunately. My sister… she has asthma, but that’s about it. Oh! And my grandmother, on my mother's side, she had cancer. Lung cancer, I think. But that was a long time ago, and she smoked, so… I try not to worry too much about things I can’t control. It’s scary thinking about all of it, honestly. You start to feel like you’re waiting for something bad to happen.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Ms. Trefren. It’s natural to feel anxious when considering family history. Knowing these details helps us assess your risk and tailor a preventative plan. So, to summarize: your father had high blood pressure and a stroke, and your grandmother had lung cancer. Now, let's talk a little about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. Tried it once when I was young, didn't like it. I used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. Just didn't enjoy it anymore. And definitely no drugs. Never been interested in that sort of thing. I prefer a good cup of tea, honestly. And a good book. Much safer hobbies.
DOCTOR: Excellent choices, Ms. Trefren! Tea and books are wonderful and certainly much safer. Now, just a few more questions to complete your history. To clarify, when you say you are sexually active, could you tell me how many partners you’ve had in the last six months?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Um… well, it’s not a lot. Maybe three? It’s hard to keep track, honestly. Like I said, it’s not regular. And I always use protection. It’s just… sometimes you meet someone, and it happens. I'm not a promiscuous person, if that makes sense. I just… want to be careful. This is a little embarrassing, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Trefren. It's perfectly normal to have questions and concerns, and you're being very honest. Three partners in the last six months is good to know. And using protection is excellent. Now, to get a clearer picture of your risk, have you ever been tested for sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I had a full panel done a few years back, just to be safe. And I had another one done last year, after meeting someone new. Everything came back clear, thankfully. It’s just… you never really know, do you? Even with protection, even with testing. That’s why I’m here, talking to you. My friend said PrEP could give me some peace of mind. Is that realistic?
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear that you've been tested previously and everything came back clear. And yes, you are absolutely right, even with protection and testing, there is always a level of risk. PrEP can absolutely provide peace of mind, Ms. Trefren. It's highly effective at preventing HIV infection, reducing your risk to nearly zero when taken as prescribed. Before we discuss whether it’s right for you, I would like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon, so I don’t want to be here all day. Just… a quick exam is fine, please. I’m not really a fan of doctors, if you haven’t noticed.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Trefren. I understand completely. We’ll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic physical assessment. First, let's check your blood pressure. 130 over 80. That's slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to briefly palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Everything feels normal. Okay, that completes the basic physical exam. Do you have any questions about what I just did?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. It wasn’t as bad as I expected, actually. You were very gentle. So… what does this mean? Is PrEP right for me? I'm just so tired of worrying. If this can help, I’m willing to try it. As long as it doesn’t have a lot of side effects. I hear those medications can be… rough on your system. Is it expensive? I’m on Medicare, so I’m not sure what it would cover.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Ms. Trefren. I always strive to make my patients as comfortable as possible. Based on your history and the physical exam, you are a good candidate for PrEP. You are sexually active with multiple partners, and you've expressed a desire to reduce your risk of HIV infection. As for side effects, PrEP is generally very well-tolerated. The most common side effects are mild – nausea, fatigue, or diarrhea – and they usually resolve within a few weeks. Rare but more serious side effects can occur, so regular monitoring with blood tests is essential. Regarding cost, Medicare does cover PrEP, but there may be co-pays or deductibles depending on your specific plan. I can write you a prescription and we can have the pharmacy check your coverage, or I can connect you with a financial assistance program if needed. Before we proceed, I will need to order some baseline blood tests to check your kidney function and screen for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Kidney function, HIV, everything. Whatever you need. I just want to get this done. I'm tired of worrying every time I meet someone new. Blood tests, prescription… let’s do it. And thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I feel a lot better already, just knowing that there's something I can do. How soon can I start taking it, if the tests come back okay?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad I could help. I will write the orders for the blood tests now. You can have those done at the lab across the hall. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once we confirm the results are normal, you can start taking PrEP immediately. The medication is taken daily as a single pill. It’s important to take it consistently to be effective. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to check your blood work again and ensure you’re tolerating the medication well. Here are the lab orders, and here’s a pamphlet about PrEP with more detailed information. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Kalinski. You've been very patient and understanding. I really appreciate it. I'm glad I came in. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Trefren. I'm glad you came in as well. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a wonderful day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
