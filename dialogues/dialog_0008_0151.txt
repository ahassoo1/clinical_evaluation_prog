DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… this tingling. In my hands, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s… well, it’s annoying. I’m Teretha, by the way. Just Teretha is fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, Teretha. Annoying tingling, got it. And how long is "a little while" exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… three, four weeks now? It comes and goes, you know? Some days it's barely noticeable, other days it feels like my fingers are… asleep, but not really. It’s hard to explain. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. Comes and goes for three or four weeks… and does anything specific seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: You know, that’s a good question. I hadn't really thought about it. Let me think… carrying the mail, definitely. Especially when it’s cold out. It seems worse then. And… when I’m doing a lot of cooking, maybe? Holding a knife for a long time. But honestly, it just happens sometimes. It’s not like I can pinpoint anything. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, thank you. So, aggravated by carrying things, and prolonged gripping… Okay. And is this tingling just in your hands, or does it travel up your arms, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Mostly just my hands, Doctor. Sometimes it goes up my forearm a little bit, but not very far. It doesn’t go to my elbows or anything. And it's usually just the palms and fingers. It feels… prickly, almost. Not painful, just… weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, prickly tingling in the palms and fingers, occasionally extending up the forearm. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands, like difficulty gripping things, or opening jars?
PATIENT: No, not really. I can still do everything, thankfully. I’m a mail carrier, I have to be able to grip things! I carry a pretty heavy bag, you know? It’s just the tingling is… distracting. Makes me worry I’m going to drop something important.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know you haven't noticed any weakness. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know? My husband… he had some problems with his heart, but I don't have any of that. I just try to keep busy, keep moving.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, but that was… a long time ago! And I broke my wrist once, falling on the ice, but it healed up just fine. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother had some trouble with her hands too, when she got older. Something with the joints, I think. She didn’t go to the doctor much though, so I don’t really know what it was. My father was healthy as a horse until the very end.
DOCTOR: Okay, some hand issues in your mother. And what about any allergies to medications, or any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. And I don’t take anything regularly. Maybe some ibuprofen for a headache now and then, but that’s it. I really try to avoid pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, no allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your hands and arms, if that’s alright. Just to see what’s going on. We'll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just… please be gentle? My hands are how I make a living, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your arm. And squeeze my hand as tightly as you can… good. Now the other side… alright. And I'm going to lightly touch your fingers with this… tell me when you feel it. Let's start with this finger... Can you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. It’s a little… faint, maybe? Not as strong as it usually is. Like… it’s a little numb.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about this finger… feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that one too. Same thing. Not strong. Like… when my husband used to tickle me, you know? I could tell exactly where he was touching me, but this… it’s more blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay. And one more finger… Can you feel that?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don’t think so. Not really. I can feel something, but it’s… hard to explain. Like a dull pressure, not a specific touch.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you feel this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I can’t. Nothing at all on that one. It’s… worrying, isn’t it? I mean, I need my hands! What's happening?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, some diminished sensation in a couple of your fingers, and complete loss of sensation in one. It looks like you have some mild weakness in your grip as well. Based on this exam, it sounds like you might have some compression of a nerve in your wrist – likely Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. It’s quite common, especially with repetitive hand movements. However, to be sure, I'd like to order a Nerve Conduction Study. That’ll help us pinpoint exactly which nerve is affected and how severe the compression is. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Carpal Tunnel… I’ve heard of that. My sister had something like that. A Nerve Conduction Study… does that hurt? I don’t like needles, you know.
DOCTOR: It involves small electrodes placed on your skin, and brief, mild electrical stimulation. It doesn’t usually cause significant pain, just a tingling sensation. It's more uncomfortable than painful. Think of it like a brief, slightly odd zap. It's a very helpful test though, and will give us a clear picture of what's going on. If it is Carpal Tunnel, we have several treatment options - wrist splints, physical therapy, and in some cases, injections or surgery. We can discuss all of those options once we have the results of the test. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… a “brief, odd zap” sounds better than a needle. Wrist splints… I can probably manage that. Surgery… no, I definitely don’t want surgery if I can avoid it. So, this test will tell us for sure if it’s Carpal Tunnel? And then we can try the splints first?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. The Nerve Conduction Study will help confirm the diagnosis. And if it is Carpal Tunnel, we’ll start with the least invasive options – likely a wrist splint and some exercises to strengthen your hand and wrist. We’ll monitor your symptoms and see how you respond. If those don't provide enough relief, we can discuss other options. I’ll write you a referral for the study. It’s done at the imaging center down the street. They'll call you to schedule an appointment. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Thank you. A splint and exercises… I can try that. I just want to be able to keep working. I don’t know what I’d do if I couldn't deliver the mail. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or watching out for? I don't want it to get any worse.
DOCTOR: Good. It’s good to be proactive. In the meantime, try to avoid activities that aggravate your symptoms – prolonged gripping, repetitive movements, and anything that puts pressure on your wrists. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen if you're experiencing any discomfort. If you notice any significant weakness, numbness that spreads up your arm, or any pain that doesn't respond to over-the-counter medication, please call the office immediately. We want to catch any potential complications early. I’ll also have the nurse print out some information about Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and exercises you can do. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Thank you for not dismissing me. Some doctors don’t listen very well, you know? Just… a splint and exercises, and try not to make it worse. I can manage that. I guess that’s it. I should get going, I have a route to finish. Thank you again, Doctor Cumper. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teretha. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And take care of yourself!
