DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Emiliano. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my foot is… bothering me. A lot. It’s a sore, you see. A bad sore that won’t get better. It’s on my foot, and it’s quite painful when I walk. I've had… problems with the sugar, the doctor told me years ago. Maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Emiliano. It's good to know a little about what's been going on. You mentioned problems with your sugar—do you have a diagnosis of diabetes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I do. The doctor told me a long time ago, maybe… twenty years now? Something like that. He put me on pills, but… well, I forget to take them sometimes. Old age, you know? And I eat… I like sweet things. Not good, I suppose. But I try to be careful.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emiliano. It can be difficult to manage diabetes, and remembering medications is often a challenge. And sweet foods are certainly tempting! When you say "sometimes," about how often would you estimate you miss taking your pills?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… I don’t know exactly. Maybe… three or four times a week? Sometimes more. It depends. If I go visit my daughter, I forget. Or if I have a friend over for tea. It just slips my mind, you know? I don’t mean to, but… it happens. I should be better, I know. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not about being "bad," Emiliano, it’s just important to be aware of it. Missing doses can definitely affect your blood sugar levels, and that can sometimes contribute to problems like foot sores, especially with diabetes. Now, can you tell me a little more about this sore on your foot?
PATIENT: Oh. So it is because of the sugar? I thought so. The sore… it’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It’s… red. And it’s not big, but it hurts. A lot when I put my weight on it. It’s been there for… a few weeks now, maybe a month? I tried putting a bandage on it, but it doesn’t seem to be helping. Sometimes it feels… warm. Is that good or bad? I don’t know what to do anymore. I like to walk, you see. I go to the park with my friends, but now I can’t really go. It makes me sad.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I appreciate you sharing all of that with me. It’s good that you’re paying attention to it, and it's certainly possible the sore is related to your diabetes. The warmth you’re feeling is something we’ll want to check more closely, as it could indicate an infection. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, would you mind if I took a look at your foot?
PATIENT: Oh, an infection? That sounds… not good. Yes, of course, Doctor. Please, look at it. Whatever you need to do. I just want it to feel better. I haven’t been sleeping very well because of the pain. It’s on this foot, here. Be careful, please. It’s quite sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emiliano. I see the sore here, on the bottom of your foot near your toes. It’s about half an inch in diameter, and the skin around it is a little red and inflamed. There is some warmth to the touch, as you mentioned, and when I gently press on it, you flinch. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: Hmm… numbness… let me think. Sometimes. Not all the time. More in the evenings, I think. Especially after I walk. It feels… like pins and needles, maybe? Not a sharp pain, just… a strange feeling. And my toes feel… cold sometimes, even when the rest of my foot is warm. Does that make sense? I don't know if it's the sugar, or just old age. Everything feels a little strange these days, you know? It's hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Emiliano. The numbness, tingling, and coldness in your feet are all consistent with what we call diabetic neuropathy – nerve damage caused by high blood sugar levels over time. It sounds like you're experiencing some of those symptoms. To get a better understanding of the extent of the nerve damage and to rule out any infection, I'd like to order a couple of tests. First, a simple blood test to check your current blood sugar levels and kidney function. Second, a nerve conduction study, which is a painless test that measures how quickly electrical signals travel through your nerves in your feet. And finally, a vascular study to assess the blood flow in your legs and feet. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, so many tests! I don’t like tests. But… if you think it’s important, I guess. Kidney function? What does that have to do with my foot? And… painful? You said painless, but then you said nerve… I don't like needles. But okay. If it will help, do what you need to do. Just… please be quick? And explain everything to me before you do it. I don’t want any surprises. I get nervous easily, you see. Old age again. Everything scares me these days.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Emiliano. It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous about tests, and I will certainly explain everything to you thoroughly before we proceed. The kidney function test is important because diabetes can sometimes damage the kidneys, and that can affect how well your body removes waste products, which can contribute to foot problems. As for the nerve conduction study, it involves placing small sensors on your skin – it doesn't involve any needles. It may feel a little strange, like a mild tingling sensation, but it shouldn't be painful. We'll need to check how well the nerves in your legs and feet are functioning to see if the neuropathy is contributing to the sore. Before we order those tests, I want to check your pulses in your feet to make sure you have good blood flow. It's a simple exam, and it will give us some additional information. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Pulses? You want to feel my pulse in my foot? Oh dear. I always worry about my heart. My mother, God rest her soul, she had a bad heart. But… okay. If it’s important, do it. Just… be gentle, please. I bruise easily these days. And tell me what you’re feeling. I like to know what’s going on. Is it bad if it's weak? I always worry. Old age, you see… everything feels scary.
DOCTOR: I understand your worries, and I will be as gentle as possible. I’m checking your pulses to assess the blood flow in your legs and feet. It’s a routine exam, and it will help us determine if there’s adequate circulation to the area. Okay, I’m feeling for your pulse here… and here. Your dorsalis pedis pulse is… weak, but present. And your posterior tibial pulse is also weak. This suggests that the blood flow to your foot is somewhat reduced, which could be contributing to your sore and delaying healing. It’s not necessarily an emergency, but it’s something we need to investigate further. To reiterate, I’m ordering a blood test to check your blood sugar and kidney function, and a nerve conduction study and vascular study to assess your nerve and blood flow. I will also write you a prescription for some special shoes, which will help reduce pressure on your foot, and a cream to help prevent infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Shoes? Special shoes? Oh dear. I already have so many shoes. But… if it will help, okay. A cream sounds good. I always use cream on my hands, keeps them from drying out. So, blood tests, nerve tests, special shoes, and cream. That's a lot. When will I get the results? And where will I get the shoes? And… the cream, will it sting? I don't like anything that stings. I guess I'm just worried about everything. Old age, you see. Everything feels… complicated these days. I miss my wife. She always knew what to do. But… okay. Do what you think is best. Just… explain everything to me slowly, please.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your worries, and I will explain everything slowly and thoroughly. It is a lot, but we’re taking these steps to get a better understanding of what’s going on and to help you feel better. The lab work will be done here at the clinic, and the results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. The nerve conduction study and vascular study will be scheduled at the imaging center across the street, and that appointment should be within the next week. The cream is a topical antibiotic—it shouldn't sting, but it's always best to test a small area first. I'll have my nurse schedule those appointments for you, and she will also provide you with instructions on how to prepare for the tests. She’ll also show you the proper way to apply the cream. As for the shoes, I'll write a prescription for a podiatrist, who specializes in foot care. They will measure your feet and recommend the best shoes for your condition. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: A podiatrist… more doctors! Oh dear. But okay. If you think it's best. So, my nurse will call me? And she'll tell me about the tests and the cream? And schedule everything? That sounds… good. Less for me to worry about. I guess… no, not right now. I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. It's just… a lot to take in. Old age, you see. My brain doesn't work as well as it used to. But thank you. I appreciate your patience. Is it okay if I just sit here for a few minutes? Just to… collect my thoughts?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emiliano. Please, take all the time you need. It is a lot to process, and I’m happy to answer any questions that come to mind later as well. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your appointments and go over everything with you. In the meantime, just relax and take a few deep breaths. We’re going to take good care of you. Is there anything I can get for you while you sit and collect your thoughts?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I think I’m alright. Just… a few minutes to sit quietly. Thank you. You’ve been very kind. It's just… hard getting old. Everything feels… complicated.
DOCTOR: It is, Emiliano. It truly is. But you’re doing a wonderful job navigating it all. Please, take your time. I’ll leave you to rest for a few minutes, and my nurse will be in shortly. Don’t hesitate to call if you think of anything. .
