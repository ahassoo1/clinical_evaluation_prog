DOCTOR: Good morning, Jacquille. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, nice to meet you too. Look, I just... I wanted to get tested for HIV. Better safe than sorry, you know? My wife and I... we both decided it was a good idea. No drama, just being sensible.
DOCTOR: That’s very responsible of both of you, Jacquille. It’s always a good idea to prioritize your health and be proactive. Okay, so you’re interested in HIV testing. Before we proceed, can you tell me a little bit about why you decided to get tested now?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s just…well, a friend of a friend was diagnosed recently. Bit of a shock, really. He didn’t seem like the type, if you get my meaning. Makes you think, doesn't it? We’ve both been… careful, but still. You hear stories. Best to know, I suppose. Avoid any unpleasant surprises, yeah? Don’t want to be that guy.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's very common to feel that way when something like that happens to someone you know – it prompts a lot of reflection. "Careful" is good, but as you said, it's always best to be sure. To get a clearer picture, can you tell me a bit about your sexual activity?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is already awkward, isn’t it? Look, Doctor, it's… fairly regular. My wife and I, mostly. Been married eight years now. We try to be… adventurous, if you catch my drift. Sometimes we… experiment. That’s it, really. Nothing wild, just… keeping things interesting. Are you asking if I’ve been with other people? No. Absolutely not. Just my wife. I just want to be clear, I don't need a lecture about fidelity, alright?
DOCTOR: Please, no lectures. I appreciate your honesty, and I understand you're feeling a bit uncomfortable. I only ask because understanding the nature of your sexual activity helps me determine the most appropriate testing and prevention strategies. "Experimenting" is perfectly normal for a long-term relationship, and it doesn’t imply anything negative. Just to confirm, you’ve only had sexual contact with your wife?
PATIENT: Yes! Only my wife. Eight years. And before that… well, nothing worth mentioning. A few dates, nothing serious, nothing physical that would matter. Honestly, I’m starting to regret even bringing this up. I just wanted a test, not a full interrogation about my past. It’s a bit… invasive, don’t you think? Is this necessary? It's just a precaution.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize if my questions feel invasive. You’re right, it's a precaution, and I want to make this as comfortable as possible. I assure you, I'm not interrogating you. The questions are simply part of assessing your risk factors so I can offer the best care. Knowing your history helps me determine the right type of test, and the timeframe for accurate results. Since you've only had sexual contact with your wife for the past eight years, and no prior partners, that significantly lowers your risk. We can proceed with an HIV antibody test. Have you ever had an HIV test before?
PATIENT: No, never. Eight years, you know? Never felt the need. Always considered myself a pretty safe guy. Look, this is good, right? Low risk? That’s what you're saying? Because honestly, I don’t want to be sitting here worrying about… everything. I just want a negative result and to be done with it. It's all my wife wants too. She's getting tested next week. Can we just get on with the test then? This is taking longer than I expected.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right – based on what you've told me, your risk is very low, which is excellent. It's good you're both being proactive. Okay, we can absolutely proceed with the test. We'll do a standard blood draw. It's a quick procedure. Before that, I'd like to ask a few quick questions about your overall health – just to make sure everything else is okay. Have you had any recent illnesses, surgeries, or medications?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Perfectly healthy. Knock on wood. No illnesses, no surgeries, no medications. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I had a bad back last year, but that was it. Went to a physiotherapist, got it sorted. Nothing serious. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a pretty boring patient. Can we just skip the health check and get to the blood draw? This is taking forever. My wife is probably wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear – boring patients are the best kind! I apologize for the delay; I just want to be thorough. Since you had physiotherapy for your back last year and have no other health concerns, we can proceed directly to the blood draw. I'll need to briefly examine your arm to find a suitable vein. Would you mind rolling up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. There. Happy? Honestly, this whole thing is a bit ridiculous, if you ask me. I feel perfectly fine. But my wife insisted, so here I am. Don't poke me too hard, alright? I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Not at all ridiculous, and I promise I’ll be very gentle. You have a good vein here. It will just be a quick prick. I'll use a small needle, and you won’t even feel it. Just relax, and take a few deep breaths. Here we go... All done! Just a little pressure here for a few moments to stop the bleeding.
PATIENT: Ouch. See? I told you I bruise easily. That wasn’t so bad, though. How long until we get the results? And where do I get them? I really don't want to be back and forth to this clinic a dozen times. My wife is relying on me. She'll want to know immediately, of course. It’s her peace of mind, you see. Honestly, the waiting is the worst part.
DOCTOR: You did great. And yes, waiting is often the hardest part. The lab usually takes about 3-5 business days to process the results. We can either call you with the results, or you can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Calling is faster, of course. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: Calling is definitely faster. I’d prefer that. Just… make sure it's the right number. I don't want to be sitting around waiting for a call that’s not going to come. And please, call my mobile. I check that more often. It's… 555-123-4567. And, look, if it is positive… who do I talk to? Do you have someone who can explain everything? Because honestly, I haven't got a clue where to even begin. My wife will be… well, she'll need support too. Just… think about that, alright? Preparing for the worst, just in case.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. 555-123-4567. I’ve got that noted. And you’re right to think ahead. If the results are positive, we have a dedicated counselor who specializes in HIV support and education. She can explain everything in detail, provide emotional support, and connect you both with resources. We also have information about support groups and long-term care options. I'll make sure her number is included in the call, just in case. However, I truly expect a negative result, based on your history. But it’s good to be prepared, and we’re here to support you either way. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's it. Honestly, you've been…patient. More patient than I deserved, probably. Just… get those results back quickly, alright? My wife’s sake, mostly. She worries. We both do, I suppose. And thank you… for the counselor’s number. Just in case. Right, I should probably go then. Less to worry about, the sooner this is over.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jacquille. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before the results come back. We’ll do our best to get them to you as quickly as possible. Take care, and I hope you and your wife have a good week. .
