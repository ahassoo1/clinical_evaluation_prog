DOCTOR: Hi Delano, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Alcorta, Delano Alcorta. It’s…well, it’s my sight, you see. It’s not what it used to be. Seems to be…diminishing, gradually. I’ve noticed it over the past few months, and frankly, I’m not pleased.
DOCTOR: Okay, Delano. Diminishing sight over the past few months… I understand that’s concerning. Can you tell me a little more about how it's diminishing?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not as though I’ve gone blind overnight, Doctor. Don’t misunderstand. It's…subtle. Things just aren’t as crisp as they once were. Reading, for instance. Used to be able to read a newspaper without any assistance. Now? I find myself holding it further and further away. And even then, the print…it seems to swim a bit. It's rather irritating, if I'm being honest. It’s not a sudden change, but a…degradation. A slow, unwelcome fading.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual fading, needing to hold things further away, and some blurring… that gives me a better picture. Has this been happening with everything you look at, or is it more noticeable with close-up objects like the newspaper?
PATIENT: Mostly close-up, yes. Distance…distance is still reasonably clear, though perhaps not as vibrant as it once was. It’s the details that are becoming troublesome. Trying to thread a needle, for example, is…an exercise in futility now. And small print, naturally. Computer screens are…manageable, with a bit of adjusting of the size, but it's a strain. It's just… inconvenient, Doctor. I expect a certain level of…acuity, you understand. It’s not as though I’m asking for telescopic vision, merely…what I had before.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Delano. Losing vision, even gradually, is definitely frustrating. Let's get some more information. Have you noticed any other changes with your vision at all?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me think. No… no flashing lights, no floaters, nothing like that. It’s not a painful experience, if that’s what you’re asking. Just…dimmer. And… perhaps a slight…shadowing around the periphery, but honestly, I’ve always had somewhat poor peripheral vision. It’s hard to say if that’s new, or merely a continuation of a pre-existing condition. I also find myself squinting…a great deal. It doesn't help much, but it's a habit, I suppose. Is that…relevant?
DOCTOR: Squinting is definitely relevant – that's your eyes trying to compensate. No pain, no floaters, no flashing lights, that's good. And the shadowing around the periphery, okay. Have you had any medical conditions diagnosed in the past, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, never. Blood pressure… well, it runs in the family, you see. My father had it, and his father before him. I've been told to “watch” it, by previous doctors, but no official diagnosis. I try to maintain a healthy diet, mostly. Though…divorce has a way of upsetting one’s routines, wouldn’t you agree? It’s difficult to maintain proper nutrition when one is…distracted. Perhaps it has crept up on me. I suppose it’s possible. I’ve never been one for regular check-ups, frankly. Prefer to avoid doctors when possible.
DOCTOR: I understand, Delano. Stress definitely plays a role in health. And a family history of high blood pressure is something we'll need to consider. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I pride myself on not being reliant on pharmaceuticals. A bit of ibuprofen for the occasional ache, perhaps, but nothing regular. I believe in letting the body heal itself, whenever possible. Though… I admit, the body isn't cooperating as well as it used to. I've never been a fan of masking symptoms, only treating the root cause. Which, in this case, I haven’t the faintest idea what it is. Is there… a test for this, Doctor? To determine the…severity, at least?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We'll need to do a thorough eye exam to assess the severity and try to pinpoint the cause. I'd also like to check your blood pressure today, just as a baseline. It's quick and painless. After that, we can discuss potential causes and further testing if needed. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a particularly sensitive constitution, thankfully. Though… I’ve always disliked the smell of most ointments. A bit… overpowering, wouldn't you agree? But an actual allergic reaction? No. I’m… reasonably robust, for my age. Though losing my vision is… rather concerning. Fine. Check my blood pressure, then. Get it over with. I’m not particularly looking forward to it, but… if it must be done.
DOCTOR: Okay, Delano. Let’s get started then. I’m going to have you sit facing that chart on the wall. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort. I'll start with your distance vision, and then we’ll move to close-up.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I suspect my distance vision is still… adequate. It’s the small print that’s the issue, as I’ve explained. But proceed, Doctor. Let’s get this over with. Though, if I may offer a suggestion… perhaps a larger font on the chart? For future patients, of course. It might make the process slightly less…degrading.
DOCTOR: I appreciate the suggestion, Delano, and I’ll certainly keep that in mind. It's good to get patient feedback. Alright, just focus on the letters, and read the smallest line you can clearly see.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is rather…dimly lit, isn't it? Perhaps if we had a bit more illumination… Very well. Let's see… It’s… blurry. I can make out some of the letters, but they aren’t crisp. I believe I can discern an 'F'… and perhaps an 'H'? But the smaller ones… entirely illegible. It’s rather frustrating. I assure you, my vision was much better just months ago. This is… disappointing.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. That’s helpful to know. It does appear you’re having difficulty with the smaller letters, even at a distance. Now, let’s check your close-up vision. I'm going to hold this card about 14 inches from your face. Can you read the smallest line you can see on this card?
PATIENT: Fourteen inches, you say? Very well. No, Doctor. Entirely illegible. Just a…blur. It's rather like looking at hieroglyphics. I can make out the shape of letters, but not the letters themselves. This confirms my suspicion. It’s not merely a matter of needing reading glasses, Doctor. It’s…something more. Frankly, this is quite distressing.
DOCTOR: I understand your distress, Delano. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your daily life. Alright, let's move on to checking your peripheral vision. I'm going to ask you to focus on this point, and I'll present some objects in your peripheral vision. Just tell me when you see them. This will help me assess if there's any loss of vision on the sides.
PATIENT: Peripheral vision, you say? Fine. Though, as I mentioned earlier, it's never been particularly… acute. Still, I shall cooperate. Focus on the point… yes, I see the point. Proceed. Though, do not expect a dramatic revelation. I suspect I shall not be detecting any subtle flashes of light.
DOCTOR: Okay, just tell me when you see something appear in your side vision. Don't worry if it's faint, just let me know. Hmm, that's interesting. It seems you're detecting objects a bit slower on your left side compared to your right. It's subtle, but noticeable. Alright, let's finish up with a quick check of your pupils. I'm just going to shine a light into your eyes.
PATIENT: Slower on the left, you say? Well, that doesn’t surprise me. I’ve always had… asymmetrical vision, I suppose. Though, I hadn't realized it was…quantifiable. Shine the light, then. Get it over with. Though, I trust this isn’t some sort of…optical illusion? I’ve always been rather skeptical of… subjective examinations.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. Based on what I’ve observed today – the difficulty with both distance and close-up vision, the slightly slower reaction in your peripheral vision on the left, and the slight difference in pupil size and reaction – I think it’s important to investigate this further. I’d like to order a few tests. An optical coherence tomography, or OCT, to get a detailed look at the layers of your retina. Also, a visual field test to map out your peripheral vision. And finally, a blood pressure check to rule out any hypertension related issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: OCT… visual field test… It sounds… extensive, Doctor. And, frankly, rather alarming. But, if it’s necessary… very well. Blood pressure check is… sensible, I suppose. Though I maintain my skepticism about the need for such… invasive procedures. But proceed, if you must. Just… try to expedite the process, if possible. I have commitments, you see. And this is… quite unsettling. Just… tell me what I need to do. And how long it will take. And, if you could explain, in layman’s terms, what these tests are actually looking for… I would appreciate it. I’m not a medical professional, Doctor. I simply want to regain my sight.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Delano. I’ll do my best to explain everything clearly and keep things as efficient as possible. The OCT scan is a non-invasive imaging test – it’s like taking a picture of the different layers of your retina. It helps us look for any abnormalities, like fluid build-up or damage to the nerve fibers. The visual field test maps out your peripheral vision, to see if there are any areas where you're losing vision. It's a bit like looking at a field of stars – you’ll be asked to focus on a central point and indicate when you see lights appear in your side vision. As for the blood pressure check, hypertension can sometimes affect vision, so it’s a good starting point. The tests should take about an hour to complete, including the prep time. We’ll schedule them with our technician. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A picture of the retina… a field of stars… It sounds… rather fanciful, Doctor. But, if that's what's required. Very well. An hour, you say? I suppose I can manage that. Just… try to be thorough. I don’t want to be subjected to repeated testing. And, if you could explain the results to me in plain English… I would be most grateful. I have no desire to decipher medical jargon. And, if it's not too much to ask… perhaps a written summary? Just… to have something for my records.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Delano. I will ensure you receive a clear explanation of the results, in plain English, and a written summary for your records. We’ll schedule the tests with our technician, and they will explain the procedure in more detail. It will be about an hour total, including time to dilate your pupils, which is necessary for the OCT scan. Let’s see… we have availability tomorrow afternoon at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow afternoon… 2:00 PM. Reluctantly, yes. Tomorrow afternoon will have to suffice. But I expect prompt and efficient service, Doctor. I have matters to attend to, you see. And I trust this won't be a protracted ordeal. Just… get it done. And provide me with a definitive diagnosis, as soon as possible. Is there anything else I need to do beforehand? Any medications to avoid? Any dietary restrictions? Just… let me know. I prefer to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Okay, 2:00 PM tomorrow it is. And I understand your need for efficiency, Delano. I’ll make sure everything runs smoothly. As for preparation, no special medications to avoid, and no dietary restrictions. The technician will explain the procedure in detail when you arrive. The only thing is, your vision will be blurry for a few hours after the tests because of the pupil dilation, so I recommend having someone drive you home or arranging for a ride. Also, it might be sensitive to light, so bringing sunglasses is a good idea. Here’s the confirmation with the technician’s contact information. If you have any questions beforehand, feel free to give them a call. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Sunglasses… a ride… Very well. Sunglasses and a ride. I suppose I can arrange that. No, Doctor. That will be all. I appreciate your… thoroughness. Though I remain cautiously optimistic. Just… try to expedite the process, as I mentioned. And provide me with a definitive answer, as soon as possible. I have matters to attend to, you see. Good day, Doctor. And, if you'll excuse me… I believe I'll need to locate a pair of sunglasses. .
