DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s… pleasant to meet you. Now, could you please tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get right to it. It's my stool. It's… black. Like tar, practically. And it's not the first time, mind you. I take those pain pills, you know, for my arthritis. The red ones. Been taking 'em for years. I figured it might have something to do with that. Is that what you think?
DOCTOR: Black stool… yes, that is certainly something we need to investigate. While it can be related to certain medications, it's never prudent to simply assume. And “years” is a rather long time to be experiencing this, Ms. Hatchard. First, let’s clarify. When you say “black, like tar,” is it consistently that color?
PATIENT: Consistently? Well, not every time, obviously. But it happens often enough to bother me. It’s not bright red, if that’s what you’re getting at. More… dark, you know? Like coffee grounds sometimes, but darker. And stickier. Honestly, it’s unpleasant. I’ve been trying to ignore it, but it keeps happening. Is it something serious? I haven't felt sick, if that matters. Just… tired, maybe. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: “Coffee grounds” is a useful description, thank you. And no, Ms. Hatchard, fatigue alone is not sufficient to rule out anything. Now, regarding these pain pills… do you recall the name of the medication, and the dosage you take?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. You want me to remember the name? I just ask my husband to refill them. He handles all that. Let me think… they're little red pills, like I said. And… I think two at a time, twice a day? Maybe three, sometimes. Depends on how much it’s aching, you see. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to the specifics. It's just pain relief. Ibuprofen, maybe? Is that right? I take a lot of things for my joints. It's all a blur.
DOCTOR: It is… rather difficult to assess risk without precise medication details, Ms. Hatchard. "A lot of things" isn’t particularly helpful. However, given your description – little red pills, taken two or three times daily for arthritis – it could be ibuprofen. Let’s move on. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Well, I eat. I like my food. Not as much as I used to, perhaps. Old age again, you know. Things just don't taste the same. And sometimes my stomach feels a little… unsettled. But nothing terrible. I still enjoy my little sweets with my tea in the afternoon. Just not as many cookies as I used to. Honestly, I don't see what that has to do with my stool. Are we getting anywhere with this? I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Changes in appetite can be indicative of underlying issues, Ms. Hatchard, even if minor. And "unsettled" is vague. Is this a feeling of nausea, bloating, cramping…?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. It's just a little queasy sometimes, alright? Like when you've eaten something that doesn't quite agree with you. Not vomiting or anything drastic, just… a bit off. Like my stomach is trying to tell me something. I’ve had it for years, like everything else. Look, I’ve lived a long life and I've had plenty of little aches and pains. I don’t need a whole examination for a bit of black stool and a slightly queasy stomach. Is this going to cost me a fortune? Because I’m on Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, I assure you, I am not attempting to cause unnecessary alarm. However, black stool warrants a thorough investigation. It is, as you've stated, concerning, and ignoring it could have implications. Given the prolonged nature of your symptoms—the black stool, the queasiness—and your reliance on pain medication, I would like to perform a brief physical examination and order a stool analysis. Additionally, we will need to obtain a complete list of your medications, dosage, and frequency from your husband. Would you agree to this?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And don't keep me waiting all day. I’ve got things to do, you know. Tell my husband to have that list ready. And make it quick. The sooner this is all done, the better. Is there anything I need to do beforehand? Like drink something awful? Or… I don’t know. Just tell me what needs to be done and let’s get on with it.
DOCTOR: Very well. No, nothing specific is required beforehand. Please, if you would, have a seat on the examination table. I will need to listen to your abdomen, and palpate it briefly. It will not be… unpleasant.
PATIENT: Honestly, all this fuss over a bit of black stool. It's ridiculous. Just get it over with. And be gentle, alright? My joints aren't what they used to be. This whole thing is such a waste of time. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen is slightly tender in the lower quadrants, but no acute findings. Bowel sounds are present, albeit slightly diminished. I will need to collect a stool sample for analysis. There should be collection materials in the restroom. Please ensure you collect a representative sample. While we await the results, do you experience any pain in your chest or shortness of breath?
