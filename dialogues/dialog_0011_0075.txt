DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. My name is Dr. NEPL, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been feeling…sleepy. Even though I am being treated for sleep apnea. I use a machine every night, a CPAP I think it is, and it helps…but not enough, you see. I still find myself dozing off during the day. It’s a bit bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Paske. It’s good that you’re already being treated for sleep apnea, and it’s important to address why the CPAP isn’t fully resolving the issue. Just to clarify, when you say “dozing off,” can you describe what that’s like?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see. It’s not like falling asleep instantly. More like…a heavy tiredness washes over me, and then next thing I know, a few minutes have gone by. Sometimes I'm sitting right here, perfectly comfortable, and I just…drift off. Or if I’m reading, the words start to blur and I have to really concentrate to stay awake. It doesn’t happen every day, mind you, but enough to be a worry. Especially when I’m driving, although thankfully that hasn’t happened in a while. I really try to avoid long drives when I'm feeling particularly tired.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Paske. That’s very helpful. It sounds like you're experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness despite CPAP therapy. We need to investigate the potential causes of this. To get a better understanding of the situation, could you tell me a bit more about your CPAP use?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’ve been using it for…oh, must be about five years now. The doctor, before you, fitted me up with it. I try to use it every night, honestly I do. It's a little uncomfortable sometimes, the mask doesn't always fit perfectly, but I push through. I clean it regularly, as they told me to. And I've had the pressure checked a couple of times, they said it was alright. Though it feels a little high sometimes, if that makes any sense. Like I'm forcing air in, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. It's good you're diligent about cleaning and getting the pressure checked. The discomfort and feeling of high pressure are important details. To clarify, when you say it “feels high”, do you experience any specific symptoms when you’re using the machine, such as nasal congestion, dry mouth, or bloating?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a few things. The dry mouth is the worst, definitely. I have to keep a glass of water by the bed. And sometimes my nose feels a bit…irritated, like it's a little raw. Not constantly, but often enough. The bloating...now that you mention it, yes, I do feel a bit puffy in the mornings sometimes. I hadn’t really connected it to the machine, to be honest. I just thought it was…old age! But now that I think about it, it does seem to be worse on the days I use the machine consistently.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. Those symptoms – dry mouth, nasal irritation, and bloating – are all potential side effects of CPAP therapy and could contribute to your daytime sleepiness if they’re disrupting your sleep quality. Let's move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Not a problem at all, Doctor. Where to begin… Well, I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a rather unpleasant experience, but that was many years ago. I also had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been well-controlled with medication for the last ten years or so. And I had a bit of a scare with my heart a few years back, but thankfully it turned out to be nothing too serious. Otherwise, not much. I've always been fairly healthy, to be honest. I try to eat a good diet and I walk every day, when the weather permits. I’ll mention I was divorced about twenty years ago, but I don't think that's medically relevant.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Paske. It’s good to hear you prioritize a healthy lifestyle. The history of high blood pressure and the heart scare are important, and I appreciate you mentioning them. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure, if you recall the names?
PATIENT: Let me see…I believe it’s Lisinopril. Yes, that’s right, Lisinopril. And I take a small dose of Amlodipine as well, the doctor added that a few years ago. I usually take them first thing in the morning with my breakfast. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I’ll take some Ibuprofen, but not every day. Just when I really need it. I should also mention, I have Medicare, if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. Lisinopril and Amlodipine, and occasional Ibuprofen. Knowing you have Medicare is also helpful. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you may have?
PATIENT: Hmm, allergies… That’s a good question. I don’t think I have any serious allergies, thankfully. I'm not allergic to any medications that I know of. I used to have some hay fever when I was a child, but that hasn't bothered me in years. Occasionally, I get a bit of a rash if I brush against poison ivy, but that’s about it. Nothing life-threatening, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Paske. No known drug allergies or significant environmental allergies. To get a more complete picture, could you briefly describe your typical daily routine?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I usually wake up around 7:00 AM, though sometimes earlier if I have something planned. I have a light breakfast – usually toast and coffee – and then I’ll go for a walk, weather permitting. I spend the afternoons reading or writing – I used to be a professor, you see, and I still enjoy research. I have dinner around 6:00 PM, and then I’ll relax in the evening, watching the news or listening to music. I try to be in bed by 10:00 PM, and then I use my CPAP machine all night. It’s a pretty quiet life, to be honest, but I enjoy it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. That gives me a good sense of your daily life. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or sleep disorders?
PATIENT: That’s a bit of a tricky question, Doctor. My family…well, we weren’t big on talking about medical things, to be honest. My father had heart problems later in life, but I don't know the specifics. My mother was healthy as a horse, never sick a day in her life. And I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ medical histories. I do remember my uncle having trouble sleeping, but I don't know if it was anything like sleep apnea. So, to be honest, I don’t have a lot of information to share. It wasn't something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Paske. Family medical history can be difficult to gather. That's perfectly alright. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I'd like to ask about your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, none of that, Doctor. Never have. I gave up smoking years ago, before it was even fashionable! I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, but that’s about it. And I certainly don't use any recreational drugs. I've never been much of a partier, to be honest. I prefer a quiet evening at home with a good book. I always told my students, “A clear head is a good head.” And that applies to everything, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Paske. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. Alright, thank you for answering all of those questions so thoroughly. Now, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need, just let me know. I trust your judgment completely. Just…try to be gentle, if you don’t mind! Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Paske. I will be as gentle as possible. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Take some deep breaths for me, in and out. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s a little elevated. Finally, I palpate your neck and note no lymphadenopathy. I document: “Neck: No lymphadenopathy.” Alright, Mr. Paske. Everything appears generally normal, although your blood pressure is a little elevated, and I noted a slight murmur and diminished breath sounds. Given your history of daytime sleepiness despite CPAP therapy, coupled with these findings, I suspect several factors may be contributing to your symptoms. I would like to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. These include a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a repeat sleep study to reassess your CPAP settings and rule out any changes in your sleep apnea severity. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to do them. I trust your expertise. A repeat sleep study…that sounds a bit unpleasant, but if it will help, then certainly. And a blood test is no bother at all. I’m used to those. So, what’s the next step? Do I need to make an appointment for the sleep study? And where do I go for the blood test?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Paske. I appreciate your willingness to proceed with the testing. Yes, we'll need to schedule you for a repeat sleep study. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, arrange that for you. She'll contact you to discuss the details and find a convenient time and location. The study will be at the Sleep Center across town, it's a comfortable facility. For the blood test, you can go to the lab in the medical building right next door. I'll give you a requisition form now, and they should be able to take the sample anytime during their business hours. It’s a simple draw, and shouldn’t take long. While we wait for the test results, I would also like you to keep a sleep diary for the next week. Please note the time you go to bed, the time you wake up, any interruptions during the night, and how rested you feel in the morning. This will help us correlate your symptoms with your sleep patterns. Here’s the requisition form for the blood tests. And I’ll have Sarah give you a sleep diary template as well. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as increased daytime sleepiness, difficulty breathing, or chest pain – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That’s very thorough, Doctor, thank you. I think I understand everything. A sleep diary… that’s a good idea. I’ll get started on that right away. And I’ll make sure Sarah knows to give me the details about the sleep study when she calls. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. You’ve explained everything so clearly. I feel much more reassured knowing that we're taking these steps to figure out what’s going on. I appreciate your time and attention to my concerns.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this and find a solution that works for you. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if any questions or concerns arise before your follow-up appointment. Sarah will be in touch to schedule that once we have the test results. Have a good day, and please get some rest! .
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I will, and I appreciate your kindness. .
