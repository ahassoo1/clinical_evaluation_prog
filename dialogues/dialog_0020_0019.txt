DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my wife and I… we are thinking about… maybe having a baby. She is a little… older, you know? And I just want to make sure… everything is okay. I don’t remember much about… things like this. It was a long time ago when we had our other children.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. It is a long time ago! And it’s very responsible of you to want to ensure everything is healthy before starting a family again. So, you and your wife are considering trying to conceive?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Trying… to have a baby. She feels… good, mostly. But we both… get a little worried. Old bodies, you know? I have Medicare, if that is important.
DOCTOR: It is important, thank you for mentioning that. And your concerns are very valid, Mr. Carlotta. It’s good you're thinking ahead. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about your wife’s health?
PATIENT: Um… she goes to the doctor, regular. For… the pressure. And her… sugar. It goes up sometimes. She takes pills for it. I think she also has… something with her heart? Not bad, the doctor says. She gets tired easily, that is all. I don't know the names of the things. I just drive her to the appointments.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me see if I can access her records here… Ah, yes. I see she’s been under the care of Dr. Hassan. It looks like she’s being treated for hypertension and type 2 diabetes, and there’s a note about mild mitral valve prolapse. That explains the tiredness. So, she’s currently on medication for blood pressure and diabetes?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Pills every morning. And… sometimes at night. She is very good about taking them. I… I worry about the baby being… okay, with her being older. And the pills. Will that hurt the baby?
DOCTOR: Those are very reasonable concerns, Mr. Carlotta. It’s good you’re asking these questions. We definitely want to make sure everything is as safe as possible. Her age and existing medical conditions do increase the risk of certain complications during pregnancy, but it doesn’t mean it’s impossible to have a healthy pregnancy. We'll need to carefully evaluate both of your health, and potentially adjust her medications if she does become pregnant. First, let’s talk about your health. Have you seen a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Not so much, Doctor. I am usually okay. A little aches and pains, you know? Old age. I used to be strong, making… models. Metal and plastic. But not anymore. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time. Maybe five years? I don’t really remember. No big problems, though. I don't think.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for letting me know. Since it’s been some time, I think it would be a good idea to do a basic physical exam and some blood work to get a baseline of your health. Just to make sure everything is in good working order. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. If it will help. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Whatever you think is best for the baby. That is all that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Carlotta. Alright, let’s start with your weight and blood pressure. Then, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. After that, we’ll draw some blood for a complete blood count and a metabolic panel, just to check your overall health and kidney function. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Anything to help. Just… tell me if it will be uncomfortable, okay? I don't like needles very much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll explain everything as we go, and we can go as slow as you need to. The blood draw will be quick, and I'll use a small needle. We can also use a numbing cream if you like. First, let's get your weight. Please step onto the scale for me. Okay, 96 kilograms. And your height is 164 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. 164. I haven't grown in many years! I used to be taller, I think. Maybe. It was a long time ago. What is next?
DOCTOR: Alright. Next, let’s check your blood pressure. It's a simple cuff around your arm. Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 88. That’s a little elevated, but not too concerning at this point. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, if you don’t mind. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Relax. I always get a little nervous at the doctor. It reminds me of… bad things. But I am trying to be brave. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart sounds regular, but I can hear a slight murmur. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Your lungs sound clear, thankfully. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Open your mouth for me, please, and say “ah.” Everything looks okay in your throat. And your ears are clear as well. Now, to get a better picture of your overall health, I'd like to draw some blood. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes… blood. Can we… can we do it quickly? And… maybe not look directly at me? I don't like seeing the needle. It makes me dizzy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can absolutely do it quickly, and I will not look directly at you. I will explain each step as I go, but I'll keep my focus on the process, not on you. The nurse, Maria, is very good at this, and she'll be assisting me. Maria, could you come in and assist us with a blood draw, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. I hope it doesn't hurt too much. My wife… she is always very brave. I am not so brave.
DOCTOR: Maria: “Hi Mr. Carlotta, nice to meet you. Dr. Beinborn tells me you're a little nervous about the blood draw, that's perfectly alright. We’ll take it slow and make sure you’re comfortable. I'm going to tie a small tourniquet around your arm to help the veins stand out.” Dr. Beinborn: “Just let us know if you feel any discomfort, Mr. Carlotta. We can stop at any time.” Dr. Beinborn: “Okay, I’m just going to feel for a vein now…” Dr. Beinborn: “Alright, this one looks good. You might feel a quick pinch…” Dr. Beinborn: “Just relax your arm. We're almost done.” Dr. Beinborn: “Okay, all done! Just a little pressure here to stop the bleeding.” Dr. Beinborn: “Maria, could you get a bandage for Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: Ouch… that… that wasn't so bad. But… hurry, please. I don't like needles. Is it almost over? I feel a little dizzy…
DOCTOR: Dr. Beinborn: “Almost done, Mr. Carlotta. Just a few more seconds. You’re doing great. Just breathe deeply.” Dr. Beinborn: “Okay, all done now. Just keep this bandage on for a few hours, and avoid heavy lifting with that arm today. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: It… it’s over? That wasn't as bad as I remembered. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you, Maria. You were both very kind. I still feel a little… shaky, but better now. What happens now? Do we… wait for the results?
DOCTOR: Dr. Beinborn: “Yes, exactly. We’ll send these samples to the lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once we have those, we can discuss them in detail and make a plan. We’ll also want to review your wife’s records more thoroughly, especially her medication list. Do you have a copy of her medications with you today?
PATIENT: Um… I think so. Here. She has a lot… for her blood pressure and… the sugar. And something for her heart, I think. Will the results tell us if it is safe to… try for a baby? That is what I am most worried about.
DOCTOR: Dr. Beinborn: Okay, thank you. Yes, the results will give us a better idea of your overall health, and we can assess if any adjustments need to be made before considering starting a family. We’ll look at things like your kidney function, blood sugar levels, and any potential nutrient deficiencies. I'll also want to discuss your wife's medications to make sure they're appropriate for pregnancy, or if any need to be changed. It is important to know that some medications can be harmful during pregnancy. For now, it’s good that you're being proactive and getting these tests done. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all for now. You explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. It is… a lot to think about. But I feel better knowing we are doing everything we can. When will I hear back about the results?
DOCTOR: Dr. Beinborn: You're very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. It is a lot to process, and I'm happy to answer any further questions you may have as they arise. The lab usually takes 3-5 business days to get the results back. Maria will call you as soon as they're available to schedule a follow-up appointment. We can then discuss the findings and create a plan together. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. Thank you again. You have been very helpful. Goodbye. .
