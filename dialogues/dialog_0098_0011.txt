DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I ain’t got all day. Just need a paper signed. Something about… a little touch-up. A procedure. My niece said I needed clearance from a doctor before I do it. She’s a real worrier, that one. Just want it done quickly, if you please.
DOCTOR: A paper for a procedure… right. And your niece suggested you come in for medical clearance. Could you tell me a little more about this procedure, Mr. Honcoop?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't rightly remember all the details. It involves... well, looking better. Some kind of… smoothing. It’s not a big deal. A fella at the shop recommended it. He said it’s real common now. Just need you to say I’m healthy enough, I guess. I ain't a complicated case. Don’t need a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand you’d like me to clear you for a cosmetic procedure. Just to be sure, and for my records, could you tell me where on your body this procedure will be done?
PATIENT: Land sakes, Doctor. Now you’re askin’ me to remember things I don’t recall! It’s… on my face. That’s all you need to know. Around my… chin area, maybe? Look, I ain’t goin’ in for surgery, it's just a little somethin’ to tighten things up. Don't make me draw you a picture. I got important things to do today.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Just to be thorough, even for a small procedure, I need to ask a few questions about your health history. Have you had any procedures like this done before?
PATIENT: Procedures? Goodness no! I'm sixty-four years old, Doctor. I’ve lived a good life. Never needed any of that fancy stuff before. This is a first, believe me. I’m a simple man. Just want this signed and be on my way. Don’t need a history lesson on things I haven’t done. Honestly, what kind of question is that?
DOCTOR: I understand. Just out of routine, could you tell me about any medical conditions you have – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else your regular doctor has told you about?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I don't go to doctors much. Never had a need to, really. I feel fine. A little achy in the mornings, like anyone my age, but that’s just livin’. No high blood pressure, no sugar problems, no nothin’. I work hard, eat decent, and keep movin’. Healthy as a horse, I tell ya. Don’t need a list of ailments I don't have. Are we getting anywhere with this paper or not? I got appointments to keep.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, you're killin' me! No! I ain’t allergic to nothin’. I eat everything. Dust, pollen, whatever. Never had a reaction. Look, I appreciate you tryin’ to do your job, but this is gettin’ ridiculous. I just need the paper signed so I can get on with my life. You makin’ a mountain outta a molehill. Just… sign it, please. I’m losin’ daylight.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I do need to perform a quick examination just to ensure your safety. It won't take long – just checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Land sakes, Doctor. You're really gonna make me jump through hoops for a little touch-up? Fine. Go ahead. But make it quick. I ain't got all day, and I'm tellin’ ya, my time is valuable. Don't poke and prod too much. Just do what you gotta do and sign the paper. Hurry it up, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit back and relax… First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Hurry it up, please. This cuff is tighter than a drum. I swear, you're tryin' to cut off my circulation. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop. Your blood pressure is a little high, 160 over 90 roughly. I’m also going to listen to your heart and lungs, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: High? Well, that ain't good, is it? Listen to it all you want, but I'm tellin' you, I feel fine. Maybe it's just the stress of bein' here! Hurry up, Doctor. This is makin’ me more anxious than before. And don't be pokin' around too long. I gotta get goin'. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Your heart sounds… a little irregular, and your lungs sound a bit quiet. Given your elevated blood pressure and these findings, I'm concerned about clearing you for any procedure at this time. It could be risky.
