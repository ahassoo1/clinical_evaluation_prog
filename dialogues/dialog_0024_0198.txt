DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… something I’ve been thinking about for a while now. I’ve been hearing a lot about mindfulness and meditation, and I was hoping to get your opinion on it. I’m just… feeling a bit scattered lately, and I thought maybe it could help me focus.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I think I keep hearing about it on the radio, and a friend mentioned she takes a class. It’s supposed to be about… paying attention to the present moment, I guess? I’m not entirely sure, honestly. I work with signals and track switches all day, which is very… precise. But then when I’m not working, my mind just races. I’m hoping it could help with that. Do you know much about it, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sugino, with all due respect, you are consulting a medical professional, not a… life coach. While I appreciate you sharing this with me, I’m not certain this falls within the scope of a typical medical consultation. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh, you’re right, of course. I’m sorry. I just… sometimes I don’t think things through. No, no physical symptoms, not really. Just… a bit tired, maybe? And easily distracted. But I thought… well, I read that stress can cause physical problems, and I thought if I could manage the stress, it might prevent something from becoming a physical problem. Is that… silly? I apologize for taking up your time with this. Perhaps I should just look for a class.
DOCTOR: It is… not optimal to preemptively seek medical intervention for hypothetical issues, Ms. Sugino. Let's focus on concrete matters. You mention fatigue. How long have you been feeling tired?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Yes, okay, concrete matters. That makes sense. Hmm… let me think. Probably… six months, give or take a few weeks. It’s not like… debilitating fatigue, not at all. More like… I used to have a lot more energy at the end of the day. Now, I just feel… drained. And I find myself needing more coffee to get going in the mornings, and even then… it doesn’t last as long as it used to. It's hard to explain. I still get my work done, perfectly, but it takes more effort.
DOCTOR: Increased effort… and increased caffeine intake. Do you have any difficulty falling asleep, Ms. Sugino?
PATIENT: No, not really. I actually sleep quite well, when I do sleep. Usually around eight hours. It’s a solid eight hours, usually. No waking up in the middle of the night or anything. It’s just… getting going in the morning is harder. And then, throughout the day, I just feel… foggy, I guess you could say. Like I’m wading through something. It doesn't affect my work, I want to stress that. I’m very careful, and I double-check everything. It’s just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sugino, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not. I really try to avoid taking anything if I can help it. Just the coffee, as we discussed. And occasionally, a pain reliever if I have a headache, but those are very rare. I've always been quite healthy, honestly. That's why this is so… puzzling. I don’t want to start taking medication unless it’s absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s perform a brief physical examination. Please step onto the scale. We will start with your weight and blood pressure. It is… standard procedure.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, of course. Standard procedure. That makes perfect sense. Here we go.
DOCTOR: 136 pounds. And your blood pressure is 138 over 82. Within normal limits, though slightly elevated. Pulse is 72. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds regular. Do you have any history of… thyroid issues in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good about the lungs and heart. Thyroid issues… hmm. Let me think. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had something with her thyroid, I believe. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the details. She lived in Bulgaria, and things were… different then. It wasn’t diagnosed as thoroughly, I suppose. She was always a bit… sluggish, if I remember correctly. And she gained a lot of weight. But that was also when she stopped working, so it could have been that, too. It’s hard to say, honestly. Do you need a more specific answer? I could ask my cousin, she’s very good at remembering family history.
DOCTOR: Possible family history of thyroid dysfunction. It would be… prudent to order a complete blood panel, including thyroid function tests. And a basic metabolic panel, just to be thorough. We will also check your Vitamin D levels. It is… a common deficiency. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds very sensible, Doctor. Please do. I trust your judgement. And if it helps rule things out, that's even better. I consent to all of those tests. What’s involved? Will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: You will need to fast for twelve hours beforehand. No food or beverages, excluding water. We will draw blood here in the clinic. It is… a simple procedure. The lab results typically take three to five business days. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that suit you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Three to five business days is fine. And yes, a follow-up appointment would be very good. Let me see… I’m free most afternoons next week. Does that work? And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to investigate this. It’s good to know we’re looking into things. Hopefully, it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: We shall see, Ms. Sugino. I have scheduled you for a follow-up appointment next Wednesday at 2:00 PM. A nurse will provide you with the necessary paperwork for the blood tests. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you again for your time and attention. I appreciate it very much. And please, let me know if you need any further information from me. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Very well. You may leave now. Have a good day as well, Ms. Sugino.
