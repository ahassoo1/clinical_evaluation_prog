DOCTOR: Right. Mackenzi Brightful, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. It’s… lovely to meet you, Doctor Havird, isn’t it? Though, truthfully, I don’t recall making the appointment myself. My husband… used to handle these things. It’s all a bit blurry, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Blurry, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes. He… passed away about six months ago. I’ve been trying to keep up with everything, but there’s… a lot. And my memory hasn’t been the best since. I apologize if I ask you to repeat things. It isn't a reflection on you, of course.
DOCTOR: Well, grief does a number on… everything. Perfectly understandable. Let's just take things slowly. So, you said you don't recall making the appointment. What made you decide to come in today?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I believe a friend – Isabella – mentioned something about… wanting me to feel more like myself again? And I think it had to do with… a procedure? Something to do with my face. Honestly, the details are… quite foggy. She was very insistent, though, and arranged everything, I think. It's a cosmetic surgery clearance, you said?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a cosmetic surgery clearance. A Ms. Isabella Ramirez did schedule this appointment for you, requesting pre-operative evaluation for a facial aesthetic procedure. You mentioned your memory is… hazy. Before we get into specifics, can you tell me generally what's been bothering you, what you're hoping to address with this procedure?
PATIENT: Oh. That helps to know Isabella arranged it. Thank you. Well… honestly, Doctor, looking in the mirror has been… difficult. Not because of anything specific, I don’t think. Just… I don’t recognize the person staring back at me. It sounds silly, I know. It’s… a feeling more than anything. A hollowness. I suppose I’m hoping to… feel a bit more like myself. To look a little more… vibrant, perhaps? I'm not sure I can explain it very well.
DOCTOR: Right. "Vibrant." It's… common, after a loss, to feel disconnected. To want to… reclaim something. So, let's focus on what's physically bothering you. Are you unhappy with wrinkles?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. I understand. And you’re right, reclaiming… feels important. Wrinkles… I hadn’t really thought about it specifically. I suppose there are some, yes. But it's not the wrinkles themselves, I don’t think. It's more like… the overall shape of my face has changed. My cheeks feel… sunken. And my jawline isn’t as defined as it used to be. It makes me look… tired, I suppose. Though I am tired, to be fair. Is that… helpful? I’m trying to be precise, but it’s difficult to articulate.
DOCTOR: Right. Sunken cheeks, less defined jawline. Let's have a look. Please sit up straight. I'll need to do a brief physical exam just to get a baseline. It's standard procedure for something like this, to rule out any underlying medical issues that might affect the outcome. Open your mouth, please.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you need. I hope I’m not being too difficult. I truly apologize for my… lack of clarity. It's just… a lot has happened, and I feel a bit lost.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No obvious abnormalities. Some laxity, as expected for your age… and recent history. Weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh. That's good to hear there are no abnormalities. Weight loss… yes, a bit. It’s been difficult to eat, honestly. Everything just… tastes like ash, if that makes any sense. I’ve lost maybe fifteen pounds, I think? It fluctuates, though. I haven’t been very good at taking care of myself, I'm afraid. It's… shameful, I know.
DOCTOR: Fifteen pounds is… significant, especially without intentional dieting. Loss of appetite can be a symptom of… many things. Let’s check your vitals. Blood pressure, pulse… and weight, just to confirm.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. It's just… everything feels a bit overwhelming right now. Is it alright if I ask what exactly you're looking for when taking these measurements? Just so I can… understand the process a little better?
DOCTOR: We’re simply establishing a baseline, Miss Brightful. Ensuring you’re a suitable candidate for elective surgery. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could affect healing or the cosmetic outcome. Blood pressure is a little low, but within acceptable limits. Pulse is normal. And you weigh 93 pounds, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, 93 pounds is correct. Low blood pressure… is that concerning? I haven’t been feeling particularly well, but I assumed it was just… grief. Or the lack of appetite. Should I be worried? I apologize for being so… anxious. It’s not usually like this.
DOCTOR: "Anxious" is… a strong word. Low blood pressure alone isn't necessarily concerning, but combined with weight loss… it warrants further investigation. Have you noticed any dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting spells?
PATIENT: Oh. Further investigation… I see. Dizziness… yes, actually. I have been a bit dizzy, especially when I stand up quickly. And I think… once, maybe twice, I felt like I was going to faint, but I sat down right away. It’s been… subtle, though. I didn’t think much of it. I just assumed I was tired. And, truthfully, I’ve been avoiding… looking too closely at how I feel. It's easier that way, sometimes. Is that… foolish?
DOCTOR: Avoiding things rarely makes them better, Miss Brightful. Dizziness and near-fainting spells… that's not simply "tired." We need to rule out several possibilities. It could be dehydration, anemia, or… something more serious. Before we proceed with any cosmetic surgery, we need a complete blood workup. And I recommend a visit with a cardiologist, just to be safe. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh. A cardiologist… and blood work… I see. That sounds… complicated. Is this because of the weight loss, then? And the dizziness? I had hoped… I had hoped this would be a simple fix. To just… feel more like myself again. I apologize for causing trouble, Doctor. Is it alright if I… call Isabella? Perhaps she can explain things a bit better? I'm feeling rather overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: "Simple fixes" rarely exist, Miss Brightful. We're not ignoring your emotional state, but we must address any underlying medical concerns first. And yes, the weight loss and dizziness are concerning. Let's focus on the blood work and cardiologist referral for now. I'll have the nurse draw some blood, and I'll write a referral for a cardiologist. As for Isabella… I suggest you discuss your concerns with her after we have some results. It's best to approach this logically. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course. Logically. I understand. Allergies… hmm. I have a mild allergy to penicillin. And… I think I’m slightly sensitive to bee stings, but it’s just a bit of redness and swelling, nothing serious. Is that all you need to know? I apologize for being so… unhelpful. I'm truly trying to cooperate, but my mind feels… foggy. And I'm so very tired. Perhaps I should have just stayed home.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. Mild reaction to bee stings is… acceptable. Alright, Miss Brightful, the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I'll write the referral for the cardiologist now. Once you have the results from both, schedule a follow-up appointment with me, and we can discuss your options. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Just… how long will the blood work take? And… will the cardiologist be able to tell me what’s wrong? I’m just… worried it’s something serious. And… will this mean I won’t be able to have the surgery? I apologize for asking so many questions. I'm truly trying to understand. And… I think Isabella is expecting me to call her soon. Perhaps I should just… step outside for a moment? To collect my thoughts?
DOCTOR: The blood work results typically take 24-48 hours. The cardiologist will determine the cause of your dizziness and recommend a treatment plan. Whether you're a suitable candidate for surgery depends on those results. Now, please. Let's not dwell on hypotheticals. The nurse will be in shortly. You can sit quietly and wait. I have other patients to see.
PATIENT: Oh. Of course. Very well, Doctor. I apologize for taking up so much of your time. I'll… wait for the nurse. And… I'll try not to dwell. .
