DOCTOR: Good morning, Ebony. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I've been… forgetting things. Not huge things, but little things. It's starting to worry me, that's all.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re addressing this now. It's definitely worth investigating when memory changes start to concern you. No need to be embarrassed at all; it happens. Can you tell me a little more about these “little things” you’re forgetting?
PATIENT: Hmm… where to start? Like, I’ll go into a room and forget why I went in there. Or I’ll be talking to someone and completely lose my train of thought mid-sentence. And sometimes I have trouble remembering names, even people I've met a few times. It's not constant, but it's happening more and more often. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Those are all fairly common experiences, and the fact that it’s becoming more frequent is what prompted you to come in, which is smart. To get a better picture, could you tell me approximately when you first started noticing these memory lapses?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… that's hard to say exactly. I think… maybe six months ago? It was very gradual, so I didn't really pay attention at first. Just thought I was getting more stressed with work. But it’s definitely gotten worse in the last couple of months, especially. I can't really pinpoint a specific moment, though. Sorry!
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. It's common for these things to develop gradually. Six months is helpful to know. Now, besides the memory issues, have you noticed any other changes – perhaps in your mood, sleep patterns, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My sleep is… okay. Not fantastic, but I've always been a bit of a light sleeper. Appetite is normal, I guess. Maybe I haven’t been as… energetic as usual, but again, work's been pretty draining. Mood… I wouldn't say I'm sad, but I've been a little more irritable than normal, snapping at people a bit. It’s probably just the stress, though. I don't know. It’s hard to say, really. I feel… a bit foggy, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: "Foggy" is a good way to describe it. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's go over some of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that’s about it. Nothing major. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I do have Medicare, obviously, as I’m getting… well, older. But no ongoing health problems.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And what about any surgeries besides your tonsils?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing else. Just the tonsils when I was little. I've never had any accidents or anything that required surgery. I’m pretty careful, I think. Well, relatively careful.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, thinking about your family history – are there any instances of memory loss, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease on either side of your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me think… My grandmother, on my mother's side, she… she did get pretty confused towards the end of her life. It was a long time ago, so I don't remember a lot of details. I think they said something about “hardening of the arteries” or something like that? It wasn’t officially diagnosed as Alzheimer's, as far as I know. My mother always said she just got “old.” My father's side… I don't really know. He wasn't very close to his family, and we didn't talk about it much. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Any information you have is helpful. It sounds like there might be a possible family history of cognitive decline, which is good to be aware of. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: Oh, I barely take anything. Just a multivitamin every day. And sometimes I'll take ibuprofen for headaches, but that's about it. Nothing regular, nothing strong. I'm not a fan of taking pills unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, occasionally. I'll have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, or a beer if I'm out with friends. Nothing excessive, though. Maybe a couple of times a week, at most. Definitely not every day. I’m not a big drinker, really.
DOCTOR: And do you smoke or use any other tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother smoked, and I hated it, so I just… never started. I try to stay healthy, even if my memory is failing me!
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Okay, one final question, Ebony. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, none that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I'm pretty lucky in that department, I guess. Is that all? I feel like I've told you my life story!
DOCTOR: No, that was perfect. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a general sense of things. We'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and do a quick neurological assessment – just some simple tests to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Let's get on with it, then. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat on the table for me, that would be great. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Okay, just relax your arm for me… Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you please cross your legs and let your arms fall relaxed?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just let me know if I need to do anything. I'm not very good at this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let's check your balance. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Alright, standing up… Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, close your eyes and extend your arms out to the sides. Just try to stand still for a moment. Alright, good. Now, could you walk a straight line for me, heel-to-toe, for about ten steps?
PATIENT: Okay, eyes closed… arms out… this is a bit nerve-wracking! Alright, I'm ready to walk now.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Walking appears stable, though slightly cautious. No significant deviations noted. Okay, please stop there. Okay, that was helpful. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple memory questions, just to get a baseline. Don't worry, they're not difficult. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Okay, that wasn't so bad. Memory questions, huh? Um… let me see… it's 2025, isn't it? August 2nd, 2025?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. Excellent. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Okay, go ahead. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Okay… um… apple… table… and… penny. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Now, I’m going to ask you to draw a clock, showing the time as 10 minutes past eleven. I have a piece of paper and a pen here. Just take your time and do your best.
PATIENT: Okay… a clock… and it needs to be ten minutes past eleven… There you go. I hope it's not too bad! It's been a while since I had to draw a clock.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ebony. Alright, based on what we've discussed and the brief assessment, it's difficult to give a definitive diagnosis at this point. Your memory lapses are concerning enough to warrant further investigation, but the physical exam was normal, and you did well on the initial cognitive tests. There are a number of potential causes for memory changes – stress, vitamin deficiencies, medication side effects, and early stages of cognitive impairment are all possibilities. I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’d also like to schedule you for a more comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation with a specialist. This will give us a better understanding of your cognitive abilities and help determine the cause of your memory issues. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. I appreciate you not jumping to conclusions. Blood tests and a specialist… that seems like a good plan. I just want to know what's going on, and figure out what I can do about it, if anything. So yes, please. Let's do the blood tests and schedule me for the evaluation. The sooner the better, if possible.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write you a referral for the neuropsychological evaluation right away. They’re quite good at the clinic downtown, and their wait times are usually reasonable. The lab results should be back within a week. I'll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for us once the results are in, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, try to maintain a healthy lifestyle – get enough sleep, eat a balanced diet, and stay mentally active. Regular exercise can also be beneficial. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything. That all sounds very thorough, and I feel much better knowing we're taking it seriously. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient. I'll keep you posted if anything changes or if I think of any other questions.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ebony. It's my pleasure. Remember, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns at all. My assistant will come in shortly with the referral and information about the blood tests. Have a good day, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
