DOCTOR: Right. Jase Nahrwold. Twenty years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It’s… my stomach. It’s been, well, not good. Lots of… going to the bathroom. Like, a lot. It’s been happening for a little while now, I think? It’s hard to say exactly how long. A few weeks, maybe? I just… keep running to the toilet.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. And “not good” and “a lot.” Right. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… okay. It’s… diarrhea. Really watery. And it’s not just once or twice a day. It’s… throughout the day. Like, after everything I eat, pretty much. It’s… exhausting, honestly. I’m sorry, this is probably gross. I just… don’t know what’s going on. I feel fine otherwise, usually. Just… this.
DOCTOR: Exhausting, yes. Well, these things are disruptive. Any fever, nausea, or vomiting accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And I haven’t thrown up, thankfully. I get a little queasy sometimes, but that doesn’t last long. It’s mostly just… the running. And feeling really weak, because I’m… well, you know. Losing a lot. I’m not sure if that makes sense. Is it bad that I don’t remember exactly when it started? I’ve been so busy… with work and everything.
DOCTOR: “Busy.” Right. Well, it’s not ideal to let things go on for weeks without seeking attention. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Um… I don’t think so. I mean, I haven’t looked, not really. I know that sounds awful, but I just… get up and go, you know? I haven’t paid attention. Is that something I should be doing? Sorry, I’m not very good at this. I don't usually go to doctors.
DOCTOR: It is advisable to observe your stool when experiencing prolonged diarrhea. However, we won’t dwell on that now. Any recent travel?
PATIENT: Travel? No, not really. Just to work and back. I haven’t been on a vacation or anything in… a long time. I work at… well, it’s sales. Mostly on the phone. So, not traveling anywhere exciting. Does that matter? I don’t think I’ve eaten anything weird either. At least, nothing I can think of.
DOCTOR: Sales, you say. And no recent travel. Hmm. Any changes to your diet lately?
PATIENT: Changes… not really. I try to eat healthy, mostly. My husband does the cooking, and he’s pretty good about it. We have a lot of… Pakistani food, of course. Rice, daal, vegetables… sometimes meat. Nothing new, I don’t think. Oh! Wait… maybe a little more dairy lately? He's been making a lot of lassi. Is that… could that be it? I don't know. I haven't really thought about it.
DOCTOR: Lassi. Possibly. It could be a temporary intolerance. We’ll need to rule out other possibilities, of course. Let me have a listen to your abdomen. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay. Sure. Is… is there something seriously wrong? I mean, you seem… worried. Should I be calling my husband?
DOCTOR: Don't jump to conclusions. We are simply being thorough. Now, lie down, please. I need to listen to your stomach. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just… let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m not very good with… this sort of thing. I get nervous easily.
DOCTOR: Breathing normally. No obvious distention or tenderness. Bowel sounds… slightly hyperactive. Nothing alarming, but not entirely normal either. Now, I'm going to check your hydration. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Okay. Is… is this going to hurt? I’m always scared of needles. My husband always makes fun of me. He says I’m such a baby. But it really bothers me.
DOCTOR: It’s a very small prick. Barely noticeable. It's simply to assess your fluid levels. Try to relax. There. All done. It’s a routine test, don't worry. We'll send it to the lab for analysis. Now, sit up. We’ll wait for the results. It should be fairly quick.
PATIENT: Okay. That wasn’t too bad, actually. It just… makes me feel a bit faint sometimes. Will the results tell us what's wrong? Is it something serious? My husband… he’s been working a lot lately, and I don’t want to worry him if it’s nothing.
DOCTOR: The results will give us a clearer picture. It could be a simple infection, or perhaps a food intolerance, as we discussed. We'll rule out more serious possibilities as well. It's best not to speculate until we have the data. In the meantime, I suggest a bland diet. Rice, toast, bananas. And plenty of fluids. Avoid dairy for now, just to be safe. We'll have the results within the hour. Then we can discuss a plan.
PATIENT: Okay. Bland diet. Rice, toast, bananas. No dairy. My husband makes good rice. He’ll be glad to hear that. So… should I just sit here and wait? Is there a waiting room? I don't want to bother anyone.
DOCTOR: There is a waiting room. I will call you when the results are available. Try to relax. Don't worry excessively. It's through there, to the left.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. I’ll just… wait in the waiting room then. .
