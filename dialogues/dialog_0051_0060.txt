DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Glazewski. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t usually do this whole doctor thing, frankly. But my mother… well, she keeps pushing me. Family history, you know? Lots of heart trouble on her side. I’m perfectly healthy, as far as I can tell. Just want to get it over with and prove her wrong, really. Get a clean bill of health and she’ll finally leave me alone.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's good you’re being proactive, even if it’s mostly to reassure your mother. Family history is important, and it's wise to be aware of potential risks. So, just to be clear, you’re not currently experiencing any specific symptoms or concerns?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I run every morning, eat… reasonably well. I’m an engineer, you know? We like things… optimized. I just feel… I don’t know, a general anxiety about it, I guess. My grandfather died young of a heart attack, and my aunt had bypass surgery. It’s just… looming, if that makes sense. And my mother won't stop talking about it.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Theriot. That’s a perfectly valid reason to want a check-up, and it sounds like you’re being very responsible. Knowing your family history and wanting to be preventative is excellent. Let’s go through a bit of your medical background, just to get a clearer picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, even something minor?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, obviously. And I broke my arm once, playing cricket. Beyond that… no. Nothing a bit of antiseptic and a cast couldn't fix. I haven’t really needed to see a doctor before, to be honest. I keep myself in good shape. I don’t get sick. It’s… inefficient.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Very efficient, indeed! Alright. Any surgeries in the past – even the broken arm, was it repaired with surgery?
PATIENT: No, the arm just… healed. It was a clean break, thankfully. No pins, no plates, nothing. Just a really annoying cast for six weeks. Honestly, the itching was the worst part. Not a fan of hospitals, you know? Too many germs. And the waiting rooms… terrible magazines.
DOCTOR: I understand completely about the waiting rooms! Alright, good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family besides the heart trouble – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. My uncle, on my mother’s side, had… something with his kidneys, I think. Dialysis, maybe? And my grandmother, the one who didn’t have heart trouble, had arthritis. Really bad, towards the end. She could barely move. Other than that… not that I’m aware of. My mother keeps very detailed records, though, so it's possible she’ll think of something later. She’s… meticulous. And enjoys being right.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I get all my nutrients from my diet. Vitamins are… a waste of money, frankly. And I don't believe in relying on pharmaceuticals unless it's absolutely necessary. I'd rather focus on preventative measures. Eat well, exercise, get enough sleep. That’s my philosophy. It’s… logical.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Mr. Theriot. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, like pollen or latex?
PATIENT: No allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m quite… robust, as I said before. My mother tried to get me tested for pollen allergies when I was a kid because I spent so much time outdoors, but the results were negative. She just likes to worry, that woman. Honestly, it’s exhausting. Is this going to take much longer? I have a calibration meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Almost finished with the initial questions, Mr. Theriot. Just a couple more. Now, are you a smoker?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no. Absolutely not. Smoking is… illogical. Terrible for your lungs, terrible for your heart, terrible for everything. It's a completely self-destructive habit. I find it quite baffling, frankly, that anyone would willingly do it. It’s… inefficient. And unpleasant. Do I need to explain why I don’t smoke? It seems rather obvious.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Theriot, it's perfectly clear. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe, on a Saturday night. Nothing excessive. I don't enjoy getting… impaired. It interferes with my cognitive function. And I don't have the time for hangovers. It’s… unproductive. Really, I only drink it if it’s a particularly good vintage. My friend, Rohan, is a sommelier, and he sometimes brings over interesting bottles. Otherwise, I stick to water.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. That’s very helpful. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it’s quick. I really do need to get back to the lab. I have some simulations to run, and they require my undivided attention. And please, be gentle. I'm not exactly comfortable with… poking and prodding. But if it’s necessary to appease my mother, I suppose I can endure it. Just… try not to take too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Theriot. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. If you could just sit up here for me. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, good and strong. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 120 over 80. Good. Now, let’s just take a quick look at your ears. Everything looks clear in there. And just open your mouth and say “Ah.” Throat looks clear as well. Overall, everything seems normal. But to be thorough, I think it's best to do a simple EKG, just to get a baseline reading of your heart's electrical activity and a blood test to look at your cholesterol and other key indicators. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An EKG and a blood test? Really? It seems… excessive, frankly. Is it absolutely necessary? I thought you said everything seemed normal. I'm starting to suspect my mother orchestrated this entire thing. She probably told you I was exhibiting some sort of… hidden symptoms. Look, I'm a perfectly healthy individual. I don't need a bunch of tests just to appease her anxiety. Can’t we just… skip it? I’m losing valuable lab time as we speak.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Theriot. And you’re right, physically, everything does seem normal. But as you mentioned, your family history is significant. An EKG and blood test aren't about finding something wrong right now, but about establishing a baseline for future comparison. If something were to develop down the line, we'd have a much better idea of what's normal for you. Think of it like preventative maintenance for a complex machine. It doesn't mean it's broken, but it helps us identify potential issues before they become serious. And while your mother’s concerns are valid, my recommendations are based on my professional judgment, and what I believe is best for your overall health. It’s a relatively quick procedure, and the information it provides can be very valuable. I wouldn't recommend it if I didn’t think it was worthwhile. It's less about pleasing your mother, and more about proactive care. Would you be willing to reconsider?
PATIENT: Fine. But I'm blaming you when my simulations fall behind schedule. And I expect a very detailed explanation of every single test result. I don't want any jargon, either. Explain it to me like I'm five years old. And if everything comes back normal, I'm never coming back to a doctor's office again. Do we have a deal? And how long is this going to take? I have a calibration meeting at 2 PM. It's critical.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Theriot. A deal. And I promise, no jargon – I’ll explain everything in plain language, as clearly as possible. The EKG will take just a few minutes – we’ll attach some small stickers to your chest, and it’ll record your heart’s electrical activity. Then, we’ll just need a small blood sample. The lab results will take a few days to come back, and I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes. Let's get started with the EKG. If you could just lie back for me…
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But if those stickers pull on my skin, I'm holding you personally responsible for the discomfort. And please, be quick. My time is valuable. I have complex algorithms to optimize, you know. This is a complete waste of a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. This won’t take long at all. Just relax, and try to breathe normally. It's just recording your heart's rhythm for a few minutes. Don't worry about feeling anything, it’s completely painless. It's just capturing information. Now, let's get you comfortable while we wait for the reading to finish. Everything looks good so far. Just a few more moments.
PATIENT: Is there… any chance this machine is malfunctioning? It feels like it’s picking up interference from something. Or maybe it's just my own internal processes. My brain is quite active, you know. It’s constantly processing data. Perhaps it’s skewing the results. I read an article once about electromagnetic fields disrupting medical equipment. It's a possibility, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: That's a valid question, Mr. Theriot. And it’s good you’re thinking about potential factors. We take steps to minimize interference – we're using shielded equipment, and there are no strong electromagnetic sources nearby. The reading looks clean and stable – it doesn't appear to be picking up any extraneous signals. It’s likely just the normal electrical activity of your heart, and perhaps a little bit of muscle tension while you’re concentrating. Almost finished. Just a few more seconds. You can relax now, everything is going well. Once we have the reading, we'll quickly get you a blood sample and you'll be all set.
PATIENT: Fine. But if this test comes back inconclusive because of “muscle tension,” I’m requesting a full refund. And I’m writing a strongly worded letter to the hospital administrator about the sub-optimal conditions. My lab time is extremely valuable, you know. This entire process is incredibly inefficient. Is it… almost done? My meeting starts in less than an hour. And I haven't even had my green tea yet. It's critical for focus.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. It's done. The reading looks good – clear and stable. Now, we just need a quick blood sample. It'll only take a few minutes. I’ll have the nurse come in and take that for you, and then you’ll be free to go. We’ll send the results to you as soon as they're available. And don't worry, we'll make sure it doesn't impact your meeting schedule. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable while we wait for the nurse?
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. Quickly and efficiently, please. And make sure she uses a small needle. I have a slight aversion to… sharp objects. It’s… illogical, I know, but it’s a valid concern. And please, tell her to be gentle. I don't want a bruise. That would completely disrupt my calibration process. And… is there any chance I can have a glass of water while she’s doing it? My throat is getting dry from all this… stress. It’s a perfectly reasonable request, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Theriot. I’ll let the nurse know about your aversion to needles and to be as gentle as possible. And yes, a glass of water is no problem at all. I’ll get one for you right now. Nurse Patel, could you come in for a blood draw, please?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry. My calibration meeting… it's crucial. And please, tell the nurse not to engage in small talk. I don't have time for pleasantries. Just get the sample and be done with it. This entire process is… profoundly inefficient. Is there any chance I can listen to calming music during the draw? Perhaps some Bach? It's scientifically proven to reduce anxiety, you know.
DOCTOR: I'll see if we can get some calming music set up for you, Mr. Theriot. Nurse Patel, this is Mr. Theriot. He’s just having a quick blood draw. He would prefer a gentle touch, and if possible, we could put on some calming music to help him relax. Nurse Patel will explain the procedure to you, Mr. Theriot. Don’t hesitate to let her know if you’re feeling any discomfort.
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. Quickly and efficiently. And please, do not ask me how my day is going. I haven't got time for trivialities. And make sure you use a new needle. I read an article once about… contamination. It’s a valid concern, you know. This entire process is… profoundly unsettling. And tell me exactly how much blood you're taking. I need to know the volume. It's a perfectly reasonable request, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Nurse Patel is very experienced and follows all safety protocols, Mr. Theriot. She'll be using a brand new, sterile needle, and will only be taking a small sample – about two or three vials, which is standard for these tests. She can explain the procedure to you in detail before she begins. Nurse Patel?
PATIENT: Just… do it. Quickly. And please, do not look at me. It's… unsettling. And if I feel any pain, I want to be informed immediately. This entire process is… profoundly inefficient and deeply unpleasant. And… is there any chance I can have a distraction? Perhaps a complicated mathematical equation to solve? It might take my mind off things. Although, I suspect it will only increase my anxiety. This entire situation is… illogical.
DOCTOR: Just take deep breaths, Mr. Theriot. You’re doing great. Nurse Patel will let you know when she's starting, and she's very gentle. Remember, this won’t take long. If you need anything at all, just let me know.
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. Quickly. And please, do not engage in small talk. I have complex algorithms to optimize, you know. This entire process is… profoundly inefficient and deeply unpleasant. And… is there any chance I can have a distraction? Perhaps a complicated physics problem to solve? It might take my mind off things. Although, I suspect it will only increase my anxiety. This entire situation is… illogical. And… is it done yet? I feel a slight tingling sensation. Is that normal? This is… profoundly unsettling.
DOCTOR: Almost done, Mr. Theriot. You’re doing very well. That tingling sensation is perfectly normal – it just means the blood is flowing. Just a few more seconds. Just focus on your breathing. You’re doing great.
PATIENT: Finally. It's... over? Is it really over? This entire process was… profoundly unsettling. And profoundly inefficient. And… is there any chance I can have a glass of water? And perhaps a small snack? I feel slightly… faint. And… is there any chance I can have a stress ball? Or a complicated mathematical equation to solve? Or perhaps a calming video of fractal patterns? This entire situation was… profoundly unpleasant. And… is there any chance I can have a full refund? This entire process was… profoundly inefficient.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's all over now, Mr. Theriot. You did great. Here, drink this water. And have a little something to eat. You're feeling a little shaken up, which is perfectly normal. Just take a few deep breaths and relax. We can discuss your anxiety later if you'd like. And regarding a refund, let me check with the billing department. We want to make sure you're completely satisfied. Right now, just focus on getting comfortable. You're doing great.
PATIENT: Fine. But… is there any chance I can have a stress ball? Or a complicated mathematical equation to solve? Or perhaps a calming video of fractal patterns? This entire situation was… profoundly unpleasant. And… is there any chance I can have a full refund? This entire process was… profoundly inefficient. And… is there any chance I can have a written apology from the nurse? For the… traumatic experience? This entire situation was… profoundly upsetting. And… is there any chance I can have a detailed explanation of the blood test results? In plain language, of course. I don't want any jargon. And… is there any chance I can have a complimentary stress test? To assess the damage? This entire situation was… profoundly unsettling.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, I understand you’re feeling very upset, and I want to assure you that we take your concerns very seriously. We can absolutely provide you with a stress ball. And I can find a calming video of fractal patterns for you to watch. Regarding a full refund, let me check with the billing department. And I will personally ensure that you receive a detailed explanation of the blood test results in plain language, with no jargon. We can also schedule a complimentary stress test to assess your overall well-being. I want to assure you that we’re here to support you. Right now, just focus on taking a few deep breaths and relaxing. We’re going to take care of everything. You've been very brave.
PATIENT: Fine. But… can I have the stress ball now? And the calming video of fractal patterns? And the written apology from the nurse? And… is there any chance I can have a complimentary massage? To soothe my nerves? This entire situation was… profoundly traumatic. And… is there any chance I can have a complimentary green tea? It's crucial for focus, you know. This entire situation was… profoundly upsetting. And… is there any chance I can have a detailed explanation of the blood test results before the blood test is even done? It's a perfectly reasonable request, isn't it? And… is there any chance I can have a full refund for the emotional distress? This entire situation was… profoundly inefficient.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, I understand you’re feeling very anxious, and I want to assure you that we’re here to support you. We can absolutely provide you with a stress ball and a calming video of fractal patterns right now. Regarding a written apology from the nurse, I will certainly discuss that with her. However, I want to assure you that she acted professionally and followed all safety protocols. I understand you're experiencing significant emotional distress, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to support you. We can also schedule a complimentary consultation with a therapist to discuss your anxiety and provide you with coping strategies.
