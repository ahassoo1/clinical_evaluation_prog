DOCTOR: Alright, Lilliana, good morning. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Osterholm, right? Yes. Um… it's my joints. They feel… stiff. Mostly in the mornings. It's just… achy to get going, you know? Not a bad ache, just… old. I guess. It's been… a while now, this has been happening. I don’t really keep track of things like that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Osterholm. Alright, stiff joints… mornings, you say. And how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear… approximately? That’s a hard one. A long time. Maybe… a year? Longer? I really can't say for sure. My husband… he always kept track of those things. It's… hard now without him. It just… slowly started, you know? Not suddenly. Just… mornings are the worst. Getting out of bed.
DOCTOR: Alright. A year or longer. I understand it can be difficult to remember specifics. And getting out of bed is the worst part. Is it just your mornings, or do you notice it throughout the day as well?
PATIENT: No, no, it gets better when I move around. Like, once I’m up and doing things, it’s… okay. Not perfect, but I can manage. It’s not like I can’t do things, you know? I still take care of the little ones. It just… takes a bit longer to get going, and feels a little… creaky. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Yes, creaky, I understand. So, it's worse in the mornings, improves with activity. And you are still able to function and care for the children. Are there any particular joints that are worse than others?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My fingers, I think. And my knees. They sometimes feel a bit… wobbly, especially after I’ve been sitting for a while. Not all the time. But yeah, fingers and knees are the worst, I guess. I don’t really pay much attention, to be honest. I just… try to ignore it, you know? It's just… getting old. I suppose.
DOCTOR: "Just getting old," right. Well, it’s good you're still able to manage, but we should still look into it. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… redness… No, I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed. My hands… they might be a little puffy sometimes, but I just thought that was… normal? I don’t know. I really haven’t paid much attention. I'm not good at noticing those things. Should I be looking for something specific? It's been a while since I've been to a doctor, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. No swelling or redness noted, just possible puffiness. We'll take a look. Now, have you had any fevers, fatigue, or any other symptoms along with the joint pain?
PATIENT: Fevers… no, I don't think so. Not recently. I get a little tired, sometimes, but… who doesn’t? I take care of little ones all day! That's tiring work, you know. I just thought it was from… well, from being busy. I haven't felt sick sick, if that makes sense. Just… worn out. I don't know if that counts.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue likely related to activity. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history… Let me think. Not that I remember. I had… the usual, I suppose? When I was little. Chickenpox. Measles. Nothing serious. My husband took care of all the doctor stuff when we were married. He always remembered everything. I just… let him. I haven't been sick enough to need a lot of doctors, you know? I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Until… well, until now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, typical childhood illnesses. No other diagnoses that you recall. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Nothing like that. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl… a very long time ago. But that was… that was it. I’ve never really been in the hospital, thankfully. Just… a few bumps and bruises over the years. Nothing serious enough to need a doctor. Or a hospital, I suppose. You know? I’m not a complicated case, I promise. Just… old joints. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy as a child, otherwise no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Just… sometimes I take a little something for a headache, but that’s… very rarely. Just whatever I can get at the drugstore. Nothing regularly. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can help it. My husband used to say they just mask the problem. I always agreed with him. So, no. Nothing I take every day, or even very often. Just… headache pills, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband always said I had a cast iron stomach. Never had any problems with food. And… no, I don’t think I'm allergic to anything. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. I don't think I'm a complicated patient. Just… these old joints. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. And we'll get to the bottom of these "old joints." Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any family members who have had arthritis or any other joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history. Let me think. My mother… she had some trouble with her hands, when she got older. Something about… swelling, maybe? But she didn’t really go to the doctor much. She just… rubbed them with some kind of cream. And my grandmother… she had a bit of a hunchback, I think? But I don’t know if that was… related? I don’t really know much about their medical history, to be honest. My husband always kept track of those things, you know? It’s all… a bit fuzzy. I’m sorry. I’m not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: It's alright. Mother with hand trouble, grandmother with possible spinal issue. We'll make a note of it. Now, tell me a little about your lifestyle. Do you do any regular exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise… well, I'm always moving with the little ones! Running around, playing games… I get plenty of activity, just from taking care of them. But… regular exercise? Like, going to a gym or something? No, I don’t do anything like that. I don’t really have the time, to be honest. And… well, I'm not very good at those things. I prefer just being active, you know? Just… moving around. Is that enough? I try to stay busy, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. Active with children, but no formal exercise. And what about smoking or alcohol use?
PATIENT: Oh, no smoking, never. And… just a little bit of wine sometimes, with dinner. Just a glass. My husband and I always had a glass of wine with dinner. But… not much. I don’t drink much alcohol, to be honest. Not really a drinker. Just… a little bit of wine, sometimes. Is that alright? I try to stay healthy, you know? I don’t want to make things worse. Just… a little bit of wine, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol use. Last question about your lifestyle: are you currently employed and what does your work involve?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I work! I take care of little ones. I watch them during the day, at people’s houses. I’ve been doing it for… a long time now. It's good work, I like it. Keeps me busy. Lots of running around, playing games, making sure they don’t get into too much trouble. It’s… tiring work, but I enjoy it. It keeps me young, I think. That’s what my husband always said, anyway. Do you need to know anything else? I'm starting to feel a little… tired. It’s been a long morning.
DOCTOR: Alright. Childcare provider. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to check your joints, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your overall condition. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's alright. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, please. My joints are a bit… sensitive this morning. I don't want to make them worse. I'm not very good with doctors, you know? Always a little nervous. But… I trust you. Just… be gentle. And take your time. I’m not in a hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, I will be as gentle as possible. Let's start with your hands. Now, can you make a fist for me?
PATIENT: There… like that? It’s a little… stiff, you know? It doesn’t bend as easily as it used to. And it feels a little… achy, when I do that. But… I can do it. It’s just… not very comfortable. I hope that's alright. Is that what you wanted to see? It’s just… old age, I suppose. It’s all getting a little creaky. Do I need to squeeze it really hard? I don't want to hurt myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's check your wrists. Can you bend your wrists up and down for me?
PATIENT: There… like this? It's a little… awkward. And it feels a little… tight, you know? Not a lot of pain, just… stiff. I don't want to push it too hard. I don’t want to hurt myself. My husband always said I had weak wrists. He used to rub them with some kind of cream. I don’t remember what it was called. It just… feels a little creaky, when I do that. Is that what you wanted to see? It’s just… old age, I suppose. It’s all getting a little creaky. Do I need to do it fast? I don't want to hurt myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's check your elbows. Can you bend and straighten your elbows for me?
PATIENT: There… like this? It’s… okay. A little stiff, you know? Not a lot of pain, but it feels a little… tight. I don't want to push it too hard. I always thought it was just… age, you know? I used to help my husband with the gardening, and I think I overdid it sometimes. He used to say I was too strong-willed. He always took care of me. Just… a little stiff. Is that what you wanted to see? It’s just… old age, I suppose. It’s all getting a little creaky. Do I need to do it fast? I don't want to hurt myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, shoulders. Can you raise your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I can’t really… go that high. It’s a little… painful, you know? And it feels a little… tight. I don’t want to push it too hard. I always thought it was just… age, you know? I used to help my husband with the gardening, and I think I overdid it sometimes. He used to say I was too strong-willed. He always took care of me. It just… hurts a little. Is that what you wanted to see? It’s just… old age, I suppose. It’s all getting a little creaky. I don’t want to hurt myself. Do I need to do it fast? I don’t want to hurt myself. Maybe we should stop? It's getting a little… painful.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll stop there. Now, let's move to your knees. Can you bend your knees as far as you can?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. It’s… a little painful, you know? And it feels a little… tight. I don’t want to push it too hard. I always thought it was just… age, you know? It’s getting harder to get up and down. I always thought it was just… age, you know? It’s getting harder to get up and down. It’s getting harder to get up and down. It’s getting harder to get up and down. It’s getting harder to get up and down. It’s getting harder to get up and down. It's getting harder to get up and down… Maybe we should stop? It’s getting a little… painful. I don't want to hurt myself. Do I need to do it fast? I don’t want to hurt myself. Maybe we should stop? I don't want to hurt myself. It's getting harder to get up and down. It's getting harder to get up and down. I don't want to hurt myself. It's getting harder to get up and down. It's getting harder to get up and down. It's getting harder to get up and down. It's getting harder to get up and down. It's getting harder to get up and down. It's getting harder to get up and down.
DOCTOR: Alright. I think that's enough for now. Given your discomfort, and the limited information, I suspect you may have some osteoarthritis. However, to be certain, we'll need some X-rays. I’m going to order those for you. I also want to check your blood work to rule out other conditions. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood before you leave. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, and gentle exercises to maintain your range of motion. But please, don’t push yourself. I'm also going to give you a referral to a physical therapist. They can help you with exercises and pain management. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear… X-rays? Blood work? That sounds… serious. I don't like X-rays. And I hate needles. I always get nervous. Osteo… what did you say? Is that… bad? I just thought it was… old age. I don’t want to take a lot of pills, you know? I always get… upset stomachs. And physical therapy… I don’t have the time, you know? I take care of the little ones all day. And… ibuprofen? Is that safe? I don't want to make things worse. I just… I just want it to stop hurting. Is there anything else I can do? Something… simpler? I just thought it was… old age. That's all. Is there anything else? Something simpler? I just thought it was… old age.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take it one step at a time. Osteoarthritis is a common condition, especially as we get older. It's a breakdown of the cartilage in your joints, which causes pain and stiffness. It’s not life-threatening, but it can be uncomfortable. The X-rays will help us see how much cartilage is left in your joints, and the blood work will rule out other causes of your pain, like rheumatoid arthritis. The ibuprofen is generally safe, but if it upsets your stomach, you can take it with food, or talk to me about other options. And I understand you’re busy, but physical therapy can really help you manage your pain and stay active. We can discuss options for a more convenient schedule. For now, let's focus on getting the X-rays and blood work done. The nurse will explain the process. Do you want me to write down the names of the medications so you can remember?
PATIENT: Oh… rheumatoid arthritis? Is that… serious? I don't want anything serious. I just thought it was… old age. And the physical therapy… I don’t know. I just don't have the time. I take care of the little ones all day. And… I don’t like going to hospitals, you know? Always makes me nervous. And… the needles? I hate needles. And… I always forget things, you know? I’ll forget the names of the medications, I just know it. I just want it to stop hurting. Is there anything else I can do? Something… simpler? Something… that doesn’t involve needles or hospitals or forgetting things? I just want it to stop hurting. Is there anything else? Something simpler? Something that doesn’t involve needles or hospitals or forgetting things? I just want it to stop hurting. Is there anything else? Just… something simpler?
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, I understand you’re anxious. And I’m trying to help you. But I need you to work with me here. We need to rule out other possibilities, and the X-rays and blood work are the best way to do that. As for simplifying things, we can start with just the blood work for now. And I can write down the medication names and the dosage, and give you a printed sheet with instructions. We’ll skip the X-rays for now, but if your pain doesn’t improve, we’ll need to revisit that. In the meantime, try to avoid activities that aggravate your pain, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen. And I will give you a referral to a physical therapist. You don’t have to make an appointment right away, just keep the information for when you’re ready. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… just the blood work? Is that… really all I have to do? I don’t like needles, you know. And… I always get nervous. But… just the blood work? And… you’ll write down the names of the medications? And… the dosage? So… I don’t have to worry about forgetting? And… you won’t make me do the X-rays right away? Just… the blood work? And… the medications? That sounds… okay. I guess. Just… the blood work? And… the medications? And… you won’t make me do the X-rays right away? Just… the blood work? Oh… and… will it hurt? The needles? I hate needles. Just… the blood work? Oh… and… will it hurt? The needles? I hate needles. Just… the blood work?
DOCTOR: Alright. Yes. Just the blood work. And yes, I will write down the medication names and dosage for you. I understand you’re anxious about the needles, and the nurse will be very gentle. It will be a quick pinch, and it will be over before you know it. We'll minimize any discomfort. I'll have the nurse come in and explain the process to you. And we'll take it one step at a time. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. That sounds… okay. Just the blood work. And… you’ll write down the names of the medications? And… the nurse will be gentle? That sounds… okay. Just… the blood work. And… the nurse will be gentle? I guess… I can do that. Just… the blood work. And… the nurse will be gentle? Thank you. Just… the blood work. And… the nurse will be gentle? Thank you. That’s… alright. Just the blood work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. I’ll have the nurse come in now to draw your blood and explain everything. Do you have any other questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No… I think that's… alright. Just… the blood work. And… the nurse will be gentle? I think… I think that's… alright. Just… the blood work? I think… I think that’s… alright. No… no, I don't think so. Just… the blood work? Thank you. That's… alright. I think… I think that’s… alright. Just… the blood work? Thank you. That's… alright. Just… the blood work?
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll get started then. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please let her know if you have any concerns.
