DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. It's good to meet you. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, finally. Look, I haven’t got all day. It's about this…procedure. My daughter insisted I get a check-up beforehand. Says the surgeon needs it. Frankly, I think it’s a waste of time, but here I am.
DOCTOR: Right, yes, the pre-operative assessment. Your daughter sounds… thorough. Just to be clear, you’re here for clearance for a scheduled procedure?
PATIENT: Is that really necessary to ask? Yes, clearance. For the face. It's… sagging. Needs a little tightening. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about, but she’s paying for it. So, here we are. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. A facelift. And your daughter is covering the cost, that's good to know. Just so I have a complete picture, have you been feeling generally healthy?
PATIENT: As healthy as an eighty-one year old man can be, I suppose. I walk every morning – well, a short walk. And I eat my vegetables. No complaints, really. Never been one for sitting around feeling sorry for myself. Unlike some people.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Orwin. Staying active is wonderful. Now, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, I had my appendix out when I was a boy. Ages ago. And a bad knee, but that was fixed… twenty years ago, maybe? Nothing since. A few bumps and bruises, naturally. What do you take me for, a porcelain doll?
DOCTOR: Appendix removal and knee repair. Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Orwin?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure. Small dose. Doctor Hansen prescribes it. And… that's it. Honestly, I barely even remember taking it half the time. My daughter reminds me. She's very… organized.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication prescribed by Dr. Hansen. Do you happen to know the name of it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Names are… unimportant. A little white pill. That's all I need to know. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I've got a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. A small white pill for blood pressure. We'll get this sorted quickly. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I'm aware of. I eat everything. Used to work with stone, you know. Terrazzo. Dusty work. Never had a reaction to anything. Though, my skin is a bit sensitive these days… But that's just old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you mentioned working with stone... how long ago did you stop that work?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It was… twenty years ago, maybe more. After my wife passed. Couldn't keep up with the physical work anymore. It was… demanding. A different life, that was.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, twenty years ago. Now, before we proceed with clearance for your surgery, I'd like to just do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam, of course. More wasted time. Fine. Get it over with. Just… don’t poke around too much. I haven't got all day, you know. And be gentle!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. A quick exam, just to be thorough. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me... Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is audible. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, I’ll check your blood pressure… 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not unexpected. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Overall, you appear to be in stable condition. Now, would you mind stepping onto the scale for me, just to get your current weight?
PATIENT: Scale? Really? Must you? Fine, fine. But don't stare. It’s a sensitive subject. There. Happy now? Just get on with it. Don’t want to be here all afternoon.
DOCTOR: 125 pounds. Thank you, Mr. Orwin. Now, before we finalize the clearance, I just want to ask a few more quick questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family had any significant health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… Goodness. My mother lived to be ninety, healthy as a horse. My father… died young, I think. Heart something, maybe? It was a long time ago. And my sister… she had some sort of… female trouble. But that was… private. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to family history. It's all very… depressing. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: Alright. Mother healthy, father died young – possible heart condition, sister with unspecified female trouble. It’s good to have some idea, Mr. Orwin. Now, are there any other concerns you have, or anything else you think I should know before I give you clearance for your surgery?
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite impatient. And slightly foolish. A perfectly healthy eighty-one year old man being poked and prodded. It's ridiculous. I just want to get this done and get on with my life. So, if you're finished, tell me if I'm cleared or not. I have a lunch date, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Based on the information you've provided and my brief examination, I can provisionally clear you for your facelift. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and I do recommend you follow up with Dr. Hansen to ensure it’s well-controlled before the procedure. Also, the murmur I detected warrants a possible echocardiogram, just to be on the safe side. Would you be amenable to scheduling those appointments?
PATIENT: Echocardiogram? Appointments? Oh, for goodness sake. No. Absolutely not. I told you, I don't want any more poking and prodding. Dr. Hansen is perfectly capable of handling my blood pressure. I'll talk to him. Just… give me the paperwork. I'm cleared, you say? Good. Let’s get this over with. I've wasted enough of my day already. Where do I sign? .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Here's the pre-operative clearance form. Please review it carefully, and sign at the bottom. And do try to follow up with Dr. Hansen regarding your blood pressure. It's important. Do you have any questions before you leave?
