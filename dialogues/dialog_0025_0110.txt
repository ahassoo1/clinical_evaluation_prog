DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Please, call me Nicoletta. It’s lovely to meet you. Well, I suppose you could say I’m here for a little...revitalizing. I’m getting on in years, you see, and I just want to feel a bit more like myself again. A sort of jumpstart, if you will. I want to be able to keep up with my great-grandchildren, and honestly, just have more energy throughout the day. Is that...does that make sense?
DOCTOR: "Revitalizing," hmm?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s a good way to put it. It's not that I'm sick, understand. I don’t have any aches or pains that are bothering me terribly, and my regular doctor says my check-ups are generally good. But…well, I feel old. And a little tired. And I’d like to do something about it, if possible. I used to be so much more active, you see. I taught kindergarten for years, and then elementary school… kept me on my feet! Now… it’s just harder.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no specific complaints, just a general feeling of decreased energy and…a desire to feel more youthful. And your regular doctor hasn't found anything concerning in routine bloodwork or exams?
PATIENT: No, nothing concerning. Dr. Ramirez is very thorough. She checks everything annually, and always says I’m remarkably healthy for my age, which I appreciate, of course. But she also says… well, she says aging is natural. Which it is, I know. But I thought perhaps you might have some ideas. Things to do, maybe? Or supplements? I don’t know. I just thought you might have some…current information. I read things, you see, but it’s so confusing these days.
DOCTOR: Well, Dr. Ramirez is right – aging is natural. And frankly, a lot of what’s advertised as a “jumpstart” is…well, let’s just say it’s often more marketing than medicine. But, we can certainly explore things. Let's start with a more detailed history. Tell me about your typical day. From the moment you wake up to when you go to bed. Be specific. What do you eat?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A detailed history… alright. Well, I wake up… usually around 7:00 am, sometimes a little later if the rooster is being particularly quiet. My neighbor has a rooster, you see. Then I have a small breakfast. Usually some fruit – papaya if it’s in season, or maybe a banana – and a piece of toast with a little butter. I drink a cup of coffee, of course. Very important! Then I check my messages, and maybe read the newspaper online. I try to do a little gardening – weeding, mostly. I can't do as much heavy lifting anymore. Lunch is usually something light… a salad, or maybe a small sandwich. In the afternoon, I visit with my daughter, she lives just down the road, or I’ll read. Sometimes I work on my quilt. I enjoy quilting very much. Dinner… well, my daughter often brings it over, or I’ll have something simple. Fish, usually. I try to eat healthy. I’m a Chamorro woman, you see, and we take our food seriously! I try to be in bed by 9:00 pm. I don’t sleep terribly well, though. That's been a bit of a problem lately. Does that…is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a fairly active day, despite the decreasing energy levels. And some difficulty sleeping. Do you take anything to help you sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I try to avoid medication if possible. I've used chamomile tea a few times, but it doesn't seem to do much. Mostly I just…try to relax. I read before bed, and sometimes listen to music. Nothing really seems to make a huge difference, though. It's not that I'm tossing and turning all night, just…not very restful sleep. I wake up feeling…not quite refreshed, you see? It's hard to explain. My husband, God rest his soul, used to say I was a light sleeper. Always have been. Perhaps it's just age.
DOCTOR: Alright. Chamomile tea, and generally light sleep. Let’s talk about other things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no allergies that I know of. Dr. Ramirez has always checked, and I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, thankfully. My mother always said a good appetite was a blessing! I've been very lucky in that regard, I think. I do get a little sensitive to the sun sometimes, but that's just common sense, you know? I always wear a hat and sunscreen when I'm outside. It’s very strong here, you see.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Oh, just a small dose of something for my blood pressure. Dr. Ramirez prescribed it a few years ago. It’s… Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. Very small dose, though. She said it was just to be on the safe side. And that's it. Just the Lisinopril. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you see. I always worry about side effects.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, as prescribed. Okay. Now, have there been any significant changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes, a little. I seem to be… shrinking, you see. I used to be quite tall, you know. Nearly six feet! But I've lost a few inches, and a little weight. Not much, maybe five or ten pounds over the last year. I don't weigh myself often, to be honest. It doesn't seem very polite to the scale! I'm still relatively strong, though. I can still manage my garden, even if it takes me a bit longer now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Weight loss, and decreased height, likely related to age and potential bone density changes. I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a baseline and rule out anything obvious. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's perfectly alright. Of course. I trust your judgment, Doctor. A physical exam sounds sensible. I haven’t had one in quite a while, to be honest. My regular doctor does the basics, but perhaps you'll notice something different. Please, proceed. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80. That's slightly elevated, but not concerning given your age and a bit of white coat hypertension is common. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is normal for your age. Everything sounds within normal limits for your age. However, given the weight loss and decreased height, I would like to order a basic blood panel to check your vitamin D levels, thyroid function, and a complete metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. Also, a Vitamin B12 level. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds…very thorough, Doctor. Yes, absolutely. If it will help determine what’s going on, please proceed. Vitamin D, thyroid, kidney, liver… and B12. I'm happy to have those checked. I trust your judgment completely. I just want to feel a little more… myself again, you see. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood draw?
DOCTOR: No specific preparation is needed. You can eat and drink normally. We’ll schedule the blood draw for tomorrow morning. It shouldn’t take long. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I'd recommend continuing to focus on a healthy diet, staying hydrated, and getting regular, gentle exercise. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor, and explained everything so clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. I feel much more reassured already. Tomorrow morning for the blood draw… alright. I’ll make sure to remember. Thank you again, Doctor Fourney. You've been very kind. I suppose there's nothing more to do for today, is there? I'll let the receptionist know to schedule the bloodwork.
