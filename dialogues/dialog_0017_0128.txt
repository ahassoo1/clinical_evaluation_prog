DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. Dr. Blim, Family Medicine. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm... what does bring me in? It's... my joints, I think. They're just so stiff in the mornings. It takes a while to get moving, you know? It's been... a while now, I guess. Not a new thing, just… always there a little.
DOCTOR: “Always there a little,” is not a helpful clinical descriptor, Ms. Voner. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry, Doctor. I don't... explain things very well, I don't think. Specific… Let me see. My knees mostly, and my fingers. When I wake up, they feel… tight. Like they haven't been used in days, even though I was moving them yesterday. It’s hard to make a fist, and walking… well, it’s not painful painful, just… slow. Does that make more sense?
DOCTOR: Somewhat. And how long has this “tightness,” as you call it, been present?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long? That’s… a hard one. Years, I think. Maybe five? Or even longer. It sort of… came on slowly, you know? Not all at once. It's just gotten a little worse over time, maybe. I really can't say for sure. My husband, he… he always helped me remember things. It’s harder now.
DOCTOR: Five years of… gradual onset. And is this stiffness consistent?
PATIENT: Consistent… hmm. Not every day is the same. Some mornings it's really bad, I have to sort of… coax my hands open. Other days, it's just a little ache. And… it seems worse when it's cold, I think. Or maybe when it's going to rain? I can't always tell, honestly. I work with the little ones, so I'm up and down a lot, and that helps loosen things up usually.
DOCTOR: "Little ones?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I help out at the daycare center, down on Elm Street. I’ve been doing it… well, since my husband passed. It keeps me busy, you know? It's good to be around the children. I help with snacks and playtime, mostly. It's not too strenuous, but like I said, I'm up and down a lot. It's a good job. Keeps me moving. Though, maybe that's why my joints are stiff? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: So you're attributing the cause of your condition to your…employment?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not attributing exactly! Just… wondering if it makes it worse, maybe? I mean, I wouldn’t be doing anything else. I like the children. It’s just… sometimes I have trouble getting down on the floor with them, you know? And picking them up. It's not a big deal, really. I just thought I should mention it, since we're talking about my joints. I don’t want to stop working there, not at all.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on. Do you have any pain associated with this stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, pain… not really. Not like a sharp pain. It's more of an ache, like I said. Sometimes it’s a little sore when I first start moving, but it goes away pretty quick. Usually after I’ve been up and around for a bit. It’s not the kind of pain that keeps me up at night, or anything. It’s just… uncomfortable. A dull ache. Is that clear enough? I’m sorry if I'm not explaining it well. It's hard to put into words, you know?
DOCTOR: “Uncomfortable.” I see. And have you noticed any swelling or redness in any of your joints?
PATIENT: Oh, swelling… let me think. No, not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes my knuckles look a little… puffy, maybe? But I thought that was just because of my age, you know? I'm not a young woman anymore. And no redness, not that I can remember. I haven’t really paid much attention, to be honest. I just try to ignore it and keep moving. Is that silly? I just didn’t want to bother you with… old lady problems.
DOCTOR: "Old lady problems," as you put it, are precisely why you're here, Ms. Voner. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… That’s a hard one. My husband used to keep track of all that. I… I think I had high blood pressure, years ago. But the doctor put me on a little pill and it went away. I don’t think I’m on anything now. And… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. Other than that… I can’t really remember. Is that bad? I haven't been to a doctor much since… well, since he passed. I mostly just try to stay active and eat healthy. I'm sure it's nothing important.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, cholecystectomy. Any family history of arthritis or other joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… hmm. My mother… she had some trouble with her hands, I think. She used to complain about them being stiff, like me. But she just said it was from doing too much housework. She didn’t go to the doctor much either. And my father… he was a strong man, never had any trouble with his joints that I can remember. I don’t really know much about the rest of my family, to be honest. We weren't very close. Is that helpful? I'm sorry I can’t be of more assistance. I never really paid attention to all that.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… No, not that I know of. I've taken a few pills here and there over the years, and I haven't had any reactions. Nothing serious, anyway. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but that's just from spicy food. I don't really take much, so I don’t think I have any allergies to worry about. I try to avoid taking pills if I can help it. Do you think I should be worried about something? I'm starting to feel a little anxious now.
DOCTOR: We are not establishing whether you should be worried, Ms. Voner, we are attempting to establish a clinical picture. Now, let us proceed. I'm going to perform a quick examination of your joints. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. An examination… That sounds sensible. I hope it won't be too uncomfortable. I'm not very flexible, you know. And please let me know if I need to adjust anything. I'm not used to lying down for very long.
DOCTOR: Simply lie flat on your back, Ms. Voner. I'll start with your knees. Limited range of motion in both knees, with mild crepitus upon flexion and extension. No significant effusion or warmth appreciated. Palpation reveals no acute tenderness. Now, if you could extend your hands, palms up. Mild swelling noted in the distal interphalangeal joints of both hands. Range of motion is slightly restricted, particularly in the fingers. No erythema or warmth. Grip strength appears diminished bilaterally.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Is that… normal? Everything feels a little stiff, you know. I try to ignore it, but it’s hard. Is it bad that I can’t move my fingers very well? I still need to hold the little ones’ hands, you know. And open the snack bags. I wouldn’t want to drop anything. It sounds like it’s getting worse… Do you think I need… medicine? Or something else? I'm a little worried now, Doctor. Really worried.
DOCTOR: Your examination is consistent with findings suggestive of osteoarthritis. It is not uncommon for individuals of your age to experience degenerative joint changes. The diminished grip strength and restricted range of motion are areas of concern, but not necessarily indicative of a severe condition. While medication could be considered, I'm hesitant to prescribe anything at this juncture. We need to rule out other potential causes. I recommend a set of blood tests to assess for inflammatory markers, and an X-ray of both hands and knees to visualize the joint space and assess for structural damage. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… an X-ray? Oh dear. Is it… serious? Are my bones… bad? I’ve never had an X-ray before. Will it hurt? And what are… inflammatory markers? I don’t understand… does this mean I’ll have to stop working with the little ones? I really don’t want to stop working with the little ones. It keeps me busy, you know. And it's good to be around them. I just… I don’t want to stop. Is there anything else I can do? Besides the tests and the… X-ray?
DOCTOR: Ms. Voner, let's not jump to conclusions. An X-ray is a simple imaging procedure; it will not cause any pain. Blood tests will simply provide us with additional information regarding your overall health and rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions. The tests will not automatically necessitate stopping your employment. However, without a definitive diagnosis, I cannot advise you on the extent of activity you should engage in. We must proceed with the investigations before formulating a treatment plan. I will order the blood work and X-rays today. Once the results are available, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, to manage any discomfort. Do you have any questions regarding the ordering of these tests?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… I think I have some of those at home. But I don't like taking pills, you know? They make my stomach feel funny sometimes. And… what if the X-ray shows something bad? Will I need… surgery? Or something else scary? And… how long will the tests take? I have to be able to get to work, you know. I need to be able to be there for the little ones. Will I be able to work while I'm waiting for the results? I just… I'm very worried, Doctor. Really, really worried.
DOCTOR: Ms. Voner, I understand your anxieties, however, dwelling on hypothetical outcomes will not serve any purpose. We are not discussing surgery at this juncture. The purpose of these investigations is to rule out more serious conditions and formulate an appropriate treatment plan. The blood tests typically take 24-48 hours to process, and the X-rays can be reviewed within a few days. As long as you are not experiencing severe pain or instability, you can continue working while awaiting the results. However, it is imperative you listen to your body and avoid any activities that exacerbate your symptoms. I will provide you with a referral to a physical therapist. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your joints and improve your range of motion. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A physical therapist… that sounds… helpful. Maybe they can show me how to… do things differently. So, I can still go to work? As long as I don’t… hurt myself? And the X-ray isn’t going to show anything… terrible? I promise I’ll listen to my body, Doctor. I will. I just… I need to be there for the little ones. It’s very important to me. Can I… write down your name and number, just in case? If I get really worried, or something feels… bad?
DOCTOR: Very well. My name and number are on the referral form. Do not hesitate to contact my office if you experience any sudden onset of severe pain, swelling, or instability in your joints. However, I must reiterate that unnecessary anxiety will not expedite the diagnostic process. The referral for physical therapy is being sent electronically to the clinic down on Elm Street. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Ms. Voner?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for… listening to me. And for not… laughing. It's just… I get very worried sometimes. I’ll… I’ll try to take it easy. And I’ll call if anything feels… bad. Thank you again. .
