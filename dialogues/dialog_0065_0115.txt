DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s about my coloring, I suppose. I’ve been looking a bit… yellow, lately. My niece, bless her heart, she noticed it first and insisted I come see someone. Something about my liver, she said. I don’t recall all the details, truthfully. It's been a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Yellowing of the skin, you say. And your niece specifically mentioned your liver. I see. Now, when did you first notice this change in your skin color?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I first notice? That’s… difficult to say. Perhaps a few weeks ago? It started subtly, I think. I didn’t pay it much mind at first, honestly. Just thought it was the lighting, maybe. It's hard to keep track of these things when one gets older, you know.
DOCTOR: A few weeks ago. Alright. And has this yellowing been getting worse since then?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I believe it has. It’s… more noticeable now, isn’t it? My hands… and my eyes, I think. My niece was quite insistent, which is why I’m here, really. She’s a very practical girl. I don’t always remember things as clearly as I used to. Is… is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It could be serious, Ms. Durig, which is why we need to investigate. Yellowing of the skin, medically known as jaundice, can indicate a number of things, some more concerning than others. Now, let's go through some questions. Do you have any pain in your abdomen, specifically in the upper right side?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain… Not really pain, Doctor. More… discomfort, perhaps? A sort of dull ache, sometimes. It comes and goes. I hadn’t thought much of it. It’s just… old age, I assumed. Everything aches a little, doesn't it? Is that important?
DOCTOR: It's important that you mention it, Ms. Durig. Dull ache in the upper right abdomen can be related to liver issues, among other things. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: Nausea… hmm. Yes, actually. A little bit. Not terribly often, but a few times in the last week or so. It wasn’t severe, just… a queasy feeling. And I haven’t actually vomited, no. Just felt like I might. Is that… is that connected to the yellowing?
DOCTOR: It could be, Ms. Durig. Now, let's talk about your bowel movements. Have you noticed any changes in their color?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That’s… a rather personal question, isn’t it? Well, yes. They’ve been… lighter than usual, I think. Almost… clay-colored. I hadn’t paid much attention before, truthfully. Is that… a bad sign?
DOCTOR: It is something we need to note, Ms. Durig. Clay-colored stools can indicate a problem with bile flow. Now, have you noticed any dark urine?
PATIENT: Dark urine… Now that you mention it… yes. Perhaps a little darker than usual. I didn’t think anything of it. I drink a lot of fluids, you see, so I don't usually pay close attention to the color. Is that… connected to everything else? This sounds rather serious, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, based on your symptoms – the yellowing of the skin, the abdominal discomfort, the nausea, the clay-colored stools, and the dark urine – it’s important we investigate potential liver issues. I'm going to need to perform a physical exam, and I'll order some blood tests to assess your liver function. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Liver issues… oh dear. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, no. I haven’t taken many medications over the years. A pain reliever here and there, but nothing regularly. I’m generally a healthy person, or I was, anyway. A physical exam… and blood tests. Very well, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better. Is this going to be painful?
DOCTOR: It shouldn't be painful, Ms. Durig, just some gentle pressing and listening. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and I'll palpate it to check for any tenderness or enlargement. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll start with listening to your heart and lungs, then move to your abdomen. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are normal. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. And now, the abdomen. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Oh… yes. A little. Right there… it’s… tender. Not terribly painful, but… uncomfortable. It feels… swollen, perhaps? I’m not sure. Is that bad? It’s been a long morning.
DOCTOR: I notice some tenderness in the right upper quadrant, and there is mild hepatomegaly – meaning your liver is slightly enlarged. I don’t feel any rebound tenderness or guarding, which is good. Alright, Ms. Durig. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, liver function tests, and a bilirubin level. We’ll also need to check your amylase and lipase levels to rule out any pancreatic involvement. These tests will give us a better understanding of what's going on with your liver and other organs. Do you have any questions before I order these tests?
PATIENT: Enlarged liver… Oh dear. All those tests… Amylase and lipase… is that… is that serious? Is it something bad? What if it is something bad? What are we looking for, exactly? I don’t mean to be difficult, Doctor, but I like to know what’s going on. And… how long will it take to get the results? This is all rather overwhelming. .
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be overwhelmed, Ms. Durig. The amylase and lipase tests help us rule out pancreatitis, which can sometimes present with similar symptoms. We are looking for evidence of liver inflammation, blockage of the bile ducts, or other underlying liver conditions. The blood tests should be processed within 24 to 48 hours. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. It's important to remember that we haven't made a diagnosis yet. These tests are simply to gather more information. I understand you're concerned, and I will explain everything clearly once we have the results. For now, I recommend avoiding alcohol and fatty foods. Do you have any further questions at this time?
