DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor… Georgiou, you say? Hmm. Well, I’m breathin’ kinda hard. And my mouth… feels like the Sahara Desert in there. Eyes too, feel like sandpaper. Not good, not good at all. It's been gettin' worse, I think. Can’t rightly say when it started, though. Old man problems, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Breathing difficulty and a very dry mouth and eyes…that does sound uncomfortable. And you're right, it's good you came in to get it checked out. It’s helpful you noticed it getting worse. Just to clarify, when you say "breathing kinda hard," can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More…? Well, like… I gotta work to get air in. Not like a big struggle, not panickin' or nothin', just… takes effort. Especially when I walk. Used to be I could walk a mile, no problem. Now? Maybe to the mailbox. And I used to fix traffic lights all day long, climb those poles... can't even think about that now. It's... frustrating. Makes a man feel useless.
DOCTOR: I completely understand how frustrating that must be, Mr. Guilds. It sounds like it’s impacting your daily life, and that’s definitely something we need to look into. So, it’s exertion-related, it seems—worsens when you walk or are active. And you've noticed a change from being able to do a lot more physically. Now, aside from the breathing and dryness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Hmm. Let me think… I get tired, real tired. More than usual, I mean. I always liked my naps, but now… I could sleep all day. And sometimes… my legs feel kinda heavy. Like they’re filled with lead. Not painful, exactly… just… heavy. And I don’t have much of an appetite, not like before. Everything just tastes… bland. Now what else…? Honestly, Doctor, I forget half the things these days. This old brain ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Guilds, take your time. We'll get through this together. Fatigue, heavy legs, loss of appetite, and things tasting bland… those are all helpful things to know. Now, have you had any fevers, chills, cough, or chest pain at all?
PATIENT: Fevers… chills… Nah, not that I recall. I mighta had a little sniffle here and there, but nothin' serious. Old man always gettin' a little cold. Chest pain… no. No pain in the chest. Heart feels okay, I guess. Never had trouble with it before. I used to be strong as an ox, climbin’ those poles, remember? But… ...my doctor back in the city, he said I had a bit of high blood pressure. Been takin’ pills for that for… oh, goodness, years now. Can't recall the name of 'em.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No fever, chills, or chest pain. You’ve had high blood pressure for years and are taking medication for it. You said you don’t recall the name of the medication, that's alright, we can look that up in your records. Alright, I see here you’re taking Lisinopril 20mg daily. Is that right?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… Hmm. Lisinopril… yeah, that sounds right. Tiny white pills, I think. Take ‘em every mornin’ with my coffee. Never really paid much attention to the name, to be honest. Just take ‘em ‘cause the doctor told me to. They haven’t been botherin’ me, if that's what you’re askin’. Just… don’t seem to be doin’ much good lately, with all this breathin' trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Lisinopril daily, no recent changes to that, and you haven’t noticed any side effects. It’s helpful you’ve been consistent with it. Alright, Mr. Guilds, I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if you don't mind. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your oxygen levels, and take a look at your throat. That will give me a better idea of what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Go ahead. Just get it over with. I ain’t one for sittin’ around. Used to fix things with my hands, now I just gotta let you fix me. Feels… strange. But do what you gotta do, Doctor. Just don’t poke too hard.
DOCTOR: I won't poke too hard, I promise. Just a quick listen and a look. Okay, Mr. Guilds, everything's going well so far. I did hear some mild crackles in your lungs, which could indicate some fluid buildup. Your oxygen saturation is a little low at 92%, and I noticed some mild swelling in your legs. Your throat is a little dry, but that could be from the breathing difficulty. I'm going to write these findings down.
PATIENT: Fluid… in my lungs? Swelling…? That don’t sound good. Is that… serious? I mean, I ain’t exactly a spring chicken anymore, but… I don't wanna end up in the hospital. Used to be I could fix anythin' broken, now I’m the broken one. What’s causin’ all this, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Guilds. It’s definitely good you came in to get checked out. Fluid in the lungs, or pulmonary edema, can be caused by a few things, and it's important we figure out the cause. Your age and your history of high blood pressure are factors we need to consider. The most likely possibility, given your history, is that it's related to your heart. The high blood pressure can weaken the heart muscle over time, making it harder for the heart to pump effectively. This can lead to fluid backing up into the lungs. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, like pneumonia or kidney problems. To do that, I’d like to order a few tests. A chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out infection, and an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… More tests. Seems like all I do these days is go to doctors and get poked and prodded. But… … if it'll tell you what’s wrong, then alright. Do ‘em. Just… try to be quick, alright? And don’t tell me nothin’ I don’t need to know. I ain’t one for fancy medical terms. Just tell me what’s broken and how to fix it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Guilds. I'll keep it simple and straightforward. No unnecessary jargon. I’ll explain everything clearly. Okay, I’ve ordered the chest X-ray, blood tests, and EKG. The X-ray can be done right here in the clinic, and the blood tests can be done at the lab across the street. The EKG will be done here as well. It shouldn’t take too long. While we wait for the results, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. Not that I know of. Never had trouble with anythin’ they gave me before. Maybe… maybe a little bit of a stomach upset with some of 'em. But nothin’ serious. Penicillin…? I think I had a bit of a rash once, years ago, but it coulda been anythin’. Honestly, Doctor, I forget half the things that happened yesterday, let alone years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known severe allergies, a possible rash with penicillin years ago, and occasional mild stomach upset with medications. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke…? Lord, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father, he smoked like a chimney, and look how he ended up. Drink…? I used to enjoy a beer or two with dinner, back in the day. But not much anymore. My stomach can’t handle it. Recreational drugs…? I'm eighty-three years old, Doctor. I've had enough recreation for one lifetime. I used to fix traffic lights, climbin' poles... that was recreation enough for me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Guilds. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drugs. Now, one last thing before the tests come back. Can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, goodness. Where do I even begin? My mother, she lived to be ninety-five, bless her soul. Heart trouble, near the end. My father… not so lucky. Smokin’ got to him, quick. My brother, he had diabetes, lost a leg. Lots of heart trouble on both sides of the family, if I remember correctly. And arthritis. Everyone had arthritis. Seems to run in the family, that one. It's probably why I’m sittin’ here in the first place.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart trouble, diabetes, and arthritis in your family. That's helpful to know. Alright, Mr. Guilds, it looks like the technician is ready for the EKG now. We’ll get that done first, and then the X-ray. The blood work can be done anytime today. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Questions…? … Will I be okay, Doctor? That’s what I wanna know. Is it somethin’ serious? I don't wanna end up in the hospital, or worse. Just tell me straight, alright? No fancy words, just the truth.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Mr. Guilds. It’s understandable to be worried. Based on what we’ve discussed and my initial exam, it's possible this is related to your heart, and that could be serious. However, it’s too early to say definitively. The tests will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. We need to rule out other causes first. And even if it is heart-related, there are many treatments available. We will discuss all your options if that turns out to be the case. Right now, let’s focus on getting these tests done, and then we can go from there. I promise we’ll figure this out together, and I'll do everything I can to help you. Shall we get started with the EKG?
PATIENT: Alright. Let’s just get it over with. Hurry up and poke those stickers on me. The sooner it’s done, the sooner I can get home and take a nap. This old body’s tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds, this will just take a few minutes. I’m going to attach these stickers to your chest, arms, and legs. They help us measure the electrical activity of your heart. Just relax and breathe normally. Just a few more seconds… perfect. Okay, we’re all set. The technician will be with you shortly to review the results. I'll be right here when you're finished.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll see you in a few moments, Mr. Guilds. Take your time, and let me know if you have any questions.
