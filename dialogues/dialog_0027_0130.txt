DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… want to feel better, I think. My mom… she had some bad things. Heart, mostly. And my sister… she’s got something now too. I worry. Just want to make sure I’m okay, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It's good you're being proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart issues. Feeling well is important. Let’s try to figure out what’s going on. Can you tell me a little more about how you've been feeling?
PATIENT: Well… I get tired. More tired than I used to, maybe. And sometimes… a little bit of pain here. Not bad pain, just… there. And my legs… they feel heavy when I walk a long way. I sell things, you know? Gotta walk a lot at the shows. It’s… harder now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer. That gives me a little bit to work with. When you say “chest discomfort”, can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not like a sharp pain. More… a squeezing? Like someone is holding it tight. And it comes and goes. Usually when I’ve been walking. Or… when I get excited about a sale, maybe? It's hard to say. It doesn't last long, though. Just a few minutes. Then it goes away. I just… don't want it to not go away, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. It's good you're paying attention to these symptoms. And it's good it resolves relatively quickly. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse, besides walking or excitement?
PATIENT: Well… sitting down helps. Just… stopping. And… if I take deep breaths, maybe. I don't know. It's hard to say what really helps. I just try to ignore it, mostly. I got things to sell! But… maybe I shouldn't, huh? That's why I'm here.
DOCTOR: You're right to come in, Mr. Schwer. It's always best to check these things out. Would you mind if I listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, no. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… don't take too long, okay? I got a show next week. Important one. But… take your time. I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. If you could just lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I'll start with your blood pressure. Just relax and take deep breaths. Okay, everything sounds alright, but your blood pressure is a bit high. And I did hear a small murmur. To get a better picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order some tests. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? I don’t like tests. Are they… bad? Will they take long? I got things to do, Doctor. What are you trying to find out?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. The tests are nothing to worry about. They’re just routine procedures to help us understand what's going on with your heart. We’ll do a simple EKG – that's a quick recording of your heart's electrical activity – and a blood test to check your cholesterol and other levels. It will take about an hour, including the wait time. The EKG will help me see if there's any evidence of a previous heart attack, or if there’s any irregular heart activity. The blood test will give me some information about your risk factors for heart disease. We need to rule things out, and make sure you're okay to continue with your… shows. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An hour… okay. I guess. A blood test… that’s okay. As long as it doesn’t take all day. And… what if you find something? Will I have to… stop working? That's my whole life, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, let’s take things one step at a time. We’ll do the tests, and then we’ll discuss the results. If we do find something, it doesn't necessarily mean you'll have to stop working. It just means we may need to make some adjustments to your lifestyle, or consider some medication to help manage your heart health. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Do you have any allergies to latex or any blood-drawing concerns?
PATIENT: No allergies. And… no, I'm okay with needles. Just don't like waiting around. So… where do I go? Who do I talk to? I just want this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. Here’s the order for the lab. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. You’ll want to tell them you're here for an EKG and blood work, ordered by Dr. Fazzina. A nurse will come to get you when they’re ready. It usually doesn’t take too long. Once you’ve had the tests done, you can come back here, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Okay. Down the hall. EKG. Blood work. And then… come back here. That sounds… okay. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it's nothing bad. I'm gonna go do this then. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Schwer. Take your time, and don't hesitate to ask the nurses if you have any questions. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
