DOCTOR: Good morning, Elijiah. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, it's kinda weird, honestly. I've been havin' trouble gettin' out of chairs. Sounds dumb, right? Like, I can sit fine, but when I try to stand up… it just feels… stuck.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Elijiah. It doesn’t sound dumb – it sounds like something we should definitely investigate. “Stuck” is a good way to describe it. Can you tell me a little more about that feeling?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. It's… like my legs just don't wanna cooperate. Not painful, exactly. More like… a real effort. Like there's somethin' holdin' me down, but it's in my legs, not on 'em. It's been goin' on for maybe a week, I guess? Started kinda slow, now it's almost every time I get up from a chair, or even just lean forward to pick somethin' up. It's worse after I've been sittin' a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's more of an effortful feeling, not pain, and it's been gradually worsening over the past week. It's worse after prolonged sitting. That gives me a little more to work with. Does it happen with every chair, or just certain ones?
PATIENT: Hmm, good question. I hadn’t really thought about that. I think… it's happened with all of 'em. At work, at home… the chair at the diner yesterday. So, yeah, I guess it’s all chairs. And, now that I think about it, gettin’ down from a high stool is kinda hard too, like it takes a lotta balance. Not fallin’ or anything, just… careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s consistent across different chairs and you’ve noticed it’s harder coming down from higher surfaces as well, requiring more balance. To get a better understanding, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this difficulty?
PATIENT: Let's see… Not really, not that I've noticed. No numbness, no tingling, no weakness, nothin' like that. My legs feel normal when I'm walkin' around. It's just… this gettin’ up part. I been pretty tired lately, work’s been busy, but I always am when it's hot out. We're pushin' a lot of iron, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness, tingling, or weakness, and you attribute some of the fatigue to work. That’s good information. Now, just to get a more complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical… huh. Not much, really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fallin' out of a tree, but that healed up fine. And I had the flu a couple of times, like everyone does. I… My wife… she passed away two years ago. Complications from childbirth, it was… rough. But other than that, I've been pretty healthy. No regular checkups or anything. I don't really… go to doctors much.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Elijiah. That must have been incredibly difficult. Thank you for sharing that with me. So, to confirm, no other significant medical problems, and you haven't had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, nope. Just the arm when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. No, nothin' else. I mean, I work hard, sometimes I get aches and pains, but I always just worked through 'em. That's kinda what we do, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, family… My mom had… I think it was high blood pressure, yeah, she took pills for it. And my grandpa, on my dad's side… he had somethin' with his heart, I remember that. He wasn't real active towards the end. But other than that… nothin' that I know of, really. My wife's family… I didn’t know them too well. She kinda kept to herself. Not much help there, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in your mother and some heart issues in your paternal grandfather. That's helpful to know. Just a few more questions, then I'd like to do a quick physical exam if that’s alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. I can eat pretty much anything. And I haven't had any trouble with medications before, either. I’m pretty easy that way, thankfully. Alright, go ahead with the exam, Doc. Let’s see what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: Great. Alright, if you don't mind, could you sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Sure thing. Here ya go. A little cold, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, it can be a bit chilly. Here, this should help. Now, first, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll do a quick neurological exam to see how your nerves and muscles are functioning. Finally, I'll check your reflexes and strength. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doc. Go right ahead. I'm ready when you are. Just let me know if anything feels weird, okay? I don't usually like hospitals… or doctors, much. But I appreciate you listenin'.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. I'll explain everything as I go, and please, tell me if anything feels uncomfortable or unusual. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated but not drastically so. It could be due to being in the office. Pulse is 78, regular, and your temperature is 98.6, normal. Now, could you please cross your legs and gently let your arms fall to your sides?
PATIENT: Sure. Like this? Everything feels… normal so far. Just a little awkward, sittin' here.
DOCTOR: Yes, perfect. Now I'm checking your reflexes. Let me know if these feel strong, weak, or painful. Tapping knee… Good, good. And now the other side. Tapping knee… Alright, those are normal. Now I'm going to have you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Okay, go ahead.
PATIENT: There. Is that okay? Feels pretty normal, just… squeezin'. A little hard work, maybe. I got strong hands from workin', you know? But they get tired quick.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good strength. A little fatigue is understandable given your profession. Now, could you please push down on my hands with your legs while I resist?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that good? It's kinda hard pushin' like this, sittin' down.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. Your strength seems adequate, but I am noticing a slight hesitation when initiating the movement. Now, just a final quick check. Could you stand up slowly and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Okay… here we go. Woah, hold on a second… Yeah, that's… that's kinda what I was talkin' about. It's hard to get goin'. Feels like I gotta force it.
DOCTOR: Whoa, easy there. That’s alright. Yes, I noticed that hesitation, and the slight unsteadiness when initiating movement. I appreciate you showing me that. Okay, please sit back down. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing something called proximal weakness, which means the muscles closest to your trunk are having difficulty initiating movement. There are several potential causes. It could be something relatively benign like deconditioning, or it could be related to a more underlying issue. Given your history, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and inflammatory conditions. I also think an EMG/NCS would be beneficial to assess the function of your nerves and muscles. What do you think?
PATIENT: Blood work… and that other thing… EMG/NCS? Sounds kinda scary. Is it… serious, Doc? Is somethin’ really wrong? I just figured I was gettin’ old, maybe needin’ a vacation. I don’t want anythin’ serious. I gotta work, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Elijiah. It’s good you’re asking. It doesn’t necessarily mean something serious. As I said, it could be something relatively minor. However, it's important to rule out anything more concerning. The EMG/NCS is a non-invasive test – it involves small needles to measure the electrical activity in your muscles, and it can help us pinpoint the cause of the weakness. It can be a little uncomfortable, but it’s generally well-tolerated. I’m going to order the blood work first. We’ll get those results back quickly, and then we can discuss if the EMG/NCS is necessary. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and focusing on gentle stretches to maintain your range of motion. Do you have any questions about the tests or what we've discussed?
PATIENT: Gentle stretches… okay, I can do that. I guess. So… no heavy liftin’? And those blood tests… how long will that take? Will I have to come back another day? And… will insurance cover any of this? I don't… I don’t have much money right now.
DOCTOR: No heavy lifting, that’s right. We want to avoid any further strain on those muscles. The blood tests usually take 24-48 hours to come back. You can have them drawn at the lab across the street, and no, you don't need an appointment. Just tell them Dr. Tosca ordered them. As for insurance, unfortunately, you mentioned you are uninsured. I can write you a referral to a free clinic that offers financial assistance for these types of tests. They may be able to cover the cost, or at least offer a discounted rate. And I can also discuss the possibility of a payment plan with the lab, if necessary. I want to assure you that we will work with you to ensure you get the care you need, regardless of your financial situation. Do you have any other questions, or would you like me to write those referrals for you now?
PATIENT: That… that would be amazing, Doc. Really. The referrals, yeah, please. I appreciate you lookin' out for me. It's… it's hard when you don't have much help. I think that's all my questions for now. Just gotta get those tests done, and see what they say. Thank you, Doc. Seriously. You’ve been a big help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Elijiah. I'm glad I could help. I’m printing these referrals for you now. One is for the free clinic, and the other is a general order for the bloodwork. Once you have the results, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me, and we'll discuss the next steps. I’ll also send a note to your primary care physician, letting them know what we’ve discussed. Do you have any other medical conditions or medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope. Just… the wife passin', like I said. No regular doctor, no medications. I just been tryin’ to keep workin’, you know? Get by. That’s all. Thank you again, Doc. I'll get those tests done as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, Elijiah. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. I'll be here. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon. .
