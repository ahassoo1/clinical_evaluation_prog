DOCTOR: Alright, Tarin. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Billman. It’s… well, it’s my leg. It’s been feeling numb, off and on, for a little while now. Not constantly, thankfully, but enough to be concerning.
DOCTOR: Numbness, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. It's mostly in my left leg, starting around my thigh and going down to my… well, my foot. It feels like it’s…falling asleep, but without the pins and needles, usually. Sometimes there is a little tingling, but not always. It comes and goes, like I said, and it's hard to pinpoint exactly when it happens, though I think it’s worse after I’ve been on my feet for a long time. I do a lot of work standing, you see, being an effects artist. Lots of motion capture and set work.
DOCTOR: Effects artist, alright. So, motion capture… a lot of repetitive movements, I presume?
PATIENT: Yes, quite a bit, sir. And holding poses for extended periods while the systems calibrate. It's not always just repetitive, though. We do a fair amount of improvisational work, trying to create realistic movements, so there's a lot of shifting weight and quick changes in position too. It's… demanding, physically. Though I generally enjoy it. But I suppose that constant use could be contributing to this. I hadn't really considered that until just now, actually.
DOCTOR: "Contributing." Right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. It started… I’d say around three months ago, maybe a little longer? It was very intermittent at first, just a fleeting sensation, and I dismissed it as fatigue. It's gradually become more frequent and… noticeable, I suppose. The last month or so has been the most concerning. I thought it might just go away on its own, but it hasn't. I don’t recall any specific injury that triggered it, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Three months… alright. And any pain associated with this numbness?
PATIENT: Not consistently, sir. There’s occasionally a dull ache in my thigh, usually when the numbness is particularly strong. But it’s not a sharp pain, and it’s not constant. It’s more like…a pressure, if that makes sense? And sometimes, after the numbness fades, there’s a slight soreness, but that disappears quickly. It's definitely the numbness that’s the bigger issue. The pain is…manageable, when it’s even there.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not that I’ve noticed. No weakness in my leg, no changes in skin color or temperature. My reflexes seem normal, as far as I can tell. I haven’t experienced any issues with my balance, and I haven’t had any trouble walking. I sleep fine, and I haven’t had any bowel or bladder problems. It really is just the numbness, sir. It's…isolated, which is what’s worrying me. I don't like when things don't have a clear cause. I'm usually quite…attentive to my body, being an artist and all.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, actually. Yes, as a matter of fact, I have. We had a project a couple of months ago that involved a lot of late nights and… less-than-ideal catering options. A lot of processed foods, sugary snacks, things like that. I’ve been trying to get back to my regular diet since then—mostly fish and vegetables, things like salmon and root vegetables—but it was a fairly significant shift for a while. I didn’t really connect that to this, but perhaps it’s relevant?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look at your leg. Can you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, sir. Just let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just tell me if anything feels particularly tender. I'm checking for any muscle spasms or points of sensitivity.
PATIENT: Okay. That feels…normal. No particular pain there. Ooh, that’s a little tender. Just above my kneecap, on the outer side. It's not sharp, more like a dull ache when you press on it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about this?
PATIENT: That…felt normal. It was a quick response, I suppose. I haven't had any issues with my reflexes that I’m aware of. Is that a normal reaction? I’m not sure I’ve ever had that tested before.
DOCTOR: Alright. Can you tell me if you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. I can feel that. It’s…a light touch. Yes, I can feel it on my thigh, my knee, my calf… and yes, I can feel it on my foot as well. Though it feels…slightly diminished on the outer side of my foot, compared to the rest of my leg. Not absent, just… less pronounced. I notice it, but it's not as strong as it should be, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like you may have some mild peripheral neuropathy. It's not uncommon, and often caused by things like vitamin deficiencies or compression of a nerve. Your diet and the nature of your work could both be contributing factors. But it's not something you want to ignore.
PATIENT: Peripheral neuropathy… I see. So, what does that mean, exactly? And what sort of treatment would you recommend? I understand it’s not something to ignore, and I appreciate you pointing that out. I’m glad we’re looking into this. Perhaps a change in diet and some exercises to relieve pressure would be helpful? I’m willing to do whatever is necessary to address this, sir.
DOCTOR: Well, we need to rule out anything more serious first. I'm going to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels—specifically B12 and D—and to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’d also like to order an electromyography, or EMG, to assess the function of your nerves. It's a bit uncomfortable, but it will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. As for dietary changes, yes, that's a good start. Focus on a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals. As for exercises... I wouldn't recommend anything specific until we have the results of the EMG. You could aggravate the condition. I'll also prescribe you a B-complex vitamin supplement in the meantime. It won’t hurt. But don't self-treat beyond that. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, I understand perfectly. Blood tests, an EMG, and a B-complex supplement. No further self-treatment until we have the results of the EMG. I’ll schedule the blood tests and the EMG right away. And would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results? Or should I contact you when they are available? I'm happy to do whatever is most convenient for you, Doctor Billman. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly.
DOCTOR: Schedule a follow-up for two weeks from today. That should give the lab enough time to process the results. And don't hesitate to call if your symptoms worsen before then. Otherwise, I’ll see you then. And try to get some rest. It’s probably just stress.
PATIENT: Very well, sir. Two weeks from today it is. I will schedule it right away. And thank you, Doctor Billman. I appreciate your time and expertise. Goodbye. .
