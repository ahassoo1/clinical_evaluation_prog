DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Geho, so what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Havird. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Said my cholesterol is a little high. Something about hyper… something. It worried me a bit, so I figured I should come get it checked out. I don't really understand all that medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia, yes. It's... not ideal, but not the end of the world. Lots of people deal with it. You’re right to get it checked out, though. So, just to be clear, you don't have any symptoms – no chest pain, shortness of breath, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that at all. I feel perfectly fine, actually. A little tired sometimes, but who doesn't? I walk a lot, I like to get outside, and I eat… well, I eat pretty normally, I guess. Not a lot of fast food, mostly just regular meals. Does that make sense? I'm not sure what to tell you, really, because I feel good.
DOCTOR: "Regular meals"... right. Okay. And how long have you been feeling… "regular," I suppose?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. For… a long time now. Years, I suppose. I haven't really been sick, or felt different, for… well, I can't remember the last time I felt bad. Maybe a cold every now and then, but that’s it. I had a checkup with my old doctor a couple of years ago, and everything was fine then.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any family history of heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father… he had a heart attack when he was pretty old, maybe in his eighties. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had something… a weak heart, I think they said. But that was a long time ago, and they didn’t have the fancy tests they have now. Does that count?
DOCTOR: It can count. It's good to know. Alright. Have you been on any medications currently or in the past?
PATIENT: Just the usual, I think. For my blood pressure, a few years back, but I stopped taking those. Doctor said it was fine to, once it came down on its own. And vitamins, you know, a multivitamin every day. Nothing else, really. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Okay. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I’ve had all sorts of shots and things over the years, and I’ve never had a bad reaction. I used to get a little itchy when I was a child, but that was just hay fever, I think. Nothing to do with medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just do a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take your blood pressure again, just to get a baseline. Then we can talk about next steps. If you wouldn’t mind stepping up on the scale for me too, just to confirm the weight we have on file.
PATIENT: Oh, okay, that sounds good. No problem at all. I’m always a little cold, so you might notice that when you listen. But I don’t think it's anything serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is a bit elevated, as is your weight at 124 pounds, which is bordering on overweight given your height. Let's not jump to conclusions, but it's all information we need to consider. Do you have a history of diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I always thought I was a healthy weight! I walk quite a bit. Diabetes… hmm. My mother’s brother, I think, had it. But that was a long time ago, and he didn’t take very good care of himself, if I’m being honest. He smoked, drank a lot… not a good lifestyle. I always made sure to eat healthy, try to stay active… It’s a little worrying to hear about the weight, though.
DOCTOR: Right, well, genetics and lifestyle play a role. Alright, I think we should start with some basic blood work to get a more detailed look at your cholesterol levels and check your blood sugar. It’ll help us determine if we need to make any changes to your diet or consider medication. Do you have any concerns with getting blood drawn?
PATIENT: No, no concerns at all. I’ve had blood drawn plenty of times. It doesn’t bother me a bit. As long as the nurse is gentle, I'm fine. Should I… should I fast before the blood draw? I always forget those details.
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll need to fast for at least eight to twelve hours beforehand. No food or sugary drinks, just water. We'll give you a form with all the instructions. We will have the lab results back in a few days. Once we have those, we'll discuss the next steps and whether we need to look into any other tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Eight to twelve hours, no food. I can definitely do that. I'll write it down right away. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It makes me feel a little better knowing what's going on.
DOCTOR: Good. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are in. If anything changes or you start experiencing any unusual symptoms before then, don't hesitate to call the office. I'll have the nurse give you a form with instructions for the blood test and a requisition form to take to the lab. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything so well. Just… is it something to really worry about? My cholesterol, I mean. I just… I don't want to have to take a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: Let's not catastrophize. It’s something to manage, not necessarily to worry about. Many people successfully control their cholesterol with diet and exercise. If that’s not enough, there are medications, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Let's get the blood work done first and see what we're dealing with. Alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That sounds sensible. Diet and exercise first. I can definitely work on that. Thank you again, Doctor Havird. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. The nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork. Have a good day, Ms. Geho. And try not to stress too much.
PATIENT: .
