DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Good morning, Doctor. Honestly? It’s probably nothing, but my mother… she had some issues. Heart stuff, mainly. And her sister, too. It just… runs in the family, you know? I’d just like to get checked out, make sure I’m not heading down the same path. Preventative, really. I don’t want to end up like them.
DOCTOR: “Probably nothing,” you say. While I appreciate your proactive approach, dismissing symptoms outright isn't advisable. Family history is important, of course. Let’s get a thorough picture of your current health, then we can assess your risk. First, can you describe any symptoms you are experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, I don't have any, that's the point. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. That's why I said "probably nothing." But my sister keeps telling me I should get checked because of Mom and Auntie Padma. She worries too much. I guess if you want a list… sometimes I get a little winded climbing the stairs at school. But that’s just being out of shape, probably. And occasionally a little… fluttering in my chest. Very occasional. It goes away quickly. It's not painful, if that makes a difference. Honestly, Doctor, I'm probably wasting your time.
DOCTOR: "Probably" seems to be a recurring theme here, Mr. Theriot. While I understand your desire to avoid unnecessary alarm, those “occasional” symptoms – the shortness of breath and the fluttering – do warrant investigation. Dismissing them as simply being “out of shape” isn’t a sound medical practice. Let's start with a bit more detail about this fluttering you describe. Can you tell me precisely when it happens?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, it’s occasional. It's not like it happens every day. When… um… it usually happens when I’ve been… rushing around. School’s hectic, you know? Lots of students, lots of deadlines. I’m a teacher, I’m constantly on my feet. I’ll be grading papers, then running to help a student, then back to more papers. It's just… when I stop moving for a second. It's brief. Like a little skip. That’s all. And it always goes away. I really don't think it's anything. It's probably just stress, to be honest. I get a lot done. Maybe I just need a vacation.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly contribute to various symptoms, Mr. Theriot, but we can’t rule out other potential causes without a proper evaluation. The fact that it occurs with activity – and then resolves – is noteworthy. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Perfectly healthy. Never been sick, really. A few colds when I was a kid, like everyone else, but that’s it. No asthma, no high blood pressure, no… anything. I don't even take vitamins, I eat reasonably well. I was always the healthiest one in the family, actually. Which is why this whole thing is so ridiculous. My mother… well, she had some… complications. But I wasn't really involved in the details. She went to the doctor a lot, that's all I really know. It was… unpleasant. I don't want to end up like that. Constantly worrying about every little ache and pain.
DOCTOR: No prior diagnoses, that’s good to know. And you say your mother had “complications.” Can you recall anything specific about her condition?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it was years ago. I was in college, then getting settled into my job. She didn't really tell us much. Something about her heart… enlarged, I think? And then… irregular heartbeat. She was always tired, breathless. Lots of appointments, lots of tests. Eventually… well, she had a pacemaker put in. And then… she passed away a few years later. It wasn’t… sudden. A slow decline. I’m not a medical professional, I just remember her being… unwell. And now my sister is convinced I’m going to end up the same way. It's very frustrating. I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Enlarged heart and irregular heartbeat… that is relevant family history. We need to proceed cautiously. Let’s talk about your surgical history, if any. Have you ever undergone any operations or procedures?
PATIENT: No. Never. Nothing at all. I’ve broken a bone or two as a kid, a wrist here, a finger there… but nothing serious. No surgeries, no procedures, nothing. I'm very careful. I avoid risks. I don’t do… extreme sports. I don’t even like roller coasters. I’m a teacher, Doctor, not an adventurer. I spend most of my time in a classroom or grading papers. I am, quite frankly, incredibly boring.
DOCTOR: Alright. No prior surgeries or procedures. Now, let’s move on to your family history, beyond your mother and aunt. Are there any other instances of heart disease, stroke, or high blood pressure in your family?
PATIENT: Look, my mother’s sister, Auntie Padma, had heart problems too, like I said. She had… I think it was angina? She took medication for it, for years. And my grandfather, on my father’s side… he had a stroke. Years ago. He recovered, mostly, but he was never quite the same. It affected his speech. He… mumbled a lot towards the end. Other than that… I don’t really know. My father wasn't close to his family, and I barely knew any of them. Frankly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like I’m wasting your time. I feel perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, you are not wasting my time. A thorough medical history is crucial, especially with your family history. We are simply gathering information to assess your risk. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Are you serious? No. Absolutely not. None of the above. I am a teacher, Doctor. I have a responsibility to my students, to my profession. I maintain a healthy lifestyle. I drink herbal tea, occasionally. And I get plenty of sleep, when I’m not grading papers. Honestly, I’m surprised you even have to ask. I’m practically a paragon of virtue.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker, no alcohol or recreational drug use. Excellent. Now, lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. I’ve never had a rash, never had trouble breathing… Nothing. I’m quite robust, actually. Look, I appreciate you going through all this, but I really think I’m fine. I just wanted to get checked out to put my sister’s mind at ease. Perhaps a quick listen to my heart, and we can be done? I have a stack of papers to grade.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, while I appreciate your desire for a quick assessment, a proper medical evaluation requires more than just listening to your heart. Given your family history and your reported symptoms – however mild – I recommend we proceed with a few basic tests. Specifically, I’d like to order an EKG and a blood panel to check your cholesterol levels and rule out any underlying inflammation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. If it will just get my sister off my back. But I still think it's a waste of time and resources. I'm perfectly healthy. But... fine. EKG and a blood panel. Just... get it over with. And please, no roller coasters afterwards. I don't need any more stress.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed. I'll have the nurse come in to start with the EKG. Please remove your shirt and lie on the examination table. We'll take it from there.
PATIENT: Of course. Just what I needed.
