DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I’m Dr. Galena. Thanks for coming in today. Now, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Och, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this nausea, ye see. Been happening most mornings now, for a good wee while. It’s not… pleasant, to put it mildly. It’s usually right when I wake up, and it just… sits with me for a bit. Feels a bit like seasickness, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm, nausea most mornings, you say?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Not every morning, mind ye, but most. And it's… well, it's been worse lately. I thought it might just be something I ate, but it’s been persistent enough now that I figured I best get it checked out. I was told I have a bit of trouble with my heart, and I worry it might be connected.
DOCTOR: Right. Persistent nausea… and you mentioned some concerns about your heart. Let’s try to piece this together. When you say trouble with your heart, do you recall what was said exactly?
PATIENT: Och, aye, I do. It was Dr. MacIntyre, a good few years back now. He said something about it not pumpin’ as strong as it should, and… heart failure, I think he called it. Early stages, he said. Put me on some water pills and told me to watch the salt. I’ve been doin’ that, mostly. I can’t rightly remember all the details, to be fair. It was a bit of a shock at the time, ye see. But I’ve been takin’ the pills and feelin’ alright, generally… until this nausea started.
DOCTOR: Alright. Early stages of heart failure, managed with water pills... and now this nausea. Do you notice anything else with the nausea?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Well, sometimes I feel a bit… breathless when it's bad. Not like I cannae catch my breath, more like I just need to take a deeper breath than usual. And sometimes my ankles feel a wee bit swollen at the end of the day, but I just put that down to being on my feet too long, ye ken? I'm a librarian, so I'm up and down all day, shelving books and helpin’ folks. It's a good job, but it keeps ye movin’.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness and ankle swelling… okay. And how about your appetite?
PATIENT: Och, it’s been a bit off, to be honest. Not that I’ve a huge appetite to begin with, but I’m eatin’ even less than usual. The nausea just takes it away, ye see. And even when I do manage to eat something, it doesn't stay down very well. It's not frequent vomiting, mind ye, but it’s happened a couple of times now. Just a wee bit of retchin’ and then nothin’. It's enough to put ye off, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, reduced appetite and some difficulty keeping food down. Let’s do a quick exam, just to get a better feel for things. Can you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Aye, no problem at all. There ye go. I haven't weighed myself in a good while, to be fair. I mostly just try not to think about it!
DOCTOR: Alright… 142 pounds. And your height is 196 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Six foot five, if you prefer. Used to be handy playin’ basketball, but those days are long gone, sadly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds… a little rapid, and I do detect a slight murmur. And yes, I feel some mild swelling in your ankles. No major fluid retention, but it’s there. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Och, aye, no problem at all. Just let me get comfortable here… Is that rapid a bad thing, Doctor? I try not to worry, but it’s hard when I hear things like that!
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. A few crackles in the lower lobes… nothing alarming at the moment, but it’s something we'll keep an eye on. And I'm going to quickly check your abdomen. Soft, no tenderness. Now, sit back up for me. I'd like to get some blood work done, and possibly an EKG.
PATIENT: Och, aye, blood work and an EKG… sounds sensible enough. I’m happy to do whatever ye think is best, Doctor. Are the crackles in my lungs connected to the nausea, do ye think? It's just… everything feels a wee bit connected these days, and it's makin' me fret a bit. I suppose that’s just getting old, though.
DOCTOR: It could be related, yes. The crackles could indicate some fluid buildup, which could be connected to your heart condition. But it's too early to say for sure. The blood work will give us a better look at your kidney function and electrolytes, which can affect both your heart and nausea. The EKG will look at the electrical activity of your heart. It’s just to get a clearer picture. I’m also going to write you a referral to a cardiologist for a more thorough evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, a cardiologist sounds a good idea. I’d rather be safe than sorry, ye ken? I trust yer judgment, Doctor. And thank ye for explainin’ everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease a bit, knowin’ what’s happenin’. I suppose I’ll just need to take things a bit easier for a wee while, then? Less shelf-stackin’, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Less shelf-stacking for a bit. I'll get the lab order and the referral sorted for you now. The lab should be just down the hall. And I’ll have the nurse give you some instructions for preparing for the EKG. It shouldn’t take long. Here you are. This is the lab order, and this is the referral information. Please call to schedule the cardiologist appointment as soon as you can. We'll review the results when they come back, and we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Och, no, I think ye’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. Thank ye kindly for yer time and yer patience. I appreciate ye not dismissin’ my worries. I’ll get those appointments booked right away. And I'll try to take it easy, like ye said. Hopefully, it’s not anything too serious. Thank ye again.
