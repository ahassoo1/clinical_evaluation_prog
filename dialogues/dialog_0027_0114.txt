DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been bothering me. I have trouble when I try to lie flat. It feels… tight. I don’t like it. I want to get this sorted out quickly if we can, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing difficulties… and worse when lying flat. Tightness, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, tightness. Like something is… pressing on me. It’s not a pain, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. And it makes it hard to get a good rest, which is important at my age. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, not really. Same as always. I do try to walk every day, when the weather allows.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on, this tightness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… probably about a month ago. Maybe six weeks? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little bit harder to get comfortable. But it’s been getting worse steadily, the last week or so. I really noticed it when I tried to take a nap yesterday. Couldn’t lie still for more than a few minutes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month to six weeks, progressively worsening. And does anything relieve the feeling, Maribeth?
PATIENT: Well, sitting up helps. Or… propping myself up with pillows. That’s why I have so many on my bed. It feels better when I’m more upright. Doesn’t fix it, but it’s easier to breathe. I find that’s all I can do. I haven’t taken anything for it, Doctor. I don’t really take many medicines.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the breathing trouble?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. My ankles do feel a little swollen sometimes, at the end of the day. But I thought that was just from the heat. It’s been so warm lately. And… I have been a bit more tired than usual. But I’m seventy-one, Doctor. A little tiredness is to be expected. I don’t know if that’s related. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Swollen ankles… and increased fatigue. Yes, that is helpful, Maribeth. We're building a picture here. Now, have you had any coughing?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little bit of a tickle in my throat sometimes, but nothing that would make me cough. No wheezing either. It’s not like a cold, or anything. Just the tightness, and the trouble breathing when I lie down. Honestly, it’s quite frustrating. I just want to be able to sleep comfortably again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick examination. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look at your ankles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I appreciate you looking into this. Just… please be quick, if you can. I have an appointment with the library board this afternoon, and I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Just a quick listen, then we'll take a look at your ankles. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Okay… lungs sound a little diminished bilaterally, some slight crackles at the bases. Heart sounds regular, but a bit distant. And yes, some noticeable pitting edema in both ankles. Hmm.
PATIENT: Edema? Is that bad, Doctor? I don’t understand all these medical terms. Is it something serious? I really hope it's not something serious. I need to get back to work, and I promised my grandson I'd bake him cookies this weekend.
DOCTOR: Edema just means swelling, Maribeth. The swelling in your ankles. It’s often a sign of fluid retention. And while it can be a sign of something more serious, it’s also common with certain conditions. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’m hearing and seeing with the exam, it sounds like we need to investigate possible heart failure or a lung issue. It's too early to say definitively, though. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. We should also check your blood levels - a complete blood count and a BNP. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… and an EKG? And blood tests? Oh dear. That sounds… involved. Is it going to take long? And will it hurt? I really don’t like needles. If it's heart failure… what does that mean? Is that something… curable? I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. I can still manage things on my own, mostly. Just… tell me plainly, Doctor. What are we looking at here?
DOCTOR: Okay, Maribeth. Let’s break it down. The X-ray will let us see your lungs, to check for fluid or other problems. The EKG will check the electrical activity of your heart. And the blood tests will give us some information about your overall health and help rule out other causes. The EKG doesn’t really hurt, it's just stickers on your chest. The blood draw… well, yes, there’s a small pinch. But it’s very quick. Heart failure doesn’t mean your heart has stopped working, it means it’s not pumping as efficiently as it should. It is manageable with medication and lifestyle changes. Sometimes it can be improved, and sometimes it can’t be completely cured, but it can be controlled. We need to get these tests done to know for sure what's going on, and then we can make a plan. It's important to rule things out as well as rule things in. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. If you think it’s necessary, then yes. I suppose I don’t have much choice. But… can we do them quickly? And… can someone explain the results to me, in plain English? I don’t understand all the medical jargon. And… is there anything I should do right now? Like, should I stop walking? Or… change my diet? I haven't eaten much salt, not really. I just want to be sensible.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I'll have the nurse draw your blood right away, and then we’ll get you scheduled for the X-ray. The nurse will explain everything. For now, let's not panic. Continue with your normal activity level, but do pay attention to how you feel. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath at rest, or significant dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Regarding diet, let’s hold off on making any major changes until we have the results of the tests. We’ll want to know what's going on before we adjust anything. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are back, so we can discuss them in detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… manageable. Just… please make sure someone explains everything clearly. I’m not a young woman anymore, and I don’t absorb things as quickly as I used to. And… is there anything I can do to help speed things up? I don't want to be waiting around all day. I have that library board meeting, you know. I suppose I should go get my blood drawn now, then? Where is the nurse?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll make a note to have the nurse explain everything very clearly. I’ll also speak with her personally to ensure she’s aware of your concerns. To help speed things up, I'll call the radiology department now to see if they can fit you in as soon as possible. The nurse, Sarah, is just outside the door. She'll come in momentarily to draw your blood. I’ll be right here if you have any questions or concerns while you're waiting. Just take a deep breath, and we’ll get through this.
