DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. My name is Dr. Kalinski, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. I see here you’re with us today for a general consultation. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, Melvenia Tippens. It's nice to meet you too. Well, to be frank, I just need some forms signed and verified. Something about health records… I don’t really understand it all, and it needs a notary, I think? I hope you can help with that. I’d really like to get this over with quickly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Melvenia. I'm happy to assist you with those forms. It sounds like you may be referring to some documentation required for various health programs or perhaps for establishing or transferring medical records. To clarify, do you recall which specific forms you're referring to?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a good question. Let me see… there’s this one here… It’s got a lot of boxes, and I filled out what I could, but some of it I just don't understand. And there's another one… They came in the mail, I think. Honestly, I get so many papers these days, it’s hard to keep track! Do you recognize them?
DOCTOR: Yes, these are indeed forms related to the Affordable Care Act’s verification process for health insurance subsidies. Specifically, this first one appears to be a detailed income attestation form, and the second is a change of information notification. It’s perfectly understandable to be overwhelmed by these documents, Melvenia; they can be quite complex. It looks like you’ve started the income attestation form, which is good. To complete it accurately, we’ll need to go through your income information for the past year. Would you mind telling me about your sources of income, if any, in 2024?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Income? Well, I’m retired, Doctor. I used to be an anesthesiologist, but that was… a long time ago. I get a small pension, that's about it. Not much. And… oh, I sometimes do a little freelance consulting, helping out old colleagues when they need an extra hand, but it’s very infrequent. It’s not a steady thing at all. Does that make sense? I don’t really have much income, to be honest. And I certainly don’t have all the numbers memorized.
DOCTOR: That clarifies things considerably, Melvenia. A small pension and infrequent freelance consulting – that's perfectly fine. We’ll focus on the pension first, as that’s your primary source of income. Do you happen to have any documentation regarding your pension – perhaps a 1099-R form or a statement from the pension provider?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A… 1099-R? I think… I think I have something… Is this it? It’s all crumpled. It says “Pension Distribution Summary” at the top. I try to keep these things organized, but it's… difficult. I hope this is what you need. I don't have a lot of energy for paperwork, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is perfect, Melvenia. Thank you. This Pension Distribution Summary gives us the information we need. It shows a total distribution of $28,500 for 2024. Now, regarding the infrequent consulting work. Do you have any records – even approximate – of the income you earned from that in 2024?
PATIENT: Oh, that was… maybe a few thousand dollars? Honestly, it was all cash, mostly. Helping out friends, you know? I didn't bother with keeping detailed records. It wasn’t a proper business, just favors. I probably made… $3,000? Maybe less. I really couldn't say for sure. It's all so… fuzzy. I wish I had kept better track, but I didn’t think it was important at the time. Is this going to be a problem? I just want to get these forms signed.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Melvenia. It’s not uncommon for income from occasional freelance work to be difficult to document precisely. An estimated amount of $3,000 is perfectly acceptable for the purposes of this form. We’ll note that it's an estimate, and we’ll disclose that it was primarily cash payments. Now, let's review the second form, the change of information notification. It asks for confirmation of your current address, contact details, and healthcare provider preferences. Do you have any changes to report in those areas?
PATIENT: Oh, no, everything’s the same. Same address, same phone number… I haven’t changed doctors in ages. I like my doctor, old Dr. Ramirez. She's very good, even if she is a bit… slow. No, nothing’s changed on that form. Can we… can we just get this over with? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Melvenia. It seems all your information is up-to-date. Here are the completed forms. Please review them carefully to ensure all the information is accurate to the best of your knowledge. You’ll need to sign and date both forms. Once signed, you can submit them to the insurance marketplace as instructed on the form itself. As a medical doctor, I am required to attest to the accuracy of the information to the best of my knowledge. I have done so here. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Melvenia?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Yes, that’s everything, I think. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you getting this done so quickly. Now, about having these verified… do you have a notary here? Because that’s what I came for, originally.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Melvenia. Unfortunately, our clinic does not have a notary public on staff. To have these forms officially notarized, you will need to visit a local notary public service. Many banks and shipping stores offer notary services for a small fee. Here is a list of notaries in the area, along with their addresses and contact information. I recommend calling ahead to confirm their availability and fees. Is there anything else I can do for you before you go?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… disappointing. Another trip. Well, alright. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I have no choice. Is that everything? I really need to be going. I’m afraid I’m not very good with all this paperwork, and I just want it to be over with. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Melvenia, that is everything I can assist you with today. I understand your frustration with the paperwork, and I’m glad I could help get these forms completed. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any further questions or concerns. Have a pleasant afternoon, and I wish you all the best with the notarization process. .
