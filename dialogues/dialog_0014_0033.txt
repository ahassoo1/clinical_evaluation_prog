DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s rather… inconvenient, to be frank. I seem to be losing my sight and, and… my hearing. It came on quite suddenly, you understand. I have important things to do. I don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Suddenly, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, suddenly. Within the past… oh, I couldn’t say precisely when. A few days, perhaps? It’s really quite disruptive. I had a very important lunch planned, and now… well, never mind. It’s just… everything seems muffled, and blurry. Honestly, I expect a swift diagnosis and resolution.
DOCTOR: Alright. A few days… and it's affecting both your vision and hearing?
PATIENT: Yes, both. Though, my hearing has always been… sensitive. But this is different. It's not a gradual thing. It's… just gone. Or fading, at least. And the sight… well, I can see you, of course, but everything lacks… definition. I really must be going soon. I have people relying on me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Goodness, Doctor, what does one expect? I’m not a medical professional, you know. Let me see… there’s been a slight… dizziness, perhaps. But honestly, that could be from rushing about. I’m a very busy woman. And a bit of a headache, but I get those frequently. Stress, you understand. It’s a demanding life. Is that helpful? Really, I’m not sure why you’re asking me all these… basic questions.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… Hmm. Now that you mention it… perhaps a little. A faint… buzzing, at times. It’s barely noticeable, though. I assumed it was the fluorescent lights. This building is dreadfully modern, you know. Everything is so… sterile. It’s quite unsettling. Are we getting anywhere with this? I really do have a schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? Are you quite finished with the elementary questions? No, I haven't had a fever, nausea, or vomiting! I am not ill, I simply have a temporary… malfunction. A temporary disruption of my senses. It’s probably just stress, as I said. Honestly, I find this line of questioning rather… insulting. I expect a proper examination, not a recitation of common ailments.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's do a quick neurological exam then. I’ll need you to follow my finger with your eyes – don’t move your head, just your eyes. Can you do that?
PATIENT: A neurological exam? Very well. Though I assure you, my neurology is perfectly sound. I was top of my class, you know. Still, I suppose it won’t hurt. But please, be quick about it. There. Am I doing it correctly? I do have important matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you tell me when you start to see my finger again when I bring it in from the side?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is quite tedious. It's… blurry on the edges. I can see it, eventually. But it’s not as clear as it should be. It’s rather unsettling, actually. Are you certain you’re doing this correctly? It feels… imprecise. And please, be mindful of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to hold this tuning fork near your ear and tap it. Can you tell me when you can no longer hear the sound?
PATIENT: A tuning fork? How… antiquated. Honestly, Doctor, I expected more sophisticated technology. I… barely hear it. It’s very faint. And it seems to… disappear quickly. It's a rather unpleasant sound, actually. Is this necessary? I'm beginning to feel quite unwell, honestly. Perhaps I should reschedule.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this brief exam, and considering the sudden onset of both vision and hearing loss, it’s… concerning. It could be a number of things, frankly. I’m going to recommend an immediate MRI to rule out anything serious, like a stroke or a tumor. And I’ll refer you to an ENT specialist for a more thorough audiological evaluation.
PATIENT: An MRI? A tumor? Honestly, Doctor, you’re being rather alarmist. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. A bit stressed, perhaps, but… an MRI seems rather excessive. And an ENT specialist? I haven’t time for endless appointments! I suppose… if you insist. But I expect a swift resolution. I have a very busy schedule, as I’ve mentioned. And I want a second opinion. I always get a second opinion. Very well. Let's get this over with. But I’m not promising I’ll be back.
