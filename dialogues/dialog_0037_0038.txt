DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconi. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I believe I was told to come and speak with you regarding… plans for the future, should something… happen. It’s a bit difficult to recall exactly why I’m here, to be honest. Something about making sure my wishes are known, if I’m unable to… communicate them myself. I think it has to do with a form?
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like we're discussing advance care planning – things like a living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare. It’s very responsible of you to think about this now. It can be a bit overwhelming, and it’s not uncommon to feel unsure about the details. Let's start with a bit of background. To help me understand your current health status and what’s important to you, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… That is a question. I… I don’t really have a regular doctor, I’m afraid. I’ve always been… fairly resilient, I suppose. No major illnesses, as far as I recall. I work with… etching, very precise work. Requires a steady hand, good eyesight. And a lot of patience. I’m divorced, and live alone. That’s… relevant, perhaps? I don't have any close family nearby. I have private insurance, if that matters. But beyond that… I’m afraid I can’t offer much in the way of a detailed health history.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconi. We can build that history together. It's good to know you're generally healthy and that you have private insurance. And thank you for sharing about your living situation; that is relevant, as we consider who might be involved in your care should you need it. Let's start with any current medications you might be taking – even over-the-counter ones or vitamins. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medications… No, I don’t believe so. I truly don’t. I try to avoid them if possible. I find a strong cup of tea is usually sufficient. Allergies… hmm. I think I might be slightly sensitive to dust, sometimes, from the etching process. It makes me sneeze. But it's not a severe allergy, not one that requires medication. Nothing else comes to mind. I’ve always been… fortunate, in that regard. Is that… helpful? I feel rather inadequate discussing this, as I have so little information to offer.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Buoniconi. And don't apologize – it's perfectly fine to not have a lengthy medical history. Avoiding medication when possible is a reasonable approach, and a dust sensitivity is good to know. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you ever had any serious injuries or surgeries?
PATIENT: Serious injuries… no, not that I recall. Perhaps a few scrapes and bruises growing up, as children do. But nothing requiring a hospital visit, or surgery. No, I don’t believe so. I’ve always been… careful. And lucky, perhaps. I spent much of my youth traveling, and was generally quite adept at avoiding… mishaps. Though, my memories are… fragmented. It's possible I’m overlooking something. But I think I would remember a surgery. Would I have records somewhere?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And it’s understandable that memories can be fragmented. We can certainly look into obtaining any records if you'd like. Don’t worry about it for now. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a difficult question, Doctor. I… I wasn’t particularly close to my family. I left home at a young age, and didn’t maintain much contact. My parents… they are no longer with us. And I don’t know much about their families, or any conditions that might have been prevalent. I’m afraid I can’t offer much assistance there. It’s… a blank space, really. I apologize. I feel I’m being remarkably unhelpful. Perhaps we should focus on my wishes, then? The form you mentioned?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconi. You are not being unhelpful at all. It’s very common for people to have limited knowledge of their family medical history, and it’s understandable given your circumstances. We can absolutely focus on your wishes regarding advance care planning. Before we dive into the form itself, let me ask one more question, just to get a complete picture. Could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle…? Well, I work. Quite a lot, actually. Etching is… demanding. It requires focus, precision. I work from home, mostly. It's a solitary occupation. I enjoy… quiet evenings. Reading. Listening to music. I don't really… socialize much. I take long walks, when the weather permits. I try to eat healthily, though I confess I have a fondness for strong tea and pastries. It’s… a simple life. A rather… uneventful one, to be honest. Is that what you meant? I don’t engage in any… extreme activities. Or vices, for that matter. I’m a very… contained person.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good sense, thank you. It sounds like you lead a peaceful and focused life. It's wonderful that you enjoy reading and walking. Now, let's talk about what brought you in regarding advance care planning. You mentioned a form. Are you aware of what a living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare involve?
PATIENT: Vaguely. I recall something about… expressing my wishes, should I become incapacitated. Unable to make decisions for myself. A living will… that sounds like it pertains to medical treatment, doesn't it? And the power of attorney… that would be someone designated to make those decisions on my behalf? I believe I was told it would outline what I would and wouldn’t want. But the details… they’re rather hazy. I remember feeling overwhelmed when it was first explained to me. Something about life support, and… feeding tubes. It was all rather… clinical. And frightening, to be honest. I suppose I just want to ensure my wishes are respected. And not be a burden. Is that… clear? I apologize for my lack of clarity. It’s… difficult to articulate.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly clear, Ms. Buoniconi. And you’re not lacking clarity at all. It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and frightened when thinking about these things. It’s a big topic. You're right; a living will outlines your wishes regarding medical treatment if you’re unable to communicate them yourself. And a durable power of attorney for healthcare designates someone you trust to make those decisions on your behalf. Let’s start with the living will. Do you have any initial thoughts about what types of medical treatment you would or would not want in certain situations?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. I suppose… I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of recovery. No quality of life. That sounds… harsh, doesn’t it? But prolonging suffering… that seems… cruel. I’m not afraid of death, per se. But I am afraid of being… trapped. Dependent. I would want pain management, of course. And dignity. That’s very important. As for specific treatments… I honestly don’t know. I’ve never had to consider such things. I suppose… if my brain was… irrevocably damaged, I wouldn’t want to be kept alive. But beyond that… I’m at a loss. Is there a… checklist? Something to guide me? I feel utterly unprepared for this.
DOCTOR: That’s a very thoughtful response, Ms. Buoniconi. And you’re not alone in feeling unprepared – many people find this difficult. There is a checklist, a questionnaire, and we can go through it together. It covers various scenarios and allows you to express your wishes in a more structured way. It also has sections about things like resuscitation – whether or not you’d want CPR if your heart stopped. And about artificial nutrition and hydration – feeding tubes. We can take it at your own pace, and I’ll explain everything as we go. Would you like to start with the resuscitation section?
PATIENT: Yes… resuscitation, perhaps. That sounds… logical. As a starting point. I suppose… if there was absolutely no chance of recovery, I wouldn’t want to be… revived. To simply prolong the inevitable. But… what if there was a small chance? A glimmer of hope? That’s what I struggle with. I wouldn’t want to miss out on… possibilities. But I also wouldn’t want to be… kept alive in a vegetative state. It’s… a terrible dilemma. Perhaps you could explain the options more clearly? What would that entail, practically speaking? If I were to… decline resuscitation?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconi. Let's break it down. If you were to decline resuscitation, it means that if your heart stopped beating or you stopped breathing, medical personnel would focus on providing comfort care – managing pain and symptoms – rather than attempting to restart your heart with CPR, electric shock, or medications. It's important to understand that this doesn't mean you'd be abandoned. It simply means the focus shifts from aggressive intervention to ensuring you’re comfortable and peaceful. There are different levels of resuscitation orders. We can discuss a "Do Not Resuscitate" order, which specifically states you don’t want CPR. Or a "Allow Natural Death" order, which allows the natural course of your illness to take its course. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Allow Natural Death… that sounds… rather final. And… unsettling. DNR… Do Not Resuscitate… that feels… more active. A deliberate choice. I suppose… I wouldn’t want to be… aggressively resuscitated if there was absolutely no hope. No brain activity. Severe and irreversible damage. But… what if there was a possibility, however small? A chance of recovery, even with… limitations? Would that be… considered? Would they still attempt to save me, even with a DNR order, if there was a glimmer of hope? Or would that be… disregarded? I don’t want to be… a burden. But I also don’t want to be… prematurely declared… finished. It’s… a terrible thing to contemplate. Perhaps I’m being… foolish. Asking too much.
DOCTOR: You're not being foolish at all, Ms. Buoniconi. These are incredibly important questions, and it's good you're thinking through them so carefully. It's perfectly reasonable to want to ensure that all possibilities are considered, even with limitations. The way a DNR order is interpreted can vary, and it's crucial to be as specific as possible. It's also important to understand that even with a DNR order, you would still receive all other appropriate medical care – pain management, symptom control, emotional support. What you're describing sounds like you'd want a "conditional" DNR. Meaning, resuscitation would be attempted if there was a reasonable chance of recovery, even with limitations. We can absolutely document that. It's often written as something like, "Full code until irreversible condition is established." We would need to define what you consider an "irreversible condition." Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Conditional… yes. That sounds… much more acceptable. Full code until irreversible condition… that is precisely what I was trying to convey. Irreversible… I suppose that would mean… no brain activity. No possibility of regaining consciousness. Severe and permanent damage to… essential organs. Something that would render me… unable to live a meaningful life. That sounds… adequate. Is that a… common definition? And… would that be clearly documented? So that there is no… ambiguity? I wouldn’t want my wishes to be… misinterpreted. Or disregarded. It’s… a great weight on my mind.
DOCTOR: That is a very common and reasonable definition, Ms. Buoniconi. "Irreversible condition" is often defined as the absence of brain activity, severe and permanent damage to essential organs, or an inability to regain consciousness. We can certainly document that specifically in your medical record. I will also include a statement outlining that you wish for full code – meaning full resuscitation efforts – until that irreversible condition is established. And yes, we will clearly document your wishes regarding all aspects of your advance care planning – the conditional DNR, your definition of an irreversible condition, and your wishes for comfort care. It will be part of your permanent medical record, and accessible to all healthcare providers involved in your care. We’ll also need to designate a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to do so. Have you thought about who you’d like to designate as your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… That is… difficult. I… I don’t have any close family. I’m divorced, and haven’t maintained contact with my ex-husband for many years. And I don’t have any… close friends. I’ve always been… rather independent. There is… a solicitor, Mr. Davies. He handles my legal affairs. He’s… reliable, and… discreet. I suppose he would be… adequate. Though I haven’t discussed these matters with him. He’s simply… familiar with my affairs. Would that be… sufficient? I hesitate, feeling a pang of unease. It doesn’t feel… ideal. But I can’t think of anyone else. I truly can’t. Would he need to be… formally designated? Or simply informed of my wishes?
DOCTOR: Mr. Davies sounds like a reasonable choice, Ms. Buoniconi. It’s perfectly alright to designate someone simply based on reliability and familiarity with your affairs. He would need to be formally designated as your healthcare proxy. That involves signing a legal document – a healthcare power of attorney form – granting him the authority to make medical decisions on your behalf. We can provide you with that form, and you can discuss it with him. He would also need to be willing to accept that responsibility. It’s also helpful to have a conversation with him about your wishes – what types of medical treatment you would or wouldn’t want, your values, and what’s important to you. Would you like me to provide you with the healthcare power of attorney form and some information about the responsibilities of a healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… most helpful. The form, and the information… anything that would help Mr. Davies understand his… responsibilities. I suppose I should also speak with him directly, and ensure he’s… willing to accept this role. I hadn’t considered that. And… is there anything else I should be aware of? Any other forms or documents that would be… beneficial? I want to ensure everything is… in order. I’ve put this off for far too long. It’s… a great weight off my mind, finally addressing this. Thank you, Doctor. Truly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Buoniconi. I'm glad we were able to address this today. It takes courage to think through these difficult topics, and you've done a wonderful job. Besides the healthcare power of attorney form, it's also beneficial to have a living will – which we discussed – outlining your wishes regarding specific medical treatments. We can provide you with that form as well. I also recommend considering a POLST form – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment. It’s a medical order that outlines your wishes regarding CPR, artificial ventilation, and feeding. However, it's typically completed when you're seriously ill or frail. We can discuss that at a later date if appropriate. I will have my assistant prepare a packet with the healthcare power of attorney and living will forms, along with some information about each. She will also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss any questions you may have and ensure everything is in order. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything for now. A follow-up appointment would be… most appreciated. It’s… reassuring to know I have someone to guide me through this process. Thank you again. Truly. I feel… much better equipped to handle this now. And I appreciate your… patience and understanding. It hasn’t been easy… confronting these matters. I suppose I should allow you to attend to other patients. I won’t take up any more of your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Buoniconi. It was my pleasure to assist you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. My assistant will be in touch to schedule your follow-up appointment. And please remember, taking care of these matters is a sign of strength and responsibility. Have a good day, Ms. Buoniconi. And take care. .
PATIENT: You as well, Doctor. And thank you again. .
