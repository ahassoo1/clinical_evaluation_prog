DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… need check for referee. For work, you know? Fitness thing. Want to finish quick if okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, a check-up for a work fitness requirement. I understand wanting to be efficient. We’ll do our best to be thorough and keep things moving. Just to clarify, is this a new requirement from your employer, or is this a routine check-up you do regularly?
PATIENT: New. First time. They say need… proof I can run, not fall over. I repair… the inside of ovens, big ovens. Need to be… strong. Not get tired easy. Never do this before, fitness test.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a physical capability assessment for your job as an oven repair technician – understandable, that requires a good level of physical fitness. And it’s the first time your employer is requesting this, alright. Let’s start with a little more detail about why they’re requesting this now. Has anything changed at work?
PATIENT: No change. Just… new boss. He like… paper. Everything need paper. He see other workers do test, so he want me do too. I don’t know why he care. I been doing this work long time. No problem before.
DOCTOR: Okay, a new boss implementing new procedures. That happens sometimes. It's good to be proactive and fulfill the requirement. Let’s put the paperwork aside for a moment and focus on you. Are you experiencing any current symptoms – any pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, fatigue – anything at all that’s bothering you, even if it seems small?
PATIENT: No pain. Sometimes… tired after work. Long day, hot. But… normal. No dizziness. Just… old. Thirty-one, but feel older sometimes. That okay, right? Old for running? I try to stay healthy. Eat rice, vegetables. Not much sugar.
DOCTOR: Thirty-one is certainly not old! It’s completely normal to feel tired after a long, physically demanding workday, especially if it’s hot. It doesn't sound like anything concerning at all. To get a better picture of your overall health, and make sure there aren’t any underlying reasons for the fatigue, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Not much. I… broke arm when little. Fall from tree. But good now. No doctor since then, maybe ten years ago. Wife… she take care of everything. After… she gone. No need doctor. Just… work. Eat. Sleep. Repeat. Nothing special. Sorry. Is that okay? Should I say more?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Shanor. It’s good to know you haven't had significant health issues. It's understandable to focus on work and daily life, especially after a loss. No need to apologize. Just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Never. Wife check me sometimes, blood pressure okay. She… careful. I think. Never say anything bad. Just tell me eat more vegetables. That's all. Don't think I have those problems. Not… family problems either. No one sick. Just… normal family.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. So, no family history of significant illness, and your wife has checked your blood pressure previously, with normal results. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. No pills. No vitamins. Just… water. Sometimes tea. Wife say tea good for… everything. But I don't really like it. So… only water. Plain water. I don’t like too much stuff in my body. Makes me… slow.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. That simplifies things. Now, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: No. Nothing I know. Never… rash. Never trouble breathing. Wife try to give me something for cold once, but I just… throw it away. Don’t like feeling… weird. Just… let cold go away. Never problem. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s very helpful. Now, to get a clearer understanding of your current physical state, would you mind if I perform a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: Okay. Quick is good. I have work later. Just need paper, you know? No long time, please? I… get nervous when too much poking. Quick check okay. Quick.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll keep it quick and focused. Just a basic assessment of your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few simple strength and balance tests. No need to worry. First, let’s start with your vital signs. Could you please sit up on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay. Sitting. Quick, you said? No… long things? Like needles? Because… I don't like needles. Very much.
DOCTOR: No needles today, Mr. Shanor. Just your blood pressure and pulse. I promise it will be quick. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is 72 and regular, and your lungs sound clear. Now, could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breath. Like this? Is good? I don’t… like being watched when I breathe. Nervous. Can we hurry? The boss… he not patient man.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Mr. Shanor. Your breathing sounds good. Just a few more quick checks, then we can get you your paper. Could you please extend your arms out to the sides?
PATIENT: Like this? Is okay? My arms… not very strong. Mostly use them to… hold oven tools. Not for… flying. Hurry, please?
DOCTOR: Alright. And just stand on your toes for a moment, if you can.
PATIENT: Woah! Okay. That’s… hard. Wife say I need more… calcium. But I don’t like milk. This test… is making me nervous. Can we just… write down I’m okay? I need to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Shanor, it’s alright. You don’t need to force anything. Based on what I’ve seen and heard, you appear to be in generally good health. There’s some mild weakness and a little unsteadiness, but that’s not necessarily concerning given your occupation and the fact that you haven’t been regularly exercising. To be safe, and to address the slight unsteadiness, I’d like to recommend a Vitamin D screening and possibly a brief consultation with a physical therapist to discuss some simple exercises to improve your strength and balance. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Vitamin… D? And… what is physical… therapy? Is that more poking? I just need paper for boss. He not care about vitamins. He care about me… not falling. Can you just… say I passed? I can tell him I do exercises at home. Push oven, you know? Very good exercise. Please?
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, I understand your situation and your concern about keeping things simple. I’m always mindful of patient comfort and preferences. Given your occupation, the fact that you are currently able to perform your job without difficulty, and your desire to avoid further testing, I can document that you have passed a basic physical assessment, with the understanding that regular physical activity is recommended to maintain your strength and balance. I will also note my recommendation for Vitamin D screening. However, I strongly advise you to consider the Vitamin D screening and a brief consultation with a physical therapist. It would be beneficial for your overall health and well-being. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes! That is… perfect. Perfect. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. Just… the paper. Please, the paper. I can tell boss I exercise. I push many ovens. Very good exercise. And I eat vegetables. Sometimes. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor, here’s your report. It states that you have passed a basic physical assessment and have demonstrated sufficient strength and balance for your occupation. I’ve also included my recommendation for Vitamin D screening. Please remember to prioritize your health and well-being. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, thank you. This is… everything. You are very good doctor. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Shanor. Take care, and have a good day.
