DOCTOR: Hi Teretha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this tingling… in my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I figured I should get it checked out. It’s just… annoying, you know? And a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your hands and feet. "A little worrying" is a good way to put it – it’s always best to get these things looked at. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not constant, thankfully. It comes and goes. Mostly feels like… pins and needles, like when your foot falls asleep. But it doesn't always feel like that. Sometimes it's just… numb. It’s worse in the evenings, I think. And colder weather doesn’t help, that's for sure. I do a lot of walking for my job, you see – postal carrier. Maybe that has something to do with it? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent tingling and numbness, worse in the evenings and with cold, and you're a postal carrier doing a lot of walking. That’s helpful information. Does it affect both hands and feet equally?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I think it’s a little worse in my feet, yes. My hands get it too, but not as often. And not as… strong, maybe? It’s hard to explain. Both sides, though – both feet and both hands. It’s not just one side acting up, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Good clarification. And have you noticed anything that specifically triggers it, besides the cold and evenings?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me see… Well, when I’m carrying a really heavy bag of mail, sometimes it feels worse right away. Like, if I’ve got a particularly full route and the bag is weighing me down, I’ll notice it more. But it doesn’t happen every time, you know? It’s just… sometimes. And… sometimes when I’m really tired, it’s worse too. But I’m always tired these days. Old age, I guess!
DOCTOR: Okay, so heavier loads and fatigue seem to be factors. And you mentioned age - 63, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Sixty-three this year. Though I feel older some days! I’ve been doing the postal route for… oh, goodness, almost 30 years now. It’s good work, keeps me moving, but… I suppose it takes a toll on the body.
DOCTOR: Right, 30 years is a long time on your feet. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other health problems I should be aware of – things like diabetes, thyroid issues, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… No, not really. I had a bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on a little pill and it’s been fine ever since. Nothing else, really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Knock on wood! I haven’t been to the doctor much in the last few years, unless it was something really bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, well that’s good to know. You have a history of hypertension managed with medication. Do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. I’m terrible with names! It’s a little white pill… I take it every morning. I just ask the pharmacy to refill it, I don’t really pay attention to the name, to be honest. My husband always took care of that stuff, and… well, he’s gone now. Sorry, I shouldn’t be rambling.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. No need to apologize at all. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. We can look it up in your records if you’d like. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good idea, looking it up. Yes, please do. Allergies… hmm. No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to help my mother with her gardening, and I never had any trouble with plants or anything. Nothing like that. I don’t really eat anything unusual either, so I doubt it's a food allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let’s move on to your family history. Has anyone in your family had similar problems with tingling or numbness?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tough one. My mother had…arthritis, I think. In her hands, mostly. She complained about aches and pains all the time. But I don’t think it was tingling, exactly. My father… he died young, from a heart attack. And my brother… he’s still alive, but we don’t talk much. I don't really know what health problems he has, if any. It wasn't really something we talked about much as a family, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, and a father who died of a heart attack. Not much information about your brother. And finally, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh no, never smoked a day in my life. Hated the smell! And I don’t drink much alcohol, either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on a special occasion. But that's it. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Lots of vegetables from my garden when I can. I do like my sweets, though… that’s my weakness!
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and a fondness for sweets. That's helpful. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just try not to poke too much! I'm not very good with needles, either, just so you know.
DOCTOR: No needles today, I promise! I'll just be checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. Let's start with your hands. Could you please extend your arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There you go. Be gentle, please! I’ve been using these hands for a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are good, and your grip and finger strength are strong. Now I’m going to check your sensation. Can you close your eyes for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There you go. Just let me know when you’re ready. I hope this doesn't take too long. I have to get home and water the tomatoes. They need a good soaking after this heat.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. Your sensation is good in your hands and forearms. However, your sensation is slightly decreased in your feet and ankles, particularly in your toes. That's what we call a "stocking distribution" pattern. Now I'll just check your pulse in your feet.
PATIENT: Oh. Decreased sensation… that doesn’t sound good, does it? Is that… serious? A stocking distribution… what does that mean? I hope it's not anything too bad. And the tomatoes really need watering.
DOCTOR: Okay, your pulses are present, but a little bit weaker than they should be. And I didn’t hear any unusual sounds when I listened to your feet. A stocking distribution pattern just means the numbness is affecting your feet and ankles in a pattern like you’re wearing stockings. It can be caused by a number of things. Don't worry yet, it doesn’t automatically mean anything serious. I think we need to do some further testing to figure out the cause. Have you had your blood sugar checked recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Further testing… that sounds expensive. I don’t have very good insurance, you see. And blood sugar… no, I haven’t had that checked in ages. Not since… well, I don’t even remember. My husband used to take care of all that stuff. Is it possible it could be something from all the walking? Or maybe just old age? I really don't want to have to go on any medications.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost and medications. Let's talk about that. We can definitely work with you to find affordable options for testing. A basic blood sugar test is relatively inexpensive. And it's important to rule out diabetes, as that can cause this type of numbness. As for the walking, it could be a factor – repetitive stress can sometimes contribute to nerve issues, but we need to rule out other causes first. I'd like to order a blood test to check your blood sugar, vitamin B12 levels, and thyroid function. We'll also check for kidney problems, as that can also cause this type of symptom. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… vitamin B12 and thyroid… and kidneys? That sounds like a lot of tests. But… if you think it’s necessary, I suppose. And I really don’t want anything serious. I just want to be able to water my tomatoes and keep walking. So, yes, alright. Let’s do the tests. But please, can we try to keep the cost down? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll make sure to order only the necessary tests and will discuss the costs with the lab beforehand to find the most affordable options. I'll also provide you with a lab order that outlines the costs. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to monitor your symptoms and letting me know if they worsen. I'm also going to give you a handout with some general tips for foot care and managing numbness. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?
PATIENT: Okay, 3-5 days… that’s good. And a handout? That’s helpful. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And please, send the lab order to the front desk, and they can help me with the cost. I really appreciate it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really should get home and water those tomatoes…
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teretha. It was my pleasure. I'll have the lab order sent to the front desk, and they'll be happy to assist you with the costs. And don't worry about the tomatoes – we'll figure this out. Take care, and I'll see you back here once the results are in. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
