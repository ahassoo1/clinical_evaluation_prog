DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Glowka. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I received a letter regarding some test results from a GI endoscopy I had done… and it seems there were some… abnormalities detected. That’s why I’m here. I must admit, I was a little worried when I read the letter, so I wanted to discuss it with someone.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly normal to be concerned after receiving such a letter. We’ll certainly go through the results together and address your concerns. To start, do you recall when exactly you had the endoscopy performed, and do you happen to have a copy of the report with you today?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It was on July 12th of this year, just a few weeks ago. Here’s the report, Doctor. I made sure to bring everything the clinic sent me. I believe it has all the details, though truthfully, some of the wording was… difficult for me to follow.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Minatra. This is helpful. Alright, let’s take a look together. It appears the report indicates some inflammation and… several polypoid lesions were identified in the stomach and duodenum. Do you have any current symptoms that prompted this endoscopy in the first place?
PATIENT: Polypoid lesions… That sounds… concerning. To answer your question, Doctor, I had been experiencing some discomfort, yes. Mostly a sort of dull ache in my upper stomach, and a feeling of being… full very quickly. Not a sharp pain, just… unpleasant. And occasionally, a bit of nausea, though I haven’t actually been sick. It wasn't constant, but it was frequent enough to bother me, and my regular physician suggested the endoscopy to investigate.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache in the upper stomach, early satiety, and occasional nausea – that's helpful information. And it’s good that your primary care doctor was proactive in ordering the endoscopy. Could you describe the ache a bit more?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It's… difficult to pinpoint exactly. It's not a burning sensation, like heartburn. More of a… heavy, nagging ache. It tends to come and go, and it doesn’t really radiate anywhere. It’s usually most noticeable after I’ve eaten, though it can sometimes be there even on an empty stomach. It’s not debilitating, mind you, but it’s enough to make me lose my appetite sometimes. I’ve also found that lying down seems to make it a little worse. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A heavy, nagging ache, worse after eating and when lying down… that helps build a clearer picture. Now, has anything in particular seemed to trigger it or make it worse besides eating and lying down?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Now that you mention it, I believe spicy foods seem to aggravate it somewhat. Not every time, but often. And…stress. If I’m particularly worried or anxious, I’ve noticed the ache is more pronounced. It's not a direct correlation, but it seems there's a connection. I've also noticed a bit of fatigue lately, though I'm not sure if that’s related. I do try to stay active, walking in the park most days, but I’ve been feeling more tired than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay. Spicy foods, stress, and some fatigue in addition to the upper abdominal pain, early satiety, and nausea… thank you for sharing that with me. Now, regarding your diet generally, what does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I try to eat a balanced diet, although I confess, I do enjoy my food. Typically, for breakfast, I have a bowl of oatmeal with fruit, maybe a slice of toast. Lunch is usually a salad with grilled chicken or fish, sometimes a small sandwich. For dinner, I often prepare traditional Aztec dishes – lots of vegetables, beans, and corn tortillas. I do enjoy a good mole sauce, though perhaps I should cut back on that, given the spice! I drink plenty of water throughout the day, and I rarely drink alcohol. I do enjoy a sweet treat occasionally, but I try to limit those. Is that the sort of information you were looking for?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Minatra. It sounds like you have a very healthy and varied diet. Knowing that you eat a well-balanced diet helps me understand your symptoms even better. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or any autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. I’ve been quite fortunate in that regard, thankfully. I’ve always been relatively healthy. I did have my appendix removed when I was a young woman, many years ago. That was the only surgery I’ve ever had. And I do have slightly elevated blood pressure, which my regular physician monitors. It’s usually well-controlled with a mild medication, though. Other than that… nothing significant. I haven’t been diagnosed with any other medical conditions.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in the past and currently well-controlled hypertension. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or any other condition, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I take Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day, for my blood pressure. Here it is. Other than that, I occasionally take ibuprofen for minor aches and pains, but not very often. I try to avoid taking any medications unless absolutely necessary. I also take a Vitamin D supplement during the winter months, as my physician suggested. Is that all you needed to know regarding medications?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Minatra. Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and occasional ibuprofen and Vitamin D. That’s very helpful. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as stomach cancer, colon cancer, ulcers, or any other digestive disorders?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My mother passed away at a relatively young age from heart disease, unfortunately. My father… he had some issues with his digestion, yes. He didn’t have a specific diagnosis, but he frequently complained of stomach discomfort and heartburn. He didn't seek much medical attention, though. He was a very stoic man. As for cancer… I don't believe anyone in my immediate family has been diagnosed with stomach or colon cancer. My aunt, on my mother's side, had breast cancer, but that was many years ago. Other than that… I'm not aware of any other significant digestive disorders in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal history of heart disease, paternal history of unspecified digestive complaints, and maternal aunt with breast cancer. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, finally, regarding allergies, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything, thankfully. I can eat all sorts of foods without any issue. And I haven’t had any problems with medications or environmental factors, either. I've always considered myself quite fortunate in that regard. No allergies to report, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Minatra. That’s a very thorough medical history. Now, let's talk about the endoscopy report. As you know, the report indicated some inflammation and polypoid lesions in your stomach and duodenum. Polypoid lesions are essentially small growths on the lining of the digestive tract. They can be benign, or in some cases, they can be precancerous. The report also mentions biopsies were taken. Do you recall anything being discussed about the type of biopsies taken or what they were looking for specifically?
PATIENT: I remember them saying they were taking samples to examine for any abnormalities, of course. They mentioned something about looking for changes in the cells… and I think the word “cancer” was used, but very quickly followed by reassurance that most polyps are not cancerous. Honestly, Doctor, it was all a bit overwhelming, and I was quite nervous. I don’t recall the specifics of which types of biopsies they took. They did explain they would send the samples to a lab for analysis. I just… I’m anxious to know what the results are.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Minatra. It is a lot to process, and it's common to feel anxious in that situation. The fact that they took biopsies is the correct course of action. I've reviewed the report, and it indicates the biopsies were sent to pathology for histological examination to determine the nature of the lesions and the presence of any dysplasia or malignancy. Now, do you have the results of the pathology report with you today?
PATIENT: Yes, I do, thankfully. It came in the mail just a few days ago. Here you are. I haven't looked at it too closely, to be honest. I was afraid of what it might say, so I left it to you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Minatra. The pathology report indicates you have several small polyps in your stomach and duodenum. The good news is, the majority of these are benign – specifically, they are described as hyperplastic polyps, which are very common and do not typically require any immediate treatment. However, the report also identifies one polyp in the duodenum that shows evidence of low-grade dysplasia. Dysplasia means there are some abnormal changes in the cells, but it’s not yet cancerous. Low-grade dysplasia has a relatively low risk of progressing to cancer, but it does require monitoring. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Benign polyps… that’s good, isn’t it? Low-grade dysplasia… that sounds concerning, even if you say the risk is low. Monitoring… what does that entail, Doctor? What exactly do you recommend? And… what are the chances of it becoming something worse? I'm afraid of cancer, you see. My sister… she lost her battle with breast cancer last year.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, Ms. Minatra. It’s very natural to be worried, especially given your sister’s experience. We’re going to take a proactive approach to ensure your health and peace of mind. Low-grade dysplasia isn’t cancer, and it doesn't necessarily mean you will develop cancer. However, it does indicate that there is some abnormal cell growth, and we want to keep a close eye on it to ensure it doesn't progress. The standard of care for low-grade dysplasia in the duodenum is regular endoscopic surveillance. This involves repeating the endoscopy every 1-3 years to monitor the polyp for any changes in size, shape, or cellular structure. During the endoscopy, the doctor can also take additional biopsies if necessary to assess the polyp further. In some cases, depending on the size and location of the polyp, the doctor may recommend removing it during the endoscopy. Would you be comfortable with scheduling a follow-up endoscopy in approximately one year to monitor the polyp?
PATIENT: One year… yes, I suppose that’s reasonable. If that's what you recommend, Doctor, I trust your judgment. I would like to know, though… are there any lifestyle changes I can make to potentially slow down the growth of this polyp? Any foods I should avoid, or anything I should be doing differently? And… is there anything else I should be aware of? Any symptoms I should watch out for?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Minatra. While there's no definitive proof that lifestyle changes can prevent the progression of low-grade dysplasia, there are several things you can do to promote overall digestive health and potentially minimize risk. First, maintaining a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and fiber is important. Limiting processed foods, red meat, and sugary drinks can also be beneficial. Avoiding excessive alcohol consumption and refraining from smoking are also recommended. In terms of symptoms to watch out for, you should contact me immediately if you experience any new or worsening abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, persistent nausea or vomiting, or blood in your stool. We will also want to ensure you continue to take your Lisinopril as prescribed to manage your blood pressure. Finally, if you experience any new medications or changes in your health status, please let me know. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Healthy diet, avoid processed foods and alcohol, no smoking, watch for new symptoms… and continue taking my blood pressure medication. I suppose that’s… manageable. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It's still worrying, of course, but I feel… a little more prepared now. So, a follow-up endoscopy in one year… let's schedule that. And thank you again, Doctor Glowka. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Minatra. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. We’ll schedule that follow-up endoscopy for around this time next year. My nurse, Sarah, will help arrange that for you before you leave. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s all. You've answered everything I was worried about. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I think I'll go home now and try to relax. Thank you once again, Doctor Glowka. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Minatra. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’re here if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care of yourself, and have a good day as well. .
