DOCTOR: Hi Criston, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Ranjan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um, well, my pee is… orange. It started a couple days ago. Not all the time, but… yeah, orange. It’s a little strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, orange urine. That is a little unusual. Let's try to figure out what's going on. First, can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. Like I said, it’s not always orange. Sometimes it’s normal color. But when it is orange, it’s… like, a bright orange. Not dark, not light, just… orange. I don't know if that makes sense. I drink a lot of water, so I don’t think it’s just from not drinking enough.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. And it's good you're staying hydrated. Bright orange, you say... Okay. Have you noticed any other changes when you go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Same amount, I guess. No pain or anything like that. Just the color. Sometimes it smells a little… stronger, maybe? But I don’t know if that’s just me thinking things. My wife didn't notice anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, normal amount, and possibly a slightly stronger smell. We'll definitely look into that smell too. Now, have you started taking any new medications, vitamins, or supplements recently?
PATIENT: New… medication? No, nothing new. Same stuff I always take for my… you know, blood pressure. And a multivitamin. I’ve been taking that for years, though. Nothing changed with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes to your medications or supplements. And you’ve had the multivitamin for years. Have you eaten anything unusual lately?
PATIENT: Unusual… not really. We had couscous last night. My wife makes it really good. And carrots with dinner a couple of times this week. But that's about it. I don’t eat a lot of strange foods. Just normal Moroccan food, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, couscous and carrots... those can sometimes affect urine color, but usually not this dramatically. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical problems besides blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure, really. And, um, I had a problem with my kidney, a long time ago. When I was a kid, maybe ten years old. I had to go to the hospital, but they fixed it. It’s never bothered me since. I don't think it's that, but you asked.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know about the kidney issue when you were a child. It’s always helpful to have the full picture. Do you remember what the problem was, if they told you?
PATIENT: Hmm… it was a long time ago. I think… they said it was an infection? Something with the urine, like a bad bug. I don’t remember a lot of the details. My mom did most of the talking with the doctors. I just know I was sick and had to stay in the hospital for a week. They gave me medicine. Never had a problem since.
DOCTOR: Okay, a childhood kidney infection. That is important information. Do you have any family history of kidney problems, or any other medical issues that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um… my grandfather, on my mom’s side, he had diabetes. And my uncle, her brother, he has high blood pressure, like me. I don't think anyone else had kidney problems, not that I know of. My mom always said everyone on her side was pretty healthy, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in the grandfather and high blood pressure in the uncle. That's helpful. Now, I’m going to ask about some other things, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Have you had any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or back pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. No sickness or throwing up. And my back feels normal, no pain. Just the orange pee. It’s a little worrying, to be honest. I just want to know what’s going on with it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll also feel your abdomen to check your kidneys and other organs. Then, I’d like to order a urine test, a simple urinalysis, to see what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever tests you need. I just want to know what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let's start with the exam. Please lie down on the exam table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Then, I'll gently press on your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels painful or uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay. Go ahead. Just tell me if I need to do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound good. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. No masses or organomegaly. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to take a quick look at your skin. Skin looks normal, no jaundice or unusual discoloration. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Now we'll get that urine sample. I'll give you a cup, and I'll step out of the room to give you some privacy. Just collect a mid-stream sample – start urinating, then collect a small amount in the cup, and finish urinating. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Start and stop, get a little in the cup. Okay, I can do that. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Perfect. I’ll step out now. Just let me know when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Okay, I’m finished.
DOCTOR: Great, thank you. I'll take that to the lab right away. The results should be back within a few hours. While we're waiting, I’m going to review your EHR to see if there's anything else relevant in your history. Okay, I see you've been consistently monitored for hypertension for the past few years, and your blood pressure has generally been well-controlled with medication. Everything looks pretty stable here. I’m ordering a complete metabolic panel as well, just to get a broader picture of your kidney function. I also want to rule out any potential liver issues. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to medications. Never had a problem with any of the pills the doctor has given me before. I just hope it's nothing serious. This orange pee is… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. I understand your concern, and we're doing everything we can to figure this out. It's good you haven't had any allergic reactions before. While we wait for the lab results, let’s talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. My wife doesn’t like smoking, so I stayed away from it. I drink a little coffee sometimes, maybe one or two cups a day. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking. And one or two cups of coffee a day isn’t usually a problem. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not every day. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on the weekend. Or a beer if we’re watching football. Nothing too much. My wife drinks wine too. We don’t go crazy with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate alcohol consumption. That's good to know. Now, just one last question for now: do you do any strenuous physical activity?
PATIENT: Strenuous? No, not really. I walk a little bit, maybe around the neighborhood. But nothing like running or lifting weights. I work in an office, so I mostly sit all day. I should probably do more, but… it's hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly sedentary with some light walking. That's helpful. Thank you for answering all those questions, Criston. Alright, let's see... We've covered a lot. While we wait for the lab results, which should be back in a couple of hours, I want to reassure you that there are a number of possible explanations for orange urine, most of which are benign. Dehydration, certain medications or foods, and sometimes even supplements can cause it. But we need to rule out anything more serious, which is why we're running these tests. I’ll have the lab fax the results directly to me. I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you notice any pain, fever, or changes in your urine output, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. I just want to know what’s going on. I’ll keep an eye out for any pain or changes. And I’ll wait for your call. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Criston. I understand your concern, and I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. You have a good day, and please try not to worry too much. We’ll figure this out together.
