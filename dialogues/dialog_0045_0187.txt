DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowic, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Chest…feel funny. And heart…jump-jump sometimes. Blood pressure…nurse say high. I no like. Make quick, okay? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. “Chest feel funny” and your heart “jump-jump” sometimes, and the nurse mentioned your blood pressure was elevated. We'll get to the bottom of it. Just trying to get a clear picture here. How long have you been feeling this "funny" feeling in your chest?
PATIENT: Long time. Maybe…two, three months? I dunno. Old man problems, probably. I busy man, no time to…measure every little thing. Just want fix, go home.
DOCTOR: Alright. Two or three months. And when you say "jump-jump," is that a fluttering feeling, a pounding, or something else?
PATIENT: Pounding. Like…drum. Sometimes after I eat big dinner. Or…when wife yell. Makes me stress, you know? Is that bad? Just tell me if need pills. I take pills before, no problem.
DOCTOR: Pounding after eating or when stressed... okay. It could be related to a number of things. It's good you’ve taken pills before, that's helpful to know. Let's not jump to pills right away though. I want to get a better idea of what’s going on. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other… hmm. Sometimes I get… short of breath. When I walk up hill. Not always. Just…sometimes. I small man, you know? Not strong like young people. Is that what you mean? Symptoms? I tired sometimes, but I old. Old people tired. Is normal.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Short of breath when walking uphill, and fatigue. It is true that those things can happen with age, but we still need to rule out other causes. Okay. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmph. Doctor…many years ago…said something about…blood. High blood, I think. And maybe…stomach problems. But I no remember all the names. I take medicine for it then, now…no more. Too many pills. I stop. Wife say bad for liver. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in the past, and possibly some stomach issues. And you stopped taking medication for those conditions. It’s good you’re thinking about your liver, that's important. Let’s see if I can pull up those old records here... And, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… One. Long time ago. When I was young man, Korea War. Shrapnel. They take it out. That’s it. No other. I strong man, no break nothing. Don't need surgery. What year is this, anyway? Still August?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's still August 2nd, 2025. And good to know about the shrapnel removal. Now, thinking about your family... do you have any family history of heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family? Hmph. Mother…she die old. Very old. Maybe 90. No remember. Father…he work very hard. Farmer. Die young. Something about…heart. I think. But no one go to doctor much. We tough people. No complain. What is diabetes? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Diabetes is when your body has trouble controlling blood sugar. It can be serious if not managed properly. Okay. Now, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. Bad for lungs. Wife no like. Alcohol… sometimes. Small glass of soju with dinner. Sometimes. When very stress. Not every day. Maybe…two, three times a week. Is that bad? I eat a lot, though. I like food. That bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional soju with dinner, and you enjoy your food. That's good to know. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure again. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Quick, you say? Yes, yes, quick. I no have all day. Let’s get it over with. And don't poke too much. I sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowic. Just lie down on the table. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your blood pressure. Just breathe normally. I'm hearing a slight murmur. Not necessarily concerning, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is elevated: 160/95. That's higher than we'd like. And your pulse is a little fast. I also notice some slight swelling in your ankles. Alright. Based on what you've told me and what I'm hearing, it sounds like you may have a combination of high blood pressure and some fluid retention. I'd like to order some blood work and an EKG to get a better picture of what's going on with your heart and kidneys. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: EKG? Blood work? More poking and prodding? Hmph. I guess so. Just make it quick. And tell me what all this means. No fancy doctor words, okay? Simple. I old man. I no understand all that. And I want pill soon. Is that possible? Make heart stop jump-jump. That is important.
DOCTOR: Alright. The EKG is a quick, painless test that checks your heart’s electrical activity. The blood work will tell us about your kidneys, cholesterol, and other important things. And yes, we'll talk about medication once we have the results back. It’s possible we’ll need to start you on something to lower your blood pressure and help control your heart rate. But we need to see the results first. It's important to know exactly what we're dealing with. In the meantime, I want you to limit your salt intake and try to reduce stress as much as possible. And no more than one small glass of soju a week, okay?
