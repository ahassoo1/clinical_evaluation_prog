DOCTOR: Hi Erle, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, Doctor… Polczynski, is it? Honestly, I haven't much time for this. It’s… work. The university, you see. It's become… quite dreadful. Young people these days have no respect for knowledge. No respect at all. It's causing… a disturbance. A great disturbance. I suppose that’s what you’re here for.
DOCTOR: Right, a disturbance at the university. And this disturbance… is it causing you physical discomfort, Erle?
PATIENT: Physical discomfort? Well, not precisely. It’s… wearing. Quite wearing on the nerves, you understand. I find myself… agitated. Sleepless, at times. Though, one doesn’t need much sleep at my age, frankly. It's more a matter of principle. It shouldn’t be this way. The standards are… slipping. Do you follow? I doubt it. Young doctors… always so focused on the body. It's the mind, Doctor, the mind that’s important!
DOCTOR: I do follow, Erle. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of stress and perhaps some trouble sleeping. Let's try to get a better understanding of what's going on. Could you tell me a little more about the sleep issues?
PATIENT: Sleep issues? It’s not a problem, Doctor. It’s merely… reduced. I wake early. Thoughts intrude. Mostly about… the state of academia. The essays. The… dreadful lack of punctuation. Honestly, it’s appalling. And these new… digital resources! They encourage plagiarism, you know. It's a slippery slope. I used to sleep like a log, before all this. Do you need a list of my former students? I have a comprehensive catalogue...
DOCTOR: No, no list is necessary, Erle. Just trying to get a sense of how this is affecting you. When you do sleep, would you say it’s restful sleep?
PATIENT: Restful? Restful implies a certain… tranquility. Which is entirely absent these days. It’s… fitful. I toss and turn, re-evaluating grading rubrics, composing strongly worded emails to department heads. It's a constant process, you see. A perpetual battle against mediocrity. Honestly, the thought of retirement is… unsettling. Who will maintain the standards then?
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from the sleep and the stress, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, my appetite isn’t what it once was. Though that’s likely just age, Doctor. One doesn’t need much sustenance at my stage in life. And… my temper. It’s… shorter than usual. I find myself correcting people – students, colleagues, even the grocery store clerk – quite frequently. It’s simply a matter of maintaining standards, you understand. They appreciate it, eventually. Though they don't always show it. Is that what you mean by changes? Because honestly, I have no patience for frivolous questions.
DOCTOR: I understand. Reduced appetite and a shorter temper… those can be related to stress and lack of sleep, certainly. It sounds like you're carrying a lot on your shoulders. Have you experienced any weight loss recently, Erle?
PATIENT: Weight loss? A negligible amount, I assure you. I haven’t been weighing myself. It’s… undignified. One doesn’t concern oneself with such trivialities at my age. My clothes perhaps fit a little… looser. But that's hardly a cause for alarm. It's merely a natural consequence of… reduced activity. I spend most of my time grading papers, you understand. It’s hardly a physically demanding occupation. Honestly, I suspect these modern scales are inaccurate. They’re probably calibrated to accommodate… larger specimens. Now, are we getting anywhere with this? I have a faculty meeting this afternoon. A rather important one, concerning… the proper use of semicolons. It's quite urgent.
DOCTOR: Alright, Erle. To get a better picture of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, and blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really, Doctor? What possible relevance could that have? This is a matter of the mind, not the body! I haven't the slightest physical ailment. I'm perfectly… functional. Though, I suppose if it will hasten the process… Very well. But I assure you, you'll find nothing amiss. Perfectly sound. Though, I must warn you, I have a rather sensitive constitution. Be gentle, please. And don't expect any cheerful pronouncements. The world is a bleak place, and a stethoscope won’t change that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathing normally for me, please. Okay, and now I'm going to listen to your lungs. Everything sounds alright so far. Blood pressure is a little elevated - 140/90. And your pulse is 88, a bit on the higher side. Now, I'm just going to take your temperature.
PATIENT: 140/90? Elevated? Hardly surprising, Doctor. The sheer incompetence of my colleagues is enough to raise anyone’s blood pressure. And 88? That's merely… energetic. I have a great deal on my mind, you understand. A faculty meeting, the proper use of commas, the deplorable state of academic writing… it’s a constant whirlwind. Honestly, I doubt any instrument can accurately measure the weight of intellectual frustration. Now, are we nearing a conclusion? I really must be going. These young people… they simply won’t self-correct. It’s appalling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Erle. Your temperature is normal, and everything seems physically alright. However, your blood pressure and pulse are slightly elevated, which could be related to stress. From what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing a significant amount of stress and anxiety related to your work. I don't think there's anything physically wrong with you, but these feelings of stress and anxiety are definitely something we should address. I would recommend considering some strategies for managing stress, such as relaxation techniques or mindfulness exercises. I also think it might be beneficial to talk to a therapist or counselor. They can help you develop coping mechanisms and manage your anxiety in a healthy way. Would you be open to discussing those options?
PATIENT: Relaxation techniques? Mindfulness exercises? Honestly, Doctor, with all due respect, that sounds… utterly ridiculous. I’m a scholar, not a… a yogi. The solution isn’t to relax, it’s to correct. To instill proper standards! I simply need more time. More authority. More… intelligent students. Therapy? I assure you, Doctor, my mind is perfectly sound. I merely possess a heightened sense of… awareness. And an unwavering commitment to excellence. The problem isn't me. It's them. Frankly, I doubt anyone could offer me any assistance. I think I’ve wasted enough time on this… frivolous exercise. Thank you for your… concern. Now, if you’ll excuse me. I have a faculty meeting to attend. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Erle. I understand. However, if you do reconsider, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. I’m always here to help, even if it's just to listen. I'll write you a summary of our conversation and the findings from the physical exam. I also have some resources on stress management that I can provide. I wish you the best of luck with your faculty meeting. .
