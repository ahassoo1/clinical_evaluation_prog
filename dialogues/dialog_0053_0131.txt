DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sladen, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Pitmon. It’s S-L-A-V-E-N, actually. Mykeisha Sladen. And, well, it’s my blood pressure. It’s been a bit high lately, and my sister told me I really oughta get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Right, Sladen. Good of your sister to be concerned. “A bit high” is rather vague, though. Do you know what your numbers are, or is this just a general feeling?
PATIENT: No, I don't know the actual numbers, no. I got one of those machines at the pharmacy a few weeks back when I wasn't feeling well, and it said something was up, but honestly, I didn't really pay attention to what it said exactly. Just that it wasn’t green, you know? Like, it was red or something. That’s why I made the appointment. I figured it was best to get a doctor to actually look at it.
DOCTOR: Right. Pharmacy machines. Generally unreliable, to be frank. People self-diagnose all the time based on those things. Well, let's get a proper reading now. I’ll need to take your blood pressure, pulse, and a few other vitals. Have you been feeling any symptoms along with this… elevated pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. Not really anything major. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, maybe? And I get headaches sometimes, but I always get headaches, to be honest. They’re usually just stress, I think. Nothing different than normal, really. But I have been feeling kinda breathless when I walk up the stairs at work, now that you mention it. That’s… probably new.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness… alright. And how many stairs are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, not a lot. Just the twelve steps up to the office. It’s an old building, you know? But yeah, usually I’m fine. Lately, I gotta stop halfway up and catch my breath. It's a little embarrassing, honestly. And the work isn’t even that hard, just filing and answering phones. It shouldn’t be making me that winded.
DOCTOR: Right. Filing and phones. And you said headaches and fatigue are usual for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. I work a lot of hours, trying to save up, so I figure it’s just from being tired. I’m a home health aide, so I’m on my feet a lot, going between clients. It’s not always easy work, even if it doesn’t seem like much. I just thought the tiredness was normal. But the breathlessness… that’s what worried me enough to come in.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get some basic information down. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything before. I haven't really taken much medication in my life, to be honest. Just over-the-counter stuff for colds, occasionally. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, even those over-the-counter cold remedies?
PATIENT: No, not right now. I had a little cold last month, but that’s gone now. Just stopped taking the decongestant a few weeks ago. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And family history?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. She was on medication for it for years. And my grandfather… he had something with his heart, I think. But I don't really know the details. Nobody really talked about it much. It was just… something old people get, as far as I know. Does that help? I'm not very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: It's… something. Okay. Let's move on. Social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. Tried it once in college, didn’t like it. Makes me cough too much. I don't really drink much either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. I'm not much of a partier. I prefer a quiet night in.
DOCTOR: Alright. And exercise?
PATIENT: Well… I walk a lot at work, going between clients’ houses. But that’s not really exercise, is it? I don't really go to the gym or anything. I used to like to dance, but I haven't had time for that in ages. Just too busy working, to be honest. It's hard to find the energy, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let's get some actual measurements. I'm going to take your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your pulse. Then we'll see where we stand. Just relax, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I'll try to relax. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathe normally. Blood pressure is… 158 over 92. Elevated. Pulse is 88 and regular. Heart sounds are… normal S1 and S2. No murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though slightly labored breathing noted. Breathing is a bit fast and shallow. We need to investigate this further. I’m going to order some blood work and an EKG.
PATIENT: Oh. That doesn't sound good, does it? What does "investigate further" mean? And what’s an EKG? Is it something serious? I get kinda nervous when doctors start talking about tests and things.
DOCTOR: It means we need to rule out any underlying causes for your elevated blood pressure and shortness of breath. The EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a simple test that checks the electrical activity of your heart. It will tell us if there are any abnormalities. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it's prudent to investigate. We don’t want to ignore something that could become a problem down the line. I’ll also order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Those will give us a broader picture of your overall health. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… I think so. So, it’s just… checking everything? To see if something’s wrong? And the blood work… that’s just taking blood, right? I don’t like needles. But if you think it's important, I guess I can do it. How long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back again? I really hope it’s not anything too serious. I have a lot of work right now.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s just checking everything. And yes, the blood work involves a needle. I understand you’re not fond of them, but it’s a necessary step. The results usually take 24 to 48 hours. You will need to come back for a follow-up appointment once the results are in. We’ll discuss them then and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your stress levels as much as possible. And if your breathlessness worsens, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand those instructions?
PATIENT: Okay, yes. Reduce stress… and emergency room if it gets worse. I understand. I'll try my best to reduce stress, but it’s kinda hard when you're working all the time. Will I get a call when the results are ready? Or do I need to call you? And… where do I go for the blood work? Is it here, at the clinic? I don’t wanna go to the wrong place.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will receive a call when the results are ready. I’m printing out a lab requisition form for you now. It lists the tests needed and the address of the lab. It's located just across the street, at the medical center. Here. It has all the information you'll need. And please, try to get some rest. And do try to reduce your stress. It can significantly impact your blood pressure. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, thank you. Across the street… that’s good, it’s not too far. And rest… I’ll try. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the blood work? Like, should I fast? Or avoid anything? I don't wanna mess up the test. And… what if the results are bad? What happens then?
DOCTOR: Yes, you do need to fast for 12 hours prior to the blood work. No food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. As for what happens if the results are “bad,” we’ll discuss that when we have the results. We may need to consider medication, lifestyle changes, or further testing. It’s premature to speculate at this point. Honestly, Ms. Sladen, worrying about potential outcomes before we even have the data is counterproductive. Focus on fasting for the blood work and reducing your stress. That's all you can do right now. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Fast for twelve hours… and… no stressing. I guess I understand. No, I don’t think so. Thank you, Doctor Pitmon. I guess I’ll just… go across the street and get the blood work done. I appreciate you explaining everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Very well. Goodbye, Ms. Sladen.
