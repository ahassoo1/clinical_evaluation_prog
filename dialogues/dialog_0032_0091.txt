DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s hard to explain really. I just… I does be feeling so thirsty all the time. And hungry too. Even after I eat a good plate of food, I still feel like I need more. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so. It's just not normal for me, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling excessively thirsty and hungry, even after eating, is certainly something we should investigate. A month is a reasonable timeframe for noticing a pattern. Could you describe a typical day for me, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Well, I wake up around six, do a little housework, you know, sweep the floor, things like that. My husband, Bertram, he does the cooking. Breakfast is usually some bake and saltfish, or porridge sometimes. I work at the water pump station from eight until four. It's mostly checking the levels and making sure everything runnin' smooth. It's not too bad, but it get hot out there in the sun. Then I come home, Bertram cook dinner, we eat, watch a little television and go to bed. I drink water all day at work, always. More than usual lately, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a fairly active day, then, with exposure to the sun. And you've noticed an increase in your water intake. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the thirst and hunger, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. I does feel a little tired sometimes, more than usual. But I always thought that was just from the work. And… oh! I does have to go to the bathroom more often too, especially at night. It wake me up sometimes, you know? I thought it was just the water I drinkin’, but… now that you ask, maybe it more than that. I haven’t been sleepin’ as well either, always gettin’ up.
DOCTOR: Increased frequency of urination, particularly at night, and disrupted sleep… those are pertinent details, Ms. Zicarelli. Now, regarding the hunger – is it a constant feeling, or does it come in waves?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, I suppose. Not a pain, just… a hollow feeling. Like I need to eat something, anything. Sometimes it worse than others, especially after I work. Bertram does make good food, you know, but even a big plate of chicken and rice don't seem to fill me up like it used to. It’s just… different now. I don't know if that make sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Zicarelli. A persistent feeling of hunger despite adequate food intake is certainly concerning. Let’s move on to some broader questions. Do you have any past medical history – any illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, not much really. I had the flu bad when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, fallin’ out a mango tree. Bertram always tease me about that. Aside from that, I been pretty healthy, thankfully. I don’t take any regular medication either. Just the occasional painkiller if my back bother me after a long day at the pump.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant medical history, no regular medications… that’s helpful. And your family – are there any instances of diabetes, kidney problems, or other similar conditions in your parents, siblings, or children?
PATIENT: Oh, my mother… she had something the doctor said was “sugar” when she got older. She had to take pills for it and watch what she eat. My father, he was strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life. And I have two sisters, both healthy as far as I know. We don't see them often, but they never mentioned any troubles. Bertram’s mother… she had weak knees when she got old, but nothing like what I’m feelin’ now.
DOCTOR: A history of diabetes in your mother is relevant, Ms. Zicarelli. We will need to investigate that further. Now, I'd like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! I don’t smoke, never have. And I don't drink neither. Bertram might have a little rum on a Saturday night, but I don't touch it. And definitely not any of… those things. I'm a church goin’ woman, Doctor. I believe in keepin’ things clean and respectable.
DOCTOR: Very good. That’s helpful to know. Now, Ms. Zicarelli, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors, such as pollen or insect stings?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had any trouble with allergies. I might get a little itchy from mosquito bites sometimes, but that’s just normal for Trinidad, you know? Bertram’s allergic to dust, he sneeze all the time when he does the gardening, but I’m alright. I can eat anything, take most pills without any problem. Nothing bothers me, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s good to hear. Now, Ms. Zicarelli, I think it would be best to perform a brief physical examination and order some laboratory tests to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. If you think it’s best, go ahead. I just want to know what’s goin’ on with me. I don’t like feelin’ like this, always thirsty and tired. Whatever you need to do, I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll start with your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Please have a seat and I will begin.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Take your time, I'm not in a hurry. Just let me know if anything bother me.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 145 over 90. Slightly elevated. Pulse is 88, regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, if you’ll please take a deep breath… Heart sounds are regular, but I detect a slight murmur. I’ll need to listen more closely. Lungs are clear, but I note some mild diminished breath sounds at the bases. Abdomen is soft, with no tenderness to palpation. No masses or organomegaly detected.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Everything feelin' a little strange, but I suppose that's normal. My stomach does feel a little… bloated sometimes, but I thought it was just from the food Bertram cookin’. He loves to add a little extra coconut milk to everything, you know.
DOCTOR: I see. Bloating could contribute to that sensation. Tympanic to percussion throughout. Now, Ms. Zicarelli, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. No pitting edema noted. Alright, Ms. Zicarelli. That concludes the physical examination. Based on the physical findings and your reported symptoms, I would like to order some laboratory tests. We will need a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a fasting blood glucose level, and a urinalysis. These tests will help us assess your overall health, check your kidney function, and evaluate for diabetes. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, so many tests! What exactly will these tests tell you, Doctor? And will they be painful? I don't like needles much, you know. Will I have to fast for the blood sugar test? Bertram makes such a good breakfast…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Zicarelli. The tests are relatively straightforward and should not be overly uncomfortable. The blood draw will cause a brief sting, but it’s usually quite mild. As for the fasting blood glucose, yes, you will need to refrain from eating or drinking anything other than water for 8-12 hours before the test. We'll schedule it first thing in the morning. These tests will provide valuable information about your kidney function, blood sugar levels, and overall health. They will help us determine the cause of your symptoms—the increased thirst, hunger, and frequent urination—and rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes or kidney disease. The urinalysis will check for glucose and other abnormalities in your urine, which can also indicate diabetes. Do you have any other questions regarding the tests or the fasting requirement?
PATIENT: Well… eight to twelve hours is a long time! I suppose I can manage, if I have to. Bertram can make me a nice cup of tea in the morning, at least. But… what if something is wrong, Doctor? What if I have… that sugar thing my mother had? I don't want to end up having to take pills for the rest of my life. And I don't want to have to stop eating all the good food I like!
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be anxious about potential diagnoses, Ms. Zicarelli. However, it's important to remember that we don’t have any definitive answers yet. These tests are simply to gather information and assess your health status. If it is diabetes, it's often manageable with lifestyle modifications—diet and exercise—and, if necessary, medication. Many people live full and healthy lives with diabetes. We will discuss all available treatment options if a diagnosis is made, and I will work with you to develop a plan that fits your lifestyle and preferences. We are gathering information at this point, and jumping to conclusions will only cause unnecessary worry. Let's focus on completing the tests first, and then we can discuss the results and the best course of action. Do you have any questions regarding the logistics of the tests—where to go, when to schedule them, or how to prepare?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. You’re right. No use worryin’ before I know somethin’ for sure. As for the tests… where do I go? And do I need to make an appointment? And will Bertram be able to come with me? He does all the drivin’, you know. I don’t like goin’ anywhere by myself.
DOCTOR: You can have the blood work done at St. Jude’s Laboratory, which is just down the street on Elm Avenue. You do not need an appointment; it is a walk-in clinic. As for Bertram accompanying you, absolutely. He is more than welcome to come with you for support and assistance with transportation. Here is a requisition form for the blood work and a separate form for the urinalysis. Please take these to St. Jude's Laboratory, and they will handle everything from there. The results should be available in 2-3 business days. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. Do you have any questions about the location of the laboratory or the necessary paperwork?
PATIENT: Okay, St. Jude's Laboratory on Elm Avenue. I think I know where that is. Bertram will be glad to drive me. He always likes to come to the doctor with me, just in case I forget somethin’. He's a good man, Bertram. Thank you, Doctor, for explainin' everything so clearly. I feel a little better now, knowin' what to do.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Zicarelli. I'm glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or experience any concerning symptoms before your follow-up appointment. We’ll see you soon, then. Have a pleasant day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too.
