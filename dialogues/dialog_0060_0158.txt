DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s about a letter. A letter for… a pet, I think? Honestly, I don’t really remember all the details. It’s something about needing proof… something official-like. My daughter, she said I needed to come. She handles most of these things for me, you see. I just…show up.
DOCTOR: Right. A letter… for a pet. And your daughter brought you in. Okay. Let's try to piece this together. So, you don’t recall why you need something official?
PATIENT: No, not really. Something about where I live… and maybe renting? Is that it? It feels like a landlord thing. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It's probably something silly. She makes a big deal out of everything, that girl. Always paperwork, always rules. I just want the letter so she’ll leave me alone!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like this might be related to verifying your address for a pet registration or perhaps a rental agreement that requires pet ownership documentation. It's not silly, it's just…administrative. Let me access your EHR to see if there's anything here that might clarify things. Do you have any allergies or medications I should be aware of while I'm looking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… let me think. I don't think so. Maybe dust? But everyone’s allergic to dust, aren’t they? And medications… um… just what the doctor prescribes when I get a headache, you know? Nothing regular. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Honestly, I don't even remember what I took last time. My daughter keeps a list, but… well, you know. She’s the organized one.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies documented, and occasional headache medication as needed. That's…not terribly helpful. Let's see… According to this, you had a check-up about two years ago. Weight was noted as 77 kilograms, height 174 centimeters. Private insurance. Anything significant discussed at that visit?
PATIENT: Oh, that was with Doctor… someone else. He retired, didn't he? I think he asked about my knees. They bother me sometimes, especially when it’s cold. And my blood pressure… he said it was a little high, but nothing to worry about. I try to eat healthy, you know? Though I do enjoy a good stew. My mother’s recipe, it’s the best. But… no, I don't remember anything specific being wrong. Honestly, Doctor, I go to the doctor when my daughter tells me to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it appears we’re not getting much clarity from the record. So, let’s focus on now. Is this about a new pet, or have you had this pet for a while?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, a pet! It’s… a dog. A lovely little thing. She’s a rescue. My granddaughter picked her out. Very energetic. We’ve had her for… oh, maybe six months now? Seven? I lose track. She sheds everywhere, that’s for sure. But she’s sweet. That’s what matters. I think the letter is so we can… register her? For the neighborhood? Or something?
DOCTOR: Okay, a rescue dog, six to seven months. And the letter is likely for neighborhood pet registration. Some municipalities require proof of residency for pet licensing. Right. Well, I can certainly write a letter verifying your address. I’ll need to confirm some details first. You said your height is 174 centimeters and your weight is 77 kilograms?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. As far as I know. Though I’ve been eating a bit more stew lately… maybe a little more than 77 kilograms now. Don’t tell my daughter! She’s always on about my weight. It's rude, honestly. But yes, 174 and… around 77. It fluctuates. It's the stew! A very good stew, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to confirm for the letter, your current address is… . Is this still correct?
PATIENT: Oh yes, that’s right! Number… 14 Willow Creek Road. That's correct! A lovely little house, a bit drafty, but very cozy. Though the garden needs some work. My granddaughter tries to help, but she’s always on her phone. It’s a good place, though. Quiet. Except for the dog, of course. She barks at everything!
DOCTOR: Here you go, Ms. Wrye. This verifies your address as of today’s date. Hopefully, this will satisfy your daughter’s requirements. Is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Thank you, Doctor. I'm sure this will be perfect. No, I think that's all. Unless… do you have any good recommendations for dealing with a shedding dog? My furniture is covered in fur!
DOCTOR: There are specialized grooming brushes and frequent vacuuming, of course. But honestly, Ms. Wrye, some shedding is simply part of owning a dog. Perhaps limiting her access to upholstered furniture would be a start. Is there anything medical I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I suppose not. No, I don't think so. Just the shedding, really. Thank you again for the letter, Doctor. You've been very helpful. Though my daughter will probably find something else to complain about. She always does. .
