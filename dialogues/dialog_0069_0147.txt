DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump… a mass, I guess, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mass in your lower abdomen. That's certainly a good reason to come in. When you say “a little while,” can you give me a better idea of how long it’s been there?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably about six weeks, maybe a little more. It didn’t bother me at first, so I didn’t rush to come in. But it hasn’t gone away, and I thought it was better to be safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible of you. It's always best to get things checked out when you notice a change. Has the size of the lump changed at all since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Yes, actually, it has. It was quite small to begin with – I almost didn’t notice it. But over the last few weeks, it’s grown a little bit. Not dramatically, but enough that I’m aware of it now. It’s… firmer, too, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Firmness is good information. And are you experiencing any pain or discomfort associated with it?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s the strange thing. No pain, no discomfort… sometimes a little bit of pressure, maybe, but nothing I would call painful. It doesn’t affect my daily life at all. It’s just… there. And growing, which is why I wanted to get it looked at.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or discomfort, just a growing mass. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed any other changes, like changes in your bowel habits, any weight loss, or any fever or chills?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My bowel habits are completely normal, no change there. My weight is stable, I haven’t lost any weight. And no fever, no chills, nothing else at all, thankfully. It’s really just this lump.
DOCTOR: Alright. And to get a better picture, can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I'm generally quite healthy, thankfully. I've had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. No chronic conditions, no surgeries. I do have Medicare, as you probably saw in the paperwork. My wife and I are both pretty careful about our health. I haven’t been hospitalized since I was a child, honestly. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. No chronic conditions or surgeries is good to know. And you said you have Medicare, okay. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I eat everything, no food sensitivities. No reactions to any medications I’ve taken in the past, and I’ve had the usual vaccinations. My wife always double-checks before I take anything new, just to be safe, but we haven’t had any issues.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. And are you currently taking any medications at all, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I prefer to avoid taking medication unless absolutely necessary. Just try to eat well and stay active, you know? No vitamins, no supplements, nothing like that. Completely medication-free.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother had high blood pressure, but that’s the only significant thing I can think of. My father was healthy until late in life. No history of cancer that I’m aware of on either side of the family. No one’s had anything like this, a mass… nothing like that, thankfully. We aren’t very close to a lot of extended family, so it’s hard to know everything, but I don’t recall hearing about any major health concerns.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No significant family history of cancer. Alright, Amy, I'd like to perform a physical exam now, if that's alright with you. I’ll need to examine your abdomen, and I may also listen to your heart and lungs just to get a complete picture. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust your judgement, and I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Amy. Please lie down on the examination table. I'm going to start by palpating your abdomen, feeling for any abnormalities. I'll start gently and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, I do feel a mass in your lower abdomen, consistent with what you described. It’s about… 2-3 centimeters in diameter, firm, and doesn’t appear to be causing any tenderness. It's located… approximately here. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds normal, and your lungs are clear. No unusual sounds detected. Based on the physical exam, the mass is the primary concern. While it doesn’t appear to be causing any immediate distress, we need to investigate further to determine its nature. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds… reasonable. It doesn't hurt, so I’m glad it’s not causing immediate distress, as you said. What kind of investigation are you thinking about? What do we need to do next to figure out what it is? I’m a little anxious, I’ll admit, but I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Amy, and it's perfectly normal to feel that way. The next step would be to order some imaging studies. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis would give us a detailed view of the mass and the surrounding structures. That will help us determine its size, shape, and location, and whether it's likely to be benign or something more concerning. We may also want to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and some tumor markers, to further evaluate your overall health and look for any signs of cancer. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A CT scan and blood work seem like the logical next steps. I’m happy to proceed with whatever you recommend. I understand that it doesn’t necessarily mean anything bad, it’s just… figuring out what it is. When can we schedule those tests? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a bit of a busy schedule, so knowing the timeframe would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm glad you're comfortable with that plan. We can schedule the CT scan for tomorrow morning at the imaging center across the street. I’ll have my nurse send you the paperwork and instructions before you go. The blood work can be done here in the clinic before you leave today. The blood results should be back within 24-48 hours. The CT scan results typically take a little longer – usually 2-3 business days for the radiologist to provide a detailed report. I'll call you as soon as I have both sets of results, and we can discuss them and plan the next steps, which might include a consultation with a specialist if needed. Does that timeframe work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that works perfectly. Tomorrow morning for the scan, and blood work today. That sounds very manageable. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It eases my mind knowing what to expect. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Any special preparations for the scan?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I'm glad I could ease your mind a bit. For the CT scan, you’ll need to fast for at least four hours beforehand – that means no food or drinks, except for water. You can continue to take any regular medications you’re on, as long as they are taken with water. You may also be asked to drink a contrast dye before the scan to help improve the images. The imaging center will provide you with detailed instructions, but you can also ask my nurse if you have any questions. I'll write you a prescription for the blood work and my nurse will go over the costs with you. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Fast for four hours, drink water, and they'll explain the contrast dye. I’ll just follow those instructions. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I feel much better prepared now. Thank you again, Doctor. I think I’m ready to go get the blood work done, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Excellent. My nurse, Sarah, will be right in to draw your blood. She'll also go over the results timeline and answer any questions you may have. She’s very good, so don't hesitate to ask her anything. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Amy. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any new symptoms or have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I'll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I’ll see you soon, then. .
