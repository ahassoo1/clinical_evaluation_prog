DOCTOR: Right. Soila McConnon, 90 years young. Look, I'm a busy woman, so let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… hello, Doctor. Um… my tummy. It feels… big. And I don't want much food these days. Not like I used to. It’s just… not feeling right, you know? It's been a little while now. Maybe a few weeks? It’s hard to say, time goes so fast…
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. "Feels big," and not much appetite. Okay. And when you say "big," can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh dear… specific… hmm. Well, it’s… rounder. My clothes feel tighter. Not a lot, but… noticeable. And… it sometimes feels… full, even when I haven't eaten much. Like a balloon, maybe? Is that… helpful? I don't know these things, Doctor. I just know it's not how it used to be.
DOCTOR: A balloon, alright. And is this fullness… painful?
PATIENT: Painful… not really painful, no. More… uncomfortable. Like… pressure. When I lie down sometimes. And… it feels a little heavy. Like… something is weighing me down. It’s not a sharp pain, if that makes sense? Just… a dull feeling. It doesn't hurt to touch, though. I checked. Old habits, you know. Always checking.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No sharp pain, just pressure and fullness. Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your… bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh my… bowel habits? You mean… going to the bathroom? Well… it’s… not as regular. Sometimes I go, sometimes I don’t. It’s… different than before. I'm not sure how different, I don't really… pay attention to those things, you know? Old lady problems, probably. Is that what you’re asking about?
DOCTOR: "Old lady problems" isn't a diagnosis, Mrs. McConnon. We need details. Is it harder to go?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no, not harder… just… less often. And… sometimes it’s… smaller. Not big like it used to be. I used to go every day, like clockwork, but now… it's all mixed up. I am sorry, Doctor, I’m not very good at explaining. It’s just… it's been a while since I thought about it this much! My tummy is what’s bothering me, not… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, irregular bowel movements. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nausea… oh dear. I haven’t… thrown up. No. But… sometimes I feel a little… queasy. Especially in the mornings. It doesn’t last long, though. Just a funny feeling. Like… maybe I ate something bad? But I can’t remember what I ate! It’s been a few mornings, maybe? Not every morning, definitely not. I just… don’t feel as strong as I used to, you know? Everything feels… off.
DOCTOR: Okay. Queasiness in the mornings. Let’s move on. Any changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Oh, weight… I don’t really… weigh myself anymore. Used to, when I was younger. Now… I just wear my clothes. And they feel a little looser, maybe? Not a lot. I probably haven’t been eating enough, with my tummy being funny and all. It’s hard to say, though. I haven't stepped on a scale in ages. My daughter used to tell me I was too thin, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. No recent weight changes that you're aware of. Let me just quickly examine your abdomen. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Just a little help, if you would be so kind? My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, lie flat. I'm just going to listen and feel around. Try to relax. Normal bowel sounds… diminished, but present. Now, I’m going to palpate. Tell me if anything feels painful. Soft… some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen. No guarding or rebound tenderness. The abdomen is… distended. Not dramatically, but noticeable. I'm noting mild lower abdominal tenderness and distension.
PATIENT: Oh dear… distended? That sounds… bad. Is that serious, Doctor? It doesn't hurt, exactly, but… feeling it poked and prodded… it makes me nervous. My tummy feels full, just like I told you. And… it feels a little hard. Not all over, just… in the middle part. Is it my insides? What’s wrong with my insides?
DOCTOR: It's likely a combination of things, Mrs. McConnon. Your age, the changes in your bowel habits, the fullness… It could be something simple, like constipation, but with your symptoms, and given your age, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m ordering some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a liver function test – to get a better baseline. And I want a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis, just to get a clear picture of what’s going on inside. I’m also going to prescribe a stool softener to help with the constipation, if that is what this is. Don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Oh my… a CT scan? That sounds… scary. Will it hurt? And what if… what if something is wrong? I'm an old woman, Doctor. I don't know if I can… My daughter… she always said I worried too much. Is it something… serious? What kind of things are you looking for? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Mrs. McConnon, it’s a scan. It won’t hurt. It’s just pictures. And frankly, worrying won't help. It's standard procedure, given your age and symptoms. We need to rule things out. It could be something simple, but we need to know. Now, I’ll have the nurse give you the paperwork for the CT scan and the blood work. Try to focus on taking the stool softener, and we'll go from there. I have other patients waiting. The nurse will explain everything.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. The nurse… yes. I'll… I'll talk to the nurse. Thank you, Doctor… I think. .
