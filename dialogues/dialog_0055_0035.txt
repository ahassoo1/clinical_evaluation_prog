DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Dr. Eaddy. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Oh, goodness, it’s these hiccups! They just won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re… well, quite persistent, you know? It’s not painful, just… irritating. I thought maybe they’d go away on their own, but here I am.
DOCTOR: Persistent hiccups, you say. Hmm. And how long exactly has it been a couple of days?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started Tuesday, I believe. So, today being Saturday… that makes it four days now. Four days of hic! this nonsense. It's silly, really. A woman my age being bothered by hiccups! But they come on and off all day. I hadn't thought much of it at first, figured it was just something I ate, but… well, four days is a long time for hiccups, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, four days is rather prolonged for simple hiccups. And are they occurring constantly, or in bouts as you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely in bouts! They don’t happen all the time, thank goodness. Maybe an hour or so goes by where I’m fine, and then hic! they start up again. Usually, it’s a little cluster of them – three or four in a row – and then they quiet down for a bit. It’s very… unpredictable, you know? Makes it hard to do anything steady, like gardening or having a proper cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable bouts, you say. And have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: That’s a good question! Hmm… not really, not that I can tell. I’ve been trying to think about it. I haven’t been doing anything particularly strenuous. Eating doesn’t seem to make it worse, drinking water doesn't stop them, like it usually does… honestly, I’m at a loss! I had a lovely chat with Mrs. Patel yesterday, and they started up right in the middle of telling her a story… but I don’t imagine that was the cause, do you?
DOCTOR: Unlikely, Ms. Sucich. We’re looking for more… physiological causes. Now, besides the hiccups, have you experienced any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Oh, physiological, right! I always get those words mixed up. Let me see… no, nothing else, really. No pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness. My appetite’s normal, I’m sleeping alright… everything’s just… normal, except for these blasted hiccups! It’s just very… annoying, you know? I feel a bit silly even coming here about it. Is it something serious, do you think? I’m a fairly healthy woman for my age.
DOCTOR: Well, while persistent hiccups are rarely indicative of a serious underlying condition, it’s prudent to investigate nonetheless. We wouldn’t want anything… overlooked. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Oh, good, you don't think it's anything terrible! That's a relief. Let me see… medications. Just my blood pressure pills, really. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. I’ve been on those for years, Dr. Eaddy, since… oh, goodness, I don't even remember now. A long time! And that’s it. Just the one thing. Nothing else, promise. I'm usually very good about remembering what I take, though sometimes… well, you know how it is at my age.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to help my mother with her garden, and she grew all sorts of things – roses, herbs, everything! Never a sniffle, never a rash. I think I’d know if I had allergies, wouldn’t I? I’ve been around quite a bit in my life, too - lots of different plants, different foods… everything seems to agree with me, usually. Oh, except for mangoes. I can't stand mangoes. But that's a preference, not an allergy!
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Sucich, I’m going to perform a brief physical examination, just to rule out any obvious causes for your hiccups. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. Whatever you think is best. A quick look won’t bother me at all. I’ve had doctors poke and prod me for years! Do you need me to lie down? Or just sit here? Whatever's easiest. Just let me know, and I'll do it.
DOCTOR: No need to lie down, just remain seated, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll just palpate your abdomen. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly noted. Everything appears normal so far, Ms. Sucich. Have you had any recent changes in your diet, or any recent illnesses, such as a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all, really. My diet’s been pretty much the same for ages - lots of fish and vegetables, a bit of fruit. I try to eat healthy, you know? And I haven't been ill. No colds, no flu, no tummy troubles. I did visit my grandson in Honolulu last month, but I was very careful. Lots of handwashing, avoided crowded places… I didn't want to catch anything from those tourists! It’s been a bit dry lately, but that’s just the season, isn’t it? Nothing to do with hiccups, I imagine. I am starting to feel a bit silly being here about this.
DOCTOR: While it’s unlikely your visit to Honolulu is directly related, we must consider all possibilities. Sometimes, even seemingly minor things can trigger unexpected symptoms. Now, Ms. Sucich, given the persistence of your hiccups and the lack of any obvious cause, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. The X-ray will help rule out any underlying lung conditions, and the blood count will assess your overall health. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, an X-ray… goodness. That sounds… thorough! If you think it’s best, then yes, of course. I trust your judgment, Dr. Eaddy. It’s better to be safe than sorry, isn’t it? And a blood test… I don't mind those either. They always poke and prod a bit, but I can handle it. Just let me know when and where, and I'll get it done. I’m just hoping they can figure out what’s causing these blasted hiccups! It's really starting to get on my nerves.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will write the orders for the X-ray and blood count now. The receptionist will schedule the appointments for you before you leave. Once we have the results, we can determine the best course of action. In the meantime, try to avoid carbonated beverages and overly large meals. And if the hiccups worsen or are accompanied by any other symptoms, such as chest pain or shortness of breath, please return immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: No carbonated drinks… and no big meals. Alright, I can do that. I mostly drink water anyway. No, I don't think I have any questions at the moment, dear. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Hopefully, these tests will give us some answers. Thank you again, Dr. Eaddy. I'll let the receptionist know I'm ready to schedule the tests. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Sucich. You are welcome. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. .
