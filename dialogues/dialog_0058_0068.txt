DOCTOR: "Alright, Sasha Queener. Fifty-nine, French… hmm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, my leg. It’s been swelling up. After… after the cancer stuff. You know, the treatments. It’s not painful, exactly, just… big. And it feels heavy. I just want it to go down, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: "Right, 'after the cancer stuff'. We’ll get to that. So, it's just swelling, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Just the swelling. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Maybe a month? It comes and goes, but it’s… it’s more there than not now. It’s my right leg, below the knee. Is… is that important which leg it is? I don’t know much about these things.
DOCTOR: “Of course which leg is important. It always is. Alright. And you said it comes and goes… is anything making it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’ve noticed. I walk a little, I sit a lot. I try to keep it up, you know, but… not much changes it. Maybe… maybe when it’s very hot? But even then, it’s not that much worse. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to be able to wear my shoes again. They’re getting tight. Is it… is it dangerous? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: “Well, ‘cancer stuff’ and leg swelling… it’s a concern, naturally. We need to rule some things out. Have you had any shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever along with the swelling?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. And I haven't felt short of breath. No fever either. Just… the leg. It's silly, isn't it? All this fuss over a swollen leg after everything else. But it's… annoying. And it feels… heavy, like I said. I don't want it to get worse, that's all. I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: “Alright. Any history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Blood clots? Oh… I don't think so. Not that I know of. The doctors told me about some risks with… everything, but they didn't say anything about clots. I had a lot going on, you know? So many appointments… it's hard to remember everything. Is that something I should have been told about specifically? I'm sorry, I just… I forget things sometimes.
DOCTOR: “You really should be more diligent with remembering important medical information. It’s your health, after all. Okay, let’s do a quick exam. Can you sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Sorry. I try. It’s just… a lot. Yes, yes, the table. Just tell me what you need me to do, Doctor. And… is this going to take long? I have a little appointment later. Not important, but…
DOCTOR: "Alright. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll need to feel your leg. Please relax." “Breathing seems clear. Now, let’s take a look at the leg. Which side was it again?
PATIENT: The right leg. It’s the right one. You can feel it’s bigger than the other one, right? It’s… it’s quite a bit bigger. I’m not sure if you can see it easily, but it feels… hard. Not like a bruise, but… firm. I hope it’s not something serious.
DOCTOR: “Yes, there is some difference in circumference. Right leg measures 42 centimeters, left leg is 38. Skin temperature is normal. There's mild pitting edema present. And yes, it does feel firm. We'll need to consider a few possibilities.” "We'll draw some blood work to rule out DVT and check your kidney function. And I’m going to order a Doppler ultrasound of your right leg to check for clots."
PATIENT: Oh. A Doppler… and blood work. That sounds… complicated. Is that… is that going to hurt? And a DVT… that sounds scary. Is that what you think it is? A clot? I really don’t want another problem, Doctor. I’ve had enough problems. Will I know when the results are back?
DOCTOR: “The blood work is just a standard draw; a little pinch. The Doppler ultrasound is non-invasive; it uses sound waves. And no, I’m not saying it’s a clot. I’m saying we need to rule it out. It could be a number of things – fluid retention, lymphatic issues… but given your history, we have to be thorough. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours. The nurse will call you with the results. Try to elevate your leg in the meantime. And honestly, try to be more proactive about your health. It’s your responsibility.” "I'll write the orders now.”
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Elevate it. And be… proactive. I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor. Is there… anything else I should be doing? Or… anything I should be looking for? Like… if it gets worse? I just want to know what to expect. .
DOCTOR: “If you experience sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or the swelling gets significantly worse, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, follow the nurse’s instructions. I've documented everything. Next patient.” .
