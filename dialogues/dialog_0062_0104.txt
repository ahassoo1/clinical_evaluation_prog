DOCTOR: Hi Tammie, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… it’s my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a little while now. Not a good hurt, you understand? I need to be quick, if you don't mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Tammie. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. "A little while now"... can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Oh dear… it’s hard to say. A week? Maybe longer. It just… started hurting. Not a sharp pain, more of a… rough feeling. Like sandpaper, perhaps? I work with… machines. Big ones. It could be from the dust, I suppose. Though we try to keep it clean. It’s very inconvenient, this pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, a rough, sandpaper-like feeling for about a week or so. And you work with machines, so dust exposure is a possibility. Does anything make it feel better or worse?
PATIENT: Not really. Drinking water helps a little, I suppose. But it comes back quickly. And… loud noises make it worse. All the clanging and banging at the factory… it vibrates, you see? It’s a dreadful place, honestly. Not what a woman should be doing. Though, my husband… he always said… Never mind. It just hurts more with the noise. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so water provides temporary relief, but the pain is exacerbated by loud noises and vibrations at work. Hmm. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the throat pain?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? I don’t know what you mean. I just have a sore throat! I haven’t been… unwell, if that's what you're asking. No fever, no… sniffles. Just this persistent… irritation. Honestly, Doctor, I don't have time for a long list of questions. Is this getting me anywhere?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie, and I apologize if I’m taking too long. I just want to make sure I have a complete picture. No fever, no sniffles, just the throat irritation. Okay. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, or any changes to your voice?
PATIENT: Difficulty… swallowing? Well, it’s a little hard, yes. Like something is… stuck. Not always, but sometimes. And my voice… I don’t know. It sounds… normal, I think. My late husband always said I had a very clear voice. Though he’s gone now, so what does it matter? Look, are you going to do something about the pain, or just keep asking questions? It’s really quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry for your loss, Tammie. And you're right, let's focus on getting you some relief. Difficulty swallowing sometimes, and a rough feeling in your throat. Okay. I'd like to take a quick look at your throat, if that's alright. It will just take a moment. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I've never had allergies. Though I don't take many… medicines. My mother always said they were… unnatural. A quick look, you say? Very well. But be gentle, Doctor. And don't take too long. I have things to do. Important things.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle as possible. Just open wide for me, and say "Ah". Okay… I see some redness and a little bit of swelling in the back of your throat. It looks a bit irritated. I also notice some… small white spots on your tonsils. Do you feel any pain when I gently touch the sides of your throat?
PATIENT: It’s… uncomfortable. Very bright. And yes, it stings a little when you poke it. It feels… raw. Like a sunburn, perhaps? I told you it was bothersome. Is it something serious, Doctor? Because frankly, I haven't got time for a long illness. I have responsibilities. And I need to get back to work. They can't run the machines without me, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's painful to touch and feels raw, like a sunburn. It's good that you're telling me all of this, Tammie. Based on what you’ve told me and what I see, it could be strep throat, or another type of throat infection. The white spots on your tonsils are concerning, and we need to confirm what's going on. I'd like to do a quick strep test, it’s a simple swab of your throat. It will only take a few minutes to get the results. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Another test? Honestly, Doctor… must everything take so long? A swab? Is it going to be unpleasant? I haven’t got all day, you know. Fine. But be quick about it. And tell me, if it is this… strep throat, what does that mean? Will I be able to go back to work? I need to know. And what will I need to do?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie, and I promise I’ll be as quick as possible. It is a quick swab, it might be a little uncomfortable for a moment, but it won't take long. If it is strep throat, it means you have a bacterial infection. It's very contagious, so it's important to get it treated to protect others. It usually requires a course of antibiotics. We'd need to start you on those right away. You'll likely need to stay home from work for a few days, until you've been on antibiotics for at least 24 hours and you no longer have a fever. Let's get this done quickly, and we'll know what we're dealing with. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Contagious, you say? Honestly, the factory is full of germs already. One more won’t make a difference. Antibiotics… I don’t like the sound of those. But… fine. If it’s the only way to get back to work, then do it. But be quick, Doctor. And don’t poke too hard. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. It will take about five minutes for the results to appear. While we wait, do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? No. I was a perfectly healthy woman until this… irritation. My late husband… he always said I was as strong as an ox. No high blood pressure, no… diabetes. Just this… sore throat. And a very busy schedule. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t understand why everything takes so long. Five minutes? It feels like an eternity. I have things to do, you know. Important things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tammie, I’m afraid the test came back positive. You do have strep throat. I'm going to prescribe you a course of Amoxicillin, 500mg, three times a day for ten days. It’s important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before then, to make sure the infection is completely cleared. I also recommend getting plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids, and gargling with warm salt water several times a day to soothe your throat. Given that you're uninsured, I want to make sure you have access to affordable medication. I'm going to write the prescription with a note to the pharmacy requesting the lowest possible cost option. Do you have any allergies to penicillin?
PATIENT: Penicillin? No. I don't think so. My mother… she always used natural remedies. Never much for those… fancy medicines. But… if I get a rash, or something, what should I do? And this Amoxicillin… will it make me tired? I have things to do, you know. Important things. And ten days? That’s… a very long time. Will I be able to go back to work sooner than that?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No penicillin allergy. If you develop a rash, or any difficulty breathing, swelling of your face or throat, or any other unusual symptoms while taking the Amoxicillin, stop taking it immediately and go to the nearest emergency room. The Amoxicillin can sometimes cause mild side effects like nausea or diarrhea, but it shouldn't make you overly tired. As for going back to work, you need to be fever-free for at least 24 hours and on antibiotics for at least 24 hours before returning. It’s important to protect your coworkers. I understand you have responsibilities, but pushing yourself too soon could prolong the illness and spread it to others. Here are the instructions for the Amoxicillin, and this note will help the pharmacy find the most affordable option for you. I also want you to follow up with me if your symptoms don’t improve within a few days, or if they get worse. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… how long until the pharmacy is open? And will this… Amoxicillin… interfere with my other… obligations? Honestly, Doctor, you ask too many questions. Just… thank you. I suppose. I need to go. I have things to do. Important things. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tammie. The pharmacy down the street opens at 9am. And the Amoxicillin shouldn’t interfere with anything, but if you experience any unexpected side effects, don't hesitate to call my office. Get plenty of rest, and I hope you feel better soon. .
