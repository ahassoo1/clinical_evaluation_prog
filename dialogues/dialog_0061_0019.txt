DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Manuel! It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, hello Doctor. Yes, hello. My wife… she want… baby. We old now, you see. She think maybe… need help? I not so sure what help is. I make little things, with metal, plastic. Not babies.
DOCTOR: Okay, Manuel, I understand. Your wife is hoping to have a baby, and you’re wondering what options there might be. That’s perfectly alright to ask, and we can definitely talk through things. Just to be clear, is your wife currently pregnant, or are you hoping to become pregnant?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not yet. Not now. We… want to try for baby. She worry maybe too old. I worry too, a little. But we love each other very much. So… trying. Yes. Is that right? Trying.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. You're hoping to start a family, and you're both a little concerned about your age. That’s very common, Manuel. To help me understand the situation a little better, and to see what options might be suitable, could you tell me a bit about your wife's medical history?
PATIENT: Her medical… ah. She go to the doctor, sometimes. For… aches and pains. Old lady things, you know? I don’t remember the names of the doctors. Or what they say. She take pills for her water… for her blood. Something like that. I make her tea, mostly. And try to keep her comfortable. Is that help?
DOCTOR: That’s very kind of you, Manuel. Keeping her comfortable is a big help! Okay, so she sees a doctor for aches and pains, and takes medication for something with her blood or water… that's a good start. Do you know if she's ever had any major surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Surgery… hmm. I think… yes, a long time ago. Something with her… tummy? When she was young. But very long ago. Before me, even. She doesn't talk about it much. Serious… illnesses? Not that I know of. She gets a cold sometimes, like everyone. But nothing… bad. I hope. She is strong woman. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so surgery on her tummy a long time ago, and generally healthy aside from occasional colds. That’s helpful. And it’s good she’s a strong woman! Now, let's talk about you, Manuel. Do you have any medical conditions or take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Me? Not much. Old man things. My back aches sometimes, when I bend down to pick things up. I take a little pill for that, when it's bad. And… I forget things, you see? Like names. And dates. My wife says I’m getting senile! But I still make good models. Very good models. No other pills. No serious… troubles. I eat a lot of fish. Is that good?
DOCTOR: That is good, Manuel! Fish is very good for you. And it's perfectly normal to forget things as we get older - it doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. Okay, so you have some back pain and occasional forgetfulness, and otherwise healthy. Do you have any allergies to medications, or have you ever had a bad reaction to any drugs?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never. My wife always checks, before she gives me anything. She is very careful. I think I would remember if I was allergic! I get a little sleepy sometimes, after the back pill. But not… bad sleepy. Just… relaxed. Is that allergies? I don't think so.
DOCTOR: No, relaxed isn't usually an allergy, Manuel. That sounds like a normal side effect of the medication. Okay, this is all very helpful. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your wife’s menstrual cycle – if that's okay with you?
PATIENT: Men…strual? What is that? Is that… lady things? My wife talk about that sometimes. I don't understand much. Is it important? I just make the tea. And try to be helpful. But I don't know about… cycles. Is it like the weather?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Manuel. It is lady things, you’re right. It’s part of how women's bodies work. It’s the monthly cycle she goes through, and knowing a bit about it will help me understand if there are any challenges to starting a family. It's okay if you don't know the details, I'm just wondering if she still has her periods each month, or if they've stopped?
PATIENT: Hmm… stopped, I think. Yes, I think she said they stopped. A few years ago, maybe? She was… sad about it. Said it meant she was getting old. We don’t talk about it much. I make her tea, and try to cheer her up. Is that important? That they stopped? I don't know much about these things, Doctor. Really, I don’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful to know, Manuel. If her periods have stopped, it means she's likely gone through menopause. That does make getting pregnant a bit more challenging, but it's not impossible. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a general sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? You want to… look at me? Or my wife? She is at home, you see. She is better at these things. But… alright. If you need to look, you look. I don’t mind. But be gentle, please. My back is bad. And I’m an old man.
DOCTOR: I'll be very gentle, Manuel. I just want to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, and maybe feel your abdomen. It's a very quick exam, just to get a baseline. I won’t need to examine anything intimately, don't worry. First, let me check your blood pressure. Could you please take off your jacket and roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Alright. There. Is that good? My wife always tells me I have good circulation. She feels my feet, sometimes. Says they are warm. But I don't know much about… circulation. Just make it quick, please. My back is getting cold.
DOCTOR: Alright, this will just take a moment. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s a little elevated, Manuel, but not drastically so. It’s good we're checking it. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and another one… Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen feels soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. Everything seems normal here. Okay, that's all for the quick exam. Everything seems relatively normal, but the elevated blood pressure is something we should keep an eye on. Do you know if you’ve been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No. Never. Doctor never said anything about my blood… pressure. I just go for check-ups, sometimes. They poke and prod, and tell me I’m getting old. But they never say anything about my blood… pressure. Maybe I should make an appointment with my regular doctor. He is very young. But very… official.
DOCTOR: That’s a good idea, Manuel. It’s always best to follow up with your regular doctor about any concerns. And it’s good to have a young, official doctor. Okay, so, to summarize, your wife has stopped having periods, you've both been generally healthy, and your blood pressure is a little elevated. Given your wife's age and the fact that she's no longer menstruating, getting pregnant naturally would be very difficult. However, there are options we can explore, such as in vitro fertilization or using donor eggs. But these are complex procedures, and they come with risks and costs. What are your initial thoughts on that?
PATIENT: In…vi…tro? Donor…eggs? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. And expensive. My wife… she would want a baby of her own. Not… someone else’s egg. She always says she wants to feel the baby grow inside her. But… if it's not possible… I don't know. I'm just a model maker, Doctor. I don’t understand these things. Is there… another way? A simpler way? Maybe just… good luck? And more tea?
DOCTOR: I understand, Manuel. Those are very valid concerns, and it sounds like your wife has strong feelings about carrying a baby herself. And you're right, those procedures are complex and expensive. Let’s not think about those options just yet. “Good luck” and more tea is always a good start! Before we get into any procedures, I would recommend a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist – that’s a specialist in fertility. They can do some thorough testing to assess your wife's hormone levels and overall reproductive health. This will give us a clearer picture of what options might be viable, and what the chances of success might be. Would you be open to a referral?
PATIENT: A specialist… yes. That sounds… sensible. Someone who understands these things. Not just… poking and prodding. Testing… yes. That’s good. Knowing… is better than not knowing. So… a referral? You can arrange that? That would be very kind, Doctor. And maybe… a little less poking and prodding? Just testing. Yes. That sounds good. Very good.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Manuel. I can definitely arrange a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist for you. I’ll have my nurse prepare a referral slip and some information about a few specialists in the area. They can explain everything in detail and answer all of your questions. In the meantime, I would recommend continuing to live a healthy lifestyle – eat a balanced diet, get regular exercise, and manage any stress. And, of course, keep making those models! Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all. You have been very helpful. Very kind. Even with the… poking and prodding. Thank you for listening. And for the referral. I will talk to my wife. And maybe… we will make a decision. Together. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Manuel. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. And please give your wife my best. Take care, and I wish you both all the best. .
