DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Hmm… brings me in, you say? Well, it’s… paperwork, I believe. Something about needing to be certified again. It’s all rather tiresome, frankly. My understanding is it’s a routine check, though I can’t rightly recall the specifics. One gets so many forms these days.
DOCTOR: Paperwork, you say. Yes, well, unfortunately, some things are necessary, Mr. Oriley, even if inconvenient. It sounds like you are referring to a required health assessment. To clarify, is this for any specific purpose?
PATIENT: Specific purpose? Oh, good heavens. Let me think… I believe it has something to do with maintaining my… privileges. Yes, that’s it. To continue… practicing, one might say. It's all very bureaucratic, and I'm not a young man anymore to be jumping through hoops. Is that sufficient detail for you, Doctor? I assure you, I’m quite capable, despite what the forms might imply.
DOCTOR: Privileges. Right. So this is a recertification exam to maintain your professional standing. And you’re understandably frustrated with the process. While I appreciate your assurance of capabilities, Mr. Oriley, the assessment is standard protocol. It ensures everyone meets certain benchmarks. To begin, can you tell me about any current health concerns you have?
PATIENT: Concerns? At my age, one always has some concern, Doctor. But I assure you, nothing debilitating. My joints ache a bit, naturally. And my eyesight… well, it's not what it once was, is it? Though I manage. I suppose a bit of tinnitus as well, a ringing in the ears. But those are simply the marks of a life well-lived, wouldn’t you agree? Are we to make a medical event of every minor discomfort?
DOCTOR: Joint ache, tinnitus, and declining eyesight. I’ll make a note of those. When did you first notice the joint pain, and where specifically are you experiencing it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When? Years, Doctor. Years ago. It comes and goes, you know? A bit in the knees, mostly. And the hips, occasionally. It’s nothing… sudden. Just the typical wear and tear of… well, a long life, as I mentioned. I wouldn't have bothered mentioning it if you hadn't pressed me. Really. It’s hardly a pressing matter.
DOCTOR: Right. And the tinnitus?
PATIENT: The ringing… let me see. It’s… constant, now, I suppose. Always a low hum. It’s more noticeable when it’s quiet. I’ve gotten… accustomed to it, if that makes sense. It doesn’t bother me terribly, though it’s rather irritating when I’m trying to concentrate. I assume it’s just age. Everything goes with age, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Everything does not simply "go with age," Mr. Oriley. While some changes are expected, dismissing symptoms entirely isn’t prudent. Now, let's move on. Have you experienced any changes in your vision beyond what you’ve already mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Well, I suppose… things aren’t as sharp as they once were. Reading is… more difficult, naturally. And in dim light, I struggle a bit. Colors perhaps aren’t as vibrant. But really, Doctor, I’m not blind! I manage perfectly well. I still drive, you know. Though the young drivers these days… that’s a concern. Are they getting properly assessed?
DOCTOR: Driving is… relevant. And we will address that later, if necessary. For now, let’s focus on your health. Any changes in your hearing besides the tinnitus?
PATIENT: Changes in hearing? Well… people sometimes mumble, don’t they? Or speak too quietly. I occasionally ask them to repeat themselves. It’s probably just their fault, honestly. Not everyone has a clear speaking voice. It's hardly a dramatic decline in my auditory capabilities, Doctor. I assure you. I can still hear quite well enough for a man of my… experience.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. Please extend your arm. I’m going to take your blood pressure now. 148 over 82. Slightly elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is audible. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, please open your mouth… Ah-h. Throat appears normal. Reflexes are diminished, but within acceptable range for your age. Now, let's take a look at your ears…
PATIENT: Must you poke around so much, Doctor? It’s rather intrusive, you know. I trust everything is as it should be. I've never had trouble hearing, aside from the occasional mumbler, as I mentioned. It's probably just wax, if you must know. Everything accumulates with age, doesn’t it? Hurry along, please.
DOCTOR: There is some cerumen buildup, as you suspected. However, I also notice some inflammation in the ear canal. It could be contributing to your tinnitus and the difficulty hearing. Now, I'm going to check your range of motion in your joints. Please raise both arms above your head. Limited range of motion, especially in the shoulders. And there’s some discomfort when I ask you to rotate your wrists.
PATIENT: Limited? Well, I'm not a gymnast, Doctor. I’m a man of… certain years, as we’ve established. A bit of stiffness is to be expected. I wouldn’t call it “limited,” precisely. It's just... not as fluid as it once was. And discomfort? Naturally. Everything aches a bit. This is all rather unnecessary, wouldn’t you agree? I assure you, I’m perfectly capable of performing my… duties. Can we please get on with it?
DOCTOR: Right. Now, I'm going to perform a neurological assessment. I’ll need you to follow my finger with your eyes. And now, I’d like you to squeeze my hands firmly. Reflexes are diminished, as expected. Now, please stand up and walk a few steps. Slightly unsteady gait. A bit of shuffling. Mr. Oriley, based on this brief examination, I recommend a few further tests. We need to rule out any underlying issues contributing to your symptoms. Namely, a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an audiogram to assess your hearing loss more accurately. And, given your gait and unsteady balance, I'd also like to order an MRI of the brain.
PATIENT: MRI? Good heavens. Now you’re talking. This is all rather… excessive, don’t you think? A few aches and pains, a bit of tinnitus, and you want to scan my brain? I assure you, Doctor, I’m perfectly sound of mind. I’ve been practicing for decades. I have a reputation to uphold! A complete blood count, perhaps, I can understand. But an MRI? No, I don’t think so. I'm quite sure it's simply age, as we've repeatedly established. I’ll just get on with my life, thank you very much. I’m not going to subject myself to all that… fuss. I think I've wasted enough of your time. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, dismissing these potential issues is not advisable. These tests are not simply about confirming what we already suspect, it’s about ensuring your safety and well-being. An MRI can detect conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms and may require treatment. Ignoring these warning signs could have serious consequences. I understand your reluctance, but I strongly advise you to reconsider. This is my professional recommendation. I’m not going to disregard potential issues because you are reluctant to undergo testing. We can discuss your concerns about the MRI, and I can explain the procedure in detail. At the very least, I urge you to consider the blood work and the audiogram.
