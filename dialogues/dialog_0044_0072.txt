DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been… forgetting things. Just little things, mostly, but it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be concerned, Ms. Heidenthal. Memory issues can be unsettling. There's no shame in seeking help. “Little things” can sometimes be important clues. Can you tell me a bit more about these “little things”?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, like… I went to the grocery store yesterday, and I completely forgot what I went there for. I just stood there looking at the produce section for a good five minutes before I remembered I needed milk. And then, the name of that actress… you know, the one in all the comedies? It was right on the tip of my tongue, but I just couldn’t get it out. It’s not happening all the time, but it’s enough to make me feel… off.
DOCTOR: I understand. Forgetting a grocery item or a name occasionally is common, especially as we get busier. But the fact that it's concerning you is important. So, it sounds like these episodes are relatively new, and you're noticing a change from how you usually function?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It’s definitely new. I mean, I've always been a little forgetful – I misplace my keys sometimes, things like that. But this feels different. It’s… more frequent, and it’s like a blank space where the memory should be. It’s not just where I put something, it’s like I didn’t even do something. Does that make sense? I’m probably not explaining it very well.
DOCTOR: You're explaining it perfectly, Ms. Heidenthal. It sounds like you're very attuned to your own cognitive function, which is excellent. A difference from your usual baseline is always worth investigating. Now, let’s try to get a clearer picture. Besides the grocery store and the actress’s name, can you think of any other instances where you’ve experienced this kind of memory lapse recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! Last week, I was supposed to meet a friend for lunch. I wrote it down in my planner, but I completely forgot about it until she texted me asking where I was. I felt terrible. And… I think I had trouble remembering how to get to my sister’s house last month. I've driven there a million times, but I kept getting turned around. It was really frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, forgetting appointments and some difficulty with familiar routes… it seems like it’s impacting different areas of your memory. And you said this started within the last month or so?
PATIENT: Yes, roughly. Maybe six weeks? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, but definitely within the last couple of months. It wasn’t sudden, it was more like… gradual. It started with small things, like forgetting words, and then it started getting worse. It's just been building up, I guess. Is this… is this something serious, Doctor? I’m a little worried.
DOCTOR: It’s natural to be worried, Ms. Heidenthal, and I appreciate you sharing your concerns. There are many possible reasons for memory changes, and it's too early to jump to any conclusions. It could be something relatively benign, like stress or sleep deprivation, but it's also important to rule out other possibilities. To get a better understanding, I’d like to ask you a few more questions about your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to know. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I’m a little stressed at work lately, if that helps. Lots of deadlines. And I haven't been sleeping great, to be honest. I toss and turn a lot.
DOCTOR: That's good information, Ms. Heidenthal. Stress and lack of sleep can absolutely affect cognitive function. Let's explore that a bit further. Aside from work, are there any other sources of stress in your life?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Work is pretty much the main thing. I live alone, and I don't have a lot of family nearby. My sister lives a few states away, but we mostly just talk on the phone. I try to stay active, I go for walks when I can, and I read a lot. So, generally, I’m pretty content. It’s just… this work stress has been building up lately. And now this memory thing… it’s just a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay. That gives me a good picture. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had chickenpox as a kid, like everyone else. And I broke my arm when I was in high school, but that healed fine. Nothing major since then. I had the flu a couple of times, but nothing serious. I'm generally healthy, Doctor. I haven't been hospitalized for anything, and I don't have any chronic conditions. I do take a multivitamin every day, though. And I had my COVID vaccines and boosters, of course.
DOCTOR: Good to know. No significant medical history. And you mentioned a multivitamin – is that the only medication you take regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. Just the multivitamin. I don't take any prescription medications. I try to avoid them if I can. I prefer to handle things naturally, if possible. I don't have any allergies, either. No food allergies, no drug allergies… nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, just to be thorough, let’s quickly talk about your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – experienced memory problems, dementia, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother… she had some trouble with her memory in her later years, but it was just… old age, I think. She got a little confused sometimes, but it wasn’t anything drastic. My father was perfectly sharp until the very end. And as far as I know, no one else in the family has had any serious memory problems. It wasn’t really something we talked about much, to be honest. It’s just… not a topic that came up. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Heidenthal. It's common for these things not to be discussed openly. So, mother had some age-related memory decline, but no one with early-onset dementia or other neurological issues. Okay. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical and neurological exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will just involve some simple tests of your balance, coordination, reflexes, and memory. It will help me get a better sense of what might be going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get to the bottom of this. I’m a little nervous, but… let’s do it. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Great. No need to be nervous. It's very straightforward. First, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse, then listen to your heart and lungs. After that, we’ll do a few simple tests. I'll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, touch your nose with your finger, and walk a few steps. And then I’ll ask you a few questions to assess your memory and cognitive function. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. Would you mind standing up for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Standing up now. I hope I don’t mess up the finger thing! I’m always a little clumsy.
DOCTOR: Don't worry about it at all, Ms. Heidenthal. It's not a test of dexterity, just a way to assess your eye movements. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 128 over 76. Good. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Okay. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is that right? I’m trying to keep my head still. It’s a little hard.
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Ms. Heidenthal. You're doing great. Your eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Now, can you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger with your index finger?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Like this? Is that right? It feels a little silly, but I’m doing it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Very good coordination. Now, let's check your balance. Can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Okay. This is a little wobbly. I’m trying not to fall. I’m not very good at balancing.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s okay to be a little wobbly. Just try to stand as still as you can for about 30 seconds. Okay, you can open your eyes now. Very good. Now, let’s do a quick cognitive assessment. I'm going to ask you a few questions to check your memory and recall. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… um… it’s August… the 2nd. August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I think so. It’s easy to lose track of the days.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Good. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s easy. We’re in… …Suburban. Yes, Suburban. It’s a pretty nice town. I’ve lived here for a few years now.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to give you three words to remember. Try your best to recall them after I ask you a few more questions. The words are: apple, table, penny. Apple, table, penny. Now, can you repeat those words back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… and… um… …penny! Yes, apple, table, penny. I think. It’s hard to hold three things in my head at once.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Ms. Heidenthal. You remembered all three words. It just takes a little concentration. Okay, I think that’s enough for the physical and neurological exam. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on my findings, your reflexes and coordination are normal. Your eye movements are smooth, and your balance is within normal limits. The cognitive assessment was also within normal limits, although you did exhibit some slight effort with recall. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 levels. We should also check your vitamin D levels. And I'd like to order an MRI of your brain, just to rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Yes, that sounds alright. Blood work and an MRI… I guess that’s what I need to figure out what’s going on. Is the MRI… scary? I’ve never had one before. And how long will it take to get the results? I’m a little anxious about all this, to be honest. It’s just… I don’t like not knowing.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Heidenthal. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. An MRI is not scary, although it can be a bit loud. You'll lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it will take about 30-40 minutes. You'll need to remain very still during the scan, and we'll provide you with headphones to help block out the noise. You won't feel anything during the scan. As for the blood work, the results usually take about 3-5 business days. Once we have the results, we'll schedule another appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying to reduce your stress levels. Things like regular exercise, meditation, and getting enough sleep can make a big difference. We can also discuss some strategies to improve your memory and recall. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. Reducing stress… I can definitely try to do that. And I’ll try to get more sleep. 3-5 days for the blood work, then another appointment… I can wait. Yes, that sounds good. So, what do I need to do now? Do I need to schedule the MRI? And where should I go for the blood work?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, let's schedule the MRI first. I'll have my assistant, Sarah, give you a call later today with a few available times and locations. There are a couple of imaging centers nearby. For the blood work, you can go to Quest Diagnostics, which is located at 123 Main Street. You don’t need an appointment, but it’s a good idea to bring your insurance card and a photo ID. Sarah will also provide you with a lab requisition form, which you'll need to give to the phlebotomist. While we're waiting for the results, if you notice any sudden changes in your memory or experience any other concerning symptoms, such as headaches, weakness, or vision changes, please contact me immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Sarah will call with MRI times, I go to Quest Diagnostics with my insurance card and a form, and I contact you if anything changes. Okay, I think I’ve got it. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything. I feel a little better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this. I’m still anxious, but… less anxious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I'm glad I could help. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious, and I want to assure you that we’ll work through this together. My goal is to get to the bottom of this and find the best possible solution for you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I’ll see you back in the office once the results are available. Have a good day, and try to relax as much as possible.
