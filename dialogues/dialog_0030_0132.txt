DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Coby’s the name. Honestly? This heat. It's getting ridiculous. Never been this bad, and I've lived a long time, let me tell you. I just… can't handle it like I used to. Feel like I’m melting just walking to the car.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Coby. This summer has been exceptionally hot, and it’s affecting many people. It’s good you came in to discuss it. When you say you “can’t handle it like you used to,” can you describe what you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Well, it's not just sweating more, though I am. It's… everything feels hotter. Like the sun's rays are stronger, even in the shade. And I get dizzy, real quick. Not falling-down dizzy, but… lightheaded. And tired. Just… drained. It’s messing with my work, you know? Can't be painting roofs when I feel like this. A man's gotta work.
DOCTOR: I see. So, increased sensitivity to the heat, dizziness, and fatigue. And it’s impacting your ability to work, specifically with outdoor labor. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, it didn’t happen overnight. Started last summer, a bit. Thought it was just a bad year, you know? But this year… it's worse. Definitely worse. Maybe… six, seven months now it's been steadily getting… unpleasant. And it's not like I'm doing anything different. Same work, same hours, same everything. I'm a practical man, Doctor. Things don’t just change for no reason.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know, Mr. Coby. It sounds like this has been a gradual onset, and it’s progressively worsening. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the dizziness, fatigue and heat sensitivity?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not much, really. Maybe a bit thirsty more often. But I always drink water. Gotta stay hydrated, you know? And… sometimes my hands swell up a little after a long day. Not bad, just… puffy. Nothing like my brother used to get, he had real problems with his hands. This is just… a bit of swelling. Like they've been holding onto water. Not a big deal, really. Don't want to bother you with every little thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst and some hand swelling after work. It’s good you’re staying hydrated. And it’s important to mention anything you’re experiencing, even if you don't think it’s significant. It helps me get a complete picture. Now, have you had any changes in your urination – frequency, color, or difficulty?
PATIENT: Urination? What do you mean? I go when I need to go. Same as always. Maybe… it’s a bit lighter in color, now that you mention it. But I drink a lot of water, like I said. Probably just that. I don’t go straining or anything, and I don’t have to get up in the middle of the night, not like some of the old fellas I work with. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a pretty simple man. Don't go making a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so straightforward, Mr. Coby. It’s good to know what you aren’t experiencing as well. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. That’s perfectly normal. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you need to do. Get it over with, then. I got work to do, you know. Though, I'll say this, I’m a healthy man. Always been active. Don't coddle me, Doctor. Just tell me what's wrong and how to fix it. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Coby. I'll be as efficient as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Pulse is 88 and regular. Temperature is normal at 98.6. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. I notice a little bit of swelling in your hands, and there’s some mild pitting edema when I press on them. Finally, I’ll check your skin for any signs of dehydration. Skin turgor seems good, but your skin does feel a little warm and dry. Now, let me take a look at your medical history on the computer…
PATIENT: Medicare’s all I got, Doc. Haven't had much cause to see a doctor in years, thankfully. I mostly just try to keep myself going. I eat alright, mostly rice and lentils, some vegetables when I can get them. No fancy foods. And I don't drink much, maybe a beer with the boys sometimes. No smoking, never touched the stuff. Family history… well, my mother lived to be eighty-five, but she had a bad heart. My brother, like I said, had problems with his hands, swelling and all. He ended up having to retire early. That’s about it, really. A simple life.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Coby. That’s helpful. So, no known allergies or medications, you eat a fairly healthy diet, and a family history of heart disease and hand swelling. Given your symptoms – increased sensitivity to heat, dizziness, fatigue, thirst, hand swelling – along with your slightly elevated blood pressure and family history, I’m considering a few possibilities. It could be related to dehydration, but the persistent symptoms, along with the hand swelling and elevated blood pressure, suggest we need to investigate further. I’m concerned about potential early signs of kidney issues or, less likely, early-stage heart failure. We need to rule out those more serious conditions.
PATIENT: Kidney issues? Heart failure? Now hold on a minute, Doctor. That sounds serious. I feel… tired, yes. And a bit warm. But I'm not sick. I'm a working man! I can’t be having kidney problems or… whatever that other thing was. You're sure you're not overreacting? Maybe it's just the heat, like I said. It's been a brutal summer. I don't want a bunch of tests if it's just… a bit of heat exhaustion. I got bills to pay, you know? Tests cost money.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely, Mr. Coby, and I wouldn’t recommend anything unnecessarily. You’re right to question it. However, given your symptoms and family history, it’s important to be thorough. We’re not jumping to conclusions, but we need to rule out anything serious. The tests I’m recommending are fairly standard. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel – which checks your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar – and an EKG to check your heart rhythm. A urinalysis to check your kidneys. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. We can start with those. If everything comes back normal, then we can revisit the possibility of it being simply heat-related. But we need that information first. Do you have any questions about those tests?
PATIENT: Tests, huh? Always tests. Fine, fine. Do what you gotta do. But I’m telling you, Doctor, it’s probably just the heat. And don't go scaring me with talk of heart failure. I need to know… how much are these tests gonna cost? And where do I go to get them done? I don’t have fancy insurance, just Medicare. Will they cover it? I need to know these things before I agree to anything. A man's gotta plan.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Coby, you're right to ask. Let me give you a breakdown. The complete blood count, metabolic panel, EKG and urinalysis typically cost around $300-$400 total. However, with Medicare, your out-of-pocket cost should be significantly lower, around $80-$120, depending on your deductible and co-insurance. I can have our billing department call you with a more precise estimate before you go. You can get these tests done at the lab right across the street, at City Labs. I’ll give you a requisition form. They accept Medicare and will bill them directly. The form will have detailed instructions. It usually takes about 30 minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Eighty to a hundred dollars… I can manage that, I suppose. City Labs, you say? Across the street. Alright. That’s… reasonable. And you'll call me when the results are back? Don’t make me wait too long. I got work to do, you know. Give me the form then, and let’s get this over with. Hopefully it’s just the heat. I’m telling you, Doctor, it's been a brutal summer. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Coby. I’ll make sure our staff prioritizes getting your results to me as quickly as possible, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they’re available. Here’s the form, and the number for City Labs is printed on the top. If you have any trouble scheduling, don’t hesitate to call our office. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, avoid strenuous activity during the hottest part of the day, and please don’t hesitate to call if your symptoms worsen. I wish you the best and hope it is something easily treatable.
