DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure, I assure you. One doesn't often find such… well, presentable physicians these days. I’m here regarding this… medical marijuana. My daughter has been quite insistent I look into it for my… discomfort. Though, frankly, I still think it's a bit much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re exploring all options. And it’s perfectly alright to have reservations. We can certainly discuss medical marijuana, and whether it might be appropriate for you. Just to clarify, when you say “discomfort,” could you tell me a little more about what you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it’s a little embarrassing to discuss. It’s just… getting old. Everything aches, mostly in my joints. My knees, especially. And my back. It’s not debilitating, mind you. I can still manage. I simply… feel it constantly. It’s terribly inconvenient, really. Makes gardening rather unpleasant, and I do enjoy my roses.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. Joint pain is very common as we get older, and it certainly shouldn’t be dismissed as just “getting old.” It sounds like you’re dealing with quite a bit of discomfort, and it’s affecting things you enjoy. Can you tell me how long you’ve been experiencing this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been… years, really. Perhaps five or six? It came on gradually, I suppose. At first, it was just a little stiffness after a long day. Now… well, now it's pretty much every day. I tried some over-the-counter remedies, of course. Ibuprofen, things like that. They help a little, but not nearly enough. And frankly, I don’t want to be relying on pills constantly. My sister had a terrible reaction to some arthritis medication, you see. I’m very cautious about such things.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise to be cautious, Ellan. It’s good you’re thinking about the potential risks. So, five or six years of gradually worsening joint pain, mostly in the knees and back, with some relief from over-the-counter pain relievers, but not enough. Do you notice any times of day when the pain is worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s definitely worse in the mornings. Getting out of bed is… a process. And after I’ve been sitting for a while. A long car ride, for example. Or an evening of watching television. Though, to be honest, every time is a bit uncomfortable these days. Perhaps the mornings are just the most… egregious. And damp weather, certainly. The humidity just makes everything ache. It’s dreadfully inconvenient when it rains.
DOCTOR: Alright, so worse in the mornings, after periods of inactivity, and with damp weather. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in your joints, particularly your knees?
PATIENT: Redness? Oh, no, Doctor. I assure you, I maintain a very rigorous skincare routine. Absolutely no redness. Swelling… sometimes, perhaps a little. Not significant. It’s not as if my knees are puffed up like balloons, mind you. Just… a little thicker than usual. I can still wear my shoes, perfectly comfortably. It’s hardly noticeable, really. Unless one is looking for it, of course.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. So, minimal swelling, not redness. Now, have you ever had any injuries to your knees or back?
PATIENT: Injuries? Goodness, no. I was a very careful child. And I’ve always been quite sensible in my activities. A few minor sprains, perhaps, when I was younger, playing tennis. But nothing serious. Certainly nothing that would explain this… chronic discomfort. My husband always said I was too cautious for my own good. He preferred a woman with a little more… spirit. But no, no major injuries.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major injuries. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your overall health, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as arthritis, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. Do I look like a woman with heart disease? I assure you, I take excellent care of myself. I eat a balanced diet – mostly. And I walk every day, when the weather permits. No, I haven’t been diagnosed with anything… serious. My blood pressure is a little high, perhaps. But the doctor says it's nothing to worry about… yet. And my sister has diabetes, but I’ve been very careful to avoid sugar. I do occasionally indulge in a small glass of sherry with dinner, but honestly, it's medicinal.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Ellan. It's good to hear you're proactive about your health and diet. And a small glass of sherry for medicinal purposes is perfectly acceptable. So, slightly elevated blood pressure, but otherwise generally healthy. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or any other condition?
PATIENT: Oh, just a small pill for the blood pressure. A very small one. It doesn’t seem to do much, frankly. My husband insisted I take it, but I suspect it’s mostly for his peace of mind. He was always rather anxious. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it. But that’s it. Nothing… substantial. I prefer to rely on natural remedies whenever possible. Though, clearly, they’re not quite sufficient in this case. Which is why I’m here, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright, so a small pill for blood pressure, and a vitamin D supplement. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I’ll just check your range of motion in your knees and back, and feel for any swelling or tenderness. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I suppose. Though I do dislike being… prodded and poked. I’ve always been rather sensitive. But if you insist it’s necessary… very well. But please be gentle, Doctor. And do explain what you’re doing as you go along. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ellan. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and I’ll explain everything as I go along. First, let’s just have you lie down on your back on the examination table. Okay. Now, I’m going to gently bend your knees one at a time. Just let me know if you feel any pain, and stop me if it’s too uncomfortable. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh! That's… not entirely pleasant. A little stiff. And a slight twinge. It’s not sharp pain, mind you. More of a… protest. It feels as if it needs… oiling, perhaps. It’s been a long winter, you see. And I haven’t been as active as usual. Please be careful, Doctor. I don’t want to exacerbate anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. A little stiffness and a twinge. No sharp pain. Now, let’s try the other knee. How about this one?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That one is… considerably worse. A definite twinge. And a little… creaking, perhaps. It sounds like an old door, honestly. It’s not excruciating, but it’s… unsettling. Perhaps I should have warned you. It’s always been the weaker knee. My husband used to say I favored it when we danced. Please be quick, Doctor. This isn’t particularly enjoyable.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. More discomfort in the left knee, with some creaking. Now, let's check your range of motion in your back. Can you gently reach forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness no, I can't possibly reach my toes. Not anymore. I haven’t been able to for years. It’s… restrictive. And it makes my lower back ache. It feels as if something is… stuck. Oh dear, that’s enough. Really, Doctor, I think that’s quite enough poking and prodding. I’m feeling rather… fragile now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan, I completely understand. I apologize if that caused you any discomfort. I can certainly stop there. Based on what you’ve told me and the limited examination we were able to do, it sounds like you’re experiencing pain and stiffness in both knees, with more discomfort in the left knee, and some restriction in your lower back. There doesn't appear to be any visible swelling or redness. Let me quickly review your records… I see here you have a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, for which you take a small daily medication. Now, based on your symptoms and the physical exam, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing your pain without further testing, such as X-rays to rule out arthritis. However, it’s likely you're experiencing age-related joint changes, possibly osteoarthritis, and some muscle stiffness in your back. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Osteoarthritis? Goodness. That sounds… dreadful. My sister had that, you know. She ended up needing a hip replacement. Is that what I’m in for? And what does that have to do with… medical marijuana? I thought that was supposed to help. Are you saying it won't? I’m not eager to undergo any… replacements, Doctor. Not at my age.
DOCTOR: Please don’t worry, Ellan. A diagnosis of osteoarthritis doesn’t automatically mean you’ll need a hip replacement. Many people manage their symptoms effectively with conservative treatments, such as physical therapy, pain relievers, and lifestyle modifications. As for medical marijuana, it can be helpful for managing chronic pain, including joint pain. It works by interacting with the body’s endocannabinoid system, which can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain. However, it’s not a cure, and it doesn’t work for everyone. Given your symptoms and medical history, it might be worth considering. We would need to discuss the potential risks and benefits, and ensure it doesn’t interact with your blood pressure medication. Before we proceed, I’d like to order some X-rays of your knees and lower back to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-rays? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure I want to endure any more discomfort. But… if it’s necessary to rule out a hip replacement, I suppose I can manage. Though I do wish there was a less… invasive way. And what about the medical marijuana? If I do agree to this… certification, what would that entail? Would I have to… smoke it? Because I absolutely refuse to smoke. My husband always said it was dreadful for the lungs. I heard you can take it in oil form, perhaps? Is that an option? I do prefer to explore all possibilities, of course. But I need to know what I’m getting into, Doctor. Completely.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those questions, Ellan. It's important to be fully informed. Yes, the X-rays will involve some positioning, but they are relatively quick and painless. They will help us determine the extent of any joint damage or arthritis. As for the medical marijuana, you are absolutely correct. Smoking is not the only way to take it. It’s available in various forms, including oils, capsules, edibles, and topical creams. The oil form, taken sublingually – under the tongue – is a very common and discreet method. It doesn’t have the same effects as smoking, and it’s often well-tolerated. If you decide to pursue certification, we'll need to complete an application form, which I can help you with. Then, a qualified physician will review your records and determine if you meet the criteria. If approved, you’ll receive a certification card, allowing you to purchase medical marijuana from a licensed dispensary. Before we go further, would you like me to schedule those X-rays for you?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Schedule the X-rays, I suppose. Though I still think it’s rather excessive. But if it’s necessary to rule out a hip replacement… And perhaps… perhaps you could send me some information about this medical marijuana? The oils, specifically. I'd like to read up on it before making any decisions. What are the potential side effects? And does it interact with my blood pressure medication? I need to know everything. Completely. You've been very patient with my… inquiries, Doctor. I appreciate that. I simply prefer to be thoroughly informed before embarking on any new treatments.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. I completely understand. I’m happy to provide you with all the information you need. I'll have my nurse print out some brochures on medical marijuana, specifically focusing on the oil form, its potential side effects, and interactions with medications, including your blood pressure medication. I'm scheduling the X-rays for you now. They're available on Thursday morning at 9:00 AM at the imaging center down the street. They'll need a referral from me, which I'll send over electronically. We'll review the X-ray results together when they come back, and then we can discuss your options in more detail. In the meantime, feel free to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all for now. Thank you for your patience and your thorough explanations. It's a relief to finally have a plan, even if it involves… poking and prodding. I shall see you on Thursday, then. And thank you again for the information about the marijuana. I shall read it thoroughly. Good day, Doctor Annesley.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ellan. It was a pleasure meeting you. I look forward to seeing you on Thursday. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. Have a good day, and travel safely.
