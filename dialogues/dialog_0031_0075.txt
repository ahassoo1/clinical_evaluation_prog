DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s about being awfully tired during the day, even though I am being treated for sleep apnea. I use the machine every night, you see, but it doesn’t seem to be enough these days. It’s just… exhausting.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Paske. It’s certainly concerning when treatment isn’t providing the relief it should. It's good you're already being treated for sleep apnea; that’s an important first step. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Well, it’s not like I fall asleep standing up, thankfully. But I find myself really dragging by mid-afternoon, almost every day. Even after a full night – or what should be a full night – with the machine on. It’s affecting things, you know? I used to enjoy my garden, but even that feels like too much sometimes. And I used to give lectures at the community college… I’ve had to cut back on those. It’s just… frustrating. It feels like I’m always in a fog.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s a persistent fatigue, even with consistent CPAP use, and it’s impacting your daily activities – your gardening, your lectures – and leaving you feeling generally foggy. That is definitely something we need to investigate. Let’s start with the CPAP machine itself. Do you know what pressure setting it’s on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now, that’s a good question. I think it’s 12, but honestly, I leave that to the technicians. They adjust it whenever I go in for my check-ups. It’s been a while since I really looked at the settings myself. I go to SleepEasy Medical, down on Elm Street, for my supplies and adjustments. They’re very good, but… well, I don’t always remember the specifics. Is it important I know the exact number?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Mr. Paske, as sometimes a change in pressure can be all that’s needed. But don’t worry about recalling it perfectly right now. We can likely obtain that information from SleepEasy Medical directly with your permission. Before we do that, let’s talk a bit more about the tiredness itself. When did you first start noticing this increased fatigue, despite using the CPAP machine?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It wasn’t sudden, you understand. It sort of crept up on me. But I’d say… maybe three, four months ago? It started with just feeling a little more sluggish than usual. I chalked it up to getting older, honestly. But it’s been getting worse steadily since then. I started noticing I was having trouble concentrating during my lectures, and that’s when I really started to worry. I need to be sharp for those, you know? It’s not fair to the students if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: I understand. A gradual onset over three to four months is important information. And it's very astute of you to recognize the impact on your lectures—that tells me this isn't just a matter of mild tiredness. Now, apart from the fatigue and difficulty concentrating, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I’ve been a bit more irritable lately, I suppose. My daughter keeps telling me I’m grumpy. And, now that you mention it, my memory hasn’t been what it used to be. But at my age… who remembers what they had for breakfast? It's hard to say if that’s new, or just getting old. I also wake up with a bit of a headache sometimes, though not every day. And I've been a little thirstier than usual, I think. Does that make any sense? I'm probably rambling now…
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Paske. That’s all very helpful information. Irritability, worsening memory, headaches, and increased thirst – these are all potentially relevant. Given your history of sleep apnea, the persistent fatigue despite CPAP use, and these other symptoms, I’d like to ask you a few more questions to get a more complete picture. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, but that hasn’t been a problem. And I have some mild arthritis in my knees, which flares up sometimes. I take ibuprofen for that when it gets bad. Other than that… nothing major, really. I used to have high blood pressure, but it's been well-controlled with medication for years. I see Dr. Chen for that, she's very good. Let me see… I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I’m just trying to remember everything… it’s hard to keep track these days.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Mr. Paske. Thank you. So, past gallbladder removal, mild arthritis managed with ibuprofen, and well-controlled hypertension with Dr. Chen. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the ibuprofen and the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Just those two, I think. Oh! And sometimes I take a little something for indigestion, like Tums. But only when I have heartburn. It’s not regular. And I take a multivitamin every day, just to be on the safe side. I try to eat well, but you can never be too careful, right? I don’t take anything else regularly, though. I used to take something for anxiety, years ago, but I stopped that a long time ago. I find gardening helps more than any pill ever did.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, blood pressure medication, occasional Tums for indigestion, and a daily multivitamin. No regular anxiety medication currently. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My daughter always asks me that question, too, and I always tell her the same thing. I used to be worried about bee stings, but I haven’t been stung in years. Nothing comes to mind, honestly. I’m pretty lucky that way. I think I’m allergic to being bored, but that’s about it!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Paske. No known allergies. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. My mother smoked, and it was awful. I always swore I’d never touch a cigarette. And I haven’t. My wife smoked too, until she… well, never mind. It’s a bad habit, plain and simple. I always encourage everyone to stay away from it. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though. A nice Cabernet Sauvignon. But that’s about it. Nothing heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of smoking, occasional glass of wine. And how about alcohol consumption overall?
PATIENT: Oh, not much at all, really. Just that one glass with dinner, maybe three or four times a week. I don't drink alone, and I certainly don’t drink to excess. I’m not a big drinker. I prefer a good cup of tea, actually. Or a nice glass of water. I try to stay hydrated, you see. It’s important at my age. I’m not one for parties or anything like that. A quiet evening at home is more my style.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Paske. So, light alcohol consumption – a glass of wine with dinner a few times a week. Now, are there any major changes or stressors in your life currently?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my daughter is getting married next year, which is lovely, but also a bit stressful, planning the whole thing. And I miss my wife, of course. It’s been five years now, and it still feels… empty sometimes. But nothing major, you understand. Just the usual ups and downs of life. I try to stay busy, keep my mind occupied. I volunteer at the community college, helping students with their history projects. That keeps me going. But no, nothing that’s really thrown me for a loop lately.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Paske. The upcoming wedding and the continued grief over your wife are significant life events. And it's wonderful that you volunteer—staying active is important. Okay, Mr. Paske, I think I have a good understanding of your situation now. Given your history of sleep apnea, the persistent fatigue despite CPAP use, and the other symptoms you've described – irritability, memory issues, headaches, increased thirst – I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Specifically, I’d like to check your thyroid function, your blood sugar levels, your kidney function, and a complete blood count.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Blood work doesn’t bother me. I’ve had plenty done over the years. As long as it might help figure out what’s going on, I’m happy to do it. Do I need to fast beforehand, or anything like that? I always forget those things…
DOCTOR: Yes, you do need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. So, no food or drinks besides water after midnight tonight. We can provide you with a slip to take to the lab, and they'll remind you as well. I also think it would be helpful to review the data from your CPAP machine. Would you mind if we contacted SleepEasy Medical to obtain that information?
PATIENT: That’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Yes, please do. SleepEasy is very good, they shouldn’t mind at all. And thank you for reminding me about the fasting. I knew I’d forget something! It’s getting harder to keep track of these things these days. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. It’s nice to finally talk to someone about all this. It’s been… unsettling, feeling so tired all the time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. It’s my pleasure. I understand your concern, and it’s completely reasonable to feel unsettled when you're experiencing unexplained fatigue. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this. While we're waiting for the lab results and the CPAP data, I'd also like to discuss your current medications and lifestyle. We can explore strategies to optimize your sleep hygiene and address any potential contributing factors. And if the blood work doesn't reveal a clear cause, we may consider a referral to a neurologist to further investigate your memory concerns. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to try anything that might help. And a neurologist… well, that sounds a little daunting, but if you think it’s necessary, I trust your judgment. I appreciate you being so thorough. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? I miss gardening with energy, and lecturing without feeling like I'm going to fall asleep mid-sentence.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Paske. And that’s exactly what we’re aiming for – to help you regain your energy and enjoy the activities you love. Okay, so to recap, we'll order the blood work, contact SleepEasy Medical for your CPAP data, and discuss strategies for optimizing your sleep and overall health. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to review the results and discuss the next steps. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. A week is fine. I’ll try to remember to fast properly this time! Thank you again for listening. I feel a little better already, just having talked it through. I really appreciate your time and attention. Are there any forms I need to fill out before I leave?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad you’re feeling a little better. Yes, just a brief form confirming your insurance information and acknowledging that we've discussed the tests and procedures. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. My assistant, Sarah, will be happy to help you with that if you need assistance. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Paske. We'll do our best to help you get back to feeling like yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it very much. I'll go fill out those forms now. And thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: Have a good day, Mr. Paske. We’ll see you next week. .
