DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. Doctor Billman, is it? Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s get this over with. I need a… a permission slip. For somethin’ the young lady at the… the place… said I needed. Somethin’ about… fixin’ my face. It’s a cosmetic thing. Don't know why I need you for it, though. Seems like a waste of both our time, honestly.
DOCTOR: A “permission slip,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A permission slip! She said somethin' about… checkin' if I was healthy enough. I told her I feel fine. Been climbin’ towers for… well, a long time. Never had no problems. Don’t see what the fuss is about. Is this gonna take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, even for… cosmetic procedures, Mr. Honcoop, we need to ensure you’re a suitable candidate. It's a matter of safety. “Climbin’ towers” doesn’t necessarily mean your heart and lungs are in optimal condition. We need to rule out anything that could complicate things. Do you know what exactly this “place” is offering, and what the procedure entails?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't recall the name of the place. It was...somethin' with a "G" in it. Gold… or Glamour… somethin’ like that. The young lady was very persuasive. Said it would… tighten things up. My face is gettin’ a little… droopy, I suppose. She showed me pictures. It involves… needles. And somethin’ about my own blood. Didn’t pay much attention to the details. I just want to look a little younger, is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: “Tighten things up” with needles and your own blood… Sounds like a… facial rejuvenation procedure of some kind. And you're looking for cosmetic improvement. Alright. Before we proceed, let’s get a bit more information. Have you had anything like this done before?
PATIENT: No, never. I'm a practical man. Always been. I work with radios, towers… real things. Not… face stuff. This is a first for me. Look, Doctor, is this gonna involve a lot of questions? I got a lunch appointment. And I ain't one for pokin' and proddin'.
DOCTOR: A few questions, Mr. Honcoop. It’s standard procedure. We need to understand your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. I had a little cough last winter, but it went away. And my knees sometimes ache after a long climb. But that’s just… old age, I reckon. Doctor, I don't go to doctors. Never have. I take a couple of aspirin now and then, but that's about it. I don't have any of those… fancy diseases you mentioned. Really. I’m a strong man. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Now that you mention it… once, a bee stung me. But that was years ago. I swelled up a bit, but it went away. Other than that… no. I can take most things. I’ve always been a hardy sort. Look, are we gettin’ anywhere with this “permission slip”? I really need to be goin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to be sure. Blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs… standard stuff. Then we can maybe talk about this slip. It won’t take long. Please, have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Now you want to poke at me. After all this talk. Fine. But make it quick. I ain't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 150 over 90. That’s not ideal. Heart rate is a bit fast, and irregular. Lungs are clear, but… you’re breathing a little shallowly. Mr. Honcoop, with your blood pressure and heart rate, undergoing a cosmetic procedure – even a simple one – could be risky. We need to investigate this further. Have you ever been told you have atrial fibrillation, or any other heart condition?
PATIENT: Atrial… what-now? Look, Doctor, I told you, I don’t go to doctors! I feel fine. A little tired sometimes, maybe. But that’s just from climbin’ those towers. Always been a fast breather. Gets the oxygen flowin’, see? I don’t need any “investigation.” I just need this slip so I can get on with my life. This is a waste of both our time, honestly. Is this somethin’ I can override? Maybe with a… a waiver?
DOCTOR: A waiver?
PATIENT: Yes! Like… a sign sayin’ I know the risks. I'm a grown man. I can make my own decisions. I’ve been workin’ with dangerous equipment my whole life. A few needles ain’t gonna scare me. Look, Doctor, I’m not askin’ for a heart transplant here. Just a little permission slip. Surely you can just sign it. I’ll even give you a little extra for your trouble.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you’re frustrated, but I have a professional and ethical obligation to ensure your safety. Signing a waiver doesn't absolve me of that responsibility. Your vital signs are concerning, and proceeding with a cosmetic procedure in your current condition could have serious consequences. I’m not comfortable signing that slip. However, I can refer you to a cardiologist for a thorough evaluation. They can determine if you’re healthy enough to proceed.
PATIENT: A cardiologist? You’re tellin' me I need to see another doctor? This is ridiculous! I came here for a simple permission slip, not a full medical workup! Look, Doctor, I ain’t got time for all this. I got things to do. I'm a busy man! Fine! Forget it! You’re wastin’ my time. I’ll find someone else. Someone who isn’t so… hesitant! .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I strongly advise against that. But you are free to seek a second opinion. Please understand that I’m acting in your best interest. .
