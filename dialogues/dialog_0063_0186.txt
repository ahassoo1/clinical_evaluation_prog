DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I am Dr. Jules. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need a check-up for… well, a sports team tryout. Gotta make sure I'm okay to go for it, you know? Don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: A sports team tryout at your age… very well. While I appreciate… enthusiasm, we must be thorough. To begin, can you tell me what kind of tryout this is for?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… archery. Yeah, archery. Not running around or anything. Mostly just… standing and shooting. It's a local thing, a recreational league. Trying to get back into it after a long time. I used to be pretty good, honestly. But, you know, gotta be sure my back and everything holds up.
DOCTOR: Archery. Right. And how long has it been since you’ve… actively participated in this activity?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… probably… fifteen years? Maybe more. It’s been a while. Definitely since the kids were little. Time flies, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Indeed. Fifteen years is… significant. And have you experienced any pain or discomfort recently, or in the past, that might be relevant to this tryout?
PATIENT: Well, my back gets a little stiff sometimes. Just from… you know, getting older. Nothing major. And my shoulder… it pops a bit. Again, probably just age. It doesn’t hurt hurt, just… feels a little loose. I’ve never really bothered with it. Is that something I should bother with?
DOCTOR: "Pops a bit," you say. Vague descriptions are… unhelpful, Mr. Kingan. When does this popping occur?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. It happens mostly when I… reach behind me. Like, trying to grab something. Or when I… stretch it too far. And sometimes, after I've been standing for a long time. Not every time, but often enough to notice. Does that… help? Look, I just want to know if I can shoot a few arrows without pulling something.
DOCTOR: Right. Very well. We will need to conduct a brief physical examination, then. Please step onto the examination table. I'll need you to perform a few simple movements, and I'll assess your range of motion and… stability. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds good. Just… try to be quick, if you don't mind. I've got things to do later. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. I'm assessing your spinal mobility now. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ugh… not as easily as I used to. That's for sure. Feels a little tight. There. That's about as good as it gets, honestly.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion, as expected. Now, raise both arms overhead. Slowly. And tell me if you experience any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: Yeah, a little pinch in my shoulder here. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like it's gonna pop. It usually does if I push it too far. Can I stop?
DOCTOR: Very well. And can you rotate your shoulders outwards, against some resistance?
PATIENT: Resistance? What do you mean? Like… push against something? I don’t have anything here. Just… I can move them, if that’s what you mean. Feels a bit tight. It’s the same shoulder. Honestly, I think it just needs a good massage. Is that something you can do, Doctor? Or can you recommend someone?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I am a physician, not a massage therapist. Based on this cursory examination, you present with some degree of age-related musculoskeletal stiffness, particularly in your lower back and shoulder. I recommend physical therapy to address these concerns. It may also be prudent to obtain an X-ray of your shoulder to rule out any underlying pathology, although I suspect it is simply degenerative changes.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Physical therapy. X-ray. Sounds… expensive. Look, Doctor, I just want to shoot some arrows. Is it safe? Can I try it, or am I gonna end up in a wheelchair? And if I do need therapy, do you know anyone who won't charge me an arm and a leg? I don't have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I cannot guarantee your safety without a comprehensive assessment and appropriate treatment. While archery itself is not inherently dangerous, your existing musculoskeletal limitations increase your risk of injury. To proceed without intervention would be… ill-advised. As for affordable physical therapy… that is a complex question. I can provide you with a list of local facilities, but I cannot control their pricing. It is your responsibility to inquire about costs and determine what is financially feasible. I strongly recommend you refrain from participating in the tryout until you have addressed these concerns. Would you like the referrals for physical therapy and imaging?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Yeah, give me the referrals. But if I pull something shooting a few arrows, I’m blaming you. This is getting complicated for a bit of fun, you know? Just… give me the list. And can you hurry, please? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Here. These are local facilities. I will also send an order to the imaging center for a shoulder X-ray. I strongly advise you follow up with physical therapy promptly. And please, Mr. Kingan, be mindful of your limitations. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
