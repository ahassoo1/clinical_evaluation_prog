DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's... it's been a bit of a struggle lately. I just haven't been feeling right, you see. Mostly with my stomach. I get sick to my stomach pretty easily now, and I don't even get very hungry. A few bites and I feel full…it’s just not like it used to be. I’m not sure when it started, to be honest. Things…they all kind of blend together after a while, don’t they?
DOCTOR: Yes, they certainly do. So, stomach issues… nausea, feeling full quickly… and you said this has been going on for a while now. Hmm. Could you tell me a little more about the nausea?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It's not a constant thing, you understand. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s just a queasy feeling, like I’m on a boat. Other times… well, other times I actually get sick. Not always, thankfully. And it doesn't seem to be tied to anything specific, not that I've noticed. I eat the same things I always have… or at least, I try to. It’s just… unpredictable. I don't even know if what I ate caused it, sometimes. Does that make sense? It’s a little confusing, even for me.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable, okay. Not tied to a specific food… and sometimes you’re not even sure if food is the cause. Right. And how about other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I've been… well, a little tired, I suppose. But at my age, who isn’t? I just figured it was getting older. And… oh! My appetite's been worse than usual, even before I started getting sick. Like, I don't really want to eat, even when I’m not feeling nauseous. I used to enjoy cooking so much, but now… it just doesn't seem appealing. I've also lost a little weight, I think. But honestly, I haven't been keeping track. It’s hard to remember things these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, decreased appetite even without nausea, and some weight loss. And you said you haven't been tracking the weight loss specifically. Let's see… have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh my. Well, now you're asking… It's been…irregular. Sometimes I have trouble going, and sometimes…well, it's the opposite. It’s just been all over the place, really. I didn't want to bother you with it, but now that you ask… it hasn’t been normal for quite some time. I apologize for not mentioning it sooner. It feels a little embarrassing, you see.
DOCTOR: Please, don't apologize at all, Raymonde. These things are important, and I need to know everything to help you. Irregular bowel movements… okay. And have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any changes in the color?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood… I don't think so. Not that I recall. Everything looks… normal, I guess. Dark, you know. Like it should. I haven’t really looked closely, to be honest. I just… I don’t dwell on those sorts of things. It’s probably nothing. But now that you ask, I might have noticed it being a little… paler, maybe? But I could be imagining things. It really is hard to remember. Everything feels a bit… hazy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, potentially paler stools… we'll keep that in mind. Now, let’s go back a bit. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think… Well, the doctor told me a while back, a few years ago now, that I had… cancer. In my stomach, I think. They did surgery, and I had some treatments. I thought it was all done, gone. But maybe… maybe that’s coming back? That's probably what’s causing all of this, isn’t it? It's just… I haven’t been back to the doctor in so long. I just didn't want to bother anyone. I've been trying to get on with things, you see. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Raymonde, that's very important information. You had stomach cancer and underwent surgery and treatment?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It was… oh, it feels like a lifetime ago. They said it was early stages, and the surgery went well. I had some… chemotherapy, I think. It made me very sick, so I don’t remember much of it. And then they said I was clear. Remission, they called it. But like I said, I haven’t been back for check-ups. I just… I didn’t want to hear bad news. And honestly, I kept forgetting. It's a terrible thing, this memory. But now… you think it might be back? Is that what all of this means? Oh dear…
DOCTOR: Raymonde, it's completely understandable why you haven't been back, and why you’re feeling anxious. Given your history of stomach cancer, these symptoms do warrant further investigation. We need to rule out recurrence, and there are other possibilities we need to consider as well. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh. Investigation… yes, that makes sense. I suppose I should have come sooner. Medications… I don’t think so. I haven’t really taken anything regularly in years. Maybe some pain relievers for arthritis now and then, but nothing serious. And I didn’t have any problems with those. I just… I can’t really recall. It’s so frustrating, this old brain of mine. I apologize for not being more helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Raymonde. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember everything. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your abdomen, and feel for any tenderness. And then, I’d like to order some blood work, and potentially a stool sample analysis. We might also need to consider imaging, like a CT scan, to get a better look at things. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh. A CT scan… That sounds…serious. But if that's what you think is best, then yes. Yes, please. I just want to know what’s going on. I don't want to keep feeling like this, and I don't want to worry my family. The physical exam is fine too. Just… be gentle, please. My stomach has been very sensitive lately. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Do what you think is best. Just… please hurry. I just want this all over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Raymonde. I'll be as gentle as possible. And we'll move as quickly as we can. First, let's lie you down on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I'll gently feel for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels painful. I'm noting the date as August 2, 2025, for documentation.
PATIENT: Okay. This is… a little difficult, I’m afraid. My joints aren’t what they used to be. But I’ll manage. Just… take your time. And yes, please let me know if anything hurts. It's… hard to describe the pain, you see. It’s just… a dull ache, mostly. But it does get sharper sometimes. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm listening to your bowel sounds now. They seem a little… diminished, but not absent. And now I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any pain or tenderness as I press. I am noting mild tenderness in the epigastric region. No rebound tenderness, no guarding. Abdomen is soft overall, but there's some discomfort with palpation in the upper center of your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… uncomfortable. Not terribly painful, but definitely… sore. Right there. It’s been like that for a while now, on and off. It feels… like a pressure, mostly. A dull ache, like something is pushing from the inside. And it does seem to get worse after I eat, even just a little bit. It’s just… a nagging pain. It doesn't go away completely. I’m glad you're checking, Doctor. I haven't told anyone how much this bothers me. It’s hard to explain to people… they always say it's just old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the epigastric region with a feeling of pressure, worse after eating. We'll document that. Now, I’m going to order some blood work. It will help us check your overall health and look for any signs of inflammation or infection. I’ll also need a stool sample. It will help rule out any bleeding or other issues in your digestive system. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Oh. A stool sample… Well, that's… embarrassing. But if it's necessary, then I suppose I can manage. The blood work is fine too. Will the blood work tell you if the cancer is back? Is that what you're hoping to find out? I just… I want to know. I can't keep living like this, wondering what's going on inside me. And what exactly will you do with the stool sample? I apologize for asking so many questions, Doctor. I just… I’m very nervous.
DOCTOR: You have every right to be nervous, Raymonde, and you're not bothering me at all with your questions. It’s important that you understand everything. The blood work will give us a general picture of your health, and can help us look for markers that might indicate recurrence, yes. But it’s not definitive. As for the stool sample, we’ll be checking it for blood, and for other signs of inflammation or infection. It's a fairly routine test, and the lab will handle everything discreetly. I want to be clear, Raymonde. We’re not jumping to any conclusions at this point. We’re just gathering information so we can figure out what’s going on and get you the best possible care. I'll also write you a referral for a CT scan. The radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment.
PATIENT: Oh. Gathering information… yes, that makes sense. I just… I get so anxious sometimes. I’ve always been a worrier. A CT scan… that sounds… thorough. But if that’s what you think is best, then I trust your judgment, Doctor. Will the results be ready soon? I know you're very busy, but I just… I’d like to know as soon as possible. And can I call you if I have any questions before my appointment? Or if I start feeling worse? I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: Of course, Raymonde. I understand your anxiety, and I’ll do everything I can to get these results back to you as quickly as possible. The lab work usually takes a few days, and the CT scan results will take a bit longer, probably around a week. You absolutely can call if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen before your appointment. My nurse will provide you with the contact information on your way out. And please, don't hesitate to call, even if it seems like a small thing. We’re here to help. I’ll also write a prescription for some medication to help with the nausea, just to make you more comfortable while we wait for the test results.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. A little something for the nausea would be wonderful. It’s just… so unpleasant. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It makes me feel a little bit better, knowing what to expect. And thank you for not dismissing my worries. So many doctors rush you through appointments, and don’t really listen. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. I just want to get these tests done, and figure out what’s going on. And… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind to me. I think I’m ready to go now, if you’re finished. I just need a little help getting up.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Raymonde. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and we’ll work together to get you feeling better. Take your time getting up. My nurse will be right with you to give you the prescriptions and schedule your follow-up appointment. She’ll also provide you with the contact information for my office, and answer any questions you might have. Please, don’t hesitate to call if anything changes before then. Take care of yourself, Raymonde.
PATIENT: .
