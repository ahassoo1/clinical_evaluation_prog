DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're a new patient with our clinic. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Yes, new patient. My back… it’s been really bad. Hurts to move, hurts to sit, hurts to… well, almost everything. It’s been getting worse for maybe a month now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Back pain that’s progressively worsening over a month is certainly concerning. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to explain. It’s not like a sharp pain, not all the time. More… a heavy ache. Deep down, you know? And sometimes, like when I try to bend over, it shoots down my leg. Not both legs, just one. The left one. It makes me feel kinda weak in that leg too.
DOCTOR: A deep ache with radiating pain down the left leg… and associated weakness, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Weakness is… not all the time, but it feels like it could give out if I try to carry something heavy. Or even sometimes just walk too far. And I know… I know I have the cancer, so… is it that? Is the pain from the cancer getting worse? I’m sorry, I shouldn’t ask you that.
DOCTOR: Ms. Meigs, it’s perfectly alright to ask questions, and I appreciate you being upfront about your concerns. It's important we address everything. While pain can be associated with cancer, it's also caused by many other things. We need to investigate the cause of your pain specifically. We won’t jump to conclusions. To help me understand things better, could you tell me a little more about your cancer diagnosis?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, that makes me feel a little better. I was diagnosed… almost three years ago now. It’s in my lung. They did surgery, and chemo, and radiation. It was… hard. They said it was… controlled. Last check-up, the doctor said it was stable. But things always seem to change, don’t they? I mostly just… try to keep working. I have to.
DOCTOR: Yes, things can change. It's good that you’ve been under regular medical care and that the scans were stable at your last check-up. Now, regarding this back pain, does anything specifically make it worse, besides bending over?
PATIENT: Sitting for too long, definitely. I work at the factory, packing boxes. Lots of standing, but then sometimes I have to sit at the table to label things. That’s the worst. And… sleeping. It’s hard to get comfortable. I toss and turn all night. And when I do finally get to sleep, it wakes me up if I move the wrong way.
DOCTOR: Okay, so prolonged sitting and sleeping are significant triggers. I’m noting that as well. Now, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes. Not all the time, like the weakness. But sometimes my left foot feels… kinda pins and needles. Like it’s falling asleep. It goes away after a little bit, but it’s there sometimes. Especially if I've been sitting for a long time.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Meigs. That's helpful information. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just… I want to figure out what’s causing this. And if it is the cancer… well, I need to know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We'll proceed systematically and gather as much information as possible. Let’s start with a neurological exam. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay. Here. Is this okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, this is perfect. I’m just going to gently feel along your spine and ask you to move in a few different directions. Please let me know if anything causes you pain. Okay… and how about now?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, that one. That one hurts. Down my leg, like usual. Not terrible, but… definitely feels it. And when you pushed… right there… …that’s tender, too. Even when you don't push hard.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And how is your strength?
PATIENT: Strength? Hmm. I don’t know. I feel… weaker in my left leg, like I said. But I don't know if that’s just normal. Can you… can you check? I’m probably not very strong to begin with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs. I’ve assessed your strength. Your right leg appears to be stronger than your left, particularly in dorsiflexion and knee extension. We are seeing some weakness on the left side. I am also noting decreased reflexes in your left ankle compared to your right. This, combined with the pain radiating down your leg, the positive straight leg raise, and the tenderness, is suggestive of nerve compression, most likely a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. However, given your history of lung cancer, we need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: A… a herniated disc? What does that mean? Is that… bad? And spinal… what did you say? Is it the cancer spreading to my back? That’s what I’m scared of.
DOCTOR: Those are very reasonable concerns, Ms. Meigs. Let’s address them one at a time. A herniated disc means that the cushioning between the bones in your spine has slipped out of place, potentially pressing on a nerve. It can be painful, and it explains the pain radiating down your leg and the weakness you’re experiencing. Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the spinal canal, which can also compress nerves. Now, regarding your fear of the cancer spreading, that is absolutely something we need to rule out. It’s possible, and that's why I want to order some imaging studies. An MRI of your lumbar spine will give us a clear picture of the bones, nerves, and discs, and help determine the cause of your pain. It will also help us see if there is any evidence of cancer involvement in your spine. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI… okay. Yes, that sounds… good. I mean, I don't want it to be bad news, but I need to know, right? So, yes. An MRI. When can I get one? And will… will it hurt? I don’t like being closed in, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable. It’s always better to know what we're dealing with. An MRI is generally painless. You will lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-shaped machine. It can be a bit claustrophobic for some people, so we can discuss options if you're feeling anxious – such as a mild sedative or an open MRI, if one is available. I’ll write the order for the MRI now, and the radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. Typically, they can get you in within a few days. While you're waiting for the MRI, I’m going to prescribe a short course of muscle relaxants and an anti-inflammatory medication to help manage your pain. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay. Muscle relaxants and… anti-inflammatory. That sounds good. Anything to help with the pain. And I’ll think about the… the closed-in part. Maybe I can talk to them about something for that, if I need it. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. It’s my pleasure. I want to make sure you feel informed and comfortable every step of the way. I’ll also provide you with a referral to physical therapy. Even before we have the MRI results, physical therapy can help you learn exercises to strengthen your back and improve your range of motion. Here are the prescriptions and the referral. Please contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your MRI appointment. And we’ll schedule a follow-up visit to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor Delacour. I really appreciate you listening and not… rushing me. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes or you have any further concerns. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
