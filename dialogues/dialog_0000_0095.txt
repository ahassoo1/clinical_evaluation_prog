DOCTOR: Right. Stephane Nissenbaum, 59 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s quite simple. I woke up this morning and… well, I can’t hear out of one ear. And my face feels… droopy, on that same side. It’s rather unsettling, you know? I don't usually bother doctors for every little thing, but this isn’t little.
DOCTOR: "Not usually bother doctors," hmm?
PATIENT: Look, are we going to discuss my healthcare choices or figure out why half my face feels like it’s going to slide off? I have things to do, you know. This is August 2nd – a perfectly good Saturday being wasted here.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to be… dramatic. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping… those can be concerning. Let’s get some details. When exactly did this start?
PATIENT: This morning. I told you. When I woke up. Around… seven, I suppose. I had my usual tea, and then I noticed when I tried to hear the news. It was just… muffled. Then I looked in the mirror and… well, you see it, don’t you? It's not exactly subtle. I don't need a detailed timeline for everything if it's obvious.
DOCTOR: “Obvious” isn’t a medical term, Stephane. And while I appreciate your… succinctness, I do need a proper history. Any fever, headache, dizziness, or trouble speaking?
PATIENT: No fever. No headache. No dizziness. And I’m speaking perfectly clearly, aren’t I? Though it's getting increasingly frustrating to repeat myself. I just… woke up like this. It's a Saturday. Honestly, I haven’t got time for a twenty-question game. Is this something serious or not?
DOCTOR: “Serious” is relative. But sudden unilateral hearing loss and facial weakness… strongly suggests a possible neurological event. We need to rule things out. Have you had any recent infections?
PATIENT: Infections? Goodness, no. I keep a very clean house. And I generally avoid people who are unwell. Though, last month, my gardener tracked some mud in… does that count? Really, Doctor, is this standard procedure? Asking about garden soil when I'm telling you half my face is paralyzed?
DOCTOR: It's called taking a complete history, Stephane. We're trying to be thorough. Any family history of stroke, neurological problems, or Bell’s palsy?
PATIENT: Stroke? No. My mother lived to be ninety-two, perfectly healthy until the very end. My father… he was a rather stern man, always working. Never sick a day in his life, as far as I know. And Bell’s… what is Bell’s? Honestly, I don’t keep track of every ailment. Is it contagious? I have a very nice Persian rug I’d prefer not to ruin.
DOCTOR: Bell’s palsy is a neurological condition that causes sudden facial paralysis. It’s not contagious. Look, I need to examine you properly. Can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, it feels ridiculous. But fine. There. Happy now? It feels… strange. And quite alarming, actually. I keep expecting things to just… fall off.
DOCTOR: Right ear appears clear. Left ear… slightly congested, but not dramatically. Now, close your eyes. Can you feel me touching your forehead, cheeks, and chin?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can feel you. Though I'm not entirely sure why we're doing this. It’s tickling, mostly. And quite… impersonal. Are you sure you washed your hands after the last patient? I really don't want to catch anything on top of this.
DOCTOR: I assure you, I follow strict hygiene protocols. Now, can you wrinkle your forehead?
PATIENT: There. Is that satisfactory? Honestly, it's rather undignified being poked and prodded like this. And it doesn't seem to be getting us anywhere. Are you going to tell me what's wrong or just continue this… performance?
DOCTOR: Based on your symptoms and my examination… it’s highly suggestive of Bell’s palsy. However, we need to rule out more serious causes, like stroke or a tumor. I’m ordering an MRI immediately. We'll need to go to the hospital. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: An MRI? The hospital? Good heavens. Contrast dye? No, I don't think so. I have sensitive skin. And frankly, I find this all rather… excessive. Couldn't it just be… stress? I've been dealing with the estate lawyers, you know. It's terribly draining. I simply cannot spend my Saturday in a hospital. It's simply out of the question. Is there nothing else we can do? Some sort of… medication, perhaps? I really need to get home.
DOCTOR: Stephane, you’re experiencing a sudden onset of neurological symptoms. Ignoring this, or attributing it to “stress,” could have serious consequences. I understand you’re inconvenienced, but I’m obligated to ensure you receive appropriate care. The MRI is necessary. And yes, there are medications we can consider once we have the results, but first, we need to determine the underlying cause. I'm referring you to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist at City General Hospital. I've already called ahead. You'll need to go immediately. Do you have someone who can drive you?
PATIENT: This is absurd! You're telling me I have to go to the hospital on a Saturday, based on a possibility? I refuse. I simply refuse. I don’t even have insurance. City General is notoriously expensive. And frankly, I don’t trust hospitals. I’ve heard dreadful stories. I think I'll just… go home and rest. Perhaps it will clear up on its own. I’m perfectly capable of making my own decisions, Doctor. Thank you for your time. .
DOCTOR: Stephane, I strongly advise against that. You’re putting your health at significant risk. I’m documenting your refusal of recommended care, and I am obligated to inform you that delaying diagnosis and treatment could lead to permanent facial paralysis, or even more serious complications. However, the decision is ultimately yours. Here’s the neurologist’s contact information, and a referral note. Please reconsider. .
