DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about my bruising. It’s getting ridiculous, frankly. I’m on that blood thinner, you see, and normally a little bump is a little bump. But lately… it's like I'm made of glass. My wife… well, she would have been concerned, and I’m starting to get worried myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising easily… and it seems to be getting worse despite being on a blood thinner already. I understand your wife's concern, and it's good you're bringing this to our attention. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about these bruises?
PATIENT: Well, where to begin? They appear with almost nothing. I barely graze my arm against the furniture and poof, a lovely purple mark. And they're… larger than they used to be. And more of them. I’m not doing anything different, I assure you. I haven't fallen or anything dramatic. I’m a careful man, always have been. It’s just… worrying. And unsightly, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they appear with minimal trauma, are larger than previously, and are increasing in frequency… despite being on a blood thinner. That is concerning, you’re right to be worried. Just to be thorough, about how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been… well, it started subtly, maybe a month or so ago. At first, I dismissed it. Old age, you know? But then it just kept getting worse. Maybe six weeks now? It's hard to pinpoint exactly. Time… it just slips away. It’s definitely been noticeable for the last three weeks, at least. My wife… she pointed it out, of course. She had a keen eye.
DOCTOR: Okay, so approximately six weeks, with a noticeable increase over the last three weeks. And your wife noticed it first. That's helpful. Now, besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No… no fever, no dizziness. I haven’t felt particularly weak, although I tire easily, but that's just getting older, I suspect. My gums… now that you mention it, they bleed a little when I brush my teeth. Just a little, mind you. Nothing dramatic. And… I’ve had a few nosebleeds, but those aren't frequent. Maybe one a month. They stop pretty easily. I don’t know if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever or dizziness, some fatigue, bleeding gums, and occasional nosebleeds that stop easily. That could all be related, it's good you're telling me everything. Now, let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my prostate removed about ten years ago. That was… unpleasant. And I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it’s manageable with some over-the-counter medication. Other than that… not much. I used to smoke, years ago, but I quit about twenty years ago. My wife… she always encouraged me to take care of myself. And I generally do. I was always a healthy man, until… well, you know. Besides the bruising, I feel alright. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, prostate removal ten years ago, arthritis in the knees, and a history of smoking, but you quit twenty years ago. That’s good to know. And you generally feel alright otherwise. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood thinner?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the blood thinner, which is… Coumadin, I believe. And I take a little something for my knees when they act up. Ibuprofen, I think it is. The over-the-counter kind. And… a vitamin D supplement. The doctor recommended it. Old people don’t get enough sun, you know. That’s about it. I’m not one for taking a lot of pills. I prefer to keep things simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, Coumadin, ibuprofen as needed, and vitamin D. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. My wife always made sure of that when I started a new medication. She was very thorough. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. And she would have remembered, definitely. She had a… a very good memory. It’s just… difficult now, without her. But no, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for sharing all of this with me, Mr. Farson. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a better look at the bruising and check for any other signs. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… be gentle, if you would. My skin is rather thin these days. And… it bruises easily, as you’ve noticed. I suppose you'll need to look at my arms and legs? And perhaps my gums?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. And yes, I'd like to take a look at your arms, legs, and gums. We'll start with your arms, if you don't mind. Okay, I see some ecchymoses – that’s the medical term for bruising – on both forearms. They vary in size and color, suggesting they are at different stages of healing. There's also some tenderness to the touch in a few areas. And I notice some smaller, pinpoint bruises – we call those petechiae – scattered around. Let’s take a look at your legs now.
PATIENT: Yes, go ahead. My legs… they’re probably worse than my arms. I try to cover them up, frankly. It’s unsightly. And people… they stare. I suppose you’ll find more of the same? The pinpoint ones, you said? Petechiae? It’s all very alarming, Doctor. I just want to know what’s causing it. And if there’s something you can do about it. I don’t want to end up… like my wife. She had… other health problems, you see. I just want to be… stable.
DOCTOR: You're right, there is more bruising on your legs, and it appears to be more widespread than on your arms. I see similar ecchymoses and petechiae. There’s some tenderness here as well. Now, let's take a look at your gums. I see some mild inflammation and a slight tendency to bleed when gently probed. Okay, Mr. Farson. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve seen, you’re experiencing significant bruising and bleeding tendencies. While you are already on a blood thinner, the extent of bruising and the presence of petechiae are concerning and warrant further investigation. I'm going to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, coagulation studies, and platelet count. These tests will help us rule out any underlying conditions that might be contributing to the bleeding. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests… alright. I suppose it’s better to know. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. My wife… she spent so much time in hospitals. I don’t want to end up like that. What kind of underlying conditions are you thinking about? Is it… is it something bad? I’d rather know, even if it’s not good news. I’ve always preferred to face things head-on. Even if it's difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson. It's perfectly natural to be worried. There are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be a side effect of the Coumadin, although your levels should be monitored regularly. However, we also need to rule out other conditions such as a vitamin deficiency, an underlying bleeding disorder, or, less commonly, a more serious condition affecting your bone marrow. I want to be upfront with you: these tests are to gather information, and it’s too early to say definitively what’s going on. Most likely, it's something manageable, but we need to investigate to be sure. We’ll get the results back within a few days, and then we can discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, please avoid any activities that could cause injury, and let me know immediately if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe bleeding, dizziness, or fatigue. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds reasonable. Avoid injury… that’s hardly a challenge these days. I mostly sit and read. And I’ll let you know if anything changes. Severe bleeding… well, I suppose I’ll know if that happens. So, blood tests. And then we wait. It’s… unsettling. My wife… she always had a logical explanation for everything. She would have known exactly what to do. Can I at least… keep taking the vitamin D? It can’t hurt, can it? And is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any creams I can put on the bruises? Anything to stop them from getting worse?
DOCTOR: It is unsettling, and I understand your feelings. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious in this situation. Yes, you can absolutely continue taking the vitamin D. It’s unlikely to cause any harm and may even be beneficial. As for the bruises, you can apply cold compresses to the affected areas for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. That can help reduce swelling and discomfort. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like acetaminophen, can also help with the pain. However, avoid taking ibuprofen or other NSAIDs, as they can increase your risk of bleeding. I'm also going to order a repeat Coumadin level check to ensure you’re within the therapeutic range. I’ll give you a written summary of these instructions and the list of tests I'm ordering. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’ll schedule that for a few days after we receive the test results. How does that sound, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Written summary… good. I tend to forget things these days. And I will call if anything changes. Follow-up appointment… alright. Just… try to be quick, if you can. I don’t want to spend too much time in hospitals. It brings back… unpleasant memories. Well… thank you, Doctor. For everything. You’ve been very… reassuring. I appreciate it. I suppose I’ll just… wait for the results now. And try not to bump into anything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Farson. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do my best to get you answers as quickly as possible. Please don't hesitate to call if anything at all comes up. I'll have the nurse draw your blood before you leave, and we’ll get the paperwork sorted out. Take care of yourself, and try to relax. And please remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I… I will. .
