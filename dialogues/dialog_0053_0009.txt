DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Alcorta. Doyle Pitmon, doctor. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Pitmon, it’s…my sight. It’s been deteriorating, shall we say. Not rapidly, but noticeably. It’s becoming…inconvenient.
DOCTOR: <stage>I tap a pen against the chart, already formulating judgements. “Inconvenient.” Really?
PATIENT: Right. And how long has it been…inconvenient, as you put it? Are we talking weeks, months, longer? Try to be precise, if you can. I find vague descriptions…unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Months, I’d say. Perhaps six, maybe eight. It’s…difficult to pinpoint exactly. Things just seem…less sharp. And it’s worse at night, I suppose. Driving is becoming…problematic.
PATIENT: Driving is…problematic? Can you elaborate on that? Are you having trouble seeing road signs? Difficulty judging distances? Headlights glaring? Be specific, Mr. Alcorta. This isn’t a social call.
DOCTOR: It's…a blur, mostly. Especially oncoming headlights. And judging the distance between cars…it's harder now. I used to be able to tell instantly if I had enough space to merge, but now…I hesitate. It's unsettling. I haven't had any accidents, thankfully, but I'm starting to avoid night driving altogether.
PATIENT: Avoidance is…understandable, I suppose. Have you noticed any changes to your vision during the day? Any floaters, flashes, or a curtain coming down in your peripheral vision? Anything at all, no matter how small it may seem.
DOCTOR: No curtain, no flashes. Though…sometimes things seem…dimmer overall, even in daylight. And occasionally, I get a sort of…fuzziness. It's not constant, but it's there. It's more noticeable when I'm tired, I think. I've also been getting more frequent headaches, mostly in the temples. They're not debilitating, but…annoying.
PATIENT: Headaches, you say. And dimmer vision overall. Have you had your eyes checked recently? Perhaps you simply need a new prescription for glasses? I'm assuming you wear glasses? Don't tell me you've been neglecting something so basic.
DOCTOR: No, Doctor. I don’t wear glasses. And…no, I haven't had my eyes checked in…well, a long time. Probably twenty years. It was never a priority. I always figured my vision was fine. Until now, of course.
PATIENT: Twenty years, Mr. Alcorta? That’s…a considerable amount of time. And you’ve experienced a noticeable decline in your vision over the past six to eight months, with accompanying headaches? This isn't something we can simply dismiss. We'll need to run some tests, of course. A thorough examination is absolutely essential.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with a basic visual acuity test. Then we'll check your peripheral vision, and I'll dilate your pupils to get a better look at the back of your eyes. It may take a little while, and your vision will be blurry afterwards, so you shouldn't drive. Do you have someone who can take you home?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I live alone. I was…hoping to avoid bringing someone. I can manage. I’ll take a taxi, I suppose. Though, frankly, the thought of navigating…with impaired vision…is rather unsettling. Is there anything…anything at all…I should be particularly concerned about? Before we proceed?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Alcorta, I'm not going to alarm you unnecessarily. However, a significant change in vision, especially coupled with headaches, can be indicative of several things. Glaucoma, cataracts…even more serious conditions. That’s why a thorough examination is crucial. The dilation will allow me to assess the health of your optic nerve and retina. We need to rule out anything serious. And frankly, driving in your current state is irresponsible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Irresponsible. Very well. Proceed, then. Let's get this over with. But…please, be quick about it, if you can. I have…commitments. Though, I suppose those are less important now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please stand facing the chart. I'll cover one eye at a time and ask you to read the smallest line you can see. Don't strain. Just read what you can. And try to relax. It won't be quick, unfortunately. Thoroughness takes time. Now, which eye shall we begin with?
PATIENT: Left eye, I suppose. Though I doubt it will make much difference. They both seem…equally compromised. Let's just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Can you read this line for me, please?
PATIENT: Umm…E…H…P…T…F… Is that correct? It’s…rather blurry, Doctor. I’m straining to make them out.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about this line?
PATIENT: That…that’s more difficult. I can make out…C…L…but the rest are…indistinct. F…V… perhaps? I’m really having trouble, Doctor. It’s like looking through a fog. Is there any way to…brighten the lights? Or…sharpen the image?
DOCTOR: The lighting is as optimal as it will be. Try your best. Don't guess, just read what you can clearly see. And remember, it's important to be accurate. This helps me understand the extent of your vision loss. Now, focus. Can you attempt this line?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I…I can’t. They’re just a blur. I can’t distinguish any of them. It’s…it’s frustrating. I used to have such good eyesight. This is…disconcerting. Perhaps we should simply move on to the other eye? This is clearly…fruitless.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s try the right eye. Please focus on the chart. And try to relax. This won’t be any faster, regardless. Begin with the top line.
PATIENT: E…H…P…T…F… Yes, I can see those. They’re…clear enough, at least. But I suspect it won’t improve much from here. It feels…the same as the other eye. A vague blur. It’s…unsettling, Doctor. Are you getting anything useful from this? Or are we simply wasting our time?
DOCTOR: We are gathering data, Mr. Alcorta. It’s important to establish a baseline. Now, focus on this line. Read what you can. Don’t strain, but be honest. I need accurate information to determine the best course of action.
PATIENT: Umm…C…L…V…F… No, wait…that's wrong. It's…indistinct. I can make out the shapes, but the letters themselves are…fuzzy. It's like looking through a dirty window. I'm really straining, Doctor. This is…quite difficult. Perhaps we should move on? This is clearly not improving. It’s…unproductive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. That’s enough for the visual acuity test. As I suspected, your vision is significantly impaired in both eyes. Now, we'll need to check your peripheral vision and dilate your pupils to examine the back of your eyes. This will give me a better understanding of what's going on. It’s standard procedure. I will need you to sign a consent form before we proceed. Do you have any questions before we continue?
PATIENT: Dilate…meaning my vision will be worse afterwards? And I'll need someone to drive me home. This is…inconvenient, to say the least. Consent form, you say? Very well. But I must reiterate, I do not have anyone available to assist me. Is there…any way to expedite this process? Or perhaps…lessen the impact on my vision?
DOCTOR: The dilation drops will temporarily blur your vision, both near and far, for several hours. Bright light will also be uncomfortable. It’s unavoidable, unfortunately. It’s necessary to get a clear view of your optic nerve and retina. As for expediting the process, I’m moving as quickly as I can while still maintaining a thorough examination. I understand your concerns, but compromising the quality of the exam isn’t an option. I also strongly advise against driving yourself home in your current condition. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Temporarily blurred vision, sensitivity to light, and…a strong recommendation against driving. Very well. Proceed, then. Let’s get this over with. Though I must confess, I find this entire situation…rather unsettling. And deeply inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to instill one drop in each eye. You may feel a slight stinging sensation. Please look straight ahead and try not to blink. And I’ll need you to sit here for about 20 minutes to allow the drops to take effect. After that, we’ll proceed with the fundoscopic examination. Just try to relax. This is the most important part of the exam. Now, lean back and keep your eyes open.
PATIENT: Very well. Proceed, Doctor. Let's get this over with. Though I must reiterate, I do not appreciate being kept waiting. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Just keep looking straight ahead and try not to blink. You may feel a slight stinging sensation, but it should pass quickly. It will take about 20 minutes for the drops to fully dilate your pupils. During this time, I’ll review your medical history and prepare for the fundoscopic examination. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort or unusual side effects. Now, I'll give you a moment to rest. I will return shortly.
PATIENT: Doctor…the stinging is…rather unpleasant. And my vision is already becoming blurry. Is this…normal? I trust this is a temporary inconvenience, and not a sign of something…untoward?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Alcorta, the stinging and blurry vision are both perfectly normal. The drops are working as intended. They need to dilate your pupils sufficiently to allow me to examine the back of your eyes. It may take a few minutes for the effects to fully subside. It's a temporary inconvenience, as you said. Please just try to relax and avoid straining your eyes. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No further concerns…at the moment. Just…an increasing sense of unease, I suppose. And the anticipation of a less-than-pleasant diagnosis. Very well. I shall attempt to remain…relaxed. Though I must confess, it's rather difficult under the circumstances. And I do hope this…procedure…doesn't take too long. My time is valuable, as I've mentioned previously.
DOCTOR: Very well. Just a few more minutes, Mr. Alcorta. I’m going to dim the lights now. Please keep your eyes focused on a fixed point in the distance. I will be examining the back of your eyes with this instrument. It may seem a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. I'll start with your right eye.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Proceed. But please, be quick about it. And try to be…gentle. I have a rather low tolerance for discomfort, as you may have surmised. And I do hope this…procedure…reveals nothing…untoward.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Just keep looking straight ahead. I’m going to shine a light into your eye. It may be bright, but try not to blink.
PATIENT: Doctor…the light is…rather intense. And I can feel a slight pressure behind my eyes. Is this…normal? Or is something…untoward…occurring? I trust you are observing something…favorable?
DOCTOR: The light is necessary to get a clear view of the back of your eye, Mr. Alcorta. The pressure is also normal—it’s simply from the instrument. I’m observing several…findings, which require further investigation. I’m now going to examine your left eye. Just keep looking straight ahead.
PATIENT: Doctor…what precisely are you observing? You mentioned…findings. Are these findings…concerning? I trust you are not detecting anything…untoward? A simple explanation would be…appreciated. I do not appreciate being kept in suspense.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. I’ve completed the examination. The findings are…concerning. I’ve observed pallor of both optic nerves, moderate drusen, cotton wool spots, and hemorrhages in both retinas. These findings suggest a significant underlying condition. Based on these findings, I suspect you may have hypertensive retinopathy, which is damage to the blood vessels in the retina caused by high blood pressure. However, this is just a preliminary assessment. We need to run some tests to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the damage. Specifically, I recommend a comprehensive blood pressure check, a blood glucose test, and a visual field test. These tests will help us determine the best course of treatment. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Hypertensive…retinopathy? High blood pressure? I…I have never been diagnosed with high blood pressure. I do not experience any symptoms. Are you certain? And what…what are the implications? Will I…will I lose my vision? What course of treatment are you recommending? And…and what will this cost? I trust you have a payment plan available? This is…very unsettling, Doctor. Very unsettling indeed.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your concern, but jumping to conclusions will not help. While I haven’t confirmed the diagnosis, the findings are highly suggestive of hypertensive retinopathy. The condition can lead to vision loss if left untreated, but with prompt diagnosis and treatment, we can often prevent further damage. The recommended course of treatment will depend on the severity of the condition. It typically involves medication to control your blood pressure, lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise, and regular monitoring of your vision. As for the cost, I can provide you with a detailed estimate after we’ve completed the necessary tests. I do not handle billing directly, but the clinic offers payment plans for eligible patients. Let's focus on getting the tests scheduled first. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…no, I do not have any known allergies to medications. Though I rarely take anything, to be honest. I pride myself on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This…this is all rather…disconcerting. Medication…lifestyle modifications…it’s…it’s a lot to process. And the tests…when can these tests be scheduled? And how long will it take to get the results? I do not have a great deal of free time, as you may have surmised. Very well. Schedule the tests, then. But please, expedite the process as much as possible. And I trust you will provide me with a comprehensive explanation of the results. This is…very unsettling indeed. And I do hope this doesn’t interfere with my…commitments. </stage>
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. I’ve scheduled you for a comprehensive blood pressure check, a blood glucose test, and a visual field test at the clinic’s laboratory tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and develop a treatment plan. Here’s the referral form. Please take this to the laboratory when you arrive. The lab technician will explain the testing procedures. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No further questions at the moment. Just…a great deal of…unease. And a growing sense of…apprehension. Very well. I shall attend the laboratory tomorrow morning. And I trust you will contact me as soon as the results are available. Thank you for your…assistance, Doctor. Though I must confess, this has been…far from a pleasant experience. Good day. .
