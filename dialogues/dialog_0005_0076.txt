DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs, see? On my shins. They’re red and kinda hurt. Not all the time, but when I rub against things, or even just sometimes when I’m standing. Been happening for… oh, a couple of weeks now, I think. Maybe a little longer.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. A couple of weeks, on your shins… and they hurt with rubbing, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Rubbing, or if I press on them too hard. They're not itchy, though. Just…sore. And kinda ugly, to be honest. My wife noticed them first, she’s got a good eye. She told me to come get ‘em checked out. Here, you see?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see them. They do appear… inflamed. Alright. Now, have you been doing anything different lately?
PATIENT: Different? Hmm… Not really, Doctor. Same old, same old. I work, come home, eat dinner with my wife, watch a little TV. I’ve been doing a bit more work around the house, maybe? Helping my son with some stuff… lifting some bags of cement for his garden project last week. But that’s about it. Nothing too strenuous, I didn’t think.
DOCTOR: Cement, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, just a few bags. He’s building a little raised bed for his tomatoes. I didn’t lift all of them, he had some friends help too. But I did a few trips, maybe ten bags over the course of a couple of days. Not a big deal, I’ve lifted heavier things before. But maybe… maybe that had something to do with it? I don't know. I’m just guessing now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. No fever, no chills, no swelling anywhere else. Just these bumps. They haven't gotten any bigger, I don't think. Maybe a little redder sometimes, after I’ve been walking around a lot. But no pus or anything like that. I don't feel sick, if that makes sense. Just… annoyed by these things.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, no chills, no swelling...Alright, let's take a look at your medical history. Do you mind if I quickly access your chart here?
PATIENT: No, no problem at all, Doctor. Go ahead. I’ve got Medicare, so I figure everything’s in there somewhere. I try to keep up with my checkups, you know? My wife makes sure of that. She's good at things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's see… Clarke Aluia, age 71… Hmm. Okay, I see some history of hypertension, well-controlled, and some mild arthritis in your knees… Nothing that immediately jumps out as being relevant here. Are you currently taking any medications for your hypertension or arthritis?
PATIENT: Yeah, I take a little pill for the blood pressure, every morning. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take ibuprofen. Just when I need it, though. Not every day. Just a couple when they ache. That’s about it, really. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril and ibuprofen as needed… Alright. And any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. Never had any trouble with any pills or anything like that. My wife always asks when she gets me new ones, just to be sure, but I haven’t had a reaction to anything, not ever. I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam of your legs. I'll just need you to lie down on the exam table, if you don’t mind. I need to feel these bumps and check the circulation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I’m used to doctor visits, you know? Getting old has its downsides. Just let me know if you need me to move or anything. Don’t want to make your job harder.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Aluia. Just lie down there, and we’ll take a look. Now, just relax. I’m going to palpate your shins, see how tender they are… Hmm… they are indeed tender to the touch. And slightly warm. No sign of open wounds or infection, that’s good. Now, let's check your pulses… Pulses are good, strong and regular. No swelling in your ankles either. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it seems likely these are shin splints, possibly exacerbated by the recent lifting you did with your son. It's a common injury, especially with increased activity.
PATIENT: Shin splints, huh? I’ve never heard of those before. But lifting those bags of cement… that makes sense, I guess. I didn't think much of it at the time, but my legs have been feeling a bit sore ever since. Is it something serious, Doctor? Do I need to, you know, get an X-ray or something?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Aluia, an X-ray isn't necessary at this time. Shin splints are usually caused by overuse and inflammation of the muscles around the shinbone. It's not usually serious, but it can be quite painful. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities, so we’ll take a cautious approach. I'm going to recommend you rest your legs as much as possible for the next week or so. Avoid any strenuous activity, including lifting heavy objects. I also recommend icing your shins for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. You can also take over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen, to help with the pain and inflammation. I'm going to write you a prescription for a stronger anti-inflammatory, just in case the over-the-counter medication isn't enough. And I'd like you to follow up with me in two weeks to see how you’re doing. If the pain gets worse, or if you notice any swelling, redness, or fever, please call the office immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… manageable. Rest, ice, pills… I can do that. My wife will be glad to hear I’m finally listening to my body. She's always telling me to slow down. Two weeks, you said? I’ll write that down. And if it gets worse, I’ll give you a call. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at my legs.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Aluia. Here’s the prescription for the anti-inflammatory, and this is a summary of our visit and instructions. Just make sure you follow the instructions carefully. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll see you in two weeks. Get some rest.
