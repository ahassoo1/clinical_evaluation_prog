DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure, I assure you. One doesn't often find such...refined establishments these days. Well, to get straight to it. I'm here about this...medical marijuana. My daughter – she's a very progressive woman, always reading things online – suggested I look into it for my arthritis. It's simply dreadful, you understand. And frankly, I'd rather not be beholden to those…pharmaceutical companies.
DOCTOR: I see. Medical marijuana for arthritis, and a preference to avoid conventional pharmaceuticals. While I respect your autonomy in choosing your treatment modalities, Ms. Ranells, I must state for the record that the efficacy of marijuana for arthritis is, shall we say, still under investigation. Now, could you describe this arthritis to me?
PATIENT: Under investigation? Honestly. I’ve been living with it for fifteen years, Doctor. That’s quite enough investigation, if you ask me. But…very well. It’s primarily in my hands, you see? Makes it terribly difficult to do even the simplest things – needlepoint, arranging flowers, things a woman of my standing should be able to do. And sometimes, it travels up to my wrists. It’s a constant ache, a throbbing, really. Especially in the damp. And the cold. Makes them quite stiff, you know. It's simply debilitating.
DOCTOR: Debilitating, you say. And localized to the hands and wrists, exacerbated by dampness and cold. Can you describe the pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: A scale? Really, Doctor. One doesn't simply quantify suffering. However… if I must. On a good day, perhaps a three or four. But on a cold, wet morning like this? Easily an eight. It’s a sharp ache, not just a dull throb. And it keeps me from…well, from maintaining standards. One has a reputation to uphold, you understand.
DOCTOR: Eight out of ten on a bad day, sharp pain, impacting daily activities and reputation. I understand. Now, has this pain been progressing recently?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, must you ask such unpleasant questions? Yes, it has. It wasn’t always this…insistent. But the last few months…particularly since this dreadful weather set in… it’s become quite unbearable. And the fingers… they’re getting stiff. It’s making my needlepoint…a disaster. I had to throw out a perfectly good canvas last week. It was simply… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: I see. Increasing pain, specifically in the fingers, impacting fine motor skills. Now, have you noticed any swelling or redness in your joints?
PATIENT: Swelling? Redness? Doctor, I assure you, I maintain a very meticulous hygiene routine. I wouldn’t allow such things. There might be a slight discoloration on particularly bad days, perhaps a little puffiness...but certainly nothing unsightly. And I certainly don't look like some…common invalid. I apply a very good hand cream, you know. Several times a day.
DOCTOR: I see. No significant swelling or redness. Now, let's move on to other things. Have you experienced any pain in other joints – your knees, hips, back, perhaps?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you suggesting I'm falling apart? Really. My knees occasionally ache after gardening, but that's to be expected. I am a woman of a certain age, after all. And my back...well, it's just the usual wear and tear of maintaining a respectable posture. Nothing a good corset can't handle. But those are minor inconveniences. It's the hands that are the problem. The hands, Doctor. A lady's hands are her livelihood, you understand.
DOCTOR: Quite. The hands are the primary concern. Now, I must ask, have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where does one even begin? I had a rather unpleasant bout of bronchitis years ago – the humidity in the Dominican Republic, you know. And a touch of anemia, but that was sorted with iron supplements. My husband—God rest his soul—insisted on a thorough check-up every year. And… I had my gallbladder removed, decades ago. But frankly, Doctor, those are all in the past. I assure you, I am a remarkably healthy woman for my age. I do take care of myself.
DOCTOR: I see. Bronchitis, anemia, cholecystectomy. And no current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Current? No, Doctor. I'm not ailing. A little arthritis, hardly counts. I take a daily walk, I maintain a sensible diet—when my cook is behaving, that is—and I see my hairdresser regularly. Is that not enough to qualify as ‘healthy’? I assure you, I am not the sort to complain unnecessarily. This is about getting some relief for my hands, not listing every minor ailment I've ever experienced.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see…Just a small dose of something for my blood pressure, the doctor insisted after a rather stressful Christmas with my nieces. And occasionally, a mild analgesic for headaches. But nothing… serious. Certainly nothing I rely on. And absolutely nothing from those… pharmaceutical companies, if I can help it. I prefer natural remedies, when possible.
DOCTOR: I see. Blood pressure medication, occasional analgesics. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, really. I was raised in the Dominican Republic. I’ve encountered every sort of plant, insect, and climate imaginable. I’m remarkably robust, I assure you. Though... I had a rather unpleasant reaction to some shellfish years ago, but I avoid it now. That's about it. No, I’m not prone to… sensitivities. I'm a very hardy woman.
DOCTOR: Shellfish allergy. Very well. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Honestly. I've been examined by the finest doctors in both Santo Domingo and New York, I assure you. But… very well. If you must. I do hope it won’t be too… indelicate. And I trust you have thoroughly washed your hands? One must maintain standards, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please, have a seat. I'll begin with your hands. Let's start with range of motion. Could you open and close your fists for me, please?
PATIENT: Very well. There. As you can see, it’s not entirely effortless. It’s a bit…stiff. Though I do maintain a rigorous hand cream regimen, I assure you. It's hardly a graceful movement, is it? A lady's hands should be nimble, delicate…not like this.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion noted, particularly in flexion. Some crepitus present upon closing fists. Any tenderness here, Ms. Ranells?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, there. That one. And…perhaps a little there. It's not a sharp pain, you understand. More of a… throbbing ache. Especially when the weather is damp. Honestly, this is quite unpleasant. One doesn’t appreciate having one’s hands poked and prodded. It’s hardly dignified.
DOCTOR: Tenderness upon palpation of the dorsal aspect of the second metacarpophalangeal joint, and distal radioulnar joint. No significant swelling or erythema. Now, please squeeze as hard as you can when I ask you to. Grip strength is… somewhat diminished bilaterally. I see.
PATIENT: Is that sufficient? Honestly, this is all rather…mechanical. A lady's hands are for delicate tasks, not brute force! It's hardly surprising my grip isn't what it used to be. One doesn't spend one's life lifting weights, you understand. This is all very well, but I'm not entirely convinced it's necessary.
DOCTOR: Diminished grip strength confirmed bilaterally, consistent with decreased muscle mass and possible joint discomfort. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. Reflexes are within normal limits for age. Overall, your general health appears stable, Ms. Ranells, aside from the arthritis in your hands. Now, I'd like to discuss potential treatment options. However, before we do, do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: Treatment options? Honestly, Doctor, I came here for a certificate for medical marijuana. I've already made up my mind. Are you going to provide it or not? All this… poking and prodding and listening to my heartbeat is hardly relevant. I assure you, I've done my research. My daughter is very knowledgeable about these things. I simply want a medical professional to validate my request. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ranells, with all due respect, simply providing a certificate without a thorough assessment would be unethical and potentially harmful. I understand your preference for medical marijuana, but it's crucial to ensure it's the right treatment option for you, considering your overall health and potential interactions with your other medications. I'm concerned about the diminished grip strength and tenderness in your hands. It's possible there's more going on than just simple arthritis. I would recommend consulting a rheumatologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. However, if you insist on pursuing medical marijuana without further investigation, I must inform you that I cannot, in good conscience, provide a certificate without a proper diagnosis and a discussion of potential risks and benefits.
PATIENT: A rheumatologist? Honestly, Doctor! Are you implying I'm falling apart? I assure you, my hands are perfectly… well, they’re hands. And my daughter has assured me this marijuana will alleviate the discomfort. I simply want a piece of paper, a validation of my own good judgment! I've wasted enough time with this… poking and prodding. I came here for a service, Doctor, not a lecture. I think I’ll be seeking a second opinion. Perhaps a doctor who understands a patient’s wishes is more appropriate.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Ranells. I wish you all the best in your pursuit of treatment. .
