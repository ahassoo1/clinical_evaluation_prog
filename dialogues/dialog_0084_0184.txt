DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look here, I ain't got all day. It's about… well, lookin’ in the mirror. It bothers me, that's what. Always been a strong man, workin' with the pile driver, but now… things ain't holdin’ like they used to. You understand what I mean?
DOCTOR: I think so, Mr. Trendler. You’re concerned about some changes you’ve noticed… physically. Can you be a little more specific about what’s bothering you when you look in the mirror?
PATIENT: Specific? Specific?! Look, everything is droopin’. Droopin’ everywhere! My skin… it's like an old piece of leather. And it ain't firm, you hear me? Not firm at all. Used to have muscles, real muscles. Now… it’s all… soft. Like my wife's pudding. And she didn't like anyone touchin’ her pudding.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, you're noticing changes in your skin’s firmness and some sagging… all over. Has this been happening gradually, or did you notice it suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, of course gradually! You think things just change overnight? I ain't a magician. Been happenin' for… oh, maybe the last year or so. It started with my neck, I think. A little wobble when I turn my head. Then the face… then everywhere else. It’s just… annoyin’. A strong man shouldn't look like… this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about a year, starting with your neck… and it’s progressed from there. And you feel it’s affecting your self-image?
PATIENT: Affectin’ my self-image? Doctor, you askin’ if I like lookin’ like a wrinkled old prune? Of course it is! I used to be somebody. People respected me. Now they just see an old man. A… floppy old man. It's disrespectful, I tell ya! I worked hard all my life, and this is what I get?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like this is really bothering you, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel that way. Let’s talk a bit more about your medical history, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. That will help me understand what might be going on. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Surgeries? Let me think… I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbin’ a mango tree. And I had the flu a few times, like everyone does. Nothing serious. Never been one for doctorin’, if you catch my drift. Mostly just strong rum and good work. But the only thing that matters now is fixin’ this. You understand? I ain’t here to talk about childhood mishaps.
DOCTOR: I understand you’d like to focus on the current issue, Mr. Trendler. But knowing about your past health can sometimes give us clues. Were you ever in the military?
PATIENT: Military? Heavens no! I was buildin’ things, not blowin’ them up. Pile driver operator, remember? Honest work. No, never been near the military. My brother, now he joined up, went off to… some place with a lot of sand. Didn't come back the same. But me? Always workin', always strong. This… this ain't right. I want it fixed, Doctor. And I don't have time for a life story.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. We’ll focus on today. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I told you, strong rum and hard work. Never needed no fancy pills. My wife, she took pills for everything, little white ones, little blue ones. Made her sleepy. I never touched them. Just rum. Now that never bothered me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter? What's that? Look, I might take an aspirin if my head hurts, and that's about it. Nothing regular. I don't believe in fillin' my body with chemicals. Waste of money, that’s what it is. And time. I told you, Doctor, I ain’t got all day. Let’s get to the fixin'.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Let’s do a quick exam then. I just want to take a look at your skin, assess the muscle tone, and get a general idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get on with it. But don't be pokin' and proddin' for too long. And be gentle, I ain't made of iron anymore. Though I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat here. I'm going to start by looking at your skin overall. Okay, Mr. Trendler. I see what you mean. Your skin does show some loss of elasticity, which is common with age. The muscle tone is also diminished, and I notice some laxity, particularly around your neck. It appears to be generalized, which suggests it’s not related to any specific injury. Your reflexes are normal, and I don't feel any unusual masses or tenderness. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 72 and regular. Respiration is 16, unlabored. Do you notice any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. Just… saggin’. It feels… empty, under the skin. Like the air is gettin' to it. And it bothers me when I shave. Gets all… bumpy. And now you’re talkin' numbers at me! What’s all that mean? I ain't a scientist, Doctor. Is it fixable, or isn't it? That's all I want to know.
DOCTOR: The numbers are just what I use to check your overall health, Mr. Trendler. Your blood pressure and pulse are within a reasonable range for your age. What you're describing – the sagging and feeling "empty" – is consistent with a natural loss of collagen and elastin as we age, and also some loss of muscle mass. It's a process called ptosis, and it’s very common. Now, about fixing it… there are options. We could discuss non-surgical options like radiofrequency skin tightening, which can stimulate collagen production. Or, for more dramatic results, there are surgical procedures like a neck lift or facelift. However, those come with risks and a recovery period. Before we go into detail, I think it would be helpful to get a better understanding of your overall health. Do you mind if I order some blood work to check your general health and rule out any underlying medical conditions?
PATIENT: Blood work? More pokin’ and proddin’? Look, Doctor, I ain’t made of money! And I told you, I ain't got time for all this fuss. Radio… what-cha-call-it… sounds like something from the radio! I just want to look presentable again, not become a science experiment. Can you just… tighten it up? With somethin’ quick? Like a bandage? Is that possible? Just somethin’ to hold it all together!
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration. Unfortunately, there's no quick fix like a bandage for this. Radiofrequency is a non-surgical treatment using energy waves to stimulate your skin’s natural collagen. It takes multiple sessions and the results are gradual. And while it can improve the appearance of sagging skin, it won't provide a dramatic tightening. A surgical procedure would give you more noticeable results, but it requires anesthesia, recovery time, and carries inherent risks. Before we consider either of those options, I really do think some blood work is important to make sure you're a good candidate and to rule out any underlying issues that could affect the results or increase the risks. It's a standard precaution, and it will only take a few vials of blood. If you're still hesitant, I can also refer you to a dermatologist who specializes in cosmetic procedures. They can provide a second opinion and discuss the options in more detail. What do you think?
PATIENT: Second opinion? More doctors?! Look, Doctor, I'm gettin' a headache just thinkin' about it. Fine, fine. Do your blood work. But make it quick, and don't expect me to be comin' back for fancy procedures. I’m an old man, not a canvas! Just get it done, so I can get on with my life. And tell me how much it’s gonna cost, before you poke and prod. I ain't made of money, remember?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. We'll keep it quick. The blood work will cost approximately $150, and we can submit it to your insurance for potential coverage. It will check your basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and thyroid function. I’ll also write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a dermatologist who is highly regarded in the area. That way, you have all your options available. I'll have the lab order ready for you, and the nurse will draw the blood before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just get it done. And tell that nurse to be gentle. I don't like needles. Now, can I go? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. The nurse will be right with you. Please let her know if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I hope you find the information helpful.
PATIENT: Hmph.
