DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s about this… team. A baseball team. They want me to… play. They need to make sure I’m… okay, I guess. For the team. It’s a physical, right? That’s what the man on the phone said. A check-up before I… try out.
DOCTOR: A baseball team. Right. At your age, that’s… unusual, but certainly not unheard of. A pre-participation physical, yes. We’ll need to go through a fairly standard examination, and I’ll need a detailed history. It's important to ensure there are no underlying conditions that could be exacerbated by strenuous activity. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant… problems? Hmm. Well, I had something once. Years ago. A bad back, maybe? Or was it my knee? It hurt for a while. I took some pills. Red ones, I think. It’s hard to remember… my wife, she always handled those things. Before… well, you know. I don’t really keep track of those details. Is… is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Bartok. Even seemingly minor issues can be relevant. The fact that you don’t recall specifics is… concerning, but we'll work through it. Let’s try this. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Oh… yes. A long time ago. For my… appendix, I think. Or was it my gallbladder? Something like that. It was… painful. Very painful. They gave me… something. To make it stop. It was a big hospital. Lots of white. I remember the food wasn’t very good. Honestly, Doctor, it was all a blur. I just want to play baseball. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, with all due respect, playing baseball requires a certain level of physical fitness and a clear understanding of your medical background. We need to establish what’s going on. Vague recollections aren’t sufficient. Alright. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I eat… everything. Well, almost everything. My wife didn’t like shellfish. But that was her preference, not an allergy. I never had a problem with… bees, or anything like that. Now that I think about it, I did get a rash once. After using a new soap. But it went away. Was that an allergy? I really don't know, Doctor. These things… they all run together.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me think… Well, the doctor gave me something for my… water. You know, when I get too much water in my legs. Or maybe it was my hands? Small white pills, I think. I take them… sometimes. When it gets bad. I can’t remember the name. It was a long time ago. I just… take them when I need to. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, taking medication without knowing what it is, or why you’re taking it, is a problem. It’s potentially dangerous. We need to identify this medication. Do you have any family history of medical problems?
PATIENT: Family? My mother… she was sick. A long time ago. Something with her… breathing. She was always tired. And my father… he had problems with his… feet. Very bad problems. He had to… get things done to them. Operations, I think. They all… went away eventually. Or maybe they didn’t. It was a long time ago, Doctor. I don't remember the specifics. Old people forget, you know. It’s natural.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, while I understand memory can fade, your lack of detailed medical information is… deeply concerning. It makes it very difficult to assess your suitability for strenuous physical activity. Let’s move on to a physical examination. I'll need to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and assess your range of motion. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Blood pressure? Oh. Right. Okay. It’s… cold. Is this necessary, Doctor? I just want to play baseball. Can’t we just… skip the check-up and let me try out? I’m a strong man, for my age. I can handle it. Fine. Do what you have to do. But be gentle.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 150 over 90. Pulse is 78, regular. Lung sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally, but no wheezes or crackles noted at this time. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No organomegaly. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Mr. Bartok, your blood pressure is higher than it should be. And the diminished lung sounds require further investigation. This doesn’t necessarily preclude you from playing baseball, but it does necessitate further testing. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions before you engage in strenuous physical activity.
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Oh, Doctor, this is getting ridiculous. I just want to play baseball, not become a science experiment. What will these tests even show? I feel fine. A little tired, maybe. But who isn’t? Is it really necessary? I don't like hospitals. Or tests. Or doctors poking around. Can’t we just… forget the whole thing? I’ll just… take it easy. Play a little slower. Please?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your reluctance, but I have a professional obligation to ensure your safety. Engaging in strenuous activity with uncontrolled hypertension and diminished lung sounds could have serious consequences, including stroke, heart attack, or exacerbation of an underlying respiratory condition. It is not a risk I am willing to take, and frankly, it would be negligent of me to allow you to participate without a thorough evaluation. The tests will provide valuable information about your overall health. The complete blood count will assess your red and white blood cell counts and platelet levels, the basic metabolic panel will evaluate your kidney function, electrolyte balance, and blood sugar levels, and the chest X-ray will help identify any abnormalities in your lungs. I'm ordering these tests as a precaution. We can discuss the results once they're available. In the meantime, I strongly advise against any strenuous physical activity. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tests… and no baseball. Fine, Doctor. Do what you have to do. But I don’t like it. Not one bit. When will I get the results? And will they definitely tell you if I can play? Because if they don't, this is all for nothing. I just want to play a little baseball. Is that too much to ask? This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.
DOCTOR: The results should be available within 48-72 hours. I’ll have my nurse contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Whether or not you can play baseball will depend on the findings. I cannot guarantee a positive outcome, but we need to rule out any potential risks first. You’ll need to take this to the lab at St. Luke’s Hospital. It’s located on Elm Street. The nurse will give you directions. In the meantime, please refrain from any strenuous activity. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Questions…? I… I don't know. Will it hurt? The tests, I mean. And how long will they take? I have… things to do. Important things. Will they find something bad? Something… serious? I just want to play baseball, Doctor. That's all I want.
DOCTOR: The tests themselves are relatively painless. The blood draw will involve a brief prick of a needle, and the chest X-ray is simply a quick imaging procedure. They should take no more than an hour in total. As for finding something serious… it's impossible to say at this point. That's why we're doing the tests. We need to gather information. It's best not to borrow trouble, Mr. Bartok. Worrying will only exacerbate your anxiety. We’ll take things one step at a time. First, we get the tests done. Then, we review the results. And then, we’ll discuss your options. My nurse will provide you with all the necessary information and answer any further questions you may have. Are we clear?
PATIENT: Clear, I think. Tests… and waiting. And maybe… no baseball. Fine. I’ll go get the tests done. But I’m not happy about it. Thank you, Doctor. I guess. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. All I want to do is play a little baseball…
