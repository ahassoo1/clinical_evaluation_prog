DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s about… starting a family. Or, trying to. My daughter, she thinks I should… get some advice before things get… serious. It’s a little confusing, to be honest. I’m not sure what I need to do, exactly.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It’s wise to seek guidance, especially when things are evolving. So, your daughter is encouraging you to explore family planning options… and you’d like my perspective?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. She’s a good girl, my daughter. Very… practical. I’m… older, you see. And I want to be… prepared. If that makes sense. I don’t… I don’t want to cause any problems. Not at my age. Is this… normal? For someone like me to… think about this now?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Verrall, and it’s becoming increasingly common. There's no age limit on starting or expanding a family, and it's commendable that you're thinking ahead and wanting to be prepared. Many people are having children later in life. Let's talk about what "prepared" means to you. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your current health status?
PATIENT: Hmm… current health… Well, I try to walk every day. Not far, mind you. Bad knees, you see. And… I get a little tired. I have… high blood pressure, I think? The doctor told me something about that a while back. I take a… a little white pill for it, every morning. That’s about it, I suppose. I don’t really… go to the doctor much otherwise. I’m not insured, so… it’s expensive. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Verrall. It's very helpful to know that you're managing your blood pressure with a medication, and that you’re active with daily walks. The knees are good to know too. Just to clarify, do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. It’s… small, and white. The pharmacy… they give it to me every month. It has… letters on it, I think. But I don’t remember what they are. My daughter usually picks it up for me. I just… take it. I’m sorry, I’m not very good with remembering things these days. Is it important?
DOCTOR: No, don't apologize at all, Mr. Verrall. It’s perfectly alright. We can figure it out. Knowing the name helps us ensure you’re on the most appropriate medication, and to avoid any potential interactions if we consider other options. We can look it up based on your pharmacy information if you're comfortable sharing that. For now, let's focus on other aspects of your health. Have you had any significant medical conditions in the past – like heart problems, diabetes, or any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgeries… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And… I think I had a problem with my… gallbladder, years ago? But I don't remember much about it. Just that it hurt. As for… diabetes or heart problems, no. Not that I know of. The doctors never said anything about that. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit… oh, maybe thirty years ago? Is that important? I really don't remember much. It was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very helpful, Mr. Verrall. Knowing about the appendix removal, the past gallbladder issue, and your history of smoking are important pieces of the puzzle. Thirty years smoke-free is excellent. Do you currently drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Alcohol… I used to, with dinner sometimes. A glass of wine, maybe. But not much. For the past few years… no. Not really. My daughter doesn't like it, and… well, I try to please her. So, no, not much alcohol these days. Just a sip, maybe, at Christmas. That’s all. It makes me a little… sleepy. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Verrall. It’s helpful to understand your current habits. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a difficult one. My family… they were mostly in Kurdistan. We didn't talk about these things much. My father… he died young, from… something with his heart, I think. But I don’t remember the details. My mother… she lived a long life, but she had… arthritis, very bad arthritis. And my sister… she had some kind of… problem with her stomach, a long time ago. But I'm not sure what it was. It was all a long time ago, and we didn’t have doctors like you back then. Is it important to know all the details? I'm afraid I don’t have much to tell you.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. You've already given me valuable information, and it's not always possible to have a complete family history. Knowing about your father’s heart issue and your mother's arthritis is helpful. Let's shift gears a bit. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the white pill for your blood pressure, or any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, I don't think so. Just the white pill. Sometimes, my daughter gives me something for my knees… a cream, you rub it on. But that's all. No vitamins, no supplements. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Fruits and vegetables. My daughter makes sure of that, too. She’s a good girl, really. I’m sure I’m forgetting something, but… no, I think that’s it. Just the white pill and the cream for my knees.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. Now, before we move onto a physical exam, are there any allergies you are aware of – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. No, not that I know of. I've never had any… reactions to anything. Sometimes, my skin gets a little itchy, but that's probably just the weather. Or dust. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. My daughter always checks the labels on food, just in case, but… no, I don't think so. No allergies. I'm pretty lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Verrall. Alright, if you’re comfortable, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam. We’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a quick look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m not really a fan of doctors, to be honest. But if it’s important… yes, go ahead. Just be gentle with my knees, please. They ache sometimes.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verrall. We'll be as gentle as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, which isn’t entirely surprising given your history. Your heart sounds regular, but there's a slight murmur – it’s not particularly concerning at this time, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. And your knees do show some signs of wear and tear, as you mentioned, with some swelling and crepitus. Do you experience pain with walking or climbing stairs?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. Especially when I climb stairs. And after I’ve walked for a while, they start to ache. Not all the time, but… yeah, they ache. It’s just… old age, I suppose. I try not to overdo it. I don't want to make it worse. It’s good you’re listening to them, Doctor. I can feel it… something isn't right. But what does it all mean? Is it… serious? Is it going to stop me from… well, you know. Starting a family?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Verrall. First, let’s address your concerns. The murmur I heard is likely benign, but we’ll want to monitor it with periodic check-ups. Your knees do show signs of osteoarthritis, which is common with age and activity. It explains the pain and crepitus. Now, regarding your question about starting a family, it's important to be realistic. Given your age and existing health conditions, there are a few things we need to consider. First, we need to optimize your blood pressure control. High blood pressure can pose risks during pregnancy, so getting that under control is crucial. Second, we need to assess your overall cardiovascular health. I'd like to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar, and a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels. I'd also recommend an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. Finally, given your knee pain, we can discuss strategies to manage it – physical therapy, pain relief options, and potentially injections. Do you have any questions about these recommendations so far?
PATIENT: Blood tests… EKG… it sounds… complicated. And expensive. I don't have insurance, remember? Physical therapy… I don't know if I can afford that either. It’s just… a lot. Is it… is it even possible? For someone like me? I’m an old man, Doctor. I don’t want to put myself, or… or anyone else, at risk. Maybe I’m being foolish, even thinking about this. I just… I want to be a father. But maybe it’s too late. What do you think? Should I just… forget about it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed, and those are valid concerns. You're right to think about the financial implications and potential risks. It's also very brave of you to be so open about your fears. Let's address the costs first. I'm aware you don't have insurance. I can provide you with information about local resources that offer financial assistance for medical testing and treatment. We can also prioritize the most essential tests initially – the blood tests and EKG – to get a clearer picture of your overall health. Regarding your age, it is true that there are increased risks associated with later-in-life parenthood. However, many people have healthy pregnancies and raise wonderful families at older ages. It requires careful planning, close monitoring, and a realistic understanding of the potential challenges. I’m not going to tell you to “forget about it,” because that’s not my place. What I will do is help you gather the information you need to make an informed decision. The blood tests and EKG will give us a better understanding of your overall health, and then we can discuss the risks and benefits in more detail. If your results are favorable, we can explore options with a specialist – a reproductive endocrinologist – who can provide further guidance. Would you like me to provide you with a list of affordable testing facilities and resources in the area?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. That would be very helpful. A list of the facilities and… resources. Thank you, Doctor. You’re… you’re very kind. I appreciate you not telling me it’s impossible. I just… I need to know. I need to be sure. And if it’s not possible, I need to accept that. But at least… at least I’ll know I tried. So, yes. Please. The list. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verrall. Absolutely. Here is a list of local facilities offering reduced-cost blood work and EKGs. I’ve also included information about a few organizations that may be able to help with the costs. I’ll also write you a referral for a reproductive endocrinologist. It doesn’t obligate you to anything, but it will allow you to schedule a consultation if you choose to explore that option further. Before you leave, are there any other questions I can answer for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you very much. You’ve given me a lot to think about. And… I appreciate your honesty. And your kindness. I’ll look over this list and… see what I can do. Thank you again.
