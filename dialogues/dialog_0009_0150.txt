DOCTOR: Good morning, Angelle. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have all day. I want to have a baby. A healthy baby. I’m… not getting any younger, and I’d like to avoid any complications, if that's possible. I’ve heard good things about your… efficiency.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Angelle. That’s a very reasonable goal, and it's good you're thinking ahead. Planning for a healthy pregnancy is excellent. “Efficiency” is a kind word, I appreciate that! Let’s gather some information so we can figure out the best path forward for you. To start, have you been trying to conceive for a while now?
PATIENT: “Trying”? Is that what you call it? A few times, yes. It’s not like it’s been a… dedicated project. My ex-husband and I… well, that's beside the point. The point is, it wasn’t exactly successful. And frankly, I don’t want to waste any more time on… uncertainties. I need to know what the chances are, and what can be done to improve them. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I see. So, previous attempts haven’t been consistently tracked, and you’re understandably eager to maximize your chances now. That’s perfectly alright. We can definitely work with that. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: My… medical history? Really? Do you need a complete rundown of every childhood ailment? I’ve had the usual things. Chickenpox, a broken arm once. Nothing… significant. I’m generally healthy. I eat reasonably well, I try to exercise. What specifically are you fishing for? I have Medicare, if that’s what you want to know. Is there a form I can fill out instead of this… interrogation?
DOCTOR: No, not an interrogation at all, Angelle. Just trying to get a complete picture. Knowing about past illnesses, surgeries, or family history can be helpful. Medicare is good to know, thank you. Let’s start with this: have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? No. Diabetes? Absolutely not. I am not that woman. Thyroid? Look, I had a bit of a… sluggish period a few years back, the doctor said it was probably just stress. He gave me some pills. I took them for a while, then stopped when things… improved. Honestly, I don’t remember the exact diagnosis. It wasn't life-threatening. Is this relevant? Everything was fine. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, a period of sluggishness a few years ago, and some medication prescribed for that. It is helpful to know, even if it wasn't a major concern at the time. Sometimes those things can impact fertility, so it's good to be aware. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I eat everything. Dust, maybe. A little bit of pollen. But nothing… serious. I'm Hungarian, you know. We’re a hardy people. I’m not one of those delicate flowers who reacts to everything. Honestly, I’m starting to wonder what this is all about. Are you going to ask me about my… childhood pets next?
DOCTOR: No childhood pets, Angelle, unless you’d like to tell me about them. Just trying to be thorough. It’s important to rule out anything that could potentially affect a pregnancy. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? A multivitamin, sometimes. And I take something for my joints. They ache a bit, you know, getting older. It's… glucosamine, I think. And chondroitin. Something like that. I buy it at the drugstore. That’s it. Nothing else. Are we nearly finished? I have an appointment this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and glucosamine/chondroitin for your joints. Thank you. That’s helpful. To complete the picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, for goodness sake. Everyone has something. My mother had… high cholesterol, I think. My grandmother… well, she lived to be ninety, so I don’t think genetics are much of a concern. No one died young, no one had any… terrible illnesses. It’s a perfectly ordinary family. Are you seriously writing all this down? It’s a waste of time.
DOCTOR: It’s not a waste of time, Angelle. Even a “perfectly ordinary” family history can be important. Knowing what conditions run in your family helps us assess your risk and plan for a healthy pregnancy. Just to be sure, were there any instances of miscarriages or stillbirths in your family?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… my aunt, on my father’s side… she had a stillbirth, a long time ago. It was… very sad. Everyone said it was just bad luck. And… I think my cousin's wife had a miscarriage, but that was a while back too. It was… early in the pregnancy. Why are you asking about this? It's all so… depressing. Are you implying something? I’m perfectly healthy. I feel healthy. And I don't need to relive old tragedies to have a baby! .
DOCTOR: I apologize if these questions are upsetting, Angelle. It’s not my intention to cause distress. We are simply gathering information to ensure the best possible outcome for you. Knowing about past miscarriages or stillbirths, even in the family, can sometimes help us identify potential risk factors. To help me get a clearer picture of your current health, would you mind if I did a brief physical exam?
