DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine. Well, I received a letter from the clinic regarding some test results… a test of my insides, I believe they called it – an “endo” test. It wasn’t quite clear in the letter what the problem was, just that it was… abnormal. I was hoping you could explain things a bit more clearly for me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Minatra. Let’s take a look at those results together. Ah, yes, I see here you had an endoscopy performed on July 12th. The report does indicate some abnormalities. Before we dive into the specifics, could you tell me if you’ve been experiencing any symptoms that have been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, July 12th… yes, that was a bit uncomfortable, I recall. As for symptoms… well, that’s a good question. I suppose I have been feeling a little more tired than usual lately, but at my age, one tends to be tired, wouldn’t you agree? And perhaps a little indigestion now and then… nothing I haven't experienced before, really. No pain, thankfully, and my appetite is still quite good. But now that you mention it, I have been noticing… a bit of a change in my bowel habits, if you will. Not major, but… different.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that you've noticed these changes, even if they seem minor. Fatigue, indigestion, and changes in bowel habits can all be important clues. Could you describe those changes in your bowel habits a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, normally… I have a regular schedule, you see. Every morning, like clockwork. But lately… it’s been a bit unpredictable. Sometimes I go, sometimes I don’t. And when I do go… it’s not quite the same consistency as before. It’s… looser, I suppose. Not diarrhea, mind you, just… softer. And occasionally, I’ve noticed… a bit of blood. A very small amount, but enough to be noticeable on the… paper. I apologize for being so graphic, Doctor. It’s just… I want to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize at all, Ms. Minatra. It’s important to be thorough, and I appreciate you sharing these details with me. That information is very helpful. The blood you’ve noticed, is it bright red, dark and tarry, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… bright red, Doctor. Not dark at all. It’s usually just a small streak, or a few spots, on the paper. It hasn’t been a large amount, thankfully. It’s more the fact that it’s there at all that worries me, you understand. I’ve never experienced anything like this before. I’ve always been… quite regular, as I mentioned. This change… it's unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Minatra. Bright red blood suggests the bleeding is likely coming from lower in the digestive tract, such as the colon or rectum. Given the changes you’ve described – the altered bowel habits, the fatigue, the indigestion, and the bleeding – it's important we investigate this further. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I'd like to perform a physical exam. Specifically, I’ll want to listen to your abdomen, and then perform a digital rectal exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I suppose it’s unavoidable, isn’t it? A bit… embarrassing, perhaps, but I understand it’s necessary. Yes, please, proceed. Just… please be gentle. This old body isn’t quite as resilient as it once was.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Minatra. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. Okay, everything sounds normal there, although a little quiet. Now, I’ll need to perform a digital rectal exam. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort. I will let you know when I'm starting. I do feel a small mass in your rectum. It’s not large, but it’s definitely there. It feels a bit firm. Based on the results of the exam and your symptoms, it's likely we need to investigate this mass further. I’m concerned about the possibility of a polyp or, less likely, a tumor. I'd like to schedule a colonoscopy. This will allow us to visualize the entire colon and rectum and take a biopsy of the mass if necessary. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… Oh dear. A biopsy… That sounds… serious, Doctor. A tumor? I hadn't even considered… Is it… is it likely to be cancerous? I understand you can’t be certain, of course, but… what are the chances? I must admit, I'm rather frightened now. A small mass… I thought it was just indigestion. This is all very unsettling. A colonoscopy… tell me, is it a painful procedure? I’ve heard… stories.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Ms. Minatra. It's natural to be frightened when hearing this information. I want to assure you that we're taking this seriously and will do everything we can to get a clear diagnosis and develop a plan. It's too early to say definitively whether the mass is cancerous. The colonoscopy will give us much more information. It will allow us to take a sample of the tissue and examine it under a microscope. Regarding the colonoscopy itself, it’s not a painless procedure, but we take steps to minimize discomfort. You’ll receive sedation to help you relax and keep you comfortable during the procedure. Most people don't remember much of it afterwards. There may be some bloating and mild cramping afterwards, but it’s usually manageable. We'll discuss the preparation process in detail, as it’s important to have a clean colon for the procedure to be effective. Before scheduling the colonoscopy, I would also like to order some blood work to check your overall health and look for any signs of anemia. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, of course. Anything you think is necessary, Doctor. I suppose it’s best to be thorough. Anemia… is that related to the bleeding? I must admit, I have been feeling a little weaker lately, but I attributed that to my age. It’s all rather overwhelming, isn’t it? A colonoscopy, a biopsy… and now blood work. I suppose it’s for the best, to know exactly what we're dealing with. When would the colonoscopy be scheduled? And how long does it usually take to get the results from the biopsy? I’m… I'm a bit of a worrier, you see. The uncertainty is the hardest part.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Minatra. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed and worried in this situation. The uncertainty is the hardest part, and we'll do everything we can to provide you with answers as quickly as possible. We can schedule the colonoscopy for next week, likely on Wednesday. That gives us time to complete the blood work and for you to prepare. The procedure itself usually takes about 30-60 minutes. The biopsy results typically take 5-10 business days to come back. We'll notify you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, if you experience any significant bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or fever, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Five to ten business days… that’s a long time to wait, isn’t it? But I understand. Yes… I do have a question. I’ve always been… quite healthy, all my life. I eat a balanced diet, I get regular exercise… I don’t smoke, I rarely drink… what could have caused this? Is it something I did… or didn’t do? And… is it something other people in my family might be at risk of? My husband… he passed away several years ago, but his mother… she had some problems with her stomach, I believe. Though I don't know what. It's a bit vague.
DOCTOR: Those are very important questions, Ms. Minatra. It’s natural to want to understand the cause and if there's a family connection. Unfortunately, it’s often difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of polyps or tumors. There are several factors that can contribute, including genetics, diet, lifestyle, and even just random chance. Sometimes, they develop without any obvious reason. Regarding your family history, it’s certainly worth knowing more about your husband’s mother’s stomach problems. Any information you can recall about her condition – the type of problem, any treatments she received, and whether other family members were affected – could be helpful. A history of colon polyps or colon cancer in the family does increase your risk, but it doesn't necessarily mean you will develop the condition. We can discuss your family history in more detail during the colonoscopy preparation. We can also look into genetic testing if the biopsy results warrant it. In the meantime, please try not to dwell on what you might have done or not done. We’ll focus on getting a diagnosis and developing a plan. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've answered everything I was wondering, I believe. I… I suppose I’m just a bit overwhelmed, as you said. Wednesday, then. For the colonoscopy. I’ll… I’ll try to prepare myself mentally, and I’ll see if I can find out any more about my husband’s mother’s condition. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient and kind, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. It… it helps to know I’m in good hands. I suppose I’ll… see you on Wednesday.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Minatra. I'm glad I could help. Please remember, I’m here for you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before Wednesday. We'll take good care of you. I’ll see you then. Have a good day, Ms. Minatra.
