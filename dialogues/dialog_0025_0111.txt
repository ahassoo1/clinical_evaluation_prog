DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the slightest idea why my wife insisted I come. Something about…my complexion? I feel perfectly fine, all things considered. Just…tired, I suppose. And my skin looks a bit…darker. Though I haven’t been paying much attention to such trivial matters. Can we please get this over with quickly? I have important things to attend to.
DOCTOR: "Trivial matters," you say. Alright. Well, even 'trivial matters' can sometimes point to something more serious, Mr. Drahota. Your wife’s concern is valid. So, this change in complexion…when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I couldn’t tell you the precise date. Weeks, perhaps? Months? Time blurs, you see. It’s…it’s just a darkening, nothing dramatic. I work outside, reinforcing iron and rebar. The sun, you understand. It’s probably just that. A bit of weathering. Is that all there is to it? Can we move on? I assure you, I am quite robust for my age.
DOCTOR: “Robust” is good, but sun exposure doesn’t typically cause uniform darkening, Mr. Drahota. And it certainly doesn't explain why your wife brought you in. Let's get a better history. Aside from working with iron and rebar, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Goodness. What do you expect me to be looking for? I am eighty-five years old, Doctor. Things change. My appetite…perhaps a little less than it used to be. And I tire easily, as I mentioned. But that's just…age. I haven’t been feeling unwell, if that’s what you’re asking. Honestly, this is rather…unnecessary.
DOCTOR: “Unnecessary” is determined by what we find, Mr. Drahota. Loss of appetite can be significant. Let’s talk about your bowel movements. Have you noticed any changes in their color, consistency, or frequency recently?
PATIENT: Now see here, Doctor. I do not discuss such…personal matters with strangers. Really. I’ve told you I feel tired and my skin is a bit darker. Is that not enough? I assure you, I’ve lived a long and productive life. I doubt a little fatigue and a change in complexion warrants this…interrogation. I believe I’ll be going now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, with all due respect, your wife brought you in because she is concerned. And I am obligated to investigate those concerns, even if you are unwilling to help. We need to rule out anything serious. It's not about an "interrogation", it's about your health. Now, I'm going to ask you one more time, and I need a straight answer. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Absolutely not! Are you suggesting I am…ill? Preposterous. My wife worries too much. She always has. And frankly, I find your line of questioning quite insulting. I have endured hardships you couldn't possibly imagine. A little fatigue is hardly cause for alarm. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Drahota. Since you are refusing to provide a complete history, I'm going to proceed with a physical examination. At the very least, we need to assess your overall condition and rule out any obvious issues. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll start with your vital signs.
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t expect me to be comfortable. And please, be quick about it. I have much more important things to attend to than…being poked and prodded. Honestly, this is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is a little tender in the upper right quadrant. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: A little discomfort, perhaps. But I’ve always had a sensitive stomach. Old age, you know. It comes with the territory. Don’t fuss over it. It’s probably just…gas. I assure you, Doctor, I’ve endured far worse in my life.
DOCTOR: Your sclera is slightly yellowed, Mr. Drahota. And I noticed your skin is quite dry. Have you had any recent changes in your urine color?
PATIENT: My…what now? Urine color? Goodness, Doctor, I don’t spend my days scrutinizing my bodily fluids. It’s probably normal. I drink tea, you know. And it’s been rather hot lately. Perhaps that’s why it's…different. Honestly, you’re asking me to pay attention to things a man of my age shouldn't have to bother with.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, based on my examination, I’m concerned about possible liver dysfunction. Your yellowed eyes and tenderness are concerning. I need to order some blood work, including a complete liver panel and a bilirubin level. We also need to do a urine analysis. And, with all due respect, I strongly recommend an abdominal ultrasound.
PATIENT: An ultrasound? Blood work? Doctor, you’re being ridiculous! I’ve told you, I feel fine. A little tired, perhaps, but perfectly functional. This is all a complete overreaction. Honestly, I’m not sure why my wife even bothered bringing me here. I refuse. Absolutely refuse. I will not be subjected to unnecessary tests and procedures. I’m leaving now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your frustration, but I am obligated to ensure your health and safety. Your wife brought you in because she is worried, and my examination has revealed concerning findings. I cannot, in good conscience, allow you to leave without pursuing these investigations. These tests are not unnecessary; they are essential to rule out potentially serious conditions. I am recommending these tests, and frankly, I strongly advise you to reconsider your refusal. If you continue to refuse, I will document your decision in your medical record and strongly encourage your wife to seek a second opinion. But I will not simply dismiss these findings. Your health is too important.
PATIENT: Fine. Do your tests. But I expect a full explanation of everything, and I expect them to be quick. And don’t expect me to be grateful. This is all a waste of my time, you understand. A complete and utter waste.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Drahota. I’ll have the lab technician draw your blood now, and you can provide a urine sample before you leave. The ultrasound facility is located at 123 Main Street. You’ll need to schedule an appointment. Here’s the referral form. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in, and we’ll discuss them at a follow-up appointment. I'll have my nurse explain the process and give you a copy of the results for your records. I understand this is frustrating, Mr. Drahota, but I assure you, we are doing this for your benefit. And while you may not be grateful now, I hope you’ll be relieved to know if these tests reveal nothing serious. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just…get it over with. And please, don’t bother explaining everything in detail. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I don’t need a lecture on my own mortality. Just…tell me the results when you have them. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Drahota. My nurse will be with you shortly to collect your sample and explain the next steps. And please, try to get some rest. .
