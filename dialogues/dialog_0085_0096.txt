DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's about the sun, really. I've been getting really bothered by it lately. My eyes… and my skin. It feels like I’m extra sensitive, you know? It’s been happening for a few months now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Sensitivity to the sun… and it's been going on for a few months. That’s good information to start with. Could you tell me a little more about what you mean by “bothered”?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, with my eyes, it's like looking at a really bright light all the time, even when it's not that bright. Makes me squint a lot. And my skin… it gets red really easily, even with just a little sun. It doesn't always burn burn, but it's uncomfortable. And it feels… kinda itchy sometimes, the red parts. It's just… more than it used to be, definitely. I used to be able to handle the sun alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased sensitivity in your eyes – causing you to squint – and your skin is getting red more easily, sometimes itchy, even with minimal sun exposure. And this is a change from how you've experienced the sun in the past. That's helpful. Do you notice if this happens even on cloudy days, or just when the sun is directly out?
PATIENT: It happens on cloudy days too, actually. Not as bad, but definitely noticeable. Like, if I’m walking outside and the sun peeks out from behind the clouds for a few seconds, I can feel it. And sometimes, even just being near a window on a bright day, you know? It's weird. I thought maybe it was just the summer, but it started before it got this hot, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s not solely dependent on direct sunlight; it happens even with partial sun and even indoors near windows. And you noticed this starting before the peak of summer. That helps me narrow things down. Have you had any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Let me think… Hmm. Not really, no. No rashes, no fever, no headaches. Just the eyes and the skin. Oh! Actually… I have been a little more tired than usual lately, but I figured that was just… life, you know? Everything's been a bit much since… well, since my wife passed. I didn't really connect it to the sun stuff. But no, nothing specifically related to the sun, not that I've noticed.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Arbin. Loss is incredibly difficult, and fatigue is a very common response. It’s good you’re being mindful of changes in your body, even if they seem unrelated. Let’s get some more information to understand what might be going on with your sun sensitivity. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, like blurry spots or difficulty seeing at night?
PATIENT: No, my vision feels normal. No blurry spots, no trouble seeing at night. Everything looks the same as always, thankfully. I do wear glasses for reading, but that hasn’t changed. And I had my eyes checked last year, everything was fine then. Just the brightness bothers me, you know? It's more uncomfortable than anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No changes in your vision apart from the brightness sensitivity, and your last eye exam was normal. That’s reassuring. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. I take a daily vitamin, just a basic one. And I had a flu shot last year, no problems with that. My wife used to keep track of all that stuff, honestly… But no, I don’t think I have any allergies. I’m pretty good with most things, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just a daily vitamin and a flu shot last year. That's good to know. And you mentioned your wife used to manage your medical records – that's helpful. Do you happen to know if she kept a record of any past illnesses or surgeries you might have had?
PATIENT: She did, yes. She was very organized! Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, that's about it for surgeries. And I had chickenpox as a kid, like everyone else. Nothing major, really. No long-term illnesses, no asthma, no diabetes, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. She had all the details written down, if you need specifics.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal as a teenager, chickenpox as a child, otherwise generally healthy. That’s good information. Now, a slightly sensitive question, but important for understanding potential causes: Is there a family history of any autoimmune conditions – things like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or multiple sclerosis?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Yes, actually. My mother had something… I think it was lupus. She was sick for a long time, and she spent a lot of time at the hospital. It was a long time ago, so I don’t remember all the details. My aunt on my father’s side had something too, maybe rheumatoid arthritis? But it was a long time ago, and we didn’t see them much. I never really paid much attention to it, honestly. It was just… family stuff. But yes, there’s some of that on both sides, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of lupus on your mother’s side and potentially rheumatoid arthritis on your father’s side. That’s very important information, Arbin. Thank you for sharing that. Given your symptoms and your family history, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your skin for any signs of a rash and just do a general assessment. Then, I may want to order some blood tests to help rule out some possible causes. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Dr. Lahn. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever tests you need. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get back to feeling normal, you know? The sun is lovely, but not when it makes me feel like this. Let’s get started.
DOCTOR: Okay. Wonderful. First, let's take a look at your skin. Please loosen your shirt and pants a bit, if you’re comfortable. I'm going to examine your arms, legs, and chest for any signs of a rash, discoloration, or any other abnormalities. I'll also check the skin on your face. I'm not seeing any obvious rashes at this moment, but I do notice some areas of redness on your chest and arms. It’s subtle, but it's there. I’ll document that. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. This will just give me a baseline to work with. Your vital signs are within normal limits. Heart and lungs sound clear. I’m going to need to draw some blood for a few tests, and then we can talk about the results. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Blood tests are fine. I’m used to those, honestly. My wife always made me go for checkups. She was very good about that. Go ahead, whenever you're ready. Let me know if there's anything I need to do. I'm happy to cooperate with whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Okay. Wonderful. We'll be drawing a standard metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a few tests to check for autoimmune markers – things like ANA and anti-inflammatory markers. These will help us rule out certain conditions and get a better understanding of what might be causing your symptoms. It'll just be a few vials, and it shouldn’t take long. Please sit comfortably, and try to relax your arm. Alright, all done. Just need to apply a little pressure here for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. I'll give you a bandage. Once that's secured, you can move your arm around normally. We should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding direct sun exposure as much as possible and wearing protective clothing and sunscreen when you do go outside. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up for today?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything really well, Dr. Lahn. Avoiding the sun makes sense. It's just been getting harder and harder to do. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and doing all the tests. I’ll wait for your call with the results. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Okay. You're very welcome, Arbin. I’m glad I could help. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available, usually within 3-5 business days. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – for example, if you develop a fever, a severe rash, or difficulty breathing – please don't hesitate to contact us immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Here's a copy of the lab request form for your records. It lists all the tests we're ordering. I hope you have a good day, and please take care. And again, thank you for coming in. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Lahn. You too. I appreciate everything. I will definitely take care. And I'll be sure to call if anything changes. Bye now.
