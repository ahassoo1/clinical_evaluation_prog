DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s… a social visit, I suppose. My husband and I just moved here, you see. New area. Something about insurance, Medicare, I believe? Honestly, the paperwork… it's simply dreadful. I’d just like to get it over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: I understand, Candice. Moving can be stressful enough without the paperwork! And Medicare can be… complicated. We can definitely get everything sorted out for you today. Just to confirm, you are here primarily to establish care with our clinic and ensure your insurance is properly updated, is that correct?
PATIENT: Establish care? Goodness, I suppose. Though I haven’t been sick sick in years. It's more about… proper procedure. And yes, the insurance. Really, it's the principle of the thing. One shouldn’t have to jump through hoops just to have things in order. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I completely agree. It shouldn’t be this difficult. We’ll get through it as efficiently as possible. To help me with that, I’d like to gather some basic information. We'll start with your medical history. Have you been seeing another doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, doctors… yes, I had a doctor back in… well, it was a very large city, you see. But truthfully, I rarely needed him. A bit of a fussbudget, really. I can’t recall his name, and it’s hardly relevant now, is it? I’ve always been quite healthy, you know. Strong constitution. Are we quite finished with this line of questioning?
DOCTOR: Alright, no primary care physician recently. That’s perfectly fine. Just to be thorough, have you been hospitalized or had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hospital? Oh, goodness. Years ago, when I was a young woman… appendix, I believe. But that was… well, a very long time ago. And a minor thing, really. Not worth detailing, I assure you. Surgeries… perhaps a tonsillectomy? I truly couldn’t say. It was… decades ago. Are we nearing the end of this, Doctor? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Almost, Candice. Just a few more questions, and then we can move on to the insurance paperwork. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I eat everything. I’ve always had a very robust appetite. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to… shellfish? But I simply avoid it. It's rather common, isn't it? Really, I think I've answered quite enough personal questions for one morning. Let's focus on this insurance matter, shall we? It's what I came here for.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Very good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or vitamins?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, honestly. Just a small dose of… something for my joints, perhaps? It's not terribly important. The name escapes me. And a multivitamin, of course. Every sensible woman takes a multivitamin. Honestly, Doctor, is this truly necessary? I feel perfectly well. Let’s simply move on to the paperwork. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candice. However, it's important for me to have a complete picture of your health, even if you feel well. Knowing what medications you're taking helps me avoid potential interactions. To clarify, can you describe the medication for your joints?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor. It's a small, white pill. I believe my previous doctor prescribed it. Something for… stiffness, perhaps? It’s not terribly potent. My husband handles the refills, so I wouldn't know the proper name if you paid me. Honestly, this is becoming quite tedious. Is there not a form I can simply sign? I assure you, I am in excellent health for my age.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. I understand you're not comfortable with the specifics. We can proceed with that in mind. However, I would like to do a brief physical exam just to get a baseline, if you don’t mind. It will be quick. Just checking your blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I did not come here to be poked and prodded. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. This is… this is simply unacceptable. I came here for administrative purposes, to sort out this insurance nonsense. Not to be subjected to… examinations. I think I’ll just… I think I’ll just take my leave. This has been… most unsatisfactory.
DOCTOR: Candice, I understand your hesitation. However, as your new physician, I have a responsibility to ensure your health and wellbeing. Even a brief exam can identify potential issues before they become serious. If you are unwilling to allow a basic assessment, I am afraid I cannot establish care with you. I can provide you with a list of other physicians in the area. I understand this isn’t what you wanted, but I must prioritize your health. Perhaps we can revisit this at another time if you reconsider.
PATIENT: I see. So, you're refusing to simply process my insurance? All this fuss over a simple administrative matter! Honestly, the audacity. Very well. I'll find a doctor who understands the meaning of efficiency. This has been a complete waste of my time. .
