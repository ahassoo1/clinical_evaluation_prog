DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Squiers. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise next month, and the cruise line needs some medical information from a doctor. Just a standard thing, I believe. They sent a form, and it needs to be filled out and signed.
DOCTOR: A cruise, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A ten-day trip around the Caribbean. It’s a bit of a dream come true, actually. My husband and I always talked about going, but… well, never mind that now. I just want to make sure I’ve got everything sorted for the cruise line. They were quite specific about needing a doctor’s approval, you see.
DOCTOR: Specific, you say. Well, “specific” is often a euphemism for unnecessary paperwork. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a girl, that was… 1982, I believe. And I’ve always had slightly high blood pressure, but it’s generally well-controlled with a small tablet each day. Nothing dramatic, you understand. Just… something the doctor keeps an eye on. I do occasionally get a bit of trouble with my knees, particularly when the weather’s damp, but that's probably just old age creeping up on me!
DOCTOR: "Old age," as you put it, is a progressive process, Ms. Squiers. The appendectomy is noted. And this blood pressure… what medication are you currently taking for that?
PATIENT: It's called… Lisinopril, I think. A small white tablet, ten milligrams, once a day. I get it from the chemist just around the corner, and it seems to do the trick. My usual doctor – Dr. MacIntyre – checks it regularly when I have my annual check-up. He's a very good man, you see. Very thorough. I’ve been with him for twenty years now, at least.
DOCTOR: Very well. And aside from the blood pressure and a decades-old appendectomy, are you experiencing any current symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. I feel perfectly well, thank you. I’m very active, I do a lot of walking, and I'm quite particular about my diet. I'm just trying to be cautious, you see. The cruise line made it very clear they needed a full medical assessment. I wouldn't want anything to spoil the trip!
DOCTOR: "Perfectly well" is a subjective assessment, Ms. Squiers. Let’s proceed with a brief examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just let me know. I suppose it's best to be thorough, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Indeed. If you’ll please step onto the table. We'll start with your vital signs. Blood pressure, pulse, respiration... standard procedure. And then a quick auscultation of your heart and lungs. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to be quite a clumsy child and ended up with a lot of scrapes and bruises, but nothing more serious than that! I’ll happily step onto the table now. Just let me know if I need to remove anything.
DOCTOR: No need to remove any clothing at this time. Just relax your arm. 140 over 88. Not ideal, but not alarming. Pulse is 72, regular. Respiration… normal. Lungs clear. Heart… unremarkable. Any recent weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. I’ve always been… comfortably built, you might say. I maintain a fairly steady weight. Perhaps a pound or two either way depending on the time of year, but nothing significant. I haven't been feeling unwell enough to lose any weight, that’s for certain! Is everything alright, Doctor? You seem… preoccupied.
DOCTOR: I am merely efficient, Ms. Squiers. Now, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your ankles recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. My ankles are perfectly fine, thank you for asking. I do a lot of walking, as I mentioned, and that keeps everything moving. And no chest pain, thankfully. I've never had any heart trouble in the family, as far as I know. I’m very fortunate, you see. Is this all standard procedure, Doctor? I'm just trying to understand why you’re asking so many questions. The cruise line didn’t mention anything this thorough.
DOCTOR: The cruise line's requirements and my professional obligations are not necessarily aligned, Ms. Squiers. I am attempting to ascertain your overall health status to ensure you are fit for travel. Now, let's move on. Any recent changes in bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a rather personal question, isn’t it, Doctor? I mean, everything is… regular, shall we say? Nothing out of the ordinary. I eat a lot of fruit, which helps, you see. I’m not entirely sure what that has to do with a cruise around the Caribbean, Doctor. Is there something you're particularly concerned about?
DOCTOR: It is standard medical questioning, Ms. Squiers. I assure you, it is relevant. We are establishing a baseline. Now, any history of diabetes or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No diabetes, thank you. And my cholesterol is… well, Dr. MacIntyre checks it every year. He says it’s a little high, but nothing to worry about. He suggests I eat more oily fish, which I try to do. I’m not very keen on mackerel, though. Is this all going on my record, Doctor? I’m just a little concerned, you see. I’ve never had such a thorough examination for a simple cruise form before.
DOCTOR: Everything is documented, Ms. Squiers. As it should be. Now, are you currently taking any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a small multivitamin, Doctor, once a day with my breakfast. And sometimes, when my knees are playing up, I take some ibuprofen. Just when they’re particularly sore, you understand. Nothing regular. Just as needed. And I occasionally take a paracetamol if I have a headache. Is that alright, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, Ms. Squiers, I've documented your medical history. Based on my assessment – and frankly, your insistence that you are in perfect health despite some minor inconsistencies – I deem you fit for travel. However, I strongly advise you to continue monitoring your blood pressure and to consult a physician if you experience any unusual symptoms during your trip. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful, Doctor! Thank you so much. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you for being so thorough. I feel much more reassured now. Will I get a copy of the form for my records, Doctor? And… do I need to pay anything?
DOCTOR: The form is yours, Ms. Squiers. As for payment... the consultation fee is £85, payable at reception. I trust you have a pleasant voyage. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. £85. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you again for everything. I appreciate your time and your thoroughness. Have a good day, Doctor! .
