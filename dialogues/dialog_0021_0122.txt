DOCTOR: Alright, Venus. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Havird. It is…difficult to explain precisely. I find I am…forgetting things. Small things, mostly. But more often now. And my blood pressure… it has been quite high, the nurse checked it, yes? It worries me.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness, you say. Well, many things can cause that. Stress, lack of sleep… It’s not always something serious. And the nurse does tend to get overly excited about blood pressure readings, honestly. But we’ll take a look. How long has this been going on, the…forgetfulness?
PATIENT: Perhaps six months? It is hard to say exactly. At first, it was just…misplacing keys, forgetting a name. Now…I repeat myself sometimes. Or I go into a room and…cannot recall why I went there. It is unsettling. And I am…a widow, Doctor. My husband, he… passed three years ago. I manage properties, many people depend on me. I need to remember things.
DOCTOR: A widow, yes. Properties… stressful work. Alright. So, six months of increasing forgetfulness. And you said you repeat yourself?
PATIENT: Yes. It is…embarrassing, truly. I will be speaking with someone about a payment, and I find I have already told them the amount. Or I ask my assistant the same question twice within minutes. Small things, but… frequent. My blood pressure is usually well-controlled, with medication, but lately, even with the pills, it is very high. Perhaps it is connected?
DOCTOR: It could be connected, or it could be entirely separate. High blood pressure isn't exactly uncommon, especially with stress. Let's go through some basics, just to be thorough. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… not really. Perhaps a little…tiredness. But I attribute that to the work, and…the loneliness. No headaches, no dizziness. I sleep…adequately. I eat…well, I try to. I do not drink, and I have never smoked. My vision is…fine, I think. I had it checked last year. It is the memory that is the real problem. I worry it is something…serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. No headaches, no dizziness… adequate sleep. And you had your vision checked last year, good. Let’s talk about medications. What are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Let me see… for my blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, twenty milligrams, once daily. And…Amlodipine, five milligrams, also once daily. I also take a small dose of Atorvastatin for cholesterol, forty milligrams. And… occasionally, ibuprofen for my joints, but not often. I take them as prescribed, Doctor. Always.
DOCTOR: And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I have taken many medications over the years for various things, but never a reaction. I am quite careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your history and what you've told me, we'll need to do a quick physical exam and perhaps some blood work. Just to rule things out. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a brief neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds…sensible. Whatever is necessary to determine the cause. I understand. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Good. If you could just lie down for me?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are… regular, but a little fast. Pulse is strong and equal in both arms. Blood pressure is 160/95, which is elevated, even with medication. Respiration is normal. Reflexes are…normal. A little brisk, perhaps, but within normal limits. Now, let’s do a brief cognitive assessment, just to get a baseline. I'm going to ask you a few simple questions. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today is… August 2nd, 2025. Yes, August 2nd. It is a Sunday, is it not? I believe so.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right, it is Sunday. And can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: We are… in your office, Doctor. At… Havird Clinic. In the…suburbs, I believe. I have been here before, with the nurse. Is something wrong? I am remembering correctly, yes?
DOCTOR: No, no, you're remembering perfectly. Just establishing a baseline. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words. Listen carefully: Apple, Table, Penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. Yes. Those were the words? Apple, Table, Penny. I believe I have them.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to ask you to subtract seven from one hundred, and keep subtracting seven each time. Let's see how far you can get.
PATIENT: One hundred… ninety-three… eighty-six… seventy-nine… seventy-two… sixty-five… fifty-eight… fifty-one… forty-four… thirty-seven… thirty… twenty-three… sixteen… nine… two… negative five… No, wait. Negative five is incorrect. It is difficult. I apologize. I believe that is as far as I can go. My concentration… is not what it once was.
DOCTOR: That's alright. That’s perfectly fine. Now, let's talk about your family history. Has anyone in your family suffered from memory loss or dementia?
PATIENT: Yes. My mother… she developed something the doctors called Alzheimer’s. It was…very difficult. She did not recognize anyone in the last years. It began slowly, with forgetfulness, and then… progressed. My grandmother, on my father’s side, also had similar issues, though they did not diagnose it at the time. They simply said she “lost her mind” with age. It is… a worrying thought.
DOCTOR: I see. And you said your husband passed away three years ago?
PATIENT: Yes. Three years last November. He was…a good man. He passed away suddenly, a heart attack. It was…a shock. I still miss him terribly. We had a long marriage, many years together.
DOCTOR: I understand. Grief can certainly affect memory and concentration, even after a long time. However, given your family history and the increasing nature of your forgetfulness, I think it's important to rule out other potential causes. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin B12 level. I also want to order an MRI of your brain, just to get a clearer picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever is necessary to determine the cause. I trust your judgment. An MRI… is that uncomfortable? I have never had one before. But if you believe it is necessary, then I will do it. I want to know what is happening, and what can be done. It is… frightening to feel one’s mind slipping away.
DOCTOR: The MRI is non-invasive, meaning we don't need to insert anything into your body. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it will take some images of your brain. It can be a little noisy, and you'll need to lie very still for about thirty to forty minutes. We will give you earplugs and instructions beforehand. The main thing is to try and relax. We'll send the results to you as soon as they're available, and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail.
