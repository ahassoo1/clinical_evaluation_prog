DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Honestly, it's about this… tiredness. It’s just getting worse, and it’s… embarrassing, really. And this other thing. I don’t even want to talk about it, but here I am. It’s just… I’ve been eating dirt. Plain dirt. Don’t look at me like that.
DOCTOR: Eating… dirt?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt! Clay, specifically. Red clay from my garden. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it started a few months ago. Just a little bit at first, a tiny taste. Now... well, now it's more than a taste. I can’t really explain it. It just... feels good going down, if you can believe that. Don’t tell me I’m crazy. It’s not like I want to eat dirt!
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, while I appreciate your… candor, this is highly unusual. And frankly, concerning. Let’s start with the tiredness. When did this begin?
PATIENT: Oh, concerning? Well, I’m concerned about having to tell a doctor I eat dirt! But fine. The tiredness… hmm. It started last fall, I think. Around October, maybe November. It’s been slowly getting worse ever since. I just thought I was getting old. You know, slowing down. But it’s not just that. It’s… heavy. Like I’m dragging weights around all day. And even sleeping doesn’t help.
DOCTOR: And has this tiredness interfered with your daily activities, Ms. Hardenburgh?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes! I used to be very active. Volunteered at the library, gardened, kept the house spotless. Now? Now I mostly sit. Can barely manage to get the groceries done, and even then I have to take breaks halfway through. I'm a physical therapist aide, Doctor! It's... humiliating, really. I can’t even keep up with the simple tasks at work anymore. I just tell them I'm not feeling well. They think I’m getting the flu all the time.
DOCTOR: And you mentioned this started around the same time as… the dirt consumption?
PATIENT: Well, no, not exactly. The tiredness came first, like I said. Maybe a month or two after that, I started… craving it. It was just a little bit at first, after I was gardening, you know? A little taste of the soil. Then it got… more frequent. I don't even garden as much anymore, but I still find myself… wanting it. It’s just… hard to explain. It's not like I'm hungry for it. It's more of a… need. A silly, awful need.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the tiredness and… this unusual habit?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t start with the “unusual habit” again. It’s embarrassing enough as it is! Let me think… well, I’ve been a little constipated, if you must know. And my stomach has been… unsettled. Not really pain, just… queasy. And sometimes I get these little… dizzy spells. Nothing major, just a quick wobble. But they’re happening more often now. Does that help? Honestly, I just feel… off. Everything feels wrong. And I’m tired. Very, very tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness no. I’m as healthy as a horse, or was before all this. No allergies. Never had any. I eat everything. Well, except for… you know. Don’t remind me. Honestly, you're making me feel worse just talking about this. Can we just… figure out what’s wrong so I can stop eating dirt? It’s ridiculous!
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little vitamin D in the winter. For the bones, you know? And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, when they bother me. That’s it. Nothing fancy. Don’t go looking for some complicated answer. I’m a simple woman with a simple problem… a very embarrassing simple problem. I just want to feel normal again. And stop craving dirt! Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had the flu once, a long time ago. And I broke my wrist when I was a child. Nothing serious. Oh! And I had high blood pressure for a little while, but it went down when I lost a few pounds. That was years ago. That’s about it. I’ve always been a pretty healthy person, really. Until… well, you know. Is there anything else you need to know? This is taking a long time, and frankly, I have errands to run. And I’m starting to feel… well, you can imagine.
DOCTOR: And has anyone in your family had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. My mother had arthritis, and she was always complaining about her bones. And my father… he had heart trouble, I think. He passed away when I was young, so I don’t remember much. And my sister… she’s perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Always bragging about her perfect health. Honestly, I don't keep up with all that family medical stuff. It's a bit of a mess, to be frank. Is this important? It feels like you're fishing for something, and I'm not sure what.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, regarding your social history, Ms. Hardenburgh. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Do I look like someone who smokes or drinks? I’m a respectable woman! Never touched a cigarette or a drop of alcohol in my life. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. Honestly, Doctor, I volunteer at the library. Do you really think I’m hiding some secret life from you? This is getting ridiculous. I just want to know why I’m tired and why I’m eating dirt!
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's proceed with a physical exam. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your abdomen. And please, try to refrain from mentioning the… soil, during the examination. It’s… distracting.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. And try not to judge. It’s not like I choose to eat dirt. Honestly, it's… upsetting. Hurry it up, please. I have things to do. And I’d really rather not talk about it anymore.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is slightly elevated, and I detect a mild murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, but I note some tenderness in the lower quadrants. Blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg. I’ll need to repeat that measurement shortly. Pulse is 88 beats per minute. Your reflexes are within normal limits. However, your skin appears slightly pale. We’ll need to run some blood work to determine the cause of your fatigue and assess your overall health. It’s likely we’ll also need to check your iron levels.
PATIENT: Oh, iron levels? That’s what it is, isn’t it? I knew it! I’ve always been a bit anemic. My mother was the same way. Fine, do your tests. Just hurry up and find out what's wrong so I can get back to my life. And please, don't ask me about the dirt again. It's… humiliating. And frankly, it’s not helping. I'm already embarrassed enough. Can we just skip to the part where you tell me what's wrong and how to fix it?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hardenburgh. I will order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a ferritin level. We'll also need to test your vitamin D levels. While we await the results, I recommend increasing your intake of iron-rich foods, such as lean meats, leafy green vegetables, and fortified cereals. And I strongly advise against consuming… soil. It poses a significant health risk, and it’s unlikely to address the underlying cause of your fatigue. The laboratory results should be available within 48 hours. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them at that time. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just get me out of here. I’ll try to eat more… spinach, or whatever. And I’ll try to stop eating dirt. Happy now? Just send me the results when they’re ready. And please, don't make me come back if I don’t see any improvement. I have a life to live, you know. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The results will be sent to you via mail. Should you experience any worsening of symptoms, or develop a fever, please seek immediate medical attention. Have a good day, Ms. Hardenburgh. .
