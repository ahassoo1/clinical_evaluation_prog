DOCTOR: Hi Nicky, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good to meet you too, Doctor. Though, frankly, I've seen better offices. Anyway, it’s this bruising. It’s… excessive. I’m on that blood thinner, you see, and normally a little bump isn’t a big deal. But lately… it’s like a child’s got ahold of a paintbrush.
DOCTOR: Hmm, excessive bruising, especially with being on a blood thinner… that’s definitely something we want to look into. You said “lately”?
PATIENT: Yes, “lately.” About… oh, three weeks, maybe? It started subtly, just a little more color than usual with a scrape. Now? I knocked my elbow on the doorframe – barely – and it looked like someone had attacked me with a plum. It’s quite concerning, really. I do pay attention to these things, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks… and it’s been progressively getting worse, even with minor injuries. And you said you do pay attention to these things, which is good. That helps a lot. Now, just to get a clearer picture, has this bruising been happening all over, or is it mostly focused on certain areas?
PATIENT: Mostly on my arms and legs, to be honest. A bit on my torso too, but not nearly as bad. And it’s not like I’m walking into walls, Doctor. I’m a reasonably careful man. It’s… perplexing. And, frankly, a bit frightening. I mean, what if it’s something serious?
DOCTOR: Right, mostly arms and legs, some on the torso… and you haven't had any significant trauma that would explain it. I understand your concern, and it's good you're bringing this up. It is important to figure out what's going on. Before we get into any testing, let's do a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. I see here you’re on Medicare, which is helpful. Do you recall any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Oh, Medicare is perfectly adequate, thank you very much. And conditions… well, my wife, God rest her soul, always said I was a perfectly healthy specimen. I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, nothing serious, cleared up with antibiotics. And my blood pressure gets a little high sometimes, but I manage it with… a small pill. Can’t remember the name, to be honest. It’s the bruising I’m worried about, not some minor ailment.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia a few years ago, and managed hypertension. That's good to know. And you're right, we'll focus on the bruising. It's just part of gathering information. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… Yes. Appendectomy when I was a boy. And… a hernia repair, maybe fifteen years ago? Something like that. It was a very simple procedure, all done outpatient. I don't recall any complications from either one. Really, I've been quite fortunate in terms of major medical issues. It's this bruising that’s thrown me for a loop.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and hernia repair, no complications. That’s good. Now, thinking about your family… is there any history of bleeding disorders in your family?
PATIENT: Bleeding disorders? Goodness, no. My family was… robust. Farmers, mostly. Tough stock. We broke bones, we got cuts, but no one ever… bled excessively. My mother used to say we all healed like Wolverine. No, Doctor, no history of bleeding issues. Which is why this is so… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Right, no family history of bleeding disorders. Okay. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood thinner and the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… Besides the blood thinner… and the pill… Well, I take a multivitamin, of course. And a little something for my… digestive system. Gets a bit sluggish, you know. It's… a brown pill, I believe. Small one. I get it at the pharmacy. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not one for keeping track of pills. I leave that to my… well, I used to leave that to my wife. It’s the blood thinner that’s the main thing, surely.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin, something for digestion, and the blood thinner is the primary medication. We'll focus on that. And just one last quick question before we move on to a physical exam – do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I’m aware of. I’ve always been a remarkably resilient man. Never even had poison ivy. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect this is simply a side effect of the blood thinner. It’s a rather strong medication, isn’t it? Perhaps the dosage is too high?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. It could be a side effect of the blood thinner, and we'll definitely explore that possibility. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just checking your vitals, listening to your heart and lungs, and taking a closer look at the bruising. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Get it over with, I say. The sooner we figure this out, the better. Though, I must say, I do have rather sensitive skin. Be gentle, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to check your pulse. Normal rate and rhythm. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 88. Nothing alarming, but we should keep an eye on it. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. And now, let’s take a closer look at these bruises. These bruises do appear a bit larger and deeper than I would expect from minor trauma, even with being on a blood thinner. Do they feel painful?
PATIENT: Yes, they are rather painful. Not excruciating, but… a dull ache. Especially when I move them. And, frankly, they seem to be getting worse even without any new injuries. It's unsettling, Doctor. I’ve never experienced anything like it. It feels… deeper than just a surface bruise, if that makes sense. More like… a contusion.
DOCTOR: You're right, they do feel deeper than a typical surface bruise. And the fact that they're worsening without further trauma is concerning. Given your history and the physical exam findings, I’d like to order a few blood tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’ll check your complete blood count to see if there are any abnormalities in your blood cells, a coagulation panel to assess your blood’s ability to clot, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, alright. As long as it gets us closer to an answer. I suppose it’s necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… please don’t keep me waiting too long for the results. I have… things to do. And this uncertainty is… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your concern, and I'll get those tests ordered right away. The lab should be able to process them fairly quickly. I'd estimate we should have the results back within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you avoid any activities that could cause further injury or bleeding. And if you notice any new or unusual bleeding – such as blood in your stool or urine, or excessive nosebleeds – please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… get the tests done quickly, please. And… is there anything I can do in the meantime? Perhaps a cream or something to alleviate the pain? Though, I doubt it will do much good. I’m used to… enduring. Just please, Doctor, find out what's causing this. It’s… unsettling. I’ve lived a long life, and I don’t want it to be cut short by something… inexplicable.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll get to the bottom of this. Unfortunately, there isn’t a cream or topical treatment that will significantly help with bruising related to a blood thinner or underlying clotting issue. For the pain, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen, but please avoid ibuprofen or naproxen, as they can interfere with blood clotting. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood now, and we’ll call you as soon as the results are back. In the meantime, if anything changes or you feel worse, please don’t hesitate to contact us. Thank you for coming in today, Nicky. We’ll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… attention to the matter. I’ll await your call.
