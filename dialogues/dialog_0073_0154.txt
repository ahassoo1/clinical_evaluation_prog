DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my water. My water keeps giving me trouble. It feels… bad. I keep getting sick, you see. I don’t… I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s been happening a while now. I just want it to stop, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: "Bad," you say. Could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Oh dear… well, it burns, mostly. When I… when I go to the bathroom. And it feels like I need to go all the time, even when there's not much to go, if you understand. It's just… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. I've tried drinking more water, I think… or maybe it was less? Oh, honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. Burning with urination, and frequent urges… I see. And you mentioned this has been going on for “a while now”. Do you recall if anything specific seemed to trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger it? Oh, goodness… that’s a good question. No, not really. Nothing that I can recall. I travel a bit in my RV… maybe it was the water in the RV? Though I always use a filter. Or… perhaps it was after I got divorced? That was… some time ago now. Everything feels a bit jumbled, honestly. I really don't know what caused it.
DOCTOR: Travel in an RV, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I enjoy it very much, when my water allows! I go to different campgrounds, see the country. Though, like I said, it's been difficult lately, with… this. It's hard to enjoy anything when you're worried about… well, you know. Always needing to find a bathroom.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be clear, is this only when you're traveling, or does this happen when you are at home as well?
PATIENT: Oh, it happens at home, too, Doctor. Definitely at home. It doesn't… it doesn't matter where I am, really. That’s why I came. I just… I thought maybe it was something I was drinking, or some place I was visiting. But it seems to follow me. It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's take a look at your records here... It appears you haven't had a full physical in several years. And I don't see any recent urine tests. We’ll need to do a urinalysis to start. And I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A test… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Diabetes? No, I don’t think so. I’ve never been told I had that. Though my mother… she had something with her sugar, I believe. But me? No, not that I know of. I get a little tired sometimes, but everyone gets tired, don’t they?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about kidney problems?
PATIENT: Kidney problems? Oh dear, I really don't know. No one has ever told me I had trouble with my kidneys. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t even know what it feels like to have kidney problems! I just know my water isn’t right. Is that what kidney problems cause?
DOCTOR: Sometimes. Alright. Have you ever had a urinary tract infection, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Oh… now that you mention it… I think so. Years ago, maybe? I remember being very sick, and the doctor gave me… pink medicine. A lot of it. I had to drink lots of water with it. But that was a long time ago. I don’t recall much else, honestly. It seems like a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh my. Well, Doctor… that's a… personal question. I am divorced, as I mentioned. I haven’t been… with anyone for quite some time, no. Not at all. It’s been many years.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've taken… all sorts of things over the years. Pain pills, cold medicine… the pink stuff for my water, like I said. I don't remember having any reactions. Though, sometimes I get a little drowsy, but that’s probably just old age, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease. I’m going to need to examine you. I’ll need a urine sample first. We’ll start with that, and then I’ll check your abdomen. It’s just a quick exam, to start. Do you have any difficulty walking?
PATIENT: Oh. An examination… alright, Doctor. Whatever you need. I can walk, yes. Though my knees sometimes ache. Old age, you see. But I can walk. Just a bit slowly sometimes. And the pink medicine… is that what you’ll use? It didn’t taste very good.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Wease, not the pink medicine. Just a simple urine sample first. There’s a cup in the bathroom. Try to collect a mid-stream sample, if you can. I'll be right outside when you're finished.
PATIENT: Oh, a cup… alright. Mid-stream? Oh dear. I’ll try my best, Doctor. It's been a while since I’ve had to… do any of this properly. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. Wease.
PATIENT: .
