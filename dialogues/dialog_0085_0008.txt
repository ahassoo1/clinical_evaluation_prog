DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Yes, hello Doctor. It's… my ear, I think. It feels blocked. Full, you know? It’s been… a while now. Honestly, I can’t really say how long. Things aren’t what they used to be, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It can be frustrating when symptoms develop gradually. “A while now” is okay, we’ll try to narrow it down. So, it feels blocked and full – is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Um… mostly constant, I think. There are days it’s… less bad? But it never really goes away. It’s just… there. Makes it hard to hear sometimes, especially… well, everything. Not sure if it’s just getting old, to be honest. My wife… she always handled these things.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like it’s significantly affecting your hearing, which is definitely something we want to address. And it’s perfectly alright to not have exact dates when things started – we'll figure it out. Do you notice any pain with it?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not really. Just… pressure. Like when you go up really high in a plane, you know? That feeling. It’s not sharp or anything. More… annoying, if that makes sense. Just… there. I mostly just want it to stop being there.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know – pressure, not pain. And “annoying” is a perfectly valid way to describe it! Do you have any ringing in your ear, or any dizziness or balance problems associated with it?
PATIENT: Ringing… sometimes. Very faint. Hard to say if it’s actually in my ear or just… in my head, you know? Old age again, probably. And no, no dizziness. Balance is… alright. I fall over sometimes, but that’s just me being clumsy. Not related to the ear, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, faint ringing, potentially, and no dizziness. Good to know. Have you noticed any discharge from the ear, or any changes in your hearing besides it just feeling blocked?
PATIENT: No, no discharge. Nothing coming out, thankfully. And… changes in hearing… I just can't hear as well as I used to, generally. Everything sounds… muffled. Like someone’s talking through a pillow. Is that a change? I suppose it is. It’s just… gradual, you know? It's hard to pinpoint. My wife… she used to notice these things.
DOCTOR: It is a change, and a gradual one is still a change we need to investigate. I’m sorry for your loss, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It sounds like you’re still adjusting. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don’t mind. Have you had any ear infections in the past?
PATIENT: Oh. Thank you. Yes. It has been a while. Ear infections… hmm. When I was a boy, maybe? I had a bad one once, I think. But that was… a long time ago. I really don't remember much about it. Lots of pain, I think. But that was… sixty years ago? I’ve had the usual things, colds and flu, but nothing specific with my ears since then. My doctor… he always handled all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a childhood ear infection, but nothing recent. And you've had the typical colds and flu. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. The doctor always said I had… a touch of high blood pressure. Nothing serious, he said. Just needed to watch my salt. And… I think he mentioned cholesterol once. But I don't take anything for it. Honestly, Doctor, I forget half the things he told me. It's just… gone. I have private insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That's alright, we can review everything. Knowing about the high blood pressure is good. And yes, the insurance information is helpful. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… a bit of aspirin now and then, for aches and pains. But it's not regular. Maybe once a month? And… sometimes a little something for my stomach, but that's also rare. My wife… she kept track of all that. I just… take what I need, when I need it. I'm sorry, I'm not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You’re doing just fine, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It's perfectly common to not remember these details, especially after a loss. Let’s do a quick examination of your ears now. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Get on with it, if you want. I just want it to stop. The fullness, you know? It's been… a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, I’m looking at your ears now. Your ear canals appear clear, no obvious signs of infection or blockage. Your eardrums… they’re a little dull, and I can’t see much movement behind them when I puff air in. This could indicate fluid in the middle ear. It’s not a dramatic amount, but it’s enough to explain some of the fullness and hearing difficulty you’re experiencing. I’m also noting some age-related changes to the ear drum, which is normal. Do you feel any discomfort when I do this?
PATIENT: No, no discomfort. Not really. Just… pressure, like you said. It's the usual. That puff of air… feels like when you go up in a plane. It doesn’t hurt, just… unsettling. I think that’s what it feels like all the time, actually. That pressure. Is it bad? Should I be worried? My wife… she would have known what to ask.
DOCTOR: No, it's not necessarily bad, Mr. Guerrerolopez, but it’s definitely something we want to address. The feeling of pressure is consistent with fluid in the middle ear. The lack of movement behind the eardrum also suggests this. It could be caused by a number of things – a mild infection, Eustachian tube dysfunction, or even just age-related changes. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to recommend a tympanometry test. It’s a quick, painless test that measures how well your middle ear is functioning and can confirm if there is fluid present. Would you be willing to do that today?
PATIENT: A… tympanometry test? Is it… complicated? I don't like too many tests, Doctor. I just want it fixed. But… if it's quick, and painless, I suppose. My wife… she always said to get a second opinion. But she’s… gone now. So, if you think it’s necessary, yes. Let’s just get it over with. The quicker the better, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It's very quick and painless – it involves placing a small probe into your ear canal and measuring the pressure. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. I’ll have Sarah here perform the test for you now. She'll explain everything as she goes. I'll be reviewing your chart while you’re doing that, and we can discuss the results as soon as she's finished. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Just… don’t take too long. It’s… unnerving, you know? Having things poked and prodded. But… if it gets me closer to being fixed, then yes. Let's just… get on with it. Tell Sarah to be gentle, will you?
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll let Sarah know to be very gentle. I’ll also be right here if you need anything at all. Sarah, could you please perform tympanometry on Mr. Guerrerolopez?
