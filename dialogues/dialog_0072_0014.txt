DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Limtiaco is fine, please. Um... well, it’s about some papers, I think. My wife, she said something about needing… forms? For work, maybe? It’s a bit fuzzy, honestly. Something about being… off work? I handle a lot of things for the church, you see, and it all gets jumbled sometimes. I believe it has something to do with me not feeling quite myself lately.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re here regarding paperwork, potentially related to a leave of absence from work, and you’re experiencing some… general unwellness?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. “Unwellness”... that’s a good way to put it. It’s not… a specific thing, you understand? Just… tired. And a little… lost in my thoughts, if that makes sense. It's been going on for a little while now, and my wife, bless her heart, thought these papers were needed. She does all the good organizing, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s try to be a bit more specific, Mr. Limtiaco. When you say “tired,” can you describe that?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, it’s not just sleepy, you understand? It's… a weight. Like carrying something heavy all the time. Even after a full night’s sleep, I wake up feeling… drained. And it’s not just physical, if that makes sense. My mind feels… slow. Like trying to wade through water. I used to be so sharp with the church finances, you know? Now… now it takes me longer to focus. I have trouble remembering things too, which is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand. A persistent feeling of fatigue, coupled with cognitive difficulties... difficulty with concentration and memory. And this has been going on for some time, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, quite some time. Months, at least. It's… come and gone in waves, you see? Some days are better than others, but it keeps coming back. My wife says I’ve been more… withdrawn, too. Not as quick to smile, I suppose. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like I’m sad, exactly. Just… distant. Does that make any sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s… becoming clearer, Mr. Limtiaco. But we need to establish a more complete picture. Let’s move on to a brief review of your overall health. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. Let me think… I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I don’t… I don’t think I have anything specific. My blood pressure was a little high a few years back, I think, but it seemed to come down on its own. And I had a bit of trouble with my knee a while back, but it's mostly okay now. I really can’t recall anything… major. My wife handles the doctor appointments, you see. She'd know better than me.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think I had my tonsils out when I was a boy. A long, long time ago. And… maybe an appendix? But it was so long ago, I barely remember. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is… not what it used to be. I'm sorry. It's frustrating for me too, trying to recall all this. I really do depend on my wife for these things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh… family history. Hmm. My father… he lived to be a very old man, thankfully. But I believe he had some trouble with his heart later in life. My mother… she passed away when I was young, so I don’t recall much about her health. And I had… a brother, I think, who had some trouble with his… his blood sugar? But that was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to him, you see. It's all a bit… hazy, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. And currently, are you taking any medications, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just a little something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. My wife keeps track of it, really. She’s the one who reminds me to take it each morning. I couldn’t tell you the name of it, if you asked. And… sometimes, when my knee acts up, I take something over the counter. Just ibuprofen, I believe. Nothing regular, really.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, no. I've never really had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I enjoy a good tropical fruit, you see. Mangoes, papayas… all sorts of things. My wife says I should be careful with shellfish, but I haven't had any trouble with it. I really don’t think I have any allergies. It’s one of the few things I am certain of, actually!
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Limtiaco, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a basic neurological assessment. Do you consent to this examination?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course! Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment completely. A physical examination sounds… sensible. Yes, please. I’m ready whenever you are. I just hope I can remember what you tell me afterwards!
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. We’ll start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is… 148 over 82. Pulse is 76 and regular. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds… normal S1 and S2, no murmurs noted. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Now, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today's date… Hmm. Let me think… It's August… is it the 1st? No… my wife mentioned something about it being… the 2nd, I believe. August 2nd, 2025. Yes, I think that’s right. Although, honestly, Doctor, the days all seem to blend together lately.
DOCTOR: And can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words… Oh dear. That’s… testing my memory, isn't it? Alright, let’s see… What are the words, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Apple, table, penny. Please repeat those for me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes, I think I’ve got it. Apple, table, penny. It's… a bit difficult to hold them all in my mind at once, you see?
DOCTOR: Now, can you recall those three words?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. Let me think… Apple… I remember that one. And… table, yes. But the third one… it’s right on the tip of my tongue… It started with a ‘p’… penny! Yes, that’s it. Apple, table, penny. I think I got them all. It took me a moment, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Based on your reported symptoms, the physical exam findings, and this brief cognitive assessment, it appears you are experiencing some degree of cognitive impairment alongside persistent fatigue. However, these findings are not definitive, and further investigation is warranted. I would like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a Vitamin B12 level. We also need to rule out other potential causes, such as depression, which can present with similar symptoms.
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds… serious, Doctor. Tests and things… Is it something bad? I just want to feel like myself again, you see. And my wife… she worries so much. Is it something that can be fixed? I trust your judgment, of course, but it's a bit overwhelming, all this talk of panels and hormones.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, it is premature to assume the worst. These tests are simply to rule out potential underlying causes. Many factors can contribute to fatigue and cognitive difficulties. Once we have the results, we can determine the appropriate course of action. In the meantime, I recommend prioritizing good sleep hygiene, maintaining a healthy diet, and engaging in regular physical activity, within your limitations. I will have my nurse schedule you for these tests at the lab. We’ll need to draw blood, so please be aware of that. We will review the results in approximately one week. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Good sleep… I try, Doctor, I really do. It's just… hard to quiet my mind sometimes. And a healthy diet… My wife is very good about that, thankfully. One week… that seems a long time to wait. Will she be able to come with me to the lab? I get a bit… flustered with these things. And about the forms… the papers for my work… will getting these tests done help with that? I’m just so confused, honestly.
DOCTOR: Your wife is welcome to accompany you to the lab, Mr. Limtiaco. Regarding the paperwork, obtaining a clearer understanding of your condition through these tests will certainly be beneficial in determining your ability to return to work. We can discuss potential accommodations or medical leave options once we have the results. It is important to address the underlying cause of your symptoms, rather than simply focusing on the paperwork. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That's... that's a very good point. Underlying cause. Yes. Well, if you don't mind, Doctor, could you maybe just write down the names of those tests? Just so I don't forget. And maybe... maybe a little note about the paperwork? So I can explain it to my wife, if she asks. I'm afraid my memory isn't what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here you are. Complete Blood Count, Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, Vitamin B12 Level. And a note: "Medical evaluation pending to determine work status." Is there anything else, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Oh! Thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. No, I think that’s all for now. Just… thank you. I appreciate your time and… and your patience. And… well, I’ll see you next week, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will escort you to the lab. Please follow her instructions. .
