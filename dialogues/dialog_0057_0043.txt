DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Sieh. Nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been having this headache, right in the back of my head. It’s been… bothering me for a little while now. Not constantly, but often enough that I figured I should get it checked out. It’s kind of a dull ache, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head. And you say it’s been going on for a “little while” – could you tell me roughly how long?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… maybe three, four weeks now? It comes and goes, like I said. Not every day, but maybe three or four times a week, it’ll start up. It doesn't knock me off my feet, but it's definitely noticeable. I can still do things, you know? Just… annoying. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. And is there anything that seems to trigger the headache, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific. Sometimes it feels a little worse when I’ve been reading for a long time, maybe? I do a lot of paperwork for my clients, financial stuff, so I spend a fair amount of time looking at documents. But honestly, it just seems to come on randomly. No loud noises or stress that I can pinpoint, anyway. It’s a bit of a mystery, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not consistently linked to reading, but perhaps a possible connection there. And when the headache comes on, where exactly in the back of your head do you feel it?
PATIENT: Well, it's right at the base of my skull, you know? Almost where my neck meets my head. Sometimes it feels like it’s spreading up a little bit, but mostly it's concentrated right there. And it's not a throbbing pain, more of a… pressure, I guess? A constant, dull pressure. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, base of the skull, dull pressure. That's helpful. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. No dizziness, no nausea, no vision changes… Nothing like that. I haven’t felt any fever or anything. I sleep okay, eat okay… Just the headache, really. I’ve been a little more tired lately, but I’m 84 years old! I figure some tiredness is just part of getting older. But no, nothing else noticeably wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright. And in terms of your medical history, do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder taken out years ago, must have been… forty years ago? Other than that, not much. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps, chickenpox… but nothing major. I used to be pretty active, did a lot of gardening, but I don’t get around like I used to. And, uh… I was divorced a long time ago. Does that count as a medical problem? I don't take any regular medications, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal many years ago, no current medications. And you haven't been experiencing any other health issues?
PATIENT: No, nothing else that I’ve noticed. My memory's not what it used to be, of course, but I haven’t forgotten everything yet! But seriously, no, just this headache. And it’s not getting worse quickly, which is good, I suppose. It just… lingers. It's more of an annoyance than anything truly debilitating.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any family history of headaches or neurological problems that you know of?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… My wife, she used to get migraines, really bad ones. But she’s passed away now, many years ago. And my siblings… not that I recall, no. Nobody ever talked much about headaches, honestly. We weren’t really a family that talked about health problems much at all. Just kind of… dealt with things quietly. I don't know of any neurological problems in the family, no. It's possible, but I wouldn't know for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can remember. I eat pretty much everything. My wife used to say I had the stomach of a goat! Seriously, no allergies. I've never had to worry about carrying an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Okay, Mr. Gibbel, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'd like to take a look at your neck and do a brief neurological exam – just to check your reflexes and strength. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Dr. Sieh. Go right ahead. I trust your judgement. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I haven't had a thorough check-up in a while, so it'll be good to know everything's still working okay, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 140/85, pulse is 72 and regular. Heart and lungs sound clear. When I palpate the back of your head and neck, I do feel some muscle tension there. Range of motion in your neck is a little limited, but not significantly. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal and equal on both sides. Strength is also normal in your arms and legs. No obvious neurological deficits detected. So, overall, the exam is fairly unremarkable, but the muscle tension in your neck is notable.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear that it’s not anything too serious, Dr. Sieh. That muscle tension… could that be from sleeping wrong, do you think? I sometimes wake up with a stiff neck, but it usually goes away on its own. It's not terribly painful, just… tight.
DOCTOR: That's definitely possible, Mr. Gibbel. Muscle tension can often be caused by sleeping position or even stress. Given your age and the nature of the headache – dull, pressure-like, at the base of the skull – and the muscle tension I felt, my initial thought is that this is likely a tension headache. However, it’s always best to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a basic blood test to check for inflammation and other common causes of headache. And, just to be cautious, I’m going to recommend a CT scan of your head to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds a little scary, Dr. Sieh. Is it really necessary? I mean, if you think it’s best, I trust you, but… I’ve always been a little nervous about those things. And I don't have insurance, so I worry about the cost. Is there any other way to find out what's going on?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Gibbel. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about a CT scan, and the cost is a valid concern, especially without insurance. Let me explain why I'm recommending it. While I strongly suspect this is a tension headache, given your age, it’s important to rule out any structural problems – like an aneurysm or a small tumor – that could be causing your headache. The CT scan will give us a clear picture of your brain and rule those possibilities out. We can discuss options to minimize the cost. Some hospitals offer financial assistance programs, and we can see if there are any lower-cost imaging centers nearby. Alternatively, we could try a course of conservative treatment – physical therapy, over-the-counter pain relievers – and see if your symptoms improve. However, if your headache doesn’t improve, or if it gets worse, we would still need to consider imaging. Given your lack of other neurological symptoms, and the fact that your headache has been relatively stable, I think it's reasonable to start with conservative treatment. We can schedule a physical therapy appointment, and I’ll prescribe a mild pain reliever. If you don’t see improvement in two weeks, we can revisit the possibility of a CT scan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better, Dr. Sieh. Starting with physical therapy and the pain reliever is a good idea. I’m not keen on having a scan unless it's absolutely necessary. And two weeks sounds like a reasonable amount of time to see if things improve. Yes, let’s do that. Schedule the physical therapy and the prescription. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad to hear that. Okay, I’m scheduling you for three sessions of physical therapy, starting next week. I’ll also send an electronic prescription to your usual pharmacy for ibuprofen 400mg, to be taken as needed for pain – no more than three times a day. Here are some things to watch out for: If you experience any new symptoms – like weakness, numbness, vision changes, fever, or a stiff neck – go to the emergency room immediately. Also, if your headache gets significantly worse, or doesn't improve after two weeks of treatment, please call my office right away. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very thoroughly, Dr. Sieh. I appreciate your patience and understanding. And thank you for considering my concerns about the cost and the scan. I feel much better knowing we're starting with something less invasive. I’ll make sure to follow your instructions carefully and keep an eye out for any new symptoms.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gibbel. I’m glad I could help. If you have any questions or concerns at all, please don't hesitate to call the office. We're here to help. Have a good day, and I'll see you in two weeks to check on your progress.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you, Dr. Sieh. You have a good day as well. Thank you again for everything.
