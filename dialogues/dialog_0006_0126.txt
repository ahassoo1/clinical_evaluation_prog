DOCTOR: Right, Christen Erxleben. Thirty-two years old. Okay. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Gorga, it’s… it’s been a bit odd lately. I’m just constantly thirsty, no matter how much I drink. And hungry, too. Really hungry. It feels like I’m always needing to eat, but it doesn’t… quite satisfy me, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry… constant thirst and hunger. Okay. And how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s probably been… oh, a month or so now, I’d say. Maybe a little longer. It started gradually, just feeling a bit more peckish than usual, and needing a drink with meals. Now… well, now it’s pretty constant. It’s becoming a bit of a nuisance, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A month or so… gradually worsening. Alright. Have you noticed any… changes in your weight?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Not that I’ve tried to weigh myself recently, but… my trousers feel a bit tighter, perhaps? I haven't been paying terribly close attention, if I'm being honest. I've just been… preoccupied with feeling hungry all the time. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It could be. Okay. Any change in how often you're urinating?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, actually. I am going to the bathroom more often than usual, and… the volumes seem larger, if you understand me. It's disrupted my sleep a couple of times, which is… unpleasant. I hadn’t really connected it to the thirst and hunger, but now that you ask… yes, definitely more frequent trips to the loo.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me see… not really, not that I’ve noticed. I’ve been a bit tired, perhaps? But that could just be work. Long hours. No, nothing else springs to mind. I’m really just worried about the constant thirst and hunger, and the… increased bathroom visits. It’s quite disruptive, as I said. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, those symptoms… thirst, hunger, frequent urination… they can point to a few different things. It’s too early to say for sure. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture. Can you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There you go. I haven’t weighed myself in quite some time, as I said. I do hope it's not anything too concerning.
DOCTOR: 93 kilograms… alright. And I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then we'll do a quick blood pressure check, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Proceed when you’re ready, Doctor. I am… somewhat anxious, if you don’t mind my saying so. It's just the not knowing, you understand.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is… 130 over 85. Not too bad. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes. Nothing to worry about, just standard procedure.
PATIENT: Alright. That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I’ll try to relax. Though, I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of medical examinations. But if you say it’s standard, I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. Sensation is intact. Okay. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to order some blood work and a urine sample. That will help us rule out a few things. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Blood work and a urine sample. I am happy to do whatever is necessary to get to the bottom of this. When do you need the sample, and where should I go for the blood work?
DOCTOR: You can leave a urine sample with the nurse right away. As for the blood work, there’s a lab just down the hall – Room 203. They should be expecting you. Fasting blood work, please – so nothing to eat or drink after midnight tonight. We'll get the results back in a couple of days. Until then, try to drink water when you feel thirsty, and eat when you’re hungry, but maybe avoid sugary drinks and excessive carbohydrates. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly manageable, Doctor. No food after midnight, and avoid sugary drinks. I can do that. I’ll go and see the nurse now for the urine sample, and then head to the lab. Thank you for your time, Doctor Gorga. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. I do hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll see what the results say. If you don’t hear back within a couple of days, please give the office a call. And, Christen… if you start feeling very thirsty, or experience any nausea or vomiting, go to the emergency room immediately. Alright?
