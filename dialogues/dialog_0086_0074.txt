DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just…my blood pressure’s been acting up again, I guess. Been high for a bit now, and my other doctor said to come see someone…closer to home. It’s just…tiresome, you know? Being old ain’t easy.
DOCTOR: "Tiresome" is one word for it. Alright. And your other doctor…who would that be, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, land. Let me think… Dr. Abernathy. Out in Stilwell. Good man, but it’s a drive. Been seein’ him for…oh, goodness, must be ten years now. Maybe more. He’s the one said I oughta find somebody closer, since the trips were gettin’ hard.
DOCTOR: Stilwell…right. And he mentioned why he thought you should find someone closer?
PATIENT: Well, he said travelin' that far just to check my blood pressure wasn't smart. Said it could raise it, all the stress of the road. Plus, my knees ain't what they used to be. He wanted me to have someone nearby I could see regular without makin’ a whole day of it.
DOCTOR: Right. Sensible. So, you've been monitoring your blood pressure at home at all?
PATIENT: No, I haven't been. I don't have one of them…machines. Tried one once, a long time ago, but I couldn't figure it out. Too many buttons. My granddaughter tried to show me, but…I just get confused. I just try to feel alright, you know? And when I don't, I call the office.
DOCTOR: “Feeling alright” is…subjective. We really need some numbers to work with, Ms. Steines. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure here in the office, and we’ll go from there. Have you had any other symptoms alongside this feeling of…high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes my head feels kinda…full. Like a tight band around it. And I get a little dizzy now and then, especially when I stand up too fast. But I just figured that was my age catchin’ up to me. Ain't nothin' new there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision? Hmm… not really. Everything’s kinda blurry these days, if I’m bein’ honest. But it’s always been that way, I think. I haven’t had my eyes checked in… oh, Lord. Probably twenty years. Just another thing.
DOCTOR: Twenty years… Right. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No chest pain, thankfully. My breath gets a little short sometimes, when I’m walkin’ up the stairs, but I figured that was just from bein’ out of shape. And my ankles…well, they swell up a bit at the end of the day, especially in the summer. Always have. I thought it was just the heat.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, mostly what we have is a feeling of fullness, occasional dizziness, and some expected swelling and shortness of breath for someone your age. Let's take your blood pressure now and get a better idea of where we stand. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Just get it over with, please. I got a pie crust to finish this afternoon.
DOCTOR: 160 over 95. Not ideal. And your pulse is a bit elevated as well, 88. We’re going to need to investigate this a bit further. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, land, I don't take much. Just a little somethin' for my arthritis, when it flares up. And…I think I had a reaction to somethin' once, a long time ago, made me itch something awful. But I can’t recall what it was.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what is the name of the medication you take for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Um… let me think… it’s a little white pill. Starts with a “N”… No, wait… maybe a “M”? Oh, this is hopeless. My granddaughter keeps track of all that stuff for me. She's got a chart, everything. I just swallow what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's not very helpful. Let's try this. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. And… I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, fell out of a tree. And… oh, and I had a hysterectomy, years and years ago. That’s all I can think of right now. It was a long time ago, before I met my husband.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder, wrist, hysterectomy. And your family history?
PATIENT: Family history…well, my mama had high blood pressure, I think. And my daddy had somethin’ with his heart. He passed away when he was still pretty young. And my brother, he had… diabetes, I think. It’s been a long time, so I don't rightly recall. Lots of sickness runnin’ in the family.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a family history of common ailments. Ms. Steines, based on what you’ve told me, and the elevated blood pressure reading, I suspect we're dealing with typical age-related hypertension, likely exacerbated by… lifestyle factors. We'll need to do some blood work to get a clearer picture. I'm going to order a complete metabolic panel and a lipid panel. And honestly, given your lack of precise medication information, it’s best we do an EKG just to be safe. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: EKG? Land sakes, Doctor, that sounds serious. Blood work, I understand. But an EKG… Is somethin’ wrong? And what are these “lifestyle factors” you’re talkin’ about? I mostly just bake and try to keep outta the sun.
DOCTOR: An EKG is a simple test, Ms. Steines. It just checks the electrical activity of your heart. It's standard procedure when we're investigating elevated blood pressure, especially given your age and the lack of comprehensive information. “Lifestyle factors” include diet, exercise, stress… things like that. You mentioned baking. What exactly does that entail?
PATIENT: Well, I bake pies, mostly. And cakes. And cookies. And… well, pretty much anything sweet. I use a lot of butter. And sugar, naturally. And flour. It's a lot of work, standin' on my feet all day. And sometimes, my grandkids come over and… we sneak a few cookies. Or a slice of pie. I try to give 'em healthy things too, but… they like the sweets best. It’s just… happy things.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a diet high in sugar and fat. And limited physical activity. That’s what I meant by lifestyle factors. Look, Ms. Steines, I’m not trying to be critical. But these things impact your health. I'm going to order the blood work and EKG, as I said. After we get the results, we can discuss a plan. And frankly, you really need to consider getting a blood pressure monitor for home use. It doesn't take a genius to operate. The lab is down the hall, and the technician will explain the EKG process. Do you think you can manage that on your own, or would you like me to have a nurse escort you?
PATIENT: Oh, Lord. All this. I guess I can manage to walk down the hall. I ain't helpless, you know. But… a nurse might be a good idea. Just to show me where it is. And to… well, hold my hand, maybe. I feel a little faint all of a sudden.
DOCTOR: Fine. I'll have Nurse Davies escort you. She's very capable. And she’ll make sure you don’t get lost. She’ll be in shortly. Try to relax, Ms. Steines. And don’t worry. We'll figure this out. Eventually.
PATIENT: .
