DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I’m Dr. Annesley. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you. Well, my… the scheduling lady said I need to have this… a check-up, yes? For… for Medicare. I am not sure what I need to do exactly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. It’s a yearly wellness visit covered by Medicare. It’s a good opportunity to review your overall health, make sure everything is functioning as it should, and address any concerns you might have. Don't worry about needing to do anything specific. We’ll just go through some questions, a brief physical exam, and then discuss any necessary next steps. To start, could you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Hmm. Well, I am… old, you know? So, things are not like they used to be. My knees, they bother me. And my back. But that is just… getting old. I tire easily, but I do not do much sitting still, you see? I work with the cars. It is good work, but… tiring. Is this what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Ms. Benites. It's good to know you're still active despite some discomfort. The knees and back pain are common with activity and age, as you said. And feeling tired is certainly something we need to explore. When you say your knees and back bother you, could you describe the pain a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. The knees… it is a sharp pain, sometimes. Mostly when I stand for too long. Or when I bend down to look at something under the cars. The back… it is more of an ache. A dull ache. It is always there, really. It gets worse when I lift heavy things. I try not to lift too much, but… sometimes I have to. It is my job, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand. So, sharp pain in the knees with prolonged standing or bending, and a constant, dull ache in your back that worsens with lifting. Does either pain radiate anywhere – down your legs, for example?
PATIENT: Radiate? You mean… does it go somewhere else? Hmm. The knee, no. Not usually. Sometimes a little bit, down the front of my leg, but not always. The back… sometimes it goes into my… my bottom. But not all the way down the legs. Is that what you mean? It is hard to explain, I think.
DOCTOR: You're explaining perfectly well, Ms. Benites. That's very helpful. So, some occasional pain radiating down the front of your leg from your knees, and pain radiating into your buttocks from your back. Now, thinking about other parts of your body, have you noticed any other aches, pains, or changes recently – anything at all, even if it seems small?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Well, my hands are sometimes… stiff in the morning. It is hard to open the jars, sometimes. And my… eyesight is not what it used to be. I need glasses for reading, now. But I got new glasses last year, so… I don’t know. Is that what you mean? Little things?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly—little things. The stiffness in your hands in the morning and the changes in your vision are definitely relevant. Have you noticed any swelling in your hands or any redness or warmth?
PATIENT: No, not really. They are just… stiff. Hard to bend. Like… rusty hinges, maybe? No red or warm. Just… not moving well in the mornings. I rub them with cream, and they get better. It takes a while, though. I have had these hands a long time, you know! They need some care.
DOCTOR: I can appreciate that—we all do as we get older. Okay, so stiffness in the hands, especially in the mornings, improving with rubbing. Now, let's talk about your overall health a bit. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh. Hmm. Let me think. My husband… he had the heart problem. But I do not. The doctor… a few years ago, he said my… the cholesterol was a little high. He gave me a pill. I took it for a while. But then he said it was okay, so I stopped taking it. I do not remember much else. I am not very good with remembering the names of things, you see.
DOCTOR: That's alright, don't worry about the names. So, you were told you had slightly elevated cholesterol a few years ago and were prescribed medication, which you later stopped taking. Do you recall how long ago that was, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Maybe… five years ago? Six? Something like that. It was before my husband… passed away. It was a long time ago. And the doctor then… he moved away. That is why I have a new doctor now. It is hard to keep track, you see? Many doctors, many pills… it gets confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Benites. It can be confusing keeping track of everything. Just to confirm, you haven't been taking any medication for your cholesterol currently?
PATIENT: No. Not now. I stopped when the doctor… he said it was okay. He did not say to keep taking it. He just… stopped prescribing it, I think. It was a long time ago. And I do not remember exactly what he said. My memory is not good, you see. It gets worse, every year, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm. Surgeries… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And I had a baby, two babies, yes. But those are not… surgeries, are they? No other surgeries. And I was in the hospital when I had the babies, of course. But… no other times. Nothing serious. Just the babies, and the tonsils, a long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a tonsillectomy in your childhood and two births. No other surgeries or hospitalizations to mention. Now, thinking about your family—are there any medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh. Family… yes. My mother, she had the… the problem with her bones. The osteoporosis, I think. She broke her hip when she was old. My father, he had the heart problem. He died when he was young. And my brother… he had the cancer. But that was a long time ago. He is gone now. Is that what you mean? Family history? It is not a happy subject, you see. Many problems.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not always easy discussing family history. So, osteoporosis in your mother, heart disease in your father, and cancer in your brother. We'll make a note of all that. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. I do not think so. I eat everything. I have not… never had a problem with food. And the doctor… he gave me many pills, over the years, and I never had a reaction. So, no allergies. I do not think. It is hard to remember everything, you see? But no allergies. I am sure.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Benites. No known allergies. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I stopped taking the cholesterol pill a long time ago, as I said. And I do not take any vitamins. I try to eat healthy, yes. But I do not take any pills or… supplements. Nothing at all. Just the food. Is that okay? Should I be taking something?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine. We'll discuss whether any medications or supplements might be beneficial later on. Okay, Ms. Benites, that gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam—just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and taking a look at your knees and hands. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. You just… say what you need me to do. I will try my best. But I am… old, you see. And sometimes I forget things. So, you must be patient with me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Benites. I will absolutely be patient. Please, have a seat here on the table, and we'll take it one step at a time. First, let’s just listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes. Like this? I take a deep breath, and then exhale slowly. Is that good? I am not very good at this, you see. I get nervous at the doctor, always. It reminds me of… unpleasant things. But I will try my best.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Ms. Benites. Just breathe normally. Dain listens to your heart and lungs for approximately thirty seconds. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. He then moves the stethoscope to different points on your chest, repeating the process. Everything sounds good so far. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. He wraps the blood pressure cuff around your arm.
PATIENT: Okay. Is this… uncomfortable? It feels a little tight. I always worry about the blood pressure. My husband, he had problems with that. But I try not to think about it. Just… tell me what you think, Doctor. Is it good? Is it bad? I just… want to know.
DOCTOR: It’s a little snug, yes, but shouldn't be uncomfortable. He glances at the reading. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated, but not critically high. We'll want to monitor that, and discuss some lifestyle changes that might help lower it. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Could you please bend each knee, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: Oh. I pause halfway through each bend. That is… uncomfortable, yes. It clicks a little. And it feels… stiff. It is worse in the mornings, as I said. I try to stretch them, but it does not help much. Is this what you wanted to see? The clicking and the stiffness? It is just… old age, I think. It happens to everyone.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful to see. There’s some crepitus—that’s the clicking you mentioned—and some mild tenderness when I bend them. There’s no significant swelling. It doesn’t appear to be anything severe, but it does indicate some osteoarthritis, which is common with age and activity. Finally, let’s take a look at your hands. Could you make a fist for me, and then open your fingers wide?
PATIENT: Like this? It is hard. They are not as flexible as they used to be. And it hurts a little, when I open them. Like… rusty hinges, as I said before. I rub them with cream, but it only helps a little. Is this what you wanted to see? The stiffness and the pain? It is just… old age, you see. Everything hurts, eventually.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful to see. There’s some mild swelling and tenderness in your knuckles, and your grip strength is slightly reduced. It appears you have some early signs of osteoarthritis in your hands as well. Okay, Ms. Benites, that completes the physical exam. Everything seems consistent with age-related wear and tear. Now, based on everything we've discussed, and the physical exam, I'd like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels again. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I will go… wherever you tell me to go. I trust your judgment. I just… want to be healthy. As healthy as I can be, at my age. So, yes. Blood work is fine. Just tell me where to go, and what to do. And I will try my best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse will draw the blood samples right here in the office before you leave. You don’t need to fast beforehand. We’ll get the results back in about a week, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on some simple lifestyle changes—a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, regular moderate exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight. We can also talk about over-the-counter pain relievers for your knees and hands if needed. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. Not right now, I think. You explained everything very clearly, Doctor. A healthy diet, exercise, pain relievers… I can do that. I will try my best. Thank you for your time, and for being so patient with me. I always get nervous at the doctor, you see. But you made me feel… much better.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. I understand. It’s perfectly normal to be nervous. Don’t hesitate to call the office if any questions come up before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
