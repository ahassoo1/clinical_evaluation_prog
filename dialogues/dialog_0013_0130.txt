DOCTOR: Hi Jim, it's good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… well, my family… they got lots of sickness. Heart trouble mostly, and my sister, she had… something with the brain. I just want to make sure I don't get it, you know? I want to be okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's very smart of you to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart trouble and your sister’s illness. It sounds like you're concerned about potentially inheriting those conditions. We can definitely explore that. To get a better picture of things, let’s start with you. Have you ever had any health problems yourself – anything at all, even if it seemed minor at the time?
PATIENT: Not much, really. I had the flu a couple times. And my knee… it bothers me when it’s cold. But nothing… serious. I work hard, sell things… keep moving. Never really been to the doctor much. That’s why I’m here now, I guess. To check things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. So, flu and some knee discomfort with the cold weather. That’s helpful. And it sounds like you're generally very active, which is excellent. Let’s talk a bit about your family history more specifically. You mentioned heart trouble and your sister's illness. Do you know what kind of heart trouble your family members had?
PATIENT: Um… my father, he had… trouble breathing. They said something about his heart being big. And my uncle, he… he fell down. They said it was his heart too. My sister… she forgot things. Lots of things. She was in the hospital a long time. I don’t know much about what it was, just that it was… bad. They didn't tell me much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a little more to work with. So, your father had shortness of breath and was told his heart was enlarged – that sounds like it could have been cardiomyopathy or heart failure. Your uncle collapsing suggests a possible heart rhythm problem or a heart attack. And your sister’s memory loss is concerning; that could be a lot of things, but we need to keep that in mind. Now, let’s switch gears a bit. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. I eat everything. I take… sometimes I take something for my knee, but it’s just over-the-counter stuff. The kind you buy at the store. I don’t remember the name. It comes in a bottle. Blue bottle, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and you use an over-the-counter medication for your knee discomfort, possibly in a blue bottle. That’s good information. Let’s talk about your current medications. Besides the knee medication, are you taking any vitamins, supplements, or any other prescription drugs?
PATIENT: No. Just the knee stuff. I don’t like taking pills if I don't have to. My wife… my ex-wife… she took lots of pills. It didn’t help her much. So, I try not to. Just the knee thing when it’s cold. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just the over-the-counter knee medication, and you prefer to avoid medication when possible. That’s perfectly reasonable. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never smoked. Don’t like it. And no, no drinking either. Never been much of a drinker. And definitely not… those other things. I work too hard for that. I need a clear head for selling. Gotta remember the prices, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's excellent. No smoking, no alcohol, and no recreational drug use. Very good. You mentioned working hard and needing to stay alert for your job. That’s great. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your diet?
PATIENT: Well, I eat… normal food, I guess. I eat rice, noodles, sometimes meat. I try to eat vegetables, but sometimes it’s hard when I’m traveling for work. I eat what I can get. Not much time for fancy cooking, you know? Mostly just… filling food. Keep me going. Not too much sugar, I don't think. I try not to.
DOCTOR: Okay, a generally balanced diet with rice, noodles, meat and vegetables, with some limitations when traveling. You focus on getting filling food and try to limit sugar. That's helpful to know. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'd like to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and just get a general sense of how you're doing. It will just take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Sounds good. I want to know if everything is okay, so… yes, please check. I don't mind. Just tell me if something is wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated, but not terribly concerning on one reading. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds… regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not loud, but it’s present. We'll need to investigate that further. Your lungs are clear, which is good. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Pulses are good and equal on both sides. Your reflexes are normal. Now, I'd like to order a few tests to get a better picture of what's going on. I want to do a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an EKG to check your heart rhythm. I also want to do a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart size. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Um… okay. If you think it’s important, yes. I trust you, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know if I’m going to be okay. Chest X-ray… that’s like… pictures, right? Is it safe? I don’t want too much… radiation or something.
DOCTOR: Yes, a chest X-ray is like a picture. You'll stand in front of a machine and it takes a quick image of your chest. You're right to be concerned about radiation, and you're very smart to ask. The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is very small—similar to what you get from a few days of normal background radiation. The benefits of getting this information to assess your heart and lungs far outweigh the small risk. We’ll also do some bloodwork. That will help me check your kidney function, electrolytes, and overall health. I want to rule out any underlying problems that could be contributing to your concerns. Do you have any questions about the tests before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… when do I get the results? I'm going back to work on Monday. I hope it doesn't take too long. And… will it hurt? The bloodwork, I mean. I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns about the timing and the needles. The bloodwork usually takes a few days to process, so I should have the results by early next week, well before Monday. I’ll make sure the results are sent to me quickly and we can discuss them then. As for the blood draw, it will be a small pinch. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will make it as quick and painless as possible. You might feel a little discomfort, but it shouldn’t be anything severe. In the meantime, let's talk about a few things you can do to support your overall health. Since your blood pressure is slightly elevated, it's important to focus on a healthy diet, low in salt and saturated fat. Regular exercise is also beneficial, even just a brisk walk for 30 minutes most days of the week. Do you have any questions about those recommendations?
PATIENT: No… that sounds… okay. I can try. Less salt… I like salt, though. And walking… I do a lot of walking for work. But it's not… exercise, exactly. It's… selling. Maybe I should walk more on purpose. So… that’s it? Tests, less salt, more walking? What if… what if something is wrong? What if it’s like my sister? I don’t want to forget things.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask about that. It’s natural to be worried about that possibility. If something is wrong, we’ll discuss all your options and create a plan to address it. We'll take things one step at a time. I want to emphasize that we’re just gathering information right now, and there’s no reason to jump to any conclusions. If the tests reveal something concerning, we can explore further investigation, such as a neurological evaluation to assess your cognitive function. It’s important to rule things out and be proactive. For now, let's focus on the tests and those lifestyle modifications. I’ll give you a requisition form for the bloodwork and the chest X-ray. The X-ray can be done at any imaging center that accepts your insurance. Do you have any questions about where to go for the X-ray or how to schedule the bloodwork?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Requisition form… okay. I’ll go get the X-ray and the bloodwork done. My insurance… Medicare, it should be okay. I'll ask the lady at the front desk to help me figure it out. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I was really worried, but… I feel a little better now. Just… let me know if something is wrong, okay? Don’t wait too long.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jim. I'm glad I could ease some of your worries. I absolutely will let you know as soon as the results are available. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Here’s the requisition form. The front desk staff will be happy to assist you with scheduling and insurance questions. Take care, and I’ll see you next week. .
