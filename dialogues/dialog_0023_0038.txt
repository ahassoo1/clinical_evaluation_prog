DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. Honestly, it's a bit difficult to explain. I was hoping to discuss… planning for the future, I suppose. I understand you can help with paperwork to make sure my wishes are known, should… something happen. I believe it has a specific name, an Advance Directive or a POLST form? I don’t recall exactly why I need it, only that someone suggested I look into it.
DOCTOR: Planning for the future… Right. Well, it's certainly… prudent to consider these things. Though, generally, these forms are discussed when there's a specific medical condition prompting the need for clarity on end-of-life care or in anticipation of a potentially serious illness. It's not typically a routine preventative measure. Before we delve into the paperwork, let’s clarify why you feel this is necessary now. Are you experiencing any health concerns that have led you to consider this?
PATIENT: That’s… a very good question. I truly don't know. My memory… isn’t what it once was. I believe my ex-husband mentioned something about… it being better to be prepared, after a… a scare, perhaps? But I don’t recall the specifics. It feels… important, though. A nagging feeling, more than anything. I apologize for being so vague. It’s frustrating, even for me. Perhaps the forms themselves would jog my memory?
DOCTOR: A “nagging feeling” isn’t quite enough to warrant these documents, Ms. Buoniconti, but I understand wanting to be thorough. It's certainly possible the paperwork could help you recall the circumstances. However, these forms are legally binding and require a clear understanding of their implications. Before we proceed, let’s do a brief cognitive assessment. Just some simple questions to get a baseline understanding of your memory and reasoning. It’s standard procedure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If it will help clarify things, please. I’m… perhaps a bit worried about it, but I understand the necessity. It’s just… unsettling to feel so unsure of things. Please, proceed when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with a few basic questions. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… August… the second? Yes, I believe it’s August the second. 2025, isn’t it? I hope I’m correct. It feels… distant, somehow.
DOCTOR: Correct. August 2nd, 2025. Good. Now, can you tell me where we are currently located?
PATIENT: We are… in your office, Doctor. Is this… a clinic? A rural clinic, if I recall correctly? I don't believe I've been here before, but it feels… familiar. Not the office itself, necessarily, but the general… atmosphere. It's a bit difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: A rural clinic, yes. You are correct. Though, stating you don't believe you've been here before and stating it feels familiar is… somewhat contradictory, Ms. Buoniconti. Let's try a slightly different question. Can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Very well. Three words, you say? Please, go ahead. I will do my best. It’s just… my mind feels a bit… foggy today. Hopefully I can recall them.
DOCTOR: Apple… table… penny. Now, repeat those three words for me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… Penny… yes, those were the words, weren’t they? Apple… table… Hmm… I… I seem to be struggling. It’s right on the tip of my tongue, I know it is… but I can’t quite… retrieve it. Is it permissible to… try again? Perhaps if you repeat them? I apologize for this… it’s most embarrassing.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Buoniconti. We can repeat them. However, repeatedly failing to recall three simple words is… concerning. Apple… table… penny. Please, focus, and repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… …chair? No… that's not right. I… I'm so sorry, Doctor. I simply… can’t recall the third word. Or even the second, now that I think about it. It’s as if… they’ve vanished. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, with all due respect, your inability to recall even simple information raises significant concerns about your cognitive function. Proceeding with Advance Directives in this state would be irresponsible. I recommend a full neurological evaluation, including an MRI of the brain, to determine the underlying cause of your memory loss. I’m referring you to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a neurologist specializing in geriatric cognitive disorders. Here's the referral information. I strongly advise you schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A… a neurological evaluation? Is it… serious, Doctor? I… I hadn’t realized it was this bad. I simply thought I was a bit forgetful, that’s all. I… I don’t understand. What does this mean? Is there… is there something wrong with my brain?
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, I cannot provide a diagnosis without further testing. However, your cognitive deficits require investigation. It could be a number of things—from vitamin deficiencies to more serious conditions. That’s why the MRI and neurological evaluation are crucial. I understand this is unsettling. But ignoring these symptoms will not make them disappear. I'm referring you to a specialist who can provide a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. Do you have any questions about the referral process?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. I’m… still trying to process everything. So… I shouldn't discuss my wishes with anyone until I’ve seen Dr. Vance? About… future care? It feels… irresponsible to put things off, but also… frightening to face this without knowing what’s happening. Is it alright if I ask my ex-husband to come with me to the appointment? I… I think I’ll need support. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Buoniconti, that is correct. Do not make any legally binding decisions regarding your future care until you have received a professional evaluation. And yes, bringing someone with you for support is highly advisable. I have documented my findings and concerns. I wish you the best with your appointment. If you have any urgent questions before then, please contact my office. Now, if there is nothing further, I believe that concludes our consultation. .
