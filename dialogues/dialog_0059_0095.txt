DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't got all day. Sudden deafness, right side. And my face… feels like it’s melting on that side too. It started yesterday morning. Is that enough for you to start, or do you need a life story?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. Sudden deafness and facial drooping – that is concerning, and we'll definitely investigate that. Thank you for letting me know. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when exactly it started yesterday morning?
PATIENT: Look, I told you. Yesterday morning. Before breakfast. I was getting ready for my… appointments. It was just… there. Woke up, and everything sounded muffled. Then I noticed this… weakness. Honestly, I don’t need to give you a time stamp. It was yesterday morning. Are you a doctor or a detective?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I apologize if my questions seem tedious. It's simply that pinpointing the timing can sometimes be helpful. So, before breakfast, you noticed muffled hearing and then the weakness on the right side of your face?
PATIENT: Yes, that's precisely what I said. Look, is this going to take long? I have things to do. And frankly, I don’t appreciate being interrogated about when I had breakfast. Get on with it, Doctor. What’s wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I assure you, I'm not trying to interrogate you. Sudden onset hearing loss and facial weakness can be caused by several things, and it’s important to understand the full picture to determine the best course of action. One possibility we need to rule out is Bell’s Palsy, but there are other, more serious, causes as well. To help me narrow it down, could you describe the weakness in your face a little more?
PATIENT: It… droops. What do you want me to say? It doesn't feel right. I can’t smile properly on that side. And when I try to close my eye… it just won't stay shut. It feels… loose. Is that good enough? Honestly, you're a doctor. You should be able to see it!
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Ms. Nissenbaum. That’s very helpful. I can see what you mean. And it sounds like it’s affecting your ability to fully close your right eye, which is important to note. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hearing loss and facial weakness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No fever. No headache. Taste… seems alright, I suppose. My ear feels a little… stuffy. And I’ve been a bit tired, but that’s normal for me, frankly. I'm a widow, Doctor. I don't sleep well. Is that what you wanted to know, or are we going to catalogue my entire medical history now?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I apologize for the extensive questioning. It's important to rule out other possibilities. No fever or headache is good. You mentioned a stuffy ear – is there any pain associated with that, or is it just a feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: Fullness. Just… pressure. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. It’s just… annoying. Like when you’re on an airplane. And frankly, the whole situation is annoying. Can we get on with whatever tests you need to do? I don’t have time for a prolonged conversation about ear pressure.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. We will proceed with a physical examination. I'd like to check your ears, nose, and throat, and then perform a neurological exam to assess the facial weakness more thoroughly. I'll also check your vital signs. If you could please sit up straight and look forward, I'll start with your ears. I'm seeing some mild inflammation in your right ear canal. The tympanic membrane – your eardrum – appears slightly congested as well. Do you have a history of ear infections?
PATIENT: Ear infections? When I was a child, maybe. A long time ago. Honestly, I don’t keep track of childhood illnesses. I haven’t had any trouble with my ears in… decades. Look, is this inflammation the cause of all this? Is it just an ear infection? Because if it is, I'll just get some drops and be done with it. I don't have time for a complicated diagnosis.
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to say definitively at this point, Ms. Nissenbaum. While the inflammation is present, it doesn’t fully explain the sudden hearing loss and facial weakness. We need to rule out other potential causes, such as Bell's Palsy, or, less commonly, something more serious like a stroke. To help differentiate, I'd like to check your facial muscles more carefully. Could you please close your eyes tightly, and then try to smile?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? As you can see, it doesn't work properly. It's obvious! This whole thing is just… frustrating. Honestly, I'm starting to get a headache now. Are we any closer to knowing what's wrong with me? Because I really don't have time for this. And I'm not insured, so I don't want a load of expensive tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and your concerns about cost, Ms. Nissenbaum. I will keep that in mind. The asymmetry is quite pronounced, and that, combined with the sudden onset of symptoms, raises suspicion for Bell’s Palsy. However, to be absolutely certain and to rule out other possibilities, especially given the hearing loss, I would like to order a quick blood test. It will help us identify any underlying conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms. Would you be willing to allow me to draw a small sample of blood?
PATIENT: Blood test? Really? Is that absolutely necessary? I hate needles. And frankly, I don’t see the point. It’s probably just Bell’s Palsy. Give me something for it and be done with it. I really don't have the energy for a lot of fuss. I’m a widow, Doctor. I don’t need more complications in my life. Is there anything else you need before you can just give me a diagnosis and some medication?
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your reluctance. However, a blood test can help us rule out other, less common causes of facial paralysis, like Lyme disease or a tumor, which require different treatment. It’s a precaution, and it will give us peace of mind. I wouldn't recommend it if it weren't important. If it makes you more comfortable, we can start with a basic test panel to minimize the cost. It will give us a good starting point. If those results are normal, we can proceed with a diagnosis of likely Bell's Palsy and begin treatment. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And keep it as cheap as possible. I don’t want any surprises. And I expect you to explain the results clearly, without any medical jargon. Just tell me what's wrong, and what I need to do to fix it. I really don’t have time for a lot of complicated explanations. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I will keep the cost to a minimum and explain everything in plain language. I’ll order the basic blood panel now. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw a small sample. While we wait for the results, I will write you a prescription for a short course of prednisone, a steroid medication, and an antiviral called acyclovir. Prednisone helps reduce inflammation and can improve the chances of a full recovery from Bell's Palsy, and acyclovir is often given alongside it to help prevent viral reactivation. I’ll also recommend using artificial tears in your right eye to keep it moist, and I’ll give you instructions on how to protect your eye from dryness and injury, as you may not be able to blink properly. Would you like me to write those down for you?
PATIENT: Just… write everything down. And make sure the instructions are clear. I don’t want to have to keep coming back here. Prednisone… is that safe? I don't like taking a lot of medication. But fine, whatever. Just get it done. I have appointments to keep. And tell me when I can expect the results. The exact time. I don't want to be waiting around all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. Here are the prescriptions and detailed instructions. The prednisone can have some side effects, such as increased appetite or mood changes, but they are usually temporary. We will discuss those in more detail if you experience any. The blood test results should be back within approximately two hours. I will have my assistant call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, please follow the instructions carefully and let me know if you experience any concerning symptoms, such as a severe headache, fever, or vision changes. Thank you for your patience, Ms. Nissenbaum. I hope you feel better soon.
