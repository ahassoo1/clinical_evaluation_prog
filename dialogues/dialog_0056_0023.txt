DOCTOR: Hi Aron, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um... my chest hurts. Like, both sides. It’s been happening for... a little while now, I think. Not all the time, but enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. That definitely needs checking out. “A little while now” is pretty vague – could you try to be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm... maybe like, two months? It started slow, just a little ache. Now it’s... sharper sometimes. Not always, but when I move my arms a lot, or if I lean forward. It’s hard to say exactly, time gets away from me, you know? I work a lot on roofs.
DOCTOR: Right, roofs – that's good to know. So, two months of intermittent chest pain, starting as an ache and now sometimes sharp. And it seems to be worse with movement, leaning forward specifically. Does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Um... not really, not that I noticed. Maybe if I just… sit still? But I can't always sit still, you know? I'm a roofer. I gotta keep working. Does that make sense? I don't take anything for it.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Aron. Working as a roofer definitely complicates things. Okay, so no relief with rest or anything you’ve tried. Has the pain radiated anywhere – like to your arm, jaw, neck, or back?
PATIENT: No, not really. It stays… here. Maybe a little in my shoulder sometimes, but not much. It's mostly just… in the chest. It doesn't feel like it's going anywhere else, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, localized to the chest, occasionally a little in the shoulder. Any shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, or sweating along with the pain?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I haven’t felt sick or anything. I get tired from the work, but that's... normal, you know? Not dizzy or sweaty, just... tired. And no trouble breathing. It's just the pain, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. No associated symptoms like shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, or sweating. Just the chest pain. And it’s not related to exertion other than general work fatigue. Do you have any past medical problems, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t really been to a doctor in… a long time. Maybe when I was a kid, but I don’t remember. I usually just try to tough things out. My wife… she worries about me, but I tell her I'm okay. I'm pretty healthy, I think. I eat okay, work hard. Nothing serious, ever.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospitals. Like I said, I pretty much just avoid doctors if I can. I've been lucky, I guess. Never had anything bad happen. Just this chest pain now. It’s… a little worrying. My wife wants me to come get it checked, so here I am.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. And it's good you’re here, Aron, and listening to your wife. Just to be thorough, any family history of heart problems, like heart attacks or strokes?
PATIENT: Hmm... my dad, he had some trouble with his heart when he got old. I think he had something... blockage, maybe? He was pretty sick before he passed. My mom, she was okay, mostly. No strokes, I don't think. It was a long time ago, I don't really remember much. They lived far away, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart problems – father with a blockage, to the best of your recollection. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never liked it. I drink a little beer sometimes, with dinner. Just one or two, not much. And no, nothing else. Just the beer. I need to be clear-headed for work, you know? Can’t be up on a roof if you’re… not yourself.
DOCTOR: Alright, minimal alcohol use. And you’re taking no medications currently, correct?
PATIENT: That's right. No medications. Just… sometimes I take something for aches, like ibuprofen, if I’ve been working really hard. But that's it. Not every day, just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Aron. Just ibuprofen as needed for aches. Last question before I listen to your heart and lungs, are you allergic to anything – medications, food, insect stings?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My wife tries to make sure I don't eat anything weird. No problems with bugs or anything, either. I've been stung by bees a few times, but nothing bad happened. I think I'm okay. You can check if you want, but I don’t think I'm allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Aron, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll feel around your chest wall. It might be a little uncomfortable if it’s muscle related. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. I’m ready. Just tell me if anything hurts too much. Like you said, maybe it’s just my muscles. I’ve been lifting a lot of shingles lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, take some deep breaths for me. In… and out… Good. Alright. I'm feeling around your chest wall now. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little bit on the left side. Like… right here. It’s not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a bruise, almost. It feels the same as the pain I told you about. It's definitely worse when you push on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, localized tenderness to palpation on the left side of your chest. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, which is good. Your heart rhythm is regular, but I'm going to order an EKG just to be safe, given your chest pain and family history. It’s a quick, painless test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An EKG? What’s that… do? Is it… serious? I don’t want a bunch of tests if it’s just a sore muscle.
DOCTOR: It’s not serious, Aron, just a precaution. An EKG is a quick test that checks the electrical activity of your heart. It helps us rule out any heart problems. It's a standard procedure for chest pain, especially with your family history. It doesn’t involve any needles or anything like that—just some stickers on your chest. It takes about five minutes. It’s better to be safe and check things out, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… if it's quick and doesn't hurt, then yes, that's okay. Five minutes… that's not so bad. I guess it's better to be sure. My wife will be happy I'm getting it checked out. Where do we go?
DOCTOR: Great. I'll have the nurse come in and get you set up for the EKG. It’s just down the hall in the testing room. After that, we’ll discuss the results and come up with a plan. It’s possible it is just muscle soreness, but we need to rule out anything more serious first. The nurse will explain everything. I'll be right back to check on you after the EKG.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you checking things out.
