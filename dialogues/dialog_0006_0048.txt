DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it's…difficult to explain. It’s like my head just…goes somewhere else for a bit. Not all the time, thankfully. My wife, she’s been worried, says I ask the same questions twice in an hour sometimes. Honestly, I haven't noticed, but she's quite observant, that one.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. So, a kind of…spacing out, or moments where you’re not quite fully present?
PATIENT: “Spacing out” is a good way to put it, yes. Though it feels more…disorienting than just daydreaming. Like a piece of the puzzle is missing. And it’s not like I’m unaware…it’s just…things don’t make sense while it’s happening. I still know who I am, and where I am, generally. It’s just…frustrating. I’ve always had a good memory, you know. Used to be able to recall dates and figures without a second thought. Now…sometimes I feel like I'm losing it. Though, to be fair, I am getting on in years.
DOCTOR: Right, disorientation, not a complete loss of awareness. And this is relatively new, you said?
PATIENT: Relatively. It started…oh, maybe six months ago? At first, it was just a few times, easily dismissed. But it's been happening more often lately. And my wife…she keeps a very detailed calendar, and she’s pointed out the repetitions, the questions I’ve already asked. She’s…a bit of a worrier, my wife. But she’s usually right about these things. It's just… unsettling, you know? A good tile setter needs his wits about him. Can’t be forgetting where the cuts are supposed to go.
DOCTOR: Okay. And, just to clarify – when these episodes happen, how long do they typically last?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It’s hard to say precisely. Sometimes it's just a few seconds, a momentary lapse. Other times…maybe a minute or two? It’s difficult to gauge when you’re…in it, I suppose. It doesn't feel like a long time, but my wife says I’m quite out of it during those moments. She’ll be talking to me, and I just…stare blankly, then ask her to repeat herself. And I don't remember the first time she told me anything. It's just…snippets, really. Like pieces of a dream.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from this…spacing out, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm…let me think. My appetite hasn’t been the best lately, though I put that down to the heat. It's been a scorcher this summer. And I've been a bit more…irritable, perhaps. Snapping at my wife more than usual. Which I feel terrible about, of course. But other than that…no, not really. I sleep alright, I think. Though I do get up a couple of times a night to…you know. An old man’s problems. But I wouldn’t say those are changes, exactly. It's just getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any prescriptions, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I have a prescription for blood pressure, Lisinopril, I believe it's called. Been on that for years. And my doctor, Dr. Pham, she suggested a Vitamin D supplement last winter, said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. I take one of those every day. And my wife makes me take fish oil, says it’s good for the brain. Honestly, I don’t see much difference, but she’s insistent. That's it, really. Nothing else. I don’t hold with all those fancy pills. Natural is best, I always say.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I've always been a strong constitution, you see. My mother always said I could eat anything. Though, I’m not much for shellfish. Gives me a bit of a stomach ache, but that's not an allergy, is it? Just a…disagreement. I've never had a problem with any of the blood pressure medication, either. Dr. Pham checks it regularly. She’s a very good doctor, Dr. Pham. Though, she's awfully young, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And let’s quickly touch on your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. Nothing major, a routine procedure. And I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Oh, and I had a bad fall a couple of years ago, broke my wrist. That was a nuisance, but the bone healed nicely. Otherwise… no, nothing serious. I’ve always been quite healthy, all things considered. A good, strong Khmer build, you see. We're a hardy people. Though, these things happen when you get old, of course. The body isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any family history of memory problems or neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My mother, she… well, she got very forgetful towards the end. But it was just old age, we thought. She lived to be ninety-two, a long life. And my uncle, on my father's side, he had some trouble with his hands shaking when he was older, but nobody ever said anything about Parkinson’s. It wasn’t something people talked about much, you see. We didn’t have doctors coming around every other week like you do now. It was just…part of getting old. I suppose it could have been something, but nobody ever knew for sure. My wife, she's always worried about these things, always reading articles. But honestly, I don’t put much stock in it. Every family has its…quirks.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a basic neurological assessment – just some simple tests of balance and coordination. And I'll listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose so. I always distrust these things, if I’m honest. Always poking and prodding. But I understand you need to do your job. Just…try not to take too long, alright? I have a tile job I need to get back to this afternoon. And my wife will be expecting me. A man's gotta keep his wife happy, you know. Go ahead, then. But be gentle, alright? I'm not as young as I used to be. And if it’s going to be uncomfortable, tell me first. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is good. Now, if you could just stand up for me, please. Let’s check your balance. Just try to stand still for a moment. I see a little bit of swaying, but nothing too concerning. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Blood pressure’s always a bit high when the doctor’s around. It’s the anxiety, you see. Always worrying about what you’re going to find. There. Am I following it? I’ve always had good eyesight, even for my age. Used to be able to spot a hairline crack in a tile from twenty paces. Still can, most days. Don’t patronize me with these simple tests. I'm not senile, you know. Just a bit forgetful, that's all. A man gets older, his mind wanders. It’s natural. Now, what’s next? Let’s get this over with. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like you to close your eyes and tell me when I touch your hands. And can you tell me the date today?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Touch me, then. There… and… there. Is that it? The date… hmm. Let me think. It’s… August. Definitely August. And… the second. Yes, August the second. 2025. Is that what you wanted to know? Honestly, these tests are rather pointless, aren’t they? I remember dates perfectly well. Used to be able to recite historical events backwards. Now, what's next? I have a reputation to uphold. A good tile setter never forgets a date, especially a job deadline. Don't waste my time with silly games.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just one more thing. I’m going to say three words, and I’d like you to repeat them back to me after I say them. Try to remember them. The words are: apple, table, penny. Apple, table, penny. Now, can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. There. Done. Is that it? Honestly, these are… elementary. I could do this in my sleep. I have a much better memory than this, you know. I remember every tile I’ve ever laid, every client I’ve ever worked with. Every detail. These simple words… they’re insulting, frankly. You’re treating me like a child. Now, what are we getting to? Are you going to find something wrong with me? My wife will be beside herself. She worries about everything. I tell her, I'm just getting old. That's all. But she doesn’t listen. Now, can we finish this already? I have work to do, and a wife who is expecting me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you for your patience. That will be all for the physical exam. I need a moment to review my notes and then we can discuss some possible causes for your symptoms. It’s good that you have a very observant wife. It’s important to remember we are still gathering information, and these tests are just a starting point.
PATIENT: Finally. Good riddance. Honestly, this whole experience has been rather… unpleasant. You doctors poke and prod and ask silly questions. It’s all very… undignified. Just tell me what’s wrong, alright? I don’t want a lot of complicated explanations. I just want to know if I’m losing my mind or not. And if I am, I want to know what I can do about it. I have a reputation to uphold, you see. A good tile setter needs to be sharp. Now, get on with it. My time is valuable. And please, don’t tell me it’s just old age. I already know that. I need a solution, not a diagnosis. My wife will be asking questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Based on what you’ve told me, and the initial exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some cognitive changes – specifically, difficulties with memory and concentration. These can have many causes, and it’s important to rule out other possibilities before jumping to any conclusions. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which we'll want to monitor. I'm seeing here that you were diagnosed with hypertension a few years ago, and are currently on Lisinopril. Given your symptoms, and your age, one possibility we need to consider is mild cognitive impairment, or MCI. But it could also be caused by other factors like stress, medication side effects, or even a vitamin deficiency. It's important to be thorough. I'd like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies and rule out other medical conditions. And I’d also like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. They can perform more detailed testing and help us determine the cause of your symptoms. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Neurologist? More tests? This is getting ridiculous. I’m not senile, you know. I just forget things sometimes. It’s a natural part of getting old. Blood tests, fine. But I don’t want to be poked and prodded by some…brain doctor. They’ll just find something wrong with me. My wife will be beside herself. I don’t like the sound of this, not one bit. What kind of testing will this…neurologist do? Are they going to stick needles in my brain? I don't want to be a guinea pig. Honestly, I came here because I was a little forgetful, not because I was falling apart. I've lived a long life. I've built things, I've worked hard. I don't need a bunch of doctors telling me what's wrong with me. If it's just old age, then so be it. I'll deal with it. But I don't want to be subjected to a battery of tests. And what about my work? Who is going to lay the tiles while I'm off getting poked and prodded? You doctors don't seem to understand that people have lives, responsibilities. This is all very… disruptive. I need to think about this. A neurologist… I'm not sure. Perhaps we can just monitor things for a while. See if it gets worse. I don't want to rush into anything. Is that an option?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and worried about what a neurologist might find. And you're right to be concerned about your work and responsibilities. That’s very important. Let me assure you, the neurologist isn’t going to stick needles in your brain. The testing is non-invasive – it involves things like answering questions, performing simple memory tasks, and maybe some basic coordination exercises. It’s like an extended version of what we did today. The purpose of the referral isn’t to find something wrong with you, it's to get a clearer understanding of what's going on and determine the best course of action. It’s about being proactive and taking care of your health. We can certainly start by monitoring your symptoms for a few weeks. I'll order the blood tests to rule out any underlying deficiencies. And I can provide you with some resources on maintaining cognitive health – things like puzzles and memory exercises. But if your symptoms worsen, or if you start to experience any new difficulties, I strongly recommend we schedule an appointment with the neurologist. Does that sound like a reasonable compromise?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Blood tests, I can handle. And some…puzzles? I suppose that won't hurt. My wife will be pleased. She's always telling me to keep my mind active. But no neurologist, not right now. If things get worse…well, we’ll see. I don’t want to make any promises. I have a reputation to uphold, you see. I can’t be disappearing for appointments. What kind of puzzles are we talking about? Crosswords? Sudoku? I prefer something…practical. Something that involves building things, maybe. And what about the blood tests? Will they take a lot of blood? I don’t like needles. Honestly, I’ve always had a weak stomach. And please, don’t tell my wife everything. I don’t want her fussing over me. She worries enough as it is. Just tell her I’m getting a check-up. That’s all. Is that understood? Blood tests, puzzles, and no neurologist, for now. And keep it quiet, alright? I have a life to live. A good tile setter never lets a little forgetfulness slow him down.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Lason, I understand completely. Blood tests, puzzles, and no neurologist for now. We'll keep it quiet, and I'll only tell your wife that you're getting a routine check-up. The blood tests will require a standard amount of blood – about two vials. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and we can make it as comfortable as possible. We have a comfortable chair, and you can distract yourself while it's happening. As for the puzzles, I’ll give you a list with a variety of options – crosswords, Sudoku, brain teasers, and even some spatial reasoning exercises that involve building and construction. Something practical, just as you suggested. I’ll also include some resources on maintaining a healthy lifestyle – things like getting enough sleep, managing stress, and eating a balanced diet. I'll order the blood tests now, and I'll print out the list of puzzles for you. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to discuss the results and see how you're feeling. If your symptoms worsen before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just…try to keep it simple, alright? I don’t need a lot of complicated instructions. I’ve lived a long life. I know how to take care of myself. And please, don't treat me like a child. I’m still a capable man. A good tile setter never loses his edge. Just…get me the blood tests and the puzzles. And let me get back to work. My wife will be wondering where I am. Thank you. I suppose. Now, if you'll excuse me… I have a reputation to uphold. A good tile setter never keeps his clients waiting. A lot of money depends on that.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. I understand completely. I'll have the blood test requisition and the puzzle list ready for you right away. And I certainly won't treat you like a child. I respect your experience and capabilities. I’m glad we were able to discuss your concerns. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or if anything changes. Have a good day, Mr. Lason. And please, take care of yourself. .
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. And tell your staff to be gentle with the needle. I have a weak stomach, you know. .
