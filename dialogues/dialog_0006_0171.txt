DOCTOR: Alright, Lacreasha, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: My nails. They... they just look funny. Not good funny. I don't remember how they got like this, exactly. Just noticed it, you know? A few weeks ago, maybe? They're kinda... discolored. And thick. It's weird.
DOCTOR: Discolored and thick, okay. A few weeks ago you noticed it. Hmm. And just to be clear, all your nails are affected, or is it just some of them?
PATIENT: Oh, not all of them. Just... most. I think. Let me see... Yeah, mostly these ones. Not the little ones on my thumbs, though. Those are okay. I think. It's hard to keep track, honestly. Everything just...blends together these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly on the fingers, not the thumbs. And you said a few weeks ago you noticed the changes… any pain or discomfort with them?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. Maybe a little... when I try to do things, like open jars. But I always have trouble with jars, so I don't know if that's the nails, or just me. They don't hurt hurt, if you know what I mean. Just... inconvenient. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Inconvenient, not painful. Alright. Have you noticed any changes around the nails themselves?
PATIENT: Around them? Like... the skin? Oh! Now that you mention it… yeah, kinda. It's all… flaky. And a little red. Not bad red, just… irritated. I thought it was from the dish soap, maybe. I do a lot of washing up. I don't know. Everything feels… off.
DOCTOR: Flaky and irritated skin around the nails… alright. And you thought it might be the dish soap. Hmm. Have you tried any creams or treatments for it so far?
PATIENT: Creams? No, not really. I had some lotion, but it didn’t do anything. I mostly just ignore it. What's the point if it’s just gonna come back? I don't bother with all that stuff, honestly. It's a waste of money. Plus, I forget where I put things anyway. I'd lose the cream.
DOCTOR: Okay, no treatments tried. Alright. Now, have you had any similar issues with your nails in the past, or anything like this with your skin elsewhere on your body?
PATIENT: Similar issues? Oh… I… I think my grandma had something like this. Her nails were always… funny-looking. But she lived in… oh, what was that place? Not here. Somewhere with mountains. I don’t remember exactly. And I get kinda itchy sometimes, but everyone gets itchy, right? I don’t think that’s important. Mostly just the nails.
DOCTOR: Alright, Grandma had similar issues, some itchiness. Now, just to get a full picture, can you tell me about any other medical problems you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a tough one. Let me think... I have… the usual old lady stuff. You know, aches and pains. I see Dr. Peterson for my blood pressure, sometimes. And I had my hip done, years ago. A long time ago. What else... Oh! Medicare pays for a lot. Does that count? I can't really remember all of it, to be honest. It's all a blur. I’m sorry, I’m not very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, don’t worry about it. High blood pressure with Dr. Peterson, hip replacement a while ago. We can always look through your records. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Medications... Um… I think so. Little white pills. Or maybe they're pink? No, wait, definitely white. I take them every morning. But Dr. Peterson keeps changing them, so I don't even bother trying to remember the names. He says they make me feel better, but they all feel the same. I just take whatever he gives me. Honestly, I just try not to forget to take something.
DOCTOR: Okay, some white pills for blood pressure, changing medications. Let’s take a look at your hands more closely. I see some thickening and discoloration on several of your nails, with some flaky skin around the edges. There doesn't appear to be any active inflammation. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, goodness. Let me see... I think I was itchy once after eating shrimp. But I eat shrimp all the time! So, it wasn't that bad. And I get a little sniffly in the spring, but everyone does, right? I don't really have serious allergies, if that makes sense. Nothing I worry about. Itchy and sniffly… that’s about it. Mostly just the nails are the problem, really. They're just… unsightly.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild allergy to shrimp, seasonal allergies. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the examination, it sounds like you might have a fungal infection of the nails, also known as onychomycosis. It's quite common. It's not usually serious, but it can be stubborn to treat. We can take a sample to confirm. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Fungal… what now? A sample? You mean… like take a piece of my nail? That sounds… unpleasant. Is it going to hurt? I don't like things that hurt. And stubborn? Oh dear. That doesn't sound good at all. I don’t know… is there anything else we can do? Maybe just… put some cream on it? Like lotion? I really don't like the sound of taking a piece of my nail.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. It’s a small scraping, like filing your nail a little bit. It shouldn't be painful, just a little uncomfortable. And the sample is really the best way to know for sure what we're dealing with, so we can choose the right treatment. If we don’t confirm it, treatment can be hit or miss. The cream you’re thinking of, anti-fungal cream, can be used, but it doesn't always work because it can't penetrate the nail very well. There are also oral medications, but those have potential side effects, and we’d need to do some blood tests first. Let’s start with the nail scraping. If you’re still uncomfortable, we can discuss other options, but I think it’s the most helpful step right now. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh dear, oh dear. Blood tests?! No, no blood tests. Definitely not. And you said it doesn't work very well anyway, the cream? No, I don’t want to take pills, and I don’t want blood tests, and I don't want to waste my time on something that doesn’t even work! Maybe… maybe it will just go away on its own? Everything usually does, eventually. Can we just… wait and see? I’ll try to keep it short. And maybe use some lotion. I really don’t like the sound of any of those other things. It sounds very… complicated.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can certainly try a “wait and see” approach with lotion. However, I do want to be clear that fungal infections rarely go away on their own and can sometimes spread. Since you’re hesitant about more aggressive treatment at this time, we’ll document your preference. Keep the nails short and clean, and try a good moisturizing lotion a couple of times a day. If you notice any changes—increased pain, spreading discoloration, or swelling—please call the office right away. I’ll write you a note summarizing this discussion, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to see if there’s any improvement. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Three months? Oh. That’s… a long time. But… okay. As long as I don’t have to take any pills or get anything scraped off. And I can just use lotion. Yes, that sounds… alright. A note would be good. I forget things so easily. So, three months, and lotion. And I’ll call if… if it gets worse. Thank you, doctor. I think. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lacreasha. I'll have the nurse print out that note for you. If anything changes before then, don’t hesitate to call, even if it’s just a question. Have a good day.
