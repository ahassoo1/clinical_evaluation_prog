DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don't see why I had to come in. It's just a number, right? My husband makes me come to these things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, while it is just a number, that number tells us a lot about your health, and it's good you're taking it seriously enough to come in. The nurse called with some readings, but I like to get a bit more detail myself. When did you first find out your blood pressure was elevated?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't remember the exact date. Sometime last month, I think. My husband’s coworker has one of those machines and he checked it at a barbeque. That's how we found out. It was probably a bad machine, though. People always mess with those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a barbeque last month. And you’re right to question it, home machines aren't always accurate. Has anyone – a doctor, nurse, anyone – confirmed it since then?
PATIENT: The nurse here did, I guess. Took it twice. But she seemed…young. Not trying to be rude, but I like a doctor with a bit more experience, you know? Like yourself. Still, it’s probably nothing. My dad lived to be 80, perfectly healthy. Genes, right?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Dudney, and I appreciate you telling me that. Family history is important, and 80 is a good age. But even with good genes, we still need to check things out. Just to get a complete picture, have you been experiencing any symptoms – headaches, vision changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. A little stressed, maybe, with work, but that’s it. It's always something, isn't it? Always trying to find something wrong with people. Honestly, I really don’t have time for this. I have a deadline on Friday.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure myself to confirm the readings. Then we can discuss next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just hurry, please. I parked in a two-hour zone.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit back and relax… First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Sounds clear. Now let’s check your pulse. Normal rate. And finally, let’s get a blood pressure reading. Okay… 148 over 92. A bit elevated, unfortunately, confirming the nurse’s readings. Anything feel particularly tight or uncomfortable while I’m taking your blood pressure?
PATIENT: See? It is my husband overreacting. It's probably just the stress of the project. I told him I was fine. Honestly, I don’t need pills or whatever you’re going to suggest. I just need to get this report done. Is that it? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: While it could be stress, Ms. Dudney, consistently elevated blood pressure, even without symptoms, can lead to more serious problems down the line – heart disease, stroke, kidney problems. It's not something we can ignore. Before we talk about medication, let’s run some basic blood work – cholesterol, kidney function, just to get a clearer picture of your overall health. It’s a simple test, and it will give us more information. Also, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle – diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests. Look, I eat reasonably healthy. I try. And I don't smoke. My husband drinks, but I maybe have a glass of wine with dinner once a week. Exercise? Not really. I sit at a computer all day. It’s a desk job! Honestly, I don't see what any of this has to do with my blood pressure. It’s just a number. Can’t you just…tell me it’s fine and let me go? I have people waiting on me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand your frustration, truly. But dismissing this as "just a number" isn't responsible medical care. Your lifestyle absolutely contributes. A sedentary job, even occasional alcohol consumption…these things matter. And while I can't definitively tell you it's fine without more information, the readings are concerning enough that we need to investigate further. We're not necessarily talking about medication right now. Let's start with the blood work, and then we can discuss some lifestyle modifications – dietary changes, exercise, stress management techniques – that may help lower your blood pressure naturally. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood work. Just...tell the lab to be quick about it. And I swear, if I get a bill for more than a basic checkup, I'm calling my insurance. And my husband. He handles all that. I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll put in the order for a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel. The lab is just down the hall; the technician will be expecting you. It shouldn't take long. While you’re there, they’ll also need to take your height and weight. Here’s the form. Once you have the results, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me, and we can discuss them. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a handout with information on healthy eating and exercise. It's just a starting point, but it might be helpful. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Just where is this lab, exactly? And please, don’t make me come back if it’s nothing. I have deadlines.
DOCTOR: It’s just two doors down on the left. They’ll call me with the results, and the receptionist will schedule your follow-up appointment. And I understand about your deadlines, Ms. Dudney. We're not trying to cause you any trouble, just want to make sure you're healthy. Have a good day.
