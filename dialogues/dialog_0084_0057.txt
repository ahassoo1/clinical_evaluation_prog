DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Chellsea. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… well, it's about the cancer. I was told to come speak with someone.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see here you were recently given some concerning news. Can you tell me a little bit more about what you were told?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Um… it was about a month ago now. They found something during a routine check-up. A mass, they called it. And… and then they did more tests and said it was cancer. I don’t… I don’t really understand all the details, to be honest. It was a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It is a lot to take in. And a month ago feels like a lifetime when you’re processing something like this. Do you know what type of cancer they said it was, or where the mass was located?
PATIENT: They said it was… uh… something to do with the breast. And… invasive? I think that was the word they used. I don’t know what invasive means exactly. And it’s in the… left one. I think that's right. It's all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, invasive ductal carcinoma in the left breast. That gives us a starting point. And have you seen any other doctors since that initial diagnosis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. You're the first. Like I said, it happened a month ago and… I didn't know where to start. My husband… he always handled things like this.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m glad you came in today. We’ll figure things out together. First, I want to get a better understanding of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. Just the usual childhood things, I guess. Nothing major. And… I had my appendix out when I was a little girl. That’s about it. No other surgeries, and I don't really get sick often. I always felt pretty healthy, before this.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child, otherwise generally healthy. And what about your family?
PATIENT: That's… a difficult question, Doctor. My mother passed away when I was young. And my father… he wasn’t around much. I don’t know much about their medical history, to be honest. I don’t think they talked about those things. I have an aunt, but I haven’t seen her in years. I don't know if she has any health problems.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s perfectly alright. It’s not always possible to have that information. Let’s talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I don’t like the smell of it. And my husband… he didn’t either. He always said it was bad for you. I don't drink much either, just maybe a glass of wine on special occasions. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I try to stay away from those things if I can. I prefer to just… tough things out, if I get a headache or something. I haven't really needed anything regular. Just sometimes some ibuprofen for aches, but it's very rare.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications, occasional ibuprofen. Now, I'd like to do a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. We’ll just take a look at your overall health and, of course, examine the area of concern. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. I guess I should do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Okay. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Everything sounds clear. I’m going to check your lymph nodes now. This might be a little uncomfortable, just let me know if it’s painful. A few nodes are palpable, but they don't feel significantly enlarged at this time. Now, I'm going to examine your breasts. Please lie back on the table and put your arms above your head.
PATIENT: Okay. Is… is this going to hurt, Doctor? I’m a little worried. It's just... difficult to think about.
DOCTOR: It might be a little uncomfortable, but I’ll be as gentle as possible. I'm just feeling for any abnormalities and assessing the size and location of the mass. I do feel a mass in the upper outer quadrant of your left breast. It’s approximately… 2 centimeters in diameter, firm, and slightly irregular in shape. The skin overlying the mass appears normal, with no redness or dimpling. No palpable masses in the right breast. Okay, Chellsea. I’ve completed the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, the next step is to get a more detailed look at the mass. We need to do some imaging and likely a biopsy.
PATIENT: A biopsy? What… what does that involve, Doctor? I’m getting very scared now. I don't think I can do this.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Chellsea. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of the mass to be examined under a microscope. It’s the only way to confirm a diagnosis. There are different types of biopsies. The most common is a core needle biopsy, which uses a small needle to remove a few tiny pieces of tissue. It’s usually done in the doctor’s office with local anesthesia, so you won’t feel much pain. There is a small risk of bleeding or infection, but it’s generally a very safe procedure. We’ll also need to get a mammogram and possibly an ultrasound to get a better look at the mass and see if it has spread to any other areas. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: I… I don’t know, Doctor. It sounds… scary. And painful. Will I know right away if it's bad? I just… I don’t want to think about it being bad. My husband… he would have known what to ask. I'm sorry, I'm probably being silly. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: You're not being silly at all, Chellsea. It is a lot to take in, and it's perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed and scared. And it’s okay to grieve the support you’ve lost with your husband. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll be here to explain everything every step of the way. We won’t rush into anything. As for knowing right away, the biopsy results will take a few days to come back. And I'll be here to discuss them with you in detail when they do. We'll talk about all your options and make a plan together. I know this is a lot to process, and I see your appointment time is almost up. Before we finish, do you have any immediate questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: Um… Will… will it hurt a lot if it is cancer? I’ve heard… bad things. And will I lose my breast? Is that… automatic? I’m sorry, I’m probably asking too much.
DOCTOR: Those are very important questions, Chellsea, and you’re not asking too much at all. It's good you’re asking them. As for pain, that depends on the stage and type of cancer, and how it’s treated. We have excellent pain management options available, and we'll do everything we can to keep you comfortable. Regarding losing your breast, it’s not automatic. There are many treatment options, including lumpectomy, which removes only the cancer and some surrounding tissue, and mastectomy, which removes the entire breast. The best option depends on the size and location of the cancer, your overall health, and your personal preferences. We’ll discuss all the pros and cons of each option before making any decisions. I want you to know that you have options, and you are in control of your treatment. Before you leave, I’m going to schedule you for a mammogram and ultrasound. I also want to refer you to an oncologist, a cancer specialist, who can discuss your treatment options in more detail. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be… good. An oncologist sounds… helpful. And the tests… I guess I should do whatever you think is best. Thank you, Doctor Voytek. For… everything. I don't know what I would do without someone explaining things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. I'm glad I could help. My nurse will schedule those tests for you before you leave. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, even after you've left the office. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Take care, Chellsea. And remember, you are not alone in this.
