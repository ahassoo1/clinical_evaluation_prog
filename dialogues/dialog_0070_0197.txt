DOCTOR: Good morning, San Sciarrotta. Welcome to San SCIARROTTA clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, I need to get a card so I can drive for a ride-share company. Something about a commercial driver’s medical card, I think? It’s all new to me. I mostly just operate logging equipment, you see. I need to make a bit of extra money.
DOCTOR: Yes, the commercial driver’s medical card, also known as a DOT physical. Absolutely. We perform those here. It’s a fairly comprehensive exam to ensure you meet the health standards for safe commercial driving. Before we begin, just to confirm, are you currently experiencing any health problems or have any concerns that might affect your ability to drive safely?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major, anyway. My knees ache a bit after a long day, but that’s just old age, I suppose. And sometimes my back… well, the same thing. But I can still get around fine. I was working just yesterday, operating the feller buncher. It's heavy work, you know? I don't feel sick, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It’s good you’re still active. We’ll certainly assess those aches and pains as part of the exam. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about the knee and back pain?
PATIENT: Well, the knees… it’s mostly when I’m bending and squatting, getting in and out of the equipment. It’s a dull ache, not sharp. The back is more of a stiffness, really. Especially in the mornings. Gets better as I move around. I haven’t been to a doctor about it in… oh, goodness, probably ten years. Just took some over-the-counter pain relievers when it flares up. Ibuprofen, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen for occasional flare-ups of knee and back pain. And you haven't sought medical attention for either in about ten years. That’s helpful to know. Before we move on to the physical exam, let’s briefly review your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes, Doctor. I was diagnosed about fifteen years ago. I take a pill for it, every morning. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. Other than that… no, nothing major. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was a long time ago and no problems since. No diabetes, no heart trouble. I don’t think so, anyway. I haven’t been to the doctor regularly, as I said.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure managed with Lisinopril for fifteen years, and a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – in the past. That's good information, thank you. Now, before we begin the exam, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the Lisinopril, Doctor. And…oh! I take a vitamin D supplement. My daughter told me I should, said I wasn't getting enough sun. It's a small dose, just one tablet a day. Nothing else, I promise. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly fish and vegetables.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for hypertension and a daily Vitamin D supplement. That’s good to know. Now, let’s move on to the physical exam. I’m going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature – and then we’ll do a basic neurological exam, vision and hearing screening, and assess your musculoskeletal system. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m not as young as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We'll take things at a comfortable pace. First, let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Blood pressure is 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not unexpected given you mentioned high blood pressure. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let’s check your vision. Can you read the letters on this chart, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… let me see. The top line… E, F, P… Oh, and that one looks like a… L? It’s a bit blurry, Doctor. I think my glasses need adjusting. I usually don’t wear them for everything, just when I’m reading small print.
DOCTOR: Alright, vision is slightly reduced, as you noted. We'll note that down. It's good you're aware of it. Now, let's check your hearing. I’m going to place some headphones over your ears and ask you to tell me when you hear a tone. Okay, it appears you have some mild high-frequency hearing loss, which is common with age. Now, let's move on to the musculoskeletal exam. I’m going to check your range of motion in your joints, and assess your strength and reflexes. Please let me know if anything causes you pain. Alright, I'm noting some mild stiffness and crepitus in your knees, and limited range of motion in several joints. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m a bit worried about my knees, to be honest. They’ve been bothering me more lately. Especially when it’s cold.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal and symmetric, which is good. I’m also noting a slight limp in your gait, primarily on your right side. Now, I'm going to perform a quick neurological exam. This will involve checking your balance and coordination. Please stand with your feet together and close your eyes. You have some mild unsteadiness when standing with your eyes closed, which is something we’ll note. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on my findings, you have some mild hearing loss, some stiffness and crepitus in your knees, a slight limp, and some mild unsteadiness. Your blood pressure is also slightly elevated. It's important to manage this effectively. Do you have any questions about anything I've found so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds like a lot. Well, no, not really. I mean, I knew my knees weren’t great. And I’ve been told my hearing isn’t what it used to be. I suppose I’m just getting old. The blood pressure… is that bad? Will that stop me from getting the card? I really need this job, Doctor. I was hoping everything would be okay.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel concerned, but let’s not jump to conclusions. It's good you're proactive about your health. The elevated blood pressure is something we need to address, but it doesn't automatically disqualify you for the commercial driver’s license. It does mean you may need to get it under better control, potentially with medication adjustments or lifestyle changes. Based on my findings, I’m not comfortable clearing you for a commercial driver’s license at this time. I want to recommend that you follow up with your primary care physician to discuss managing your blood pressure and addressing the stiffness in your knees. It might also be helpful to get a referral to a physical therapist to help improve your strength and balance. Would you like me to provide you with a written summary of my findings and recommendations?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Yes, please. A written summary would be good. That way, I can show it to my doctor. And… thank you, Doctor. Even if it’s not what I wanted to hear, I appreciate you being honest with me. I suppose I should have gotten this checked out sooner. And… what happens now? Do I need to schedule another appointment here, after I see my doctor?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. It's always best to be thorough when it comes to your health. Here’s a written summary of my findings, including the elevated blood pressure, mild hearing loss, knee stiffness, limited range of motion, and slight limp. I’ve also included my recommendations for follow-up with your primary care physician and a potential referral to physical therapy. Once you’ve seen your primary care physician and addressed the blood pressure, you can schedule a follow-up appointment here. We can reassess your condition and determine if you meet the requirements for the commercial driver’s license. It may involve repeating some of the tests we did today. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding activities that exacerbate your knee pain and staying as active as possible within your limitations. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. And… Here’s my insurance card, Medicare. And… is there a copay for this visit? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. Yes, there is a $30 copay for this visit, payable at the front desk. Here is your copy of the Medical Summary. Please be sure to share this with your primary care physician. If you have any questions after your appointment, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. We wish you all the best, and please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I think that’s everything. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, San Sciarrotta. Take care, and we look forward to seeing you again soon. .
