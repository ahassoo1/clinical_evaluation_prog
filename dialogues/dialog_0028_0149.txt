DOCTOR: Right. Wynell Gunasekara, 83 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, honey, it’s not bringing me in. I came because… well, my daughter insisted. She fusses over everything. Says I need to “get checked.” What is there to check? I’ve lived a long life, haven’t I? A good long life. And I know my own body. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Daughters often worry. Still, a check-up isn’t a bad idea at any age. Let’s just… go through some things. It will be quicker if you just answer directly. Now, are you experiencing any specific problems?
PATIENT: Problems? Goodness gracious. What kind of problems are you asking about? My feet are a little sore, maybe. But that’s just… old age. And standing too long at church. I don't go around complaining about everything, you know. Some people just want to make a mountain out of a molehill. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Sore feet… alright. And anything else?
PATIENT: Honestly? My memory ain’t what it used to be. But I get by. I don't need a list of things wrong with me to remind me I’m getting older. It's perfectly obvious, isn't it? I just… don’t like being poked and prodded. Is that so wrong?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not wrong. But we need to gather information. A decline in memory can be a sign of several things. Now, can you tell me – and try to be specific – have you noticed any recent changes in your memory?
PATIENT: Recent changes… oh dear. That’s a tricky one. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy these days. I forget where I put my glasses sometimes, even though they’re usually on my head. And names… oh, the names. I see people from church and… well, it just doesn’t stick. But that happens to everyone, doesn’t it? It's not like I'm forgetting important things. Not yet, anyway.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you having any difficulty with things like… managing your finances?
PATIENT: Finances? Oh, my daughter handles all that now. Always has, really. I never was very good with numbers. She says I’d spend it all on… well, never you mind what she says. But yes, she does it. Perfectly capable girl, that one. A bit bossy, but capable. So, no, I don’t have any difficulty with it. I don’t do it, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: I understand. And any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite's fine. I like a good meal, always have. Though, I don’t eat as much as I used to. Everything tastes a little… bland these days. Not that I'm complaining, mind you. I'm just saying. And weight… well, I’ve always been a skinny thing. Never been one to put on weight, thank goodness. It’s a curse, really. Everything hangs so loose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your weight is listed as 100 pounds. That is quite low. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Unintentional? Well… I suppose so. I haven’t been trying to lose weight. It just… happened. Maybe I’m not eating enough. But like I said, everything tastes so… muted. It's hard to get excited about food when it doesn't taste like anything. Honestly, I think I’m just getting old. Everything’s losing its flavor, you know? Not just the food.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It won’t take long. Please, have a seat. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re going to poke and prod? I knew it. I don’t like being touched. Really. But… alright. Get it over with. Just be gentle, will you? And don't take too long. I have a luncheon with the ladies from church this afternoon. And Mildred makes a lovely potato salad.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are… slightly diminished, but regular rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, but… some mild guarding. No masses palpable. Your skin is quite thin, and I notice some bruising on your arms. Do you fall often?
PATIENT: Bruising? Oh, that’s just… clumsy me. I bump into things, you know? Old age. Everything feels so fragile these days. And I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be. But I don’t fall often. Just… little stumbles. Nothing to worry about. My daughter keeps fussing about it, says I need a walker. But I’m not ready for a walker yet. I still have some dignity, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking about pills? I don't take many. Just… something for my blood pressure, I think. My daughter handles all that, you know. She says I shouldn't worry my pretty little head about it. Allergies… I don't think so. I haven't had any problems with them. But honestly, I couldn't tell you. I just take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Do you know the name of the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, honey, do I look like a pharmacist? I just swallow the little pills. They're… white, I think. Or maybe they're pink. Honestly, they all look the same to me. I'm 83 years old, not a walking encyclopedia. My daughter keeps a list. Why don't you ask her? She knows everything about my pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to order some blood work and a basic metabolic panel. And I would like to review your medication list. Perhaps your daughter could bring it to a follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Oh, more poking and prodding. Just what I needed. Blood work… Honestly, I don't see the point. But alright. If you insist. And yes, my daughter can bring a list of my pills. She’s always so organized. But honestly, I think I'm perfectly fine. Just a little… old. Is that so terrible?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not terrible. But it’s important to rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. We’ll get the blood work done, review your medications, and then we can discuss a plan. I recommend a follow-up appointment in two weeks. Please take this to the lab. And try to bring that medication list with you next time. .
PATIENT: Oh, alright. More appointments. Honestly, it's exhausting just thinking about it. But alright. I'll try to remember. And yes, I'll tell my daughter about the list. She'll probably have it organized before I even get home. Honestly, I think I need a nap. This whole thing has been rather draining. Thank you… I think.
