DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome. I'm Dr. Roseburroough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… terribly nice to meet you. Oh dear, what did bring me in? It’s these pains, you see. Down low… in my belly. They’ve been… quite severe lately. It's hard to keep track of things these days, but I believe they’ve been happening more often. I do apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, no need to apologize at all. It’s perfectly normal for memory to change as we get older. “Down low in the belly,” okay. Can you tell me a little more about these pains?
PATIENT: Well… they’re not constant, thankfully. They come and go. When they do come, it feels… like a really bad cramp, almost? But… deeper? And sometimes it radiates… goes into my back a little. It's hard to explain. I think they started a few weeks ago, but honestly, the dates… they all blur together. And it’s… concerning, because of… well, the lupus. That’s what the other doctors have said, at least. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Glymph, thank you. Lupus can certainly cause abdominal pain. And radiating pain is helpful to know. So, cramping pain, coming and going, deeper in the belly, sometimes going into your back… and you’ve had lupus diagnosed previously. Do you recall when you were first diagnosed with lupus, and who your lupus specialist is?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that was… a long time ago. I believe it was… Dr. Albright? Yes, Dr. Albright in the city. That was… perhaps fifteen years ago? No, more… twenty, I think. It was before I moved here. Everything’s so… hazy. I saw him regularly for a while, but then… well, things changed. I haven't been back to him in… a very long time. I’ve been managing with my general practitioner since then, but he felt it was best I see someone… more specialized, given these pains. I do apologize for being so vague; it's frustrating for everyone, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Ms. Glymph. We'll get through this. Twenty years with lupus, managed with your general practitioner until recently… that's good to know. Now, besides the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… that's a good question. Sometimes I feel… rather tired, more so than usual. And a little… bloated, I suppose? Nothing terribly dramatic. Oh! And occasionally… a bit of nausea. Not vomiting, just… feeling like I might be sick to my stomach. It comes and goes, like the pain. I’ve also been feeling… a bit warm, generally. But I always feel a bit warm, to be honest, so it’s hard to say if that’s related. Is that helpful? I’m trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Glymph. Fatigue, bloating, nausea… and feeling warm. Those could all be related. Let's talk about your bowels. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements—constipation, diarrhea, blood in the stool—anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that’s… a rather personal question, isn’t it? I… I suppose I have been a bit constipated lately. Yes. It’s not… regular, to put it politely. No blood, thankfully. Just… difficulty. And… less frequent. I haven’t thought much of it, honestly. I tend to… drink a lot of tea, and sometimes that does it. But, now that you mention it… it has been worse recently, alongside the pain. I do apologize for the… bluntness. I'm trying to be thorough.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all. It’s important to be thorough, and I appreciate you sharing that. Constipation alongside the pain is definitely something to note. Now, let's briefly go through some other things. Any fever, chills, or weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I’ve noticed, no. I haven’t taken my temperature, but I don’t feel feverish. Chills, no. Weight loss… that’s possible. I haven’t been eating as much lately. Everything seems… less appealing, and the pain doesn’t help. But I haven’t actually weighed myself, so I couldn't say for certain. It’s just… clothes feel a bit looser, perhaps? And I seem to have less energy for… well, for everything. I'm not sure if that’s related to the weight, though. I’m afraid I’m being terribly unhelpful with specifics.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Ms. Glymph. You're giving me a lot of good information. So, no fever or chills, possible weight loss with decreased appetite and less energy. Let's talk about your medical history briefly. Any surgeries or serious illnesses other than lupus?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Surgeries… I had my appendix out when I was a child, a very long time ago. And… I had a hysterectomy, perhaps ten years ago? No, maybe fifteen? It was… routine, I believe. No complications, thankfully. Serious illnesses… I had pneumonia once, many years ago. And… that’s about it, I think. Nothing major, aside from the lupus, of course. I've always been… rather fortunate, health-wise, all things considered. Until recently, that is. I'm starting to ramble, aren't I? I do apologize.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all. Appendix out as a child, hysterectomy fifteen years ago, pneumonia… good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, good question! Let me think… no known food allergies, thankfully. Medications… I think I had a mild reaction to penicillin once, many years ago. Just a bit of a rash, nothing serious. But I’ve avoided it ever since, just in case. Other than that, no known allergies. I’m quite fortunate, really. Although, I do find myself increasingly sensitive to… the cold, lately. But I hardly think that counts as an allergy. Perhaps it's just old age creeping in.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t count as an allergy. Mild reaction to penicillin… noted. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me see. I take a small dose of… lisinopril, for my blood pressure. And… that’s it, I think. Oh! No, wait. I take a calcium supplement, for my bones. And occasionally… ibuprofen, for aches and pains, when the pain is particularly bad. But not regularly, just… as needed. And sometimes a bit of… chamomile tea, for relaxation. Is that all? I'm afraid I’m quite forgetful, you see. I might be leaving something out.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Lisinopril for blood pressure, calcium supplement, ibuprofen as needed, chamomile tea… that’s good to know. Okay, I see some notes from your general practitioner. It looks like he’s been monitoring your blood pressure and has noted your fatigue. Alright. Ms. Glymph, I'm going to do a quick physical exam now, if that's alright with you. We'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and do a quick neurological check. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. I trust your judgment completely. Please, do whatever you need to do. I’m… rather used to examinations, unfortunately. I’ll just… sit here, won't I? And try to remember to breathe normally.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Glymph. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your reflexes are normal. However, your abdomen is… tender to the touch, particularly in the lower left quadrant. There's no rebound tenderness, thankfully, but it is definitely sensitive. I also feel some mild… guarding in that area. Can you tell me if that’s where you’re experiencing the most pain?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s… exactly where the pain is worst. Lower left quadrant, as you say. It’s… a dull ache, most of the time. But it gets sharper when you press there. And… yes, I do tend to tense up a bit when someone touches it. I hadn’t realized I was doing that, actually. It’s… rather uncomfortable. Is that a bad sign? I do apologize for being such a worry.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Glymph. You're not being a worry at all. It’s good that you point out the discomfort. Tenderness in the lower left quadrant, with some guarding… that is something we need to investigate further. Given your history of lupus, and the findings on the exam, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be a flare-up of your lupus affecting your bowel, diverticulitis, or even something else. To rule things out, I’d like to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A CT scan… that sounds… rather serious, doesn’t it? But… yes, Doctor, if that’s what you think is best, then please do. I trust your judgment completely. I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. Blood work is fine too, of course. Anything to help figure out what’s causing this pain. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the CT scan? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good attitude, Ms. Glymph. It’s better to be thorough. For the CT scan, you’ll need to drink some oral contrast beforehand—it helps to visualize your bowel. The radiology department will give you specific instructions when they call to schedule the appointment. As for the results, it usually takes a few hours to a day for the radiologist to read them, and I’ll discuss them with you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever—something stronger than ibuprofen—to help manage the discomfort. And I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. We'll take it one step at a time. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Pain reliever, avoid lifting… I can manage that. A stronger pain reliever would be most welcome, thank you. Hmm… let me think. I suppose I'm wondering… should I be worried about this being… serious? I know you said a few possibilities, but… is it something that needs immediate attention, or can we wait for the scan results? And… will it interfere with my lupus medications? I apologize for all the questions; I'm just… a bit frightened.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be frightened, Ms. Glymph, and you’re not bothering me with questions at all. To answer your questions, we are taking it seriously, which is why we're ordering the scan. While it may not be an emergency, we need to rule out anything serious, like a bowel obstruction or a severe infection. Given your lupus, we want to be especially cautious. As for your lupus medications, the pain reliever I’m prescribing—tramadol—can interact with some lupus medications, so I'll review your current medication list carefully and adjust the dose accordingly. I'll also contact your general practitioner to coordinate your care. Ultimately, Ms. Glymph, it’s best to wait for the scan results before jumping to any conclusions. We’ll get a clearer picture of what’s going on, and then we can formulate a plan. I will call you as soon as the results are available, and we can discuss them in detail. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that answers everything… for now. Thank you for being so thorough and patient with me. And for explaining everything so clearly. It's… reassuring to know you're taking this seriously and that you're coordinating with my other doctor. I suppose I should… wait for the call, then? And try to rest. Thank you again, Doctor Roseburroough. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. That’s what I’m here for. Yes, please just wait for the call, and try to get some rest. Avoid any strenuous activity, and if the pain becomes significantly worse, or if you develop a fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here’s the prescription for the tramadol, and the contact information for the radiology department. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. In the meantime, please take care.
