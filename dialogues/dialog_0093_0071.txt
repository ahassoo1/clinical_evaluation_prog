DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, sir, it’s about some paperwork. A friend… a younger friend… is lookin’ at comin’ to the States, and I believe she needs some shots to get her visa. I’m tryin’ to get everything sorted out for her, make sure she’s all set. I wasn’t sure where to start, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Skarbek. It's very thoughtful of you to assist your friend with this process. We can certainly help with determining what vaccinations are necessary for visa requirements. To start, do you happen to know where specifically she is coming from, and what type of visa she’s applying for?
PATIENT: That's kind of you to say, Doctor. She’s comin’ from… let me think… Colombia, yes, Colombia. And it’s a family visa, I believe. Her sister lives here now, in Oklahoma. She’s been here a good while. I'm not entirely sure on all the details of the visa type though, to be honest. She’s doin’ most of the paperwork herself, and she just asked me to look into the health requirements.
DOCTOR: Very good. A family visa from Colombia… that’s helpful. Generally, for family visas, applicants will need to demonstrate they meet certain health requirements, typically including a medical examination and proof of vaccination against certain communicable diseases. To ensure we cover all the necessary bases, could you tell me a little about your friend’s age and general health status?
PATIENT: She's… oh, I'd say she's around 28 years old, maybe 29. And as far as I know, she's in pretty good health. She works, she’s active, no major illnesses that I'm aware of. She might have had the usual childhood illnesses, but I don’t recall specifics. She hasn’t mentioned anythin’ serious to me, that's for sure. Would a record from her doctor in Colombia be helpful? I suppose she could get one.
DOCTOR: That's excellent information, Mr. Skarbek. Yes, a record from her doctor in Colombia would be very helpful, if possible. It can give us a clearer picture of her vaccination history and any past medical issues. In the meantime, we can start by outlining the vaccinations generally required for visa applicants from Colombia. These typically include proof of immunity to measles, mumps, rubella, varicella , and an up-to-date tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccination. Depending on her age and any travel history, other vaccinations might be recommended as well. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies or current medications we should be aware of for you, Mr. Skarbek?
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin’ it all so clearly. I don't have any allergies, thankfully. And no medications neither. I take a daily vitamin, but that’s it. Just tryin’ to stay healthy as I get older. I'm alright, all things considered. We mostly just need to get my friend sorted.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Skarbek. It’s always a good idea to prioritize health. And we will certainly focus on getting your friend sorted. Given her age and assuming no significant medical history, we can likely proceed with a standard vaccination review and any necessary boosters. To begin, let's perform a brief physical exam to assess her general health status. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. She’s a good girl, she is, just wants a better life for herself and her family. I want to make sure she’s prepared for everything. Go ahead with the exam, sir.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you for your trust, Mr. Skarbek. Alright, let’s start with your height and weight, if you don’t mind. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. It's just a routine check to ensure everything is in good working order. Okay, your height is 158 centimeters, and your weight is 102 kilograms. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Neurological exam is grossly intact, reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, and cranial nerves appear normal. Overall, your general physical condition appears good. Now, do you have any specific concerns or symptoms you’ve been experiencing lately?
PATIENT: That sounds alright, Doctor. I appreciate you tellin’ me everything as you go. No, nothin’ really. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ older, I suppose. My knees bother me sometimes, and my back ain’t what it used to be, but I reckon that’s just a part of life. Nothin’ to worry about, really. I try to stay active, walk a little each day. I just want to be sure my friend is healthy enough for all this, more than anything.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're staying active despite some minor discomfort, Mr. Skarbek. It's important to maintain physical activity as much as possible. Regarding your friend, we can proceed with determining the necessary vaccinations. To be thorough, could you provide me with any information about her past medical history, if known?
PATIENT: Well, I believe she had the usual childhood illnesses, like measles and chickenpox, when she was little. But I don't know the specifics. She wasn't born here, so there weren't medical records kept like they are now. She’s always seemed healthy, though. Never been a sickly girl, that's for sure. I don’t think she’s ever had any serious operations or anything. I really wish I knew more, but she's a long way away and it's hard to get that information. Would it be alright if she just gets the shots that are generally recommended? We can always get her tested if somethin’ comes up.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Mr. Skarbek. Given the limited information and her reported good health, proceeding with generally recommended vaccinations is a sensible approach. We can always revisit the situation and conduct further testing if needed. To summarize, we will focus on verifying immunity to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, and ensuring she is up-to-date with tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccination. If she does not have documentation of prior vaccination, we can proceed with administering the vaccines. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I appreciate your patience with me. It's just a bit of a worry, you know? Wantin' to make sure everything goes smoothly for her. I think… I think we’re alright. What’s the next step? Do we need to schedule somethin’ for her? I’m not sure when she'll be able to come over here, she’s still workin’ on the visa stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, Mr. Skarbek. It’s admirable that you’re taking such good care of your friend. The next step would be to schedule an appointment for her once her travel dates are more firm. We'll need to review any available documentation she has regarding her vaccination history and administer any necessary vaccines. If she doesn’t have records, we’ll proceed with vaccination and document accordingly. To make things easier, I’ll have my assistant, Sarah, contact you when you have a confirmed travel date for your friend. She can then schedule the appointment and provide you with any necessary forms or instructions. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfect. Havin’ Sarah contact me would be wonderful. That takes a lot of worry off my shoulders, thank you. I really appreciate all your help. I'll let my friend know, and we’ll get in touch with Sarah when we have a date. I think… I think that’s all for now. Thank you again, sir. You’ve been a great help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. It was my pleasure assisting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions or concerns. We look forward to helping your friend. Have a wonderful day, and please give my best wishes to your friend.
