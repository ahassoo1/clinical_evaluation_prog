DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Selbitschka. Welcome. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It's…well, it's my weight. I’ve gained a considerable amount recently, and I haven’t changed anything in my diet or exercise routine. It's quite unsettling, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weight gain when there haven't been changes to diet or activity… that is worth looking into. Hmm. Now, when you say “recently,” could you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Certainly. It began, I believe, around… February of this year. Though it was gradual at first, it has become quite noticeable in the last three months, perhaps since May. I weighed myself then, and it was already… alarming.
DOCTOR: Alright, February to May… a few months. And you mentioned alarming. About how much weight would you estimate you've gained overall during that period?
PATIENT: Let me see… I typically weigh myself every few weeks, though I confess, I’ve been avoiding it lately. But I believe… approximately fifteen pounds, perhaps a little more. It’s difficult to say precisely, but it feels significant. My clothes are tighter, and… well, I simply don't feel like myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, fifteen pounds or so… and you haven't noticed any changes to your appetite or how you eat?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s the most perplexing part. My appetite is normal, I eat the same foods, the same amount of food. I haven’t started any new habits, or indulged in anything particularly… decadent, if you will. It truly seems to be happening without reason.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. And have you noticed any other changes along with the weight gain?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not immediately, no. But… now that you mention it, I have been feeling rather fatigued lately. More tired than usual, even after a full night’s sleep. And… my hands sometimes feel a little… swollen. Not drastically, but enough to notice my rings feel a bit tight. I hadn't connected it to the weight gain before, but perhaps it's relevant.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and some swelling… alright. Let’s get some more information. Do you have any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve been quite fortunate, really. I’ve never been diagnosed with any serious illnesses. Just the usual childhood ailments, nothing lasting. My husband, he worries, of course, but I’ve always been a very healthy person. I do take a daily vitamin, a general multivitamin, if that is of importance.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No major medical history, just the multivitamin. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I’ve always been careful, I suppose. Avoid strenuous activities, eat a balanced diet… I’ve always tried to take good care of myself. It’s… unsettling, this is, when everything seems to be changing without any discernible reason. I'm just hoping we can find out what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… My mother, she had some issues with her joints when she was older, arthritis, I believe. My father was healthy, very active until his passing. He was a farmer, always working outdoors. No history of…weight problems, particularly, or any major metabolic conditions that I am aware of. My sister is healthy as well, living in Vilnius, thankfully. Is that the sort of information you require, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. Okay, one more quick thing about your background. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke. Never have. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that is all. It’s not a habit, certainly. I find it…doesn’t agree with me. I prefer tea, if you will. A nice, strong black tea. I believe I've answered all your questions regarding my background?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very thorough, thank you. Now, just to be complete, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I am aware of. I have never experienced any allergic reactions to any medication, food, or anything else, thankfully. I've always been quite fortunate in that regard. Is this…is this going to involve bloodwork, Doctor? I confess, I’m not particularly fond of needles.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. And yes, I think some bloodwork is a good idea to help us understand what might be going on. It'll help us rule out a few things. We can check your thyroid levels, blood sugar, and some other basic metabolic tests. And we can also check for any vitamin deficiencies. It’s just a standard panel, nothing too extensive. I understand your hesitation about needles; we’ll get it done as quickly and comfortably as possible. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds…reasonable. If it will help determine the cause, then I am willing. I…I suppose I should have prepared myself for that possibility. Please, do try to be quick. And…is there anything I should do beforehand? Avoid certain foods, or…fasting, perhaps? I wouldn’t want to invalidate the results.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No need to fast for this panel. You can eat as usual. And we’ll try to be as quick as possible. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood. She’s very good. Before we proceed, have you been taking any other medications, over-the-counter remedies, or supplements besides your daily multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. Just the multivitamin. I rarely even take pain relievers, if I can avoid it. I prefer a warm compress, or a cup of herbal tea, if I have a headache. I assure you, my medication list is exceptionally short. I pride myself on maintaining a natural lifestyle, as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your thyroid gland. It's just a routine check. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly acceptable. Please, proceed at your convenience. I understand it is all part of the process. I trust your expertise implicitly. I am ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Pulse is normal, 72 and regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, let me palpate your thyroid. Hmm. Thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but not dramatically so. No nodules that I can feel at this moment. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. No masses palpable. Some mild edema in your ankles and feet, which you mentioned. And… I noted your skin appears slightly dry. Alright. So, slightly elevated blood pressure, mild edema, enlarged thyroid, dry skin, and fatigue. Everything else seems within normal limits. We will proceed with the blood work. It's a good starting point. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That…that is a rather extensive list. But I suppose that is why I came to see you. No, I don’t believe I have any questions at this moment. I will trust your judgement, and await the results. When might I expect to hear back? And…will it be a phone call, or an appointment? I would prefer a phone call, if possible, if the news isn't…grave. I simply wish to know what is happening, and how to remedy it.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab usually takes a couple of days to get the results back, so I'd estimate around three to five business days. I’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. If the results indicate something more serious, we will schedule an appointment to discuss it in detail. Otherwise, a phone call will suffice. I’ll also send the results to your primary care physician for their information. Now, let me get the lab order for you. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood and provide instructions. Do you have any other concerns before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. Thank you for your thorough examination and your kind attention. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. I simply hope the results provide some answers, and allow me to regain my health. I'm ready when the nurse is.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Selbitschka. You're very welcome. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Just relax, and we’ll take it one step at a time. The nurse will be with you shortly.
