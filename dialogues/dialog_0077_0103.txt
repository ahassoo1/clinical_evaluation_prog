DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Vankampen. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, my back... it hurts. Lower back, mostly. It's been bothering me for a little while now, getting worse lately. I think it has something to do with my bones, the doctor before said something about them getting weak. I forget the name, but it’s… not good, he said.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you’ve been seen previously. Lower back pain, you say, and worsening recently. And you mentioned something about your bones… osteoporosis, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, that's it! Osteoporosis. That’s the word. It makes it hard to do things, you know? Even just getting out of a chair is a struggle some days. I used to be very active, but… not so much now. It just… aches. All the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen. It sounds like this is impacting your quality of life, and we need to address it. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it… Well, it’s not a sharp pain, not like if you fall or something. It’s more… a dull ache. Like a heavy weight is sitting on my lower back. Sometimes it’s just a little annoying, but other times it’s really bad, makes it hard to stand up straight. And it feels worse after I've been sitting for a long time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dull ache, worse with prolonged sitting… and does anything relieve the pain, Mr. Vankampen?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes when I lie down, it feels a little better. And… walking, slow walking, helps a bit. Not running or anything! Just a gentle walk. But it doesn’t last long, the relief. Mostly, I just try to be careful. I don't want to fall or anything. That would be… bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Down my legs… hmm. Not really pain, no. Sometimes a little tingling, in my feet, but not pain. It comes and goes, really. It’s not constant. I thought maybe it was my shoes, but I tried different shoes and it didn’t help much. Mostly just the tingling, and only sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling occasionally… And have you experienced any weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… yes, a little, maybe? It’s hard to explain. Like they feel… heavy sometimes. I don’t fall often, but I feel a little unsteady on my feet sometimes. It's like they don’t always listen to me, if that makes sense. Especially if I’ve been sitting for a while. I have to be careful getting up.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Okay, Mr. Vankampen. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just checking your reflexes, range of motion, and palpating your spine. Is that agreeable with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I want to get this figured out. It’s just… worrying, you know? I don’t want to end up not being able to move. Do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Vankampen. Let’s start with your reflexes. Can you please sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Alright, here I am. Be careful with my back, please. It’s a little tender. And I’m not very flexible, if you were wondering. I haven't done much stretching in years.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a little pressure here… and here… Does that cause any particular discomfort?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. That spot right there… that’s a little sore. Not awful, but definitely feels it. And… a little to the left of that too. It's a dull ache, like I told you. It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you bend forward for me, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Oof… that’s about as far as I can go. It's hard. It hurts a bit, to be honest. My back feels tight. I don’t think I can go any further without really hurting myself. It’s been a long time since I’ve done any bending.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen. Slowly now… and good. Now, can you stand on your tiptoes?
PATIENT: Whoa… steady now… This is hard. I can only go up a little bit. It feels… unstable. I'm afraid I'll fall. I haven't been able to do this for a long time. It's just… not easy anymore. I feel a little dizzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. Please come down slowly. You’re doing very well. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Just relax your legs. And that… and that.
PATIENT: Whoa! That's a little startling. My leg… it kicked, didn’t it? I felt it jump. I don’t know if that’s good or bad. It felt… a little weak, maybe? Like it didn’t kick very high. Is that normal? I’m not very good at this doctor stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Vankampen. That’s helpful. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to check your feet. Do you feel okay?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. A little shaky, maybe, but okay. What are you checking for in my feet? I always worry about my circulation. My mother had problems with her legs when she got older.
DOCTOR: I’m checking for pulses and sensation, to assess circulation, as you mentioned. And just looking at the skin tone. Can you tell me if you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. It's a little… prickly. Like a little pinprick, but not painful. Is that good? Sometimes my feet feel numb, especially in the cold. It's hard to tell if I'm feeling everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen. That completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you are experiencing lower back pain likely related to osteoporosis, as your previous doctor suggested, and potentially some mild neuropathy affecting your feet. We will need to confirm this with some imaging. I’m going to order an X-ray of your lower back and a nerve conduction study to assess the neuropathy. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray and… nerve what? Oh, nerve conduction study. Okay. Yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what’s going on. I just want to be able to walk again without worrying about falling. What does the nerve study do? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a lunch date next week, I hope I won’t miss it.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The nerve conduction study involves applying small electrical impulses to your legs and feet to measure the speed of nerve signals. It’s not painful, just a little uncomfortable. It will take about an hour and a half. As for the results, it typically takes a few days to a week for the radiologist to read the X-ray and the neurologist to interpret the nerve study. I will call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to walk, but gently, and avoiding any activities that exacerbate your pain. I also want to prescribe you a vitamin D supplement, as this can help with bone health. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Vitamin D… okay. Yes, that sounds fine. Gentle walking, vitamin D… and wait for the results. I can do that. What about pain? Is there anything I can take for the pain while I'm waiting? It’s been a little worse lately, especially at night. It makes it hard to sleep. I don’t want to take anything too strong, if possible. I’m a little worried about side effects.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can definitely address the pain. Given your concerns about side effects, I recommend starting with acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol, 500mg, every 6 hours as needed. It’s a relatively mild pain reliever and can be effective for lower back pain. If that’s not sufficient, we can discuss other options, but let’s start with this and see how it goes. I’ll write you a prescription for the vitamin D and I'll give you a printout with the instructions for the acetaminophen. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Acetaminophen… yes, I think I’ve taken that before. Okay. No, I don’t think so. That’s all I can think of right now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. You explained everything very well. I appreciate your patience. Now, about this lunch date… do you think I’ll be able to go? I promised my friend, and she’s been looking forward to it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. I’m glad I could help. As for your lunch date, I see no reason why you shouldn’t be able to go. Just pace yourself, avoid any strenuous activity, and take the acetaminophen if you need it. If you experience any worsening pain or new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here are the prescriptions and the instructions. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule your X-ray and nerve conduction study. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been wonderful. I feel a little better just knowing what’s going on. I’ll call if anything changes. Have a good day! .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your lunch date. It was a pleasure meeting you.
