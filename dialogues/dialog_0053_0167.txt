DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Pitmon, yes? It’s my foot. It’s… hurting. A sore, really. Been hurting for a little while now, and it doesn’t seem to be getting better. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes.
DOCTOR: Yes, Stoegbauer. Alright, a sore on the bottom of your foot. “A little while now” is rather vague, I’m afraid. Could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific. Well, let me think. Maybe… three, four weeks now? It started small, like a little bug bite, almost. Didn't bother me much at first. But then… it got bigger. And red. And now… it’s painful to walk. Especially in these slippers.
DOCTOR: Right. And you say it’s near your toes… is it on a toe, or just close by?
PATIENT: No, not on a toe. It’s… between them, I think. Near the big one and the next one. It’s hard to see… I’m not so good at bending over these days. It’s not a clean cut, you know? It looks… rough.
DOCTOR: “Rough,” alright. And has anything changed recently that might have caused this?
PATIENT: Changed? Well… not really. I try to take care of myself. I eat my fruits, mostly. And I walk a little bit every day, if the weather’s nice. I’ve been… a little more tired lately, maybe. But that's just getting old, I suppose. Oh! And my wife… she passed away last year. That's been hard.
DOCTOR: I see. And before your wife passed, did she notice anything unusual about your feet?
PATIENT: Hmm… my Mary? She was always looking out for me. She… she noticed I was swelling up in my ankles sometimes. She’d rub them for me, you know? Said my feet were getting puffy. And she worried about my sugar… always telling me to watch what I ate. She used to say my feet were getting cold a lot too. But that was just her worrying, I think.
DOCTOR: Swelling, coldness, and… your wife’s concern about your sugar. Do you have any history of diabetes, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Diabetes… Oh. Yes. The doctor… he told me a long time ago. Years ago now. Type 2, I think he said. I try to take my pills, but sometimes… I forget. And I like my mangoes, you know? Maybe I eat too many mangoes.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, we're dealing with a history of Type 2 diabetes, and some… inconsistent management of it. And this sore on your foot, which has been present for three to four weeks, and is located between your big toe and the next one. Now, I'm going to need to take a look at this properly. Could you please take off your slippers and socks?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. There you are. It doesn't look very pretty, does it? I try to keep them clean, but…
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some erythema—redness—around the sore, and some induration—hardening—of the surrounding tissue. There’s a small amount of drainage present, and the area is warm to the touch. It doesn't appear to be deeply infected at this moment, but it's certainly inflamed. Your pulses are present, though somewhat diminished. Given your history of diabetes, we need to take this very seriously. It is possible this is a developing diabetic ulcer. Now, I'm going to check your blood sugar to get a baseline reading. Just a quick prick of the finger, alright?
PATIENT: A… ulcer? Oh dear. That sounds serious. Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A prick of the finger is fine. I’m used to those. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a little pinch. Okay… 212. That’s quite elevated, Mr. Stoegbauer. As I suspected. Given your blood sugar and the appearance of this sore, we'll need to run some further tests to determine the extent of any infection and assess your circulation. I'm going to order a wound culture to identify any bacteria present, and a vascular study to check the blood flow in your legs and feet. In the meantime, it's absolutely crucial that you keep all weight off this foot. I'm going to prescribe a pair of diabetic shoes and a walking boot to protect it. Are you able to ambulate with a walking boot?
PATIENT: Oh my. 212… that is high, isn’t it? A walking boot? I… I haven’t used one of those before. I can try. I suppose I can manage… slowly. But I do like to get out and walk, you know? Even just a little bit. Will I be able to walk at all with this boot?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Stoegbauer, you will be able to walk, but you need to significantly reduce the amount of weight you put on that foot. The boot will provide support and protect the area from further injury. Think of it as a temporary measure to allow the wound to heal. Now, regarding the wound culture and vascular study… I’ll have my nurse schedule those for you as soon as possible. It's imperative we rule out a deep infection or poor circulation, which could lead to more serious complications. I’m also going to increase the dosage of your diabetes medication, and I want you to follow up with an endocrinologist. Do you currently have an endocrinologist?
PATIENT: An… endo-what-now? No, I don’t think so. I just see my regular doctor, you know? The one down the street. He gives me the pills. I… I don't really understand all these different doctors. Is that… is that a very important doctor?
DOCTOR: An endocrinologist is a specialist who focuses on hormone-related conditions, specifically diabetes. Given the elevated blood sugar and this developing ulcer, it's crucial to have a specialist manage your diabetes. Your regular doctor does a good job, but they aren't equipped to handle complex cases like this. I’ll write you a referral, and my nurse will help you schedule an appointment. It's very important you follow up with them as soon as possible. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. Not that I know of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years. Maybe… once, a long time ago, I got a little rash from some cream. But that was years ago. I can’t even remember what it was for. No, I don’t think I have any bad allergies. But my wife… she was allergic to shrimp. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Stoegbauer, your wife’s allergies aren't relevant. I need to know if you have any allergies to medications. Alright, so no known medication allergies. Good. I’m going to write you a prescription for the walking boot, and I’ll increase the dosage of your current diabetes medication. I’ll also give you a detailed handout on proper foot care for diabetics. This is very important—you need to inspect your feet every day for any signs of redness, blisters, or sores. Any changes, even small ones, and you need to call my office immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Every day, check my feet. Redness, blisters, sores. And call you if anything changes. It sounds… a lot to remember. But I’ll try my best. I don’t want to lose my foot, you know?
DOCTOR: You won’t lose your foot if you follow the instructions and take proper care of it. Now, I'll have my nurse come in and schedule the wound culture, vascular study, and an appointment with the endocrinologist. She’ll also give you the prescriptions and the foot care handout. She can also help you with any questions you might have about setting up appointments and managing your medications. Any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor… I think that’s all. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it. I just… I hope this doesn't take too long to heal. I miss walking.
DOCTOR: Alright. My nurse will be in shortly. Follow the instructions, and we'll do our best to get you back on your feet as soon as possible. Don’t hesitate to call if anything concerns you. .
PATIENT: .
