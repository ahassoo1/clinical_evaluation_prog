DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. My name is Dr. Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you please tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um… well, I have been coughing up some blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come see a doctor. It’s not… a lot, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Coughing up blood, even a small amount, is certainly something we need to investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this cough?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it started maybe two weeks ago? At first, it was just a normal cough, like a cold. But then, a few days ago, I noticed… the blood. It’s usually when I cough first thing in the morning. It's… bright red. Not a dark color. And it's mixed with… the mucus. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Weichers. Bright red blood suggests it's likely from your airways, which is good information. And it being mixed with mucus is also important. Just to clarify, about how much blood are we talking about?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. It’s not like a big amount, Doctor. Maybe… a teaspoon? Sometimes less. It’s hard to measure when you are… startled. I always use a tissue, and it’s usually just… spots on the tissue. But enough to make me worry. I'm sorry I can’t be more precise.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Weichers. Estimating can be difficult in these situations. A teaspoon or less, occurring mostly in the morning, is what I'm noting. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the cough?
PATIENT: Yes. Um… I have been a little tired. More tired than usual, I think. And sometimes I feel… a little short of breath. But I thought that was just because I live on the tenth floor and the stairs are… long. Also, I’ve had a small fever, maybe 99 degrees. It comes and goes. Nothing too high, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, shortness of breath, and a low-grade fever. Thank you. Have you noticed any pain in your chest, Ms. Weichers?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no chest pain. Not at all. Sometimes I feel a little… weak, but that is probably from being tired. And… no weight loss. I haven't been eating much less. I still have my appetite.
DOCTOR: Good. No chest pain or weight loss is reassuring. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… well, I had pneumonia when I was a child, a long time ago. But I recovered fully. And… my husband, he passed away last year. He had heart problems. I don’t have any other… serious illnesses. I try to eat healthy and get some exercise. I walk a lot when the weather is nice.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Weichers. That must have been very difficult. Pneumonia as a child is noted. And it’s good to hear you prioritize a healthy lifestyle. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations besides the pneumonia when you were a child?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No other surgeries or hospital stays. Just the pneumonia when I was little. I have never really been… a sick person. That’s why this blood is so worrying. It’s… unusual for me. I don’t smoke, if that is important. And I rarely drink alcohol. Mostly just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful information, Ms. Weichers. No smoking, minimal alcohol, and generally good health—that’s good to know. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any regular medications. I might take something for a headache sometimes, but that is it. Nothing… every day. I prefer to try and rest if I feel unwell. And I take a Vitamin D supplement in the winter, but that’s just because the sun is… not so strong then.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. And Vitamin D occasionally. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies. I have never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, and I have never had trouble with… pollen or dust or anything like that. I used to have a cat when I was younger, and I was fine with it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No allergies is good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Is there anyone in your family who has had lung problems, such as asthma, bronchitis, or lung cancer?
PATIENT: Um… my father, he had… emphysema, I think it was called. He smoked for many years. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had… bronchitis often when she was older. But no one else, that I know of, had… anything serious with their lungs. Everyone else lived to be quite old, with… normal illnesses.
DOCTOR: Emphysema in your father and bronchitis in your aunt are noted. That’s helpful information. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam to listen to your lungs and check your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I want to find out what is causing this blood, so please do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Weichers. I appreciate your trust. If you could please sit back and take some deep breaths for me, that would be great. Okay, take a deep breath… and again… good. Your breath sounds are slightly diminished in the lower lobes, bilaterally. I'm also palpating your lymph nodes in your neck. They feel… normal, no swelling. Your heart sounds are regular. Your temperature is 99.2 Fahrenheit. And your blood pressure is 130/80. I'm noting some mild fatigue, low-grade fever, and diminished breath sounds. These findings are not definitive, but they warrant further investigation. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work. The blood work will help us check for infection and rule out other possible causes. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: An X-ray and blood work… yes, that sounds… sensible. I trust your judgement, Doctor. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. You have explained everything very clearly. Will the X-ray… hurt? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: No, the X-ray won't hurt at all, Ms. Weichers. You'll simply stand or sit in front of the machine while it takes a picture of your chest. It's a very quick procedure. As for the results, it typically takes a few hours for the X-ray to be read by the radiologist, and the blood work usually comes back within a day or two. Once I have the results, I will contact you immediately to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms—such as increased bleeding, severe shortness of breath, or high fever—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. No more bleeding, shortness of breath, or high fever… go to the emergency room. I will remember that. A few hours for the X-ray, a day or two for the blood work… and you will call me with the results. Thank you very much for your help so far. I feel a little better knowing we are doing something to find out what is wrong. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Or do I just wait for your call?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. No, you don’t need to do anything further at this time. Just wait for my call. I will be in touch as soon as I have the results. I will also have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us in a week, just to ensure we are on the right track. Thank you for coming in today. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before my call.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Shely. I appreciate your kindness and thoroughness. I will. Have a good day.
