DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, that’s all. Gotta fill out some forms and get poked and prodded, right? I’d like to get it over with quickly if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can certainly get this done as efficiently as possible. A physical for life insurance... right. So, just to start, are you currently experiencing any health problems or have you noticed anything unusual lately?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I’m getting older, so things ache a bit more than they used to. But nothing major. My back bothers me sometimes, especially after I’ve been lifting things at work, you know? I manage a hotel, so there's always something to move. But it’s nothing I haven’t dealt with before.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain with lifting... I see. And how long has the back pain been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… a while. Years, probably. It comes and goes. Like I said, it’s just part of the job. It's not constant, if that makes sense. More when I'm busy, which is… most of the time. I haven't seen a doctor about it specifically, though. Just take some ibuprofen and try to stretch.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the back pain, are you experiencing any other aches, pains, or discomfort anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. My knees get a little creaky when it’s cold, but that’s probably just age too. And sometimes I get a bit of heartburn after I eat something spicy, but nothing too bad. I try to avoid spicy food now. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, creaky knees and occasional heartburn… thank you. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Actually, yeah. I think I've put on a little weight in the last year or so. It's probably the stress at work, and not eating as well as I should. I used to be a little slimmer, but things have been hectic. I haven't really weighed myself recently, though, to be honest. I try not to.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any trouble breathing, chest pain, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I can breathe just fine. No chest pain or anything weird with my heart. I walk a lot at work, running around the hotel, and I haven't had any problems keeping up. I get a little winded sometimes, but that's normal, right?
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good. Now, just to get a full picture, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never really been sick, to be honest. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, but nothing serious. I think I had a bad case of the flu a few years back, but I just stayed home and rested. They did Medicare checkups when I turned 65, and everything seemed okay then. I don't really remember all the details though.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just ibuprofen when my back acts up, like I said. Sometimes I take a little something for heartburn, but it's not regular. Just when it’s really bothering me. It's one of those things you get at the drugstore, I don't even remember the name. And sometimes a multivitamin, but I forget to take it half the time. I'm terrible with remembering things, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… my ex-wife, she used to smoke. I didn't like it, so I stayed away from it. It smelled awful. And she passed away a few years back, so… it's definitely not something I'm interested in. Sorry, didn't mean to get morbid.
DOCTOR: No, please, don't apologize. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just occasionally. A beer with dinner sometimes, or a glass of wine on a special occasion. Nothing heavy. I'm not a big drinker. It makes me sleepy, to be honest. And I usually have to get up early for work, so I don't want to feel groggy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I don’t think I’ve ever had an allergic reaction. I'm pretty lucky in that regard. Is that all the questions? I'm ready to get this over with if you are.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Putney, that’s all for the questions. Thank you for your patience. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds good. Let's just get it done. The quicker the better, right? I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. We'll need to keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds good, but your breath sounds are a little quiet. I'm going to listen again while you breathe deeply. Okay. Now, let me take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Open your mouth and say "Ah."
PATIENT: Ah… Is something wrong? Everything feels okay, I just wanna get this over with.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks clear. No redness or swelling. Your ears also look clear. Okay. I'm going to listen to your back as well. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, that hurts a little. Not terrible, but definitely feels it. Like I said, it always bothers me. Especially when I've been lifting things. Is that bad? I mean, is it really bad?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily "bad," but it does indicate some muscle tension and inflammation. It’s likely contributing to your back pain. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This won’t hurt, just a quick tap on your knee. Your reflexes are good. Everything seems normal overall, but your blood pressure is a little high, and you have some tenderness in your lower back. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I'd like to order some blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Ugh. Okay, fine. If it’ll get me out of here faster, I guess. Just… how long will it take? And where do I go? I don’t want to make multiple trips.
DOCTOR: The blood tests should be relatively quick – about 15-20 minutes. There's a lab right across the hall, number 203. They take most insurance cards, including Medicare. They’ll send the results directly to me. Here's the form. Take this to the lab, and they'll take care of it. Once I have the results, I'll give you a call to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. Number 203, right across the hall. Medicare should cover it. Alright. Thanks, Doctor. Hopefully, everything’s okay. I really need to get back to work. Are we finished here? I don’t want to hold up anyone else’s schedule.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Putney, you are all set. I'll be in touch as soon as I have the lab results. In the meantime, please try to avoid heavy lifting and continue taking ibuprofen as needed for the back pain. If the pain gets significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call us. Thank you for coming in today. And don't worry too much. We'll figure out what's going on. .
PATIENT: Okay, thanks. You too.
