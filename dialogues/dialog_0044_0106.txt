DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my foot. It’s been…troublesome. Honestly, I don’t understand why it’s taking so long to heal. I’ve always been a strong woman, you know? Never one for complaining. But this…this is just ridiculous. It’s a sore, and it won't close up.
DOCTOR: I see. A sore that's not healing… that is frustrating, especially when you're used to being strong and resilient. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not just a sore, Doctor. It’s a proper ulcer. And it’s on my foot, right on the bottom near my toes. It’s been there for…oh, I suppose nearly three months now. I tried putting some ointment on it, the kind my daughter brings when she visits, but that didn’t do a thing. It just seems to get worse, and it smells…well, let's just say it's unpleasant. I keep it bandaged, of course, but the bandage gets soaked through something awful. Honestly, the home remedies aren’t working and I suspect this clinic isn’t much better.
DOCTOR: Three months…and it’s not responding to ointment. And you’re right to be concerned about it not healing, and the odor is definitely something we need to address. I understand your skepticism, Louine, but I assure you we'll do our best to figure this out. First, let's get some details. You said it's on the bottom of your foot, near your toes. Is it on one foot or both?
PATIENT: Just the one, Doctor. My left foot. And it’s not just near my toes, it’s under them, practically. It's a terribly awkward spot, you see. Makes it hard to put any pressure on it, and I've been shuffling around like an old woman. It's quite humiliating, if I'm honest. I used to walk everywhere! Now I have to rely on my grandson to take me to the market. It's just…not dignified.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Louine. It sounds incredibly uncomfortable and disruptive to your life, and it's perfectly valid to feel that way. It's not dignified to have your independence taken away like that. Okay, so it’s on the bottom of your left foot, under the toes. Has anything specific happened to injure your foot?
PATIENT: Injure it? No, not that I recall. I haven’t tripped or stubbed it or anything like that. It just…appeared. I noticed it when I was washing my feet one evening. A little red spot, at first. And then it got bigger, and deeper. My daughter, she says it’s my sugar. Something about the diabetes. But I’ve had diabetes for years, and I’ve never had anything like this before. Frankly, I think she worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it developed gradually, without a specific injury. And your daughter mentioned diabetes. You've had diabetes for some time, but this is a new issue. That's helpful information. It's true that diabetes can certainly contribute to slow wound healing and increase the risk of foot ulcers. Do you currently take any medications for your diabetes, or any other health conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I take a pill every morning for the sugar. A little white one. And another one for my blood pressure. It's a pink one. My grandson refills them for me, so I don’t really keep track of the names. He's a good boy, but he doesn’t always explain things properly. I used to manage it all myself, but... well, getting old isn't for the faint of heart, is it? And I take a calcium tablet, for my bones, of course.
DOCTOR: That's very good of you to remember those, Louine. It's understandable that keeping track of everything can be difficult. And yes, you're absolutely right, getting older does come with its challenges. Now, aside from the medications, do you have any other health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. I have trouble seeing things up close, so I rely on my reading glasses. And my knees ache, especially when the weather is cold. But those are just…old age things. Nothing serious. Oh, and I get a little breathless sometimes, when I walk too fast. My doctor years ago said it was just my heart being “a little tired”. Honestly, I think all doctors say the same things these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some vision changes, knee pain, and occasional shortness of breath. That's all helpful information. And it's true, some symptoms can be common as we get older. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Years ago, when I was still living on Majuro, I had my appendix taken out. That was a very long time ago, back in… well, I don’t even remember the year. It was a long time before they had all these fancy machines. And I had a bad case of pneumonia when my eldest son was a little boy, but I recovered from that. Apart from that… I’ve always been a strong woman. I don’t get sick easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, so an appendectomy many years ago and a bout of pneumonia. And generally good health otherwise. That’s very good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? Oh, I have a lot of children, grandchildren, and even a few great-grandchildren now. They're mostly scattered around the islands, and a few on the mainland. My eldest son is a fisherman, my daughter is a teacher… it’s all very normal. Do you mean if anyone else in my family had this sort of sore? I don’t believe so. My mother had arthritis in her hands, but never anything like this on her feet. I’ve always been the healthy one.
DOCTOR: I understand. And no history of similar foot problems in your family. That's good information. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like foods or insects?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. I used to garden, you know, and I never had a reaction to anything I grew. And I haven't been stung by a bee or anything in years. My skin gets a little itchy sometimes, but that's just the heat, I think. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very simple woman. I don't have complicated allergies or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, I’d like to take a look at your foot if that's alright with you. We'll need to assess the ulcer directly to get a better idea of what's going on. I'll also check your circulation and sensation in your foot. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Go ahead. But be gentle, please. It’s quite tender. And don’t be alarmed if I flinch. It really is painful, you know. I’ve been trying to ignore it, but it's getting harder and harder. Honestly, I suspect this whole thing is going to be a very long process.
DOCTOR: I will be very gentle, Louine, I promise. And it's perfectly alright to flinch or let me know if anything is too uncomfortable. I’ll explain everything as I go. Okay, I'm just going to take a look now. Hmm… the ulcer is located on the bottom of your foot, near your little toe. It appears to be fairly deep, and there’s some redness around the edges. The odor is definitely present. And I'm feeling a weak pulse in your foot, and sensation seems a little diminished. It’s warm to the touch. This suggests some possible circulatory issues and potential nerve damage. I’m going to document these findings. Ulcer on plantar aspect of left foot near 5th toe. Depth approximately 1cm. Surrounding erythema and odor present. Weak dorsalis pedis pulse. Diminished sensation to light touch. Warm to palpation. We'll need to get some tests to determine the best course of action. I’d like to order a blood test to check your blood sugar levels and kidney function, and an X-ray of your foot to see if there's any bone infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, dear. More tests. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like a science experiment. But… I suppose if you think it’s necessary. Blood sugar I understand, since my daughter is always on about that. But an X-ray? Is it serious? Will it hurt? I really don't like doctors poking around.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Louine. It's never pleasant to have a lot of tests done, and it's perfectly valid to feel anxious about it. The blood test will help us get a better understanding of your overall health and see if your diabetes is well-controlled. As for the X-ray, it's a very simple procedure. It doesn't hurt at all—you just need to stand still for a few moments while the machine takes a picture of your foot. It will help us to determine if there's any bone infection or other underlying structural problems. It’s a precaution, really, to get a more complete picture of what’s going on. We’ll also need to check your circulation more thoroughly. I'm going to use a Doppler ultrasound to measure the blood flow in your legs and feet. This doesn't hurt either, but it does require me to place a small probe on your skin. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Manageable… Well, I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t involve any needles. I hate needles. My daughter had to hold my hand when I had my flu shot last year. And as long as it doesn’t take too long. I get tired easily these days. Doppler…what was that? Something about the blood again? Honestly, Doctor, you use a lot of complicated words. Is this something serious? Is my foot going to have to be…amputated? My cousin’s husband lost a leg to diabetes, and I don't want that to happen to me.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Louine. You’re right to ask questions and voice your anxieties. It’s good you’re thinking about all of this. And you’re right, I sometimes use complicated words—I apologize for that. I'll make sure to explain everything in simpler terms going forward. The Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to measure the blood flow in your legs and feet. It doesn't involve any needles, so you don't need to worry about that. Now, about your cousin’s husband… I understand your fear, and it’s natural to be worried about amputation. However, that is not what we’re anticipating at this stage. We are doing these tests to assess the situation and develop a plan to prevent complications, not to prepare for amputation. The majority of foot ulcers can be successfully treated with proper wound care, infection control, and management of blood sugar levels. We will do everything we can to avoid that outcome. Right now, we need to focus on getting the infection under control, improving circulation, and keeping your blood sugar stable. The tests will help us determine the best course of action. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Well… that's…reassuring, I suppose. Keeping it under control… yes, I can understand that. My daughter is always telling me to watch what I eat. And the blood sugar… yes. As long as I don't have to have any surgery, or lose my foot. Honestly, Doctor, I'm just an old woman. I don't want to be a burden to anyone. So, these tests… where do we do them? And how long will it take? Will my grandson have to take me? He’s a busy boy, you know, with his studies. And will there be…a bill? I’m on Medicare, but I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: You're not a burden, Louine, and we'll do everything we can to make this process as easy as possible for you. The tests will be done right here in the clinic. The blood test will only take a few minutes, and the X-ray should take about 15-20 minutes. We can schedule them for later this afternoon, if that works for you. And your grandson can certainly bring you, or if it’s easier, we can help arrange transportation. As for the bill, yes, Medicare should cover most of the costs. There may be a small co-pay, depending on your plan, but our billing department will work with you to ensure you understand everything. We accept Medicare and will handle the paperwork for you. We'll take things one step at a time. First, we'll get these tests done. Then, once we have the results, we'll discuss a treatment plan and address any further concerns you may have. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: One step at a time… yes, that sounds better. Much better. Tests this afternoon, then a plan. And someone to help with the bill… that’s good. Very good. Alright. This afternoon, then. What time should my grandson bring me? And should I… eat something beforehand? Or not? I always get confused about those things. And is there anything I should bring with me? My glasses, of course. And my Medicare card. Honestly, Doctor, you've been very patient with me. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Louine. It's my job to make you feel comfortable and informed. Let’s schedule the tests for 2:00 PM this afternoon. That will give you plenty of time. You should eat a light meal beforehand – something easy to digest. No need to fast. And yes, please bring your glasses and your Medicare card. You might also want to bring a book or magazine to keep you occupied while you wait. I’ll have the receptionist schedule the tests and let your grandson know the time. She’ll also give you a form to fill out with your medical history, but we can go through it together if you’d like. Is there anything else I can do for you right now, Louine?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… getting through this afternoon, then. And hoping for good news. It's been a long morning, you know. All this worrying. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. I appreciate your patience. And please… tell your receptionist to be gentle with my arm when they take the blood. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Louine. We’ll do everything we can to make it as easy as possible. I’ll make a note to remind the receptionist to be gentle with your arm. We’ll get through this together. Just focus on getting some rest this afternoon, and we’ll see you at 2:00 PM. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to help. Have a good afternoon, Louine. And please, try not to worry too much.
