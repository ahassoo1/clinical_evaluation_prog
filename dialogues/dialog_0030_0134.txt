DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It’s nice to meet you as well. Hmm… well, things haven't been right for a bit now. I get sick to my stomach a lot, even if I haven't eaten much. And I just… don't feel hungry like I used to. It's hard to explain. It just feels like I fill up after only a few bites, and then I feel awful. I don't know if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Kelder. Thank you for explaining that. Feeling sick to your stomach frequently and a loss of appetite are certainly concerning. So, you’re saying this has been going on for “a bit now”—could you give me a rough estimate of how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… time gets away from me these days. Let me think… it started, oh, maybe… three, four months ago? It was gradual, not all at once. At first, I just thought it was something I ate, but it hasn’t gone away. I’ve tried eating smaller meals, but it doesn’t seem to help much. It's just… been persistent. I really don't remember exactly when it started, though. Everything feels a bit blurry lately.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for things to feel a little blurry when you’re not feeling your best, and the gradual onset can make it harder to pinpoint. Three to four months is helpful to know. Now, aside from the nausea and feeling full quickly, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Well, I’ve been feeling… tired, a lot more tired than usual. And I’ve lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven't really been weighing myself regularly. Oh, and sometimes my stomach hurts, just a dull ache, mostly after I try to eat. It’s not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Does that make sense? I'm probably forgetting something.
DOCTOR: Yes, that all makes perfect sense, Ms. Kelder. Fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and that dull stomach ache – those are all important pieces of information. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. Well, my husband, bless his soul, always handled the doctor’s appointments. I remember having… arthritis, in my hands mostly. And I had my gallbladder out years and years ago. But other than that… I don’t really recall. I was diagnosed with… something, a while back, but it was a long time ago, and I don’t quite remember what it was. It had to do with… well, I just don't know. My memory isn't what it used to be, I’m afraid. I’m on Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Kelder. It's perfectly alright if you don't recall everything; we can certainly work with what you do remember. Arthritis and a previous gallbladder removal are good to know. Medicare is helpful information as well. Let's try to clarify that other diagnosis you mentioned, if possible. Do you recall roughly when you were diagnosed with that other condition?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I think it was… after my husband passed. Yes, definitely after. He passed… oh, it must be… fifteen years ago now? Maybe a little more. It was at the… the big hospital in the city. They did a lot of tests. They said something about… cells. Not good cells. It was… cancer, I think. But it was a long time ago, and they said it was… small. They didn't do much about it then, just told me to watch for changes. I really don't remember the details. It’s all so fuzzy. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: You're not vague at all, Ms. Kelder. Fifteen years ago, a diagnosis of cancer that was considered small and required only monitoring is very helpful to know. We will definitely want to review those records. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take a pill for my arthritis, it's a white one. And sometimes, when my arthritis is really bad, the doctor gave me something stronger, a little yellow pill. But I don’t take that very often. And… I think that’s it. I don’t take anything regularly except for the white pill. Oh! And I take vitamins, a multi-vitamin, every day. But that’s not a prescription, just something I picked up at the store. I hope that helps. I’m afraid I’m not very organized with these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. Knowing you take a white pill for arthritis, a yellow pill occasionally, and a multivitamin is a great start. We can get the specifics of the white pill later. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of, dear. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat just about everything. My husband always said I had an iron stomach! No, I don’t think I have any allergies. I’ve never had any trouble with bee stings or poison ivy, either. I’m pretty lucky that way, I suppose. But I did have a rash once, a long time ago, but I don't remember what caused it. It wasn't serious, just itchy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Kelder. No known allergies are helpful. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I'm not as spry as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths for me, please. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. I’m checking for any tenderness or masses. It's a little tender in your upper abdomen, but no obvious masses. Finally, I'll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Based on this quick exam, your abdomen is mildly tender, which could be related to your stomach issues. But it’s not enough to point to a specific problem.
PATIENT: Oh, that wasn’t bad at all, dear. It's good to know my heart and lungs are okay. It's just… this stomach trouble is worrying me. It's not like me to feel this way. I just want to feel like myself again. What do you think is going on? Is it serious? I apologize for being so anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Ms. Kelder, and you’re not at all being unreasonable. We need to investigate further to determine the cause of your symptoms. Given your history of a previous cancer diagnosis, even one that was small, and your current symptoms of nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, and weight loss, we need to rule out any recurrence or other serious underlying conditions. I’d like to order some blood work. This will give us a good baseline and help us assess your overall health, including checking your organ function and looking for any signs of inflammation. I also think a stool test would be helpful to rule out any infections. Given your weight loss and persistent symptoms, I would also like to discuss the possibility of an upper endoscopy. This involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining and take a biopsy if needed. It’s the best way to get a definitive answer about what's going on in your stomach. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… a little scary, dear. An endoscopy? A camera in my stomach? I don’t know… I’m not sure I’m strong enough for that. But I understand you want to find out what’s wrong. The blood work and stool test sound alright. I can manage those. But… what are the risks of this endoscopy? And is it absolutely necessary? I’m just worried about… everything, I suppose. It’s just a lot to take in. Perhaps we could start with the blood work and see what that shows?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask those questions, Ms. Kelder, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned. Let’s definitely start with the blood work and stool test, as you suggested. That will give us a lot of valuable information before we even consider the endoscopy. Regarding the endoscopy, it’s not always necessary, but it is the most definitive way to diagnose the cause of your symptoms. The risks are generally low. The most common risks include mild discomfort, bloating, and sore throat. There is a very small risk of bleeding or perforation, but that is rare. It's typically performed with sedation, so you wouldn’t feel much discomfort during the procedure. We would discuss all the risks and benefits in detail before scheduling it, and it would be your decision whether or not to proceed. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests ordered. I'll write you a requisition form for the blood work and stool test. The lab is just down the hall. They will draw the blood, and I'll give you a container for the stool sample. Please try to collect the sample after your first bowel movement in the morning. And I will have the nurse provide you with detailed instructions on how to do that. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully for accurate results. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in about a week. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better, dear. Starting with the blood work and stool test feels more manageable. A week is good. I’m glad you explained the risks of the endoscopy, even though I hope we won’t need it. Thank you for being so patient with me. I’m just a bit… overwhelmed, I suppose. And I do tend to worry. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I’ll go get the tests done now. Where is the lab, exactly?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. It’s perfectly alright to be overwhelmed, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have along the way. The lab is just down the hall to your left. You’ll see a sign that says “Laboratory.” The staff there are very friendly and will take good care of you. They'll give you instructions on how to collect the stool sample. After you’ve had the tests done, please stop by the front desk, and they will schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now, dear. Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I’ll go get those tests done. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. You have a good day as well. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. .
