DOCTOR: Hi Jase, welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… my stomach. It’s been, like, really bothering me lately. Just… a lot of diarrhea. It’s been going on for a bit now, and I just wanted to get it checked out. Honestly, I don't really remember when it started exactly, just that it's been happening a lot recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Diarrhea can be really disruptive, so it’s good you came in to get it looked at. "A bit now" is a little vague, though – can you try to narrow it down for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… Okay, let me think. I guess… maybe a couple of months? Or more? It's hard to say. Things have been… a little blurry lately, to be honest. I know I’ve had it for a while, definitely not just a few days. I was told a while ago something about… my gut? That might be why it's happening? I don't really remember the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months, and you mentioned something about your gut… That’s helpful. Do you recall who told you about your gut?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, this is the hard part. I… think it was a doctor? Maybe a specialist? It was a while ago, and I had a lot going on at the time. It wasn’t Dr. Georgiou, that’s for sure. They said something about… IBD, maybe? Or… celiac? It all sounds kind of the same, honestly. I don't really remember getting a definite diagnosis or anything. Sorry, I’m not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You’re perfectly fine, Jase. It’s very common to not remember all the details, especially if it was a while ago and you were stressed. IBD – inflammatory bowel disease – and celiac disease are both possibilities, and it's good we're thinking along those lines. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's been going on currently with your diarrhea. Besides just having diarrhea, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Other symptoms… hmm. Well, I’ve been really tired, just generally exhausted. And sometimes my stomach hurts, like cramps. Not all the time, but pretty often when I… you know. And I think I've been losing a little weight, but honestly, I haven’t really been checking. My appetite hasn’t been great either. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Tiredness, cramps with the diarrhea, weight loss, and a decreased appetite… those are all things we need to explore further. Now, about the diarrhea itself – can you describe what it looks like?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… It's… watery. And sometimes there's… blood. Not a lot, usually just a little bit. It’s… kind of scary, honestly. It’s not every time, but often enough that I noticed. And it smells really bad, if that matters. I’m sorry, I know it’s gross.
DOCTOR: It's okay, Jase, you're being very open and honest, and that's exactly what I need to help you. It’s important to describe things as they are, and you’re doing a great job. Blood in the stool is definitely something we need to investigate. Now, let's talk about other parts of your body. Have you noticed anything else different lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… I’ve been getting a lot of headaches, actually. And my skin feels… dry and itchy. And I’ve been really thirsty all the time, even when it’s not hot. Oh, and… I’ve been feeling kind of weak. Like I don't have much energy. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Those are all important things to note, Jase. Headaches, dry itchy skin, increased thirst, and weakness… all of those could be related to what’s going on with your stomach, or they could be something else entirely. Let's go over some basic history now. Do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven’t really had any bad reactions to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My husband sometimes says I eat too much, but… No allergies, as far as I can remember. I don’t have any trouble with any medications either. Not that I take many, though. Just… the usual stuff when I get a cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about any medications you do take regularly, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a multivitamin sometimes, but not every day. And occasionally, when my headaches are really bad, I take ibuprofen. Just a couple of tablets, usually. And… that’s it, I think. Nothing else regularly. Should I be taking something else?
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily. Just making sure I have a complete picture. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I've been pretty lucky, I haven't needed any surgeries. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. Other than that, nothing. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s good to know. Tonsillectomy is a surgery, but it was a long time ago. Now, do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Well… like I said before, I think a doctor mentioned something about my gut a while ago. IBD or celiac, maybe? But I never got a definite diagnosis. Other than that… not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. My husband always says I’m a tough cookie. But lately… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, we’ve circled back to that potential gut issue. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… That's a good question. My mom has high blood pressure, I think. And my dad… he had diabetes, but he passed away a few years ago. My grandma on my mom’s side had arthritis, really bad. And… oh! My aunt on my dad’s side, she had something with her stomach, but I don’t remember what it was. Something about… inflammation? It’s all a bit blurry, honestly. I'm not very good at remembering family history. We don’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. High blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, and some kind of stomach inflammation in the family… We’ll keep those in mind. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! I don’t smoke, and I hardly ever drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. I wouldn’t even know where to start. My husband would kill me if I did any of that. He’s very health-conscious. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s important. No smoking, minimal alcohol, and no drug use… good to know. Now, tell me a little about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, breakfast is usually toast and a cup of tea. Sometimes cereal, if I’m in a hurry. Lunch is usually a sandwich, or leftovers from dinner. And dinner… varies. My husband does most of the cooking, and he likes to experiment. Sometimes it’s curry, sometimes pasta, sometimes roast chicken. We eat a lot of rice. And I like sweets, so I usually have something for dessert. I don’t really have any dietary restrictions, so I eat pretty much everything. I’ve been eating less lately, though, because I haven’t been feeling very hungry.
DOCTOR: Okay, a varied diet, with reduced appetite recently. One last thing about your lifestyle. How would you describe your stress levels?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. Honestly? Pretty high lately. My husband and I have been arguing a lot. And work has been really busy. I’m always worried about something. I try to cope, but it's hard sometimes. I don’t really have any hobbies or anything to relax me. I just… worry. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, high stress levels. That could definitely be contributing to your symptoms. Alright, Jase, that was a lot of information. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, I’m going to need to do a physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better, so… yes, please. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen – that means I’m going to gently feel your stomach. Hmm… it’s a little tender in your lower abdomen, especially on your left side. No masses that I can feel. Finally, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam, checking your reflexes and balance. Your reflexes are normal, and your balance seems good. Okay, all done. Everything seems fairly normal, but the tenderness in your lower abdomen is concerning, and given your symptoms and your history, I want to order some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. Tests… what kind of tests? Will they be… painful? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to order a complete blood count – that checks for things like anemia and infection. I also want to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and liver function. We'll also do a stool test to look for any bacteria, parasites, or blood. And, given your history and symptoms, I'd like to order a C-reactive protein and an Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate which can help us look for inflammation in your body. The blood tests are just a simple prick of the finger, and the stool sample can be collected at home with a kit we'll provide. The tests themselves shouldn't be painful. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for everything to come back from the lab. I'm also going to write you a prescription for some anti-diarrheal medication to help manage your symptoms in the meantime, but it’s important to remember that’s just treating the symptom, not the cause. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… blood tests, stool sample, anti-diarrheal medication… 3-5 days for the results. Yes, that makes sense. So, the medication will just help with the… diarrhea? And we need to wait for the tests to find out what's really wrong? Okay. That sounds… okay. You think you’ll be able to figure out what’s going on?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. The medication will help to control the diarrhea while we wait for the test results. And yes, the tests will help us to pinpoint what’s causing your symptoms. It could be a simple infection, or something more complex like inflammatory bowel disease, or even celiac disease. We’ll rule things out systematically. I do think we can figure out what's going on, Jase. It may take some time and a bit of investigation, but we’ll get there. I'm going to get a nurse to come in and give you the lab orders and the prescription for the medication. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, especially if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or notice blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before I get the nurse?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Dr. Georgiou. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I just… I want to feel better, you know? It’s just been… a lot. I hope we can figure it out soon.
DOCTOR: I understand, Jase. And I promise you, we’ll do everything we can to get you feeling better. It’s good you came in, and you’re not alone in this. We’ll work through it together. I’ll have the nurse in shortly. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And please, try to get some rest. .
PATIENT: .
