DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Pleasuah to meet you too. My foot… it hurt, yes? Very sore. I have… sugar sickness, they tell me. And now this hole… on my foot. It no heal.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Stoegbauer. So, you're experiencing pain in your foot, and you've noticed a wound that isn't healing. You also mentioned you have been told you have diabetes, or “sugar sickness” as you put it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this foot pain?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. It started small, like a little cut. I no pay much mind. But then… it get biggah. Now, it hurt all the time. Even when I stay still. And sometimes… it feel numb, you know? Like… no feeling at all. I walk slow now, very careful. Don't want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it began as a small cut, worsened over time, and now causes constant pain, even at rest. You've also noticed numbness in the area, and are walking more cautiously to avoid further irritation. Could you tell me approximately how long ago this cut first appeared, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Hmm… long time. Maybe… two, three months ago? Hard to say for sure. Time go fast when you old, yes? I no remember exactly. But it was before the hot season, I think. Before all the tourists come.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Stoegbauer. Time does seem to slip away. So, roughly two to three months ago, before the tourist season began. Now, have you noticed any redness, swelling, or pus draining from the wound?
PATIENT: Redness… yes, a little. Around the hole, it red. And sometimes… it get warm. Not all the time, but sometimes. Pus… I think so. A little white stuff come out, yes? I clean it with water every day, but it still no get bettah. I try, doctor. I really try. But it scare me, this hole. It look bad.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you telling me all of this, and I commend you for keeping it clean. It's good that you're being so attentive to it. The redness and warmth, along with the white discharge, are things we’ll need to investigate further. Now, let’s talk a bit about your diabetes. Do you know what your blood sugar levels typically are?
PATIENT: Blood sugar… doctor, I no know numbers. The doctor before… he give me the little stick, poke my finger. Then he say, “Too high!” And give me pills. I take pills every day. But I no know what the numbers mean. He no explain very good. I just take the pills. He move away, very fast. Now, new doctor. You explain bettah, I hope?
DOCTOR: I certainly hope so, Mr. Stoegbauer. It sounds like you didn’t receive a thorough explanation from your previous doctor, and that’s not ideal. We’ll take our time and go through everything carefully. Do you remember the name of the medication you are taking for your diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… little white pill. Small one. I think… Met… Metformin? Maybe? The bottle say something like that. I give it to my daughter, she help me with the pills. I no read so good anymore. She bring me the medicine every week.
DOCTOR: Metformin, yes. Excellent. It looks like you’ve been prescribed Metformin 500mg twice daily. That’s a common medication for diabetes. Now, in addition to the Metformin, are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the pills for my… heart. The doctor give me those too. Small blue pill. I take one every morning. And sometimes, when my knees hurt, I take something for the pain. But I no remember the name. My daughter buy it for me. She say it good for the… inflammation. She know all the names, she very smart. I just take what she give me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so Metformin for diabetes, a blue pill for your heart, and something for knee pain as needed. It's helpful that you have your daughter assisting you with your medications. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Long time ago… I break my arm when I was young. Fall from the mango tree! But that long time ago. And… when I was oldah, I stay in the hospital for a little while. My tummy hurt very bad. They say it was… diverticulitis? Something like that. They give me pills and I get bettah. But that was many years ago. No surgeries, I think. Never had the knife. I no like the knife.
DOCTOR: Alright, a broken arm in your youth and a hospital stay for diverticulitis. No surgeries, which is good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family's health?
PATIENT: My family… my mother, she have the sugar sickness too. And my brother, he have the heart problem. Many problems in my family, yes? My father, he strong like bull, no problems. But my mother… she lose her leg from the sugar. Very sad. That’s why I scare about my foot. I no want to lose my foot.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Stoegbauer, especially given your mother’s experience. It's certainly important to be proactive about your health, and that's why you're here today. Now, let's talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, doctor. I never smoke. My father no like smoke. He say it bad for the lungs. I listen to my father, always. He good man. And I no drink much alcohol. Maybe a little beer sometimes, with my friends. But not much. I like to garden, I like to fish. Keep me busy, keep me healthy. Mostly. This foot… it make it hard to do things now.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. Gardening and fishing are excellent ways to stay active, and avoiding smoking is very good for your overall health. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, doctor. I no think so. I eat everything. I no worry about food. Sometimes my tummy hurt a little, but I think it's the old age. And I no wear any fancy jewelry, so no metal allergy. I simple man, I no have many allergies. I think. Maybe a little itchy when the mosquitoes bite me, but everyone get itchy from the mosquitoes, yes?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Stoegbauer. No known allergies. Alright, let’s take a look at your foot now. Would you mind if I examined it?
PATIENT: No, doctor. Go ahead. Look all you want. I hope you can help me. It hurt so much. Be gentle, please? It very sensitive. I worry about this foot, you know? It scare me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Stoegbauer. I will be as gentle as possible. I see here a wound on the top of your foot. There is some redness around the edges, and some swelling. I also notice some discharge. I’m going to gently probe the wound to assess the depth. It does appear to be fairly deep. Your pulses in your foot feel present, but are a bit diminished. I’m going to check the sensation in your foot now. There appears to be some loss of sensation in the area around the wound, as well as in the toes. Okay, Mr. Stoegbauer. Based on my examination, it appears you have a fairly deep wound on your foot with some signs of infection. The diminished pulses and loss of sensation are concerning, as they can indicate poor circulation, which is common in people with diabetes. It’s very important we address this promptly to prevent further complications.
PATIENT: Complications? What kind of complications, doctor? You mean… I lose my foot? My mother… she lose her foot. I no want that. Please, doctor, tell me what we can do. I take more pills? I put something on the wound? Please help me. I very scared now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Stoegbauer, I understand your fear, and I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to help. Losing your foot is not inevitable, but it is a potential risk if we don’t address this infection and poor circulation. The good news is we caught this early enough that we have options. The infection needs to be treated, and we need to improve blood flow to your foot. To determine the best course of action, I’m going to order some tests. We’ll need a blood test to check your blood sugar levels and assess your overall health. I also want to get an X-ray of your foot to see if there’s any underlying bone infection. Depending on the results of those tests, we may need to consider antibiotics to fight the infection, and potentially a referral to a vascular specialist to evaluate your circulation. We'll also need to take very good care of the wound, keeping it clean and protected. I will provide detailed instructions on wound care, and I will want to see you back here frequently to monitor your progress. Does that make sense, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Tests… pills… specialist… Yes, doctor. That make sense. I take tests. I take pills. I see specialist. But… how long? How long before I know? And… will the specialist cut my foot? I no want cut. Please, doctor, be honest with me. I just want to keep my foot.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxieties, Mr. Stoegbauer. It's perfectly natural to feel worried. The blood tests and X-ray should be completed within the next few days. I expect we’ll have the results back within 48 to 72 hours. As for the specialist, the vascular specialist will evaluate your circulation – they won’t automatically cut your foot. They will perform some non-invasive tests to assess the blood flow and determine if any further intervention is needed. That intervention could include surgery, but it’s not a certainty. In many cases, they can improve circulation with medication or lifestyle changes. I want to be upfront with you: if the infection is severe, or if there is significant damage to the tissues, surgery may be necessary to prevent it from spreading. However, we’ll discuss all of your options thoroughly before making any decisions. I’m here to support you every step of the way, and we'll work together to get you the best possible care. In the meantime, it's very important to keep the wound clean and dry, and to avoid putting any weight on your foot as much as possible. I'm going to write you a prescription for a course of oral antibiotics to start immediately. I'll also give you detailed wound care instructions, and a referral to Dr. Kaimana, the vascular specialist here in town. Would you like me to also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to review the test results and discuss next steps?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. Please, schedule the appointment. And thank you. You explain very good. You make me feel… a little bit better. I try to keep it clean. I try to no worry so much. But it hard. This foot… it my life.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm glad I could help ease some of your worries. Remember, we’re a team in this, and I'm here to support you. I’ve scheduled you for a follow-up appointment next week, on August 9th at 10:00 AM. Here are your wound care instructions, the antibiotic prescription, and the referral to Dr. Kaimana. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care, and please do your best to rest and keep the wound clean.
