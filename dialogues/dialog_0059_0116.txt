DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Well… it’s my legs, dear. They just… ache. Mostly at night, you see. It wakes me up, it does. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness. A while now. I can’t rightly say how long, though. Things… slip my mind these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. Leg aches, especially those that wake you at night, can be quite bothersome. It’s alright that you don't recall exactly how long it’s been going on; we’ll work through it together. Could you describe the ache a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… it's not a sharp pain, you understand. More like… a tightening. A squeezing. Starts in my calf, I think. Down here. And it just… gets harder and harder until I have to… well, stretch it out. Sometimes that helps, sometimes it doesn't. It’s… unpleasant. Very unpleasant. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A tightening and squeezing sensation, starting in your calf, that worsens and is relieved somewhat by stretching. I appreciate you describing it so clearly. Now, does this ache happen only at night, or do you experience it at other times of the day as well?
PATIENT: Mostly at night, dear. Though… sometimes if I’ve been standing for a long time, I feel a little… a little pull. Not as bad, mind you. Nothing like what I get when I'm trying to sleep. It’s mostly just when I’m resting. Or trying to rest. It’s… it’s hard to explain. It just… happens. Do you… do you follow me? I’m afraid I’m not very good at this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Ms. Bilstein. It’s helpful to hear how it affects you, and you’re describing it very well. So, it’s primarily a nighttime issue, but you can experience a milder pulling sensation after prolonged standing. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the ache?
PATIENT: Oh… other symptoms? Let me see… Well… sometimes my leg feels a little… cool. Not cold, exactly. Just… not as warm as the other one. And… sometimes a little twitchy. It’ll just… jump. Not often, though. It doesn’t hurt when it does, it just… startles me. I can’t recall anything else, really. Old age, I suppose. Everything gets… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: It’s alright if things feel a little fuzzy; we’ll take our time. So, you’ve noticed a coolness in the affected leg and occasional twitching. That’s helpful information. Now, Ms. Bilstein, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any injuries to either of your legs recently, or in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Injuries… well, I was quite the tomboy as a girl. Lots of scrapes and bruises, you understand. Running around, climbing trees… but nothing serious. I don't recall breaking anything. As for recently… no, dear. Nothing I can remember. I haven't fallen or anything like that. I try to be careful. Though… … years ago, my husband… he said I twisted my ankle once. But that was decades ago, and it healed up just fine. I don’t think that’s related, is it?
DOCTOR: No, a twisted ankle decades ago likely isn't related to your current symptoms. It’s good to know you haven’t had any recent injuries. Now, do you have any other medical conditions that you are aware of, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think… My husband used to say I had a touch of… what was it now? Not the sugar sickness… the pressure one? High blood pressure, that’s it. But I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, goodness. Years. He handled all that. He said I worried too much. And… I suppose he was right. I don't feel sick, if that makes sense. Just… these legs. I really haven’t been keeping track of things lately. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if things feel blurry, and it's common for things to be handled by a spouse. Having a history of high blood pressure is important information, though. Now, Ms. Bilstein, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh… medications. Let me see. No, dear. Not that I know of. Not regularly, anyway. Sometimes I take something for… for my nerves. When I can’t sleep, you understand. But it’s just an old bottle my friend gave me. I don’t even remember what it’s for, truthfully. It’s mostly just… a little something to help me relax. But I haven’t taken it in… oh, goodness. Weeks, perhaps. Months? I really couldn’t say.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no regular medications and occasional use of something for nerves, but you haven't taken it recently. Now, Ms. Bilstein, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, such as food or pollen?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. Not that I’m aware of. I used to get a little sniffly in the springtime, you understand. With all the flowers blooming. But that was just a little sneeze here and there. Nothing serious. And… no, I don’t think I’ve ever had a bad reaction to anything. I eat just about everything, really. Old age, you see. You get used to things. Though… sometimes my stomach doesn't agree with me. But I don't think that’s an allergy. Just… old age. Is that enough? Am I being helpful? I do worry I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Bilstein, and not rambling at all. It’s good to know you don’t have any known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your legs, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just take a look and feel for anything unusual. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That would be just fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, alright? My legs aren’t what they used to be. Go right ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bilstein. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, Ms. Bilstein. I'm noting some mild coolness to the left leg compared to the right, as you mentioned. Your pulses are present, but slightly weaker in the left foot. I’m also feeling some tightness in the calf muscles of the left leg. There is no visible swelling or skin discoloration. I don’t detect any significant tenderness to the touch. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m finding on the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of peripheral artery disease, or PAD, combined with possible venous insufficiency. PAD involves narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to your legs, which can cause pain, especially with activity. The coolness and weaker pulse suggest reduced blood flow. The tightness and nighttime aches could be related to venous insufficiency, where the veins have trouble returning blood to the heart. However, these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be willing to have an Ankle-Brachial Index, or ABI, done?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. Arteries and veins… It all sounds very complicated, dear. An… ABI, you say? What does that involve? Is it painful? I don't like needles, you know. And… is it expensive? I haven’t got much money, and my husband… well, he always took care of these things. I don’t want to be a burden. It's just… all this talk of blood flow and… insufficiency. It frightens me a little. What are we trying to find out, exactly? Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Bilstein, and it's perfectly alright to feel frightened. Let me explain everything as clearly as possible. The Ankle-Brachial Index, or ABI, is a simple, non-invasive test. It doesn’t involve any needles or injections. We use a blood pressure cuff and a handheld ultrasound device to compare the blood pressure in your ankles to the blood pressure in your arms. This helps us assess how well blood is flowing through the arteries in your legs. It takes about 10-15 minutes and isn’t painful at all. As for the cost, I understand your financial concerns. We can discuss options for reducing the cost, and I can connect you with resources that may be able to help. I will also speak with the billing department to see what kind of arrangements can be made. We're trying to find out if the blood flow to your legs is reduced, and if so, to what extent. If the blood flow is reduced, we can discuss treatment options to improve circulation and relieve your symptoms. It’s important to remember that many people experience PAD, and it can often be managed effectively with lifestyle changes and medication. We're not necessarily looking for something “bad,” but rather trying to get a clear understanding of what’s going on so we can provide you with the best possible care. Would you be willing to proceed with the ABI test?
PATIENT: Oh… no needles, you say? That's… reassuring. And you'll help me with the cost? That's very kind of you, Doctor. Well… if it doesn't involve needles, and you'll help me with the money… alright. Yes. Let’s do the test. I just want to know what's going on, you see. It's been bothering me for so long. And I… I don’t want to be a burden. When do we do it? Is it today? I hope it doesn't take too long. I have my… my afternoon tea, you see. I don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Wonderful, Ms. Bilstein. I’m glad you’ve decided to proceed with the test. It won’t take long at all, and we can absolutely work around your afternoon tea. We can do it right here in the examination room. It should take about 15-20 minutes total, including the preparation and the actual test itself. I’ll explain everything as we go, and you can stop me at any time if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and get you set up. She’ll take your blood pressure and explain the procedure in a little more detail. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me before we begin?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. I think you've explained everything very well. Just… thank you. Thank you for being so patient and understanding. It's… it's nice to have someone listen. And… thank you for helping me with the cost. My husband… he would have appreciated that. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… let’s get it over with, shall we? The sooner I know what’s going on, the better. And… please, just be gentle. My legs aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Bilstein. I will be as gentle as possible. And you’ve already explained everything I need to know. I'll just let Sarah know you’re ready, and she’ll be in shortly. You've been very brave coming in and getting this checked out. I promise we will work through this together. Sarah, could you please come to examination room number two when you have a moment?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I do appreciate it. I just… I worry, you see. Old age, you know. Things just… start to fall apart. But… you seem very capable. And kind. That’s important. I suppose I’ll just wait for Sarah, then. And try not to worry too much. It’s hard, though, isn't it? All these… tests and procedures. When I was younger, things were so much simpler.
