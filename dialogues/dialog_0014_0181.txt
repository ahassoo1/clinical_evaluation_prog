DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Osterholm. Thank you for seeing me. I requested a general check-up, a full lab panel, if you will. Just wanting to make sure everything is still in working order, you understand. At my age, one wants to be… proactive.
DOCTOR: Proactive, yes, of course. Though frankly, most people your age are just looking for something to complain about. Still. A “full lab panel” is rather vague. Do you have any specific concerns?
PATIENT: Oh, I assure you, Doctor, I am not here to complain! I simply wish to have a comprehensive overview of my health. No specific concerns, no aches or pains particularly troubling me. Just… a baseline, shall we say? To have a clear picture, and to be able to compare results in the future if need be. Is that so unusual?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not unusual. It’s… inefficient. But alright. We can do a standard complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a basic urinalysis. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies to my knowledge, Doctor. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me throughout my seventy-four years, and so far, no ill effects! Though… my wife does say I have an allergy to being told what to do. But medically, no. No allergies to report.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of lisinopril, Doctor, for my blood pressure. My family doctor prescribed it a few years back, and it seems to be doing the trick. Other than that, nothing. I prefer a good cup of coffee and a walk in the sun for my well-being, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril. Dosage?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s been some time since I last looked at the bottle myself. My wife handles those things, you see. I believe it’s ten milligrams, once a day. Yes, ten milligrams, every morning with my coffee. I’m quite certain of it. Though, perhaps it’s best to double-check with my wife, just to be absolutely sure. She has a remarkable memory.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s get a basic physical exam done first. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. Then we can order the labs. Please take a seat on the exam table and loosen your shirt.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is a little elevated, but not alarming. Lungs are clear, but you do have a slightly raspy sound on exhale. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother would haunt me if I did. Perhaps it’s simply the air, Doctor. The city air isn’t what it used to be, you know. Or perhaps it’s just a bit of a cough – I’ve had a tickle in my throat for a day or two. Nothing to worry over, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Slightly enlarged liver, but again, not particularly concerning at your age. Your weight is… 90 kilograms?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is correct. A solid 90 kilograms. I was always a robust man, even as a boy. Strong build, you see. Plenty of muscle… well, perhaps a little less muscle these days. But still, a healthy weight, I believe. I’ve never been one to starve myself, preferring good food and good company.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we'll see what the labs say. I'm ordering a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, and urinalysis. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. Don't eat or drink anything other than water for the next eight hours if we need to repeat anything. Any family history of… anything relevant?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My father lived a long life, nearly ninety years, though he did have a touch of diabetes towards the end. My mother was remarkably healthy, until a fall brought about her passing. As for other ailments… my uncle on my mother’s side had some issues with his heart, I believe. Nothing particularly dramatic, though. Mostly just… the usual aches and pains of getting old, you understand. We were a sturdy people, my family, generally. Not prone to illness.
DOCTOR: Alright. Diabetes, heart issues. Noted. The phlebotomist will be with you shortly. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: Well, actually, yes, Doctor. I was wondering… with these lab results, and my general check-up, would you be able to give me some advice on… maintaining my energy levels? I find myself tiring a bit more easily these days, and I’d like to continue enjoying my walks and tending to my garden. Perhaps some suggestions for diet, or… supplements? Anything to keep me feeling sprightly, you understand.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Mombrun, let's get the lab results back first. We can discuss supplements then. Frankly, you're seventy-four years old. Some fatigue is to be expected. Eat a balanced diet, get some exercise, and try not to stress. That’s about the best advice I can give you right now. The phlebotomist should be here any minute. .
PATIENT: .
