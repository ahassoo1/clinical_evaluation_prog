DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doctor, it’s… it’s about having a baby. I don’t want any trouble, you know? I lost my husband a few years back, and I’d like to… well, have a child before it’s too late. I don’t want any complications or… issues. Is that clear enough? I haven’t got all day to explain my life story.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly clear, Carmaleta. Thank you for sharing that with me. It takes courage to come in and discuss something so personal, and I want to assure you that we will take things at your pace. It’s completely understandable to want to avoid complications, especially given your circumstances. So, to get a better understanding of your situation, have you been trying to conceive already?
PATIENT: Trying? Not really. I mean, it hasn't been… a priority, exactly. It’s more like… I’d like to, if it’s going to be easy. I don’t have time for all that… poking and prodding. Is there a test? Can we just do a test to see if everything’s alright and move on? Honestly, I just want to know if I can even have a baby without a whole lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. You'd like to assess your ability to conceive without undergoing extensive testing initially, if possible. That’s a very reasonable approach. Yes, there are several tests we can do to get a good starting point. A basic blood test can check your hormone levels, which are important for ovulation and pregnancy. We can also do a pelvic exam to assess the health of your reproductive organs. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little bit about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Ugh, cycles. Honestly? They're… irregular. Always have been. Sometimes they're close together, sometimes… not so much. I really don't keep track, Doctor. It's not like I needed to before. Now that I’m thinking about it… they’ve been even more irregular since… well, since my husband passed. Does that matter? I just want to know if this is going to be a long, drawn-out process. I really don’t have the patience for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, irregular cycles, and a change in regularity since your husband's passing. That definitely gives us some important information. Changes in cycle regularity can be related to stress or other life events, and it’s good you mentioned that. To get a clearer picture, could you give me a rough estimate of how often you typically have a period – even if it varies?
PATIENT: Rough estimate? Honestly, it’s all a blur. Maybe every… six weeks? Sometimes longer. I truly don’t remember. Look, is there a pill? Can’t you just give me a pill to regulate everything? I'm not looking for a miracle, but I'd prefer a quick fix to all this questioning. I have things to do, you know? I haven’t got time to sit here dissecting my… my periods.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. It sounds like you’re hoping for a straightforward solution. While there are medications that can help regulate cycles, it's important to first understand why your cycles are irregular before starting any treatment. Simply regulating them without knowing the cause might mask an underlying issue. To help me get a better understanding, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, I don't get sick often. A cold here and there, but nothing serious. I had… the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, but that was ages ago. Oh, and I had a difficult delivery with my daughter, years and years back. Needed a… a procedure. But other than that, I’m generally healthy. And frankly, I'd rather not dwell on the past. It’s not helping me have a baby, is it? Can we just skip this part and get to the tests?
DOCTOR: I understand. You're generally healthy and would prefer to focus on getting to the testing phase. The difficult delivery is important information, so thank you for sharing that. Okay, we can certainly proceed with some initial tests. I’d like to start with a blood test to check your hormone levels and assess your overall health. We can also do a pelvic exam to get a better understanding of your reproductive organs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. Blood test, exam… whatever. As long as it doesn't take too long. And please, tell me the results quickly. I don’t want to be waiting around for weeks. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Do I need to fast? Because I have a lunch appointment. I really, really need to know if this is going to interfere with my schedule. .
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. We'll certainly try to expedite the results as much as possible. For the blood test, you will need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand – no food or drinks except water. It's important to have an accurate reading. And the pelvic exam is fairly quick and straightforward. Let’s get you scheduled for those tests, and then we can discuss the next steps once the results are back. I’ll also have my nurse give you a list of instructions for the fasting. Is there a day this week that works best for you?
