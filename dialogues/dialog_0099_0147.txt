DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Raghunathan, welcome. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, I’ve noticed a lump… a mass, I guess, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a few weeks now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: A lump in your lower abdomen, you said. For a few weeks. Okay. Can you describe it to me?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… firm, not really painful to the touch, though sometimes a little uncomfortable. It feels maybe a couple of inches across? Roundish, I suppose. It doesn’t seem to be getting bigger quickly, but it’s definitely not going away on its own. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: “Not going away on its own,” right. And you haven’t noticed any other changes – no redness, warmth, discharge, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. No redness or warmth, and definitely no discharge. Just the lump itself. I haven't had any fever or changes in my… bowel habits, if that’s what you were going to ask. No weight loss either, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No pain anywhere else. Just… awareness of it, you know? It’s not a sharp pain, just… a feeling of fullness, sometimes. It doesn’t interfere with my work, but it’s on my mind, naturally. I’m a choreographer, and I need to be able to move freely.
DOCTOR: A choreographer, you say. Well, that explains the concern about mobility, I suppose. And how is your appetite?
PATIENT: Yes, I choreograph. It’s important work! As for my appetite… it’s been normal, I think. Not significantly changed. I eat regularly, maybe a little less when I’m very focused on a project, but nothing drastic. I haven’t been losing my appetite, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to some other things then. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes, actually. When I was quite young, I had my appendix removed. That was… oh, it must be over twenty years ago now. And I’ve had the usual vaccinations, of course, but no other surgeries or serious illnesses. Nothing that I can recall, anyway. Would that appendix removal be relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's good to know. Anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my father had some issues with his prostate when he was older, if that’s relevant. It required… treatment, but I’m not a medical professional, so I don’t know the specifics. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, managed with medication. Is that the kind of family history you're looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not. I generally try to avoid medication if I can. I eat a healthy diet and get plenty of exercise, and I haven’t needed anything beyond the occasional pain reliever for a headache, and that’s very rare. I don’t take any regular supplements either. Nothing at all, really.
DOCTOR: Right. Good. Now, let's have a quick physical exam. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. Just let me know if there's anything specific you'd like me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to palpate your abdomen, so please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. I'll start here on the left side. Tell me if this is uncomfortable. …Hmm. No significant tenderness there. Now, moving to the right side. …And here… yes. I feel a firm, somewhat rounded mass. Approximately two inches in diameter. Not freely mobile. Some mild discomfort with palpation. No rebound tenderness, but there is a noticeable fullness. I’m also noting some mild guarding. Okay. It’s as you described. Now, I want to listen to your bowel sounds.
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds… concerning, naturally. It's good you found it, I suppose. I felt a little discomfort there, yes, but nothing… excruciating. Listening to my bowel sounds… is that to see if it's causing any blockage? I'm not very familiar with medical procedures, Doctor. Perhaps you could explain what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Raghunathan. I'm listening to make sure everything is functioning normally. Bowel sounds are present, but slightly diminished in the lower right quadrant. That could be due to the mass, or something else entirely. Based on this initial examination, it's difficult to say definitively what this is. It could be a number of things. We’ll need some further investigation. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. That will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Do you have any allergies I need to be aware of before ordering these tests?
PATIENT: Oh, of course. I apologize, Doctor. I didn't mean to question the procedure, just… anxious, I suppose. No allergies, thankfully. No known allergies to medication or contrast dye, as far as I’m aware. I’ve never had a CT scan before, so I haven't been exposed to any contrast dye. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the scan? And how long will it take to get the results? I need to be back at the studio next week to begin rehearsals…
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. No allergies simplifies things. As for the CT scan, you'll need to fast for at least six hours beforehand, and you’ll likely be given oral contrast dye to drink before the scan. The lab will provide detailed instructions. As for results, it usually takes 24 to 48 hours for the radiologist to review the images and send the report. I will review the report myself, and then we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and determine the best course of action. I’ll have the nurse send over the lab requisitions and the instructions for the CT scan. I suggest you schedule the scan as soon as possible. Do you have any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very helpful. I think… no, I don't have any immediate questions. Fast for six hours, schedule the scan quickly, and then a follow-up appointment. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me and explaining everything so thoroughly, even if you were… a little impatient at times. I understand you're busy. I’ll make sure to follow the instructions carefully and schedule the scan right away. Thank you again, Doctor Overgaard.
DOCTOR: Alright. See to it. The nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork. Don't hesitate to call if you have any difficulties scheduling the scan.
