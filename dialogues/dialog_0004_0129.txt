DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get on with it. It's my…well, my stool. It's black. Like…really black. And I take those pills, you know, for the arthritis. The ones the other doctor gave me. Been taking them for years, honestly. It's probably just that. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Black stools are certainly something we need to investigate, even if you suspect it’s related to your arthritis medication. It’s good you’re aware of it. “Years” is a long time to be on a medication, and we should review that. First, can you describe the stool itself?
PATIENT: Describe it? Honestly, it looks like…well, like tar. Dark, sticky…you know. Not normal. It's not watery, if that’s what you’re asking. Just…dark. And it smells…well, like stool, obviously. What else would it smell like? I don't need a detailed description lesson, thank you very much. Are we getting somewhere, or are you just going to ask me a million questions?
DOCTOR: No, we are getting somewhere. "Tar-like" is a helpful description, thank you. It's important to be thorough, Ms. Hatchard. We need to rule out potential causes. Has there been any change in the amount of stool you're passing?
PATIENT: Amount? Oh, for goodness sake. It's…normal, I suppose. Not more, not less. I don't weigh it or anything! Really, doctor, I haven't been inspecting my…output that closely. It goes in, it comes out. That's how it works. Are you suspecting I'm making this up? Because I assure you, I'm not. It's black, and it's concerning. Now, can we just figure out what's causing it and get me some medicine if I need it? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Hatchard, I'm not suspecting you of anything. I'm simply gathering information to determine the best course of action. Black, tarry stools can indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract, and that needs to be investigated. Let’s move on to your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever had any issues with ulcers, heartburn, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Ulcers? Oh, goodness, no. I’ve always had a strong stomach. Heartburn, sometimes, if I eat something spicy. But who doesn't? And abdominal pain…well, old age comes with aches and pains, doesn't it? I wouldn't call any of it serious pain. It's just…discomfort. I'm not a delicate flower, doctor. I’ve lived a long life. Are you going to ask about every little ache and pain I’ve ever had? Because I haven't got time for that. Just tell me if this is serious or not, and what we’re going to do about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll keep it concise. Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. I’m 73 years old! Of course I get tired! And sometimes a little breathless walking up the stairs. What did you expect? I'm not exactly spring chicken anymore, you know. It’s called getting old, doctor. And I’m sure it’s not related to my…stool. Honestly, this is all very tiresome. Are you going to do a test or not? Because I really need to get going. I have a luncheon with my ladies.
DOCTOR: Yes, we will do a test. Before we proceed, I need to ask about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. You mentioned pills for arthritis—can you tell me the name of that medication and the dosage?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. The name…let me think. It’s…Naproxen. Yes, Naproxen. 500 milligrams. I take two of them, twice a day. Sometimes three if my arthritis is acting up, but mostly just two. I’ve been taking it for…oh, I don’t know, ten years maybe? Longer. Look, is that enough information? I really don’t keep track of these things. It’s a pill, it helps my arthritis. That’s all I know. Can we just get this over with? I’m starting to feel faint just talking about it all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Naproxen 500mg twice daily, sometimes three times daily. It is possible that the Naproxen is contributing to the stool color, as NSAIDs like that can cause gastrointestinal irritation. However, we still need to rule out other causes. I'm going to conduct a brief physical exam, and then I'd like to order a stool test to check for blood, and a complete blood count to check for anemia. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever. A test is a test. Just don’t poke me too much. And don’t keep me waiting all day. I have a life, you know. Can I sit down for this exam, or do I have to stand here like a…a specimen? Honestly, this whole thing is just dreadful. Get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. We'll keep it as brief as possible. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen and feel for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything is painful. Do you experience any pain in your abdomen when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, there! A little bit. Not terrible, but…yes, that’s a bit sore. It’s probably just gas, though. I ate a bean salad yesterday. You know how those things are. Honestly, don't make a big deal out of it. It's just a little bit of discomfort. Can we get on with the…the stool test now? I really don't want to be here any longer than I have to. This is all very undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about here?
PATIENT: No, that's alright. That doesn't bother me. See? It's just gas. I told you. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite faint. Is this exam going to take much longer? I really need to get going. This is ridiculous. I've lived a long life and I've never had so much poking and prodding over…stool. It's simply absurd. Can we please just get to the test? I have a luncheon to attend. And I'm quite sure my ladies will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. I’ve completed the physical exam. I did detect some tenderness in your abdomen, which could be due to gas, as you mentioned. However, given the black stool and your history of Naproxen use, we need to rule out a more serious cause. I'm going to order a fecal occult blood test – a stool test to check for hidden blood. I’m also ordering a complete blood count to check for anemia. The nurse will provide you with instructions on how to collect the stool sample. It will likely require a couple of samples over a couple of days. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. It may be necessary to consult with a gastroenterologist if the results are concerning. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist? Oh, for goodness sake. Another doctor? This is getting out of hand. Just…just tell me if it's serious or not, and what I need to do. I really don't want to be running around to a dozen different doctors. And a stool sample? Honestly, this is mortifying. Fine, I'll do it. But please, just keep it simple. And don't expect me to be thrilled about it. I have better things to do than collect…well, you know. Can I at least get a card with the gastroenterologist's name and number, just in case? And tell the nurse to be quick. I'm starting to feel quite faint again. .
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. The nurse will provide you with the collection kit and instructions. She will also give you a referral card with a gastroenterologist’s name and number. We will discuss the results as soon as they become available. If you experience any increased abdominal pain, dizziness, or blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Here is the referral information. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
