DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia, have a seat. August 2nd, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor Billman. Thank you. It is August 2nd. And… well, I suppose you’ve noticed I’ve put on a little weight. Though, frankly, I find it rather impolite to state the obvious.
DOCTOR: Impolite?
PATIENT: Yes. A proper physician would inquire as to why I am seeking assistance, rather than… commenting on my physique. It’s rather…unsophisticated, don't you think? However, since you ask, I've been feeling quite fatigued lately, despite maintaining my usual activities. And I’ve been having… night sweats. It’s terribly disruptive to my sleep.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and night sweats… alright. And how long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Approximately… let me see… it began roughly three months ago. March, I believe. It started subtly, just feeling a little more tired than usual, but it has steadily worsened. The night sweats… those began about a month after the fatigue, and are now almost nightly. Quite unpleasant, I assure you. It requires changing my linens, and frankly, my husband finds it bothersome.
DOCTOR: Right. And has anything changed in your life recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Not particularly. My husband and I maintain a very structured routine. I continue my work as a graphic designer – mostly branding, very discerning clients, you understand. No new travel. No significant alterations to my diet, though I do confess to a fondness for sweets. But that’s hardly a recent development. I truly can't pinpoint any specific change that might be contributing to this… unpleasantness.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, I have been feeling rather…warm, generally. Not a fever, precisely, just… flushed. And occasionally, a slight discomfort in my joints, particularly my knees. It’s nothing debilitating, just… a nagging ache. And, well, I have lost some of my appetite. Though I maintain my portion sizes, I find myself less…enthusiastic about my meals. It's quite distressing, really. Maintaining appearances is very important, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your chart here... 18 years old, graphic designer, private insurance. No recent hospitalizations… Any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies. None whatsoever. I am very careful about what I consume and avoid anything that might be… substandard. I believe I mentioned my discerning nature previously. And my husband is quite vigilant about ensuring the quality of our provisions. He’s a biochemist, you see, so he’s quite knowledgeable on such matters. It would be most irregular for me to have an allergic reaction.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: No. I do not take medications. I believe in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and avoiding unnecessary pharmaceuticals. My husband and I find that a balanced diet and sufficient rest are far more effective than… artificial interventions. I take a daily multivitamin, but that's hardly a medication. And occasionally, chamomile tea for…relaxation. But that is hardly relevant to this…situation.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your vitals and listen to your heart and lungs. Can you step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Must we? I already informed you I’ve gained a little weight. I find repeated emphasis on such a trivial matter rather…demeaning. However, if it’s absolutely necessary for… diagnostic purposes, I suppose I can comply. But I expect a thorough explanation of why it's required. And I do hope it’s a properly calibrated scale.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Jailia. We need a baseline measurement. It helps us understand your overall health. And yes, it is calibrated. Please, step on. I assure you, it won't be… judgemental. Right. That's… 105 pounds. And your height is listed as 196cm. That gives you a BMI of… 27.3. A little above the normal range, but not alarming. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please, take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: “A little above the normal range”? That is a rather…simplistic assessment. And frankly, I find the focus on a single numerical value rather…reductionist. My physique is naturally… robust. Now, if you wouldn’t mind expediting this process, I have a rather important branding project awaiting my attention. There. Is that sufficient for your…assessment?
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to check your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes are… slightly enlarged. Not dramatically, but enough to warrant further investigation. Do you have any history of night sweats before these three months, or any recent infections?
PATIENT: "Slightly enlarged"? I assure you, my constitution is perfectly sound. Perhaps your technique is… lacking? I have never experienced night sweats prior to this past March, and I rarely fall ill. A common cold perhaps, once every few years, but nothing more substantial. My husband is quite fastidious about hygiene, you understand. And I maintain a rigorous schedule of self-care. This is… most perplexing. Is there something… serious I should be concerned about? But it must be a mistake.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia. Given your symptoms—fatigue, night sweats, loss of appetite, and the enlarged lymph nodes—I want to run some blood tests to rule out a few possibilities. Things like a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and a few tests to check for inflammation. It’s standard procedure. We also may need to consider imaging, like a chest X-ray, depending on the results of the blood work. It's important to be thorough. Do you have any objections to these tests?
PATIENT: “A few possibilities”? That is hardly reassuring. I find the implication that something might be… amiss quite distressing. While I appreciate your… thoroughness, I must confess, I harbor a rather strong aversion to needles. And the idea of subjecting myself to… imaging is most unpleasant. However, if it’s absolutely necessary to alleviate my concerns and determine the cause of this… unfortunate condition, I suppose I can comply. But I expect a full explanation of each procedure before it is administered. And I trust the laboratory is of the highest caliber? I wouldn’t dream of allowing substandard analysis of my… vital fluids.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jailia. The lab is certified, and we use the best equipment. The blood tests are relatively simple—a few vials will be drawn. The chest x-ray is quick and painless—you’ll just stand in front of a machine. The tests will help us rule out things like infection, autoimmune disorders, and—although it’s unlikely given your age—certain types of cancer. I'll order the tests now. The nurse will come in and draw your blood. And we'll schedule the X-ray for tomorrow. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: “Certain types of cancer”? Now you’re simply alarming me! This is… wholly unacceptable! I came to you seeking a diagnosis for fatigue and night sweats, not to be subjected to… insinuations of terminal illness. While I appreciate the attempt to be… comprehensive, I insist on a more detailed explanation of why these tests are necessary. What specifically are you looking for? And what are the likelihoods of each… undesirable outcome? I expect clarity, Doctor Billman. My peace of mind is paramount. And I trust the nurse is experienced in… gentle venipuncture? I have a rather… sensitive constitution. And I would appreciate a quiet room for the procedure. The clinical atmosphere is most… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia. Let me explain. The fatigue and night sweats can have many causes - everything from a simple viral infection to something more complex. The enlarged lymph nodes are what prompt us to investigate further. We’re looking for signs of infection – something like mononucleosis or another bacterial infection. We also need to rule out autoimmune conditions, where your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body. And, as a precaution, we need to screen for certain types of lymphoma, which is a cancer of the lymph nodes. It's highly unlikely, but it's important to rule it out completely. The likelihood of it being lymphoma is very low, especially given your age and lack of other symptoms. But we need to be thorough. I understand your anxiety, and I assure you, we'll do everything we can to make the process as comfortable as possible. I’ll speak with the nurse to ensure a quiet room and gentle venipuncture. Does that alleviate your concerns, even slightly?
PATIENT: "Mononucleosis"? I haven’t been in close contact with anyone exhibiting… adolescent behavior. And "autoimmune conditions"? I maintain a perfectly balanced lifestyle. This sounds increasingly improbable. However, if it will expedite the process and alleviate my… anxieties, I suppose I can submit to these… indignities. But I expect a detailed report of the results, Doctor Billman. And I expect you to explain each finding in layman’s terms. I have no patience for… medical jargon. And I trust you will refrain from speculating on… worst-case scenarios. My constitution is remarkably… resilient. Now, where is this nurse? And is she aware of my… sensitivities? I trust she possesses a steady hand? This is most… trying.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia. I'll have the nurse come in immediately. Her name is Maria, and she's very experienced. I’ll personally ensure she is aware of your concerns and that she’s extra gentle. I’ll also have her explain each step of the process. As for the results, I’ll review them thoroughly and explain them to you in simple terms. No jargon, I promise. Maria, could you come to exam room three?
PATIENT: Very well. I trust this “Maria” is… punctual? I have a branding proposal awaiting my attention this afternoon, and I cannot afford to be delayed indefinitely by… clinical procedures. And Doctor Billman, while I appreciate your… assurances, I must reiterate my expectation of a thorough explanation of each finding. I am not a medical professional, and I require clarity, not speculation. Now, please, expedite this process. I find the clinical atmosphere most… unsettling.
DOCTOR: She should be right here. And I assure you, Jailia, I will explain everything. We will go through the results together, step-by-step. Your peace of mind is important. Maria, this is Jailia. She's a little anxious about getting some blood work done. Could you please explain the procedure to her?
PATIENT: Well? Do explain. And I trust you are proficient in… gentle venipuncture? I have a remarkably sensitive constitution, and I will not tolerate any… discomfort. Do proceed, but with the utmost care. I have a rather important branding proposal awaiting my attention this afternoon, and I cannot afford to be delayed by… unnecessary pain.
DOCTOR: Hello, Jailia. My name is Maria, and it's lovely to meet you. Yes, I'm very experienced in drawing blood, and I always prioritize making my patients as comfortable as possible. We'll just need to take a small sample of blood from your arm. First, I'll tie a little tourniquet around your upper arm to make your veins more visible. Then, I’ll clean the area with an antiseptic wipe. You might feel a little pinch when the needle goes in, but it's very quick. It's over before you know it. We’ll collect a few different vials for the different tests Doctor Billman ordered. After that, I’ll remove the needle and apply a bandage. It's important to keep the area clean and dry for a few hours. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: “A little pinch”? That is hardly reassuring. And "a few vials"? Precisely how many vials are we discussing? I trust you are employing a sterile technique? I would be most displeased to contract any… extraneous infections. And do inform me of the precise location of the puncture site. I have a rather important event this evening, and I would prefer to avoid any… unsightly bruising. Also, do you have any experience with… particularly delicate veins? Mine are somewhat… elusive.
DOCTOR: We'll be drawing about four vials of blood, Jailia. And yes, absolutely, we use a strict sterile technique with every patient. We use a new, single-use needle for each blood draw to ensure your safety and prevent any infections. As for the puncture site, we’ll aim for the inner crease of your elbow, which is a comfortable location and minimizes the risk of bruising. As for your veins, don't worry, I have a lot of experience drawing blood from patients with delicate veins. I can use a few different techniques to locate a suitable vein and make the process as comfortable as possible. If we have trouble finding a vein, we can use a warm compress to help it become more visible. Would you like me to apply a warm compress to your arm now?
PATIENT: “Four vials”? That is… excessive. And "a warm compress"? Will that necessitate the removal of my sleeve? I trust the temperature is… moderate? I would be most displeased to be subjected to any… undue warmth. And do ensure the technique is… gentle. I have a remarkably sensitive constitution, and I would prefer to avoid any… bruising. Also, do inform me of the precise duration of this… ordeal. I have a branding proposal awaiting my attention this afternoon, and I cannot afford to be delayed indefinitely by… clinical procedures. And do ensure the room is adequately ventilated. I find the clinical atmosphere most… stifling. Begin, but with the utmost care. And do inform me precisely when the needle is about to… penetrate. I would prefer to be… prepared.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia. We’ll start with the warm compress to help make your vein more visible. It will be at a comfortable temperature, just warm enough to help the vein expand, and you won't need to remove your sleeve. The entire process should only take about five to ten minutes, including locating the vein, drawing the blood, and applying the bandage. I’ll let you know exactly when I’m about to insert the needle, and I promise to be as gentle as possible. I’ll also make sure to apply pressure to the site after the draw to minimize any bruising. Now, just relax your arm, and I’ll gently feel for a suitable vein. Do you feel the warmth?
PATIENT: The warmth is… tolerable. But do ensure it doesn’t become… excessive. And do not apply undue pressure. I have a remarkably sensitive constitution, and I would prefer to avoid any… discomfort. Also, do refrain from any… unnecessary chatter. I find the clinical atmosphere most… stifling, and I would prefer to maintain a state of… tranquility. Proceed, but with the utmost care. And do inform me precisely when you are about to… penetrate. I would prefer to be… prepared. And do ensure the needle is… sterile. I would be most displeased to contract any… extraneous infections. Begin, but with the utmost care. Now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia. I've located a suitable vein. I’m now going to insert the needle. You’ll feel a quick pinch, and then a slight pressure. Remember to breathe deeply and relax your arm. There. You’re doing great. Just relax, and I’ll collect the samples now.
PATIENT: Aaaah! That was a pinch! And quite… unpleasant. And do refrain from any… sudden movements. I have a remarkably sensitive constitution, and I would prefer to maintain a state of… tranquility. Is it nearly over? This is… quite distressing. And do ensure you are collecting the correct samples. I would be most displeased to discover any… erroneous analysis. Nearly over? Now.
DOCTOR: Almost done, Jailia. Just a few more seconds. There. All done. Here you go. All finished. Just keep this bandage on for about fifteen to twenty minutes to prevent any bleeding or bruising. You did great, Jailia. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: "All done"? Finally. It took an eternity. And do refrain from any… undue enthusiasm. The bandage feels… constricting. And do ensure it’s… sterile. I would be most displeased to discover any… extraneous infections. And how long must I endure this… constriction? I have a branding proposal awaiting my attention this afternoon, and I cannot afford to be delayed indefinitely by… clinical procedures. And do ensure I do not experience any… undue discomfort. I have a remarkably sensitive constitution. Now. Can I remove it immediately after fifteen minutes? Or must I endure it for a longer period? And what precisely am I to do if I experience any… undue bleeding? Now.
DOCTOR: You can remove the bandage after fifteen minutes, Jailia. It’s just to prevent any bleeding or bruising at the puncture site. If you experience any bleeding, just apply gentle pressure to the area for a few minutes and it should stop on its own. If it doesn't stop after a few minutes, or if you notice any swelling or pain, please let us know. And yes, it was a bit of an ordeal, but you handled it very well. Doctor Billman will be in shortly to discuss the results with you. In the meantime, would you like a glass of water?
PATIENT: "A glass of water"? How… pedestrian. However, I suppose a small sip might be… tolerable. But do ensure it's… filtered. I have a remarkably sensitive constitution. And do refrain from any… unnecessary chatter. I find the clinical atmosphere most… stifling, and I would prefer to maintain a state of… tranquility. And do ensure Doctor Billman is prepared to discuss the results in a… comprehensive manner. I require clarity, not speculation. And do refrain from any… unnecessary medical jargon. I am not a medical professional, and I require explanations in… layman’s terms. And do ensure he is aware of my… sensitivities. Now. Bring the water. And do expedite the process. I have a branding proposal awaiting my attention this afternoon, and I cannot afford to be delayed indefinitely by… clinical procedures. Now.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jailia. Here you are. And I'll let Doctor Billman know to be prepared to discuss the results in a comprehensive and easy-to-understand manner. He’ll be with you shortly. Please, just relax and try to take a few deep breaths.
PATIENT: Finally. Now. Let us hope Doctor Billman is prepared. I have a branding proposal awaiting my attention this afternoon, and I cannot afford to be delayed indefinitely by… clinical procedures. And do refrain from any… unnecessary medical jargon. I am not a medical professional, and I require explanations in… layman’s terms. This ordeal has been most… trying. Now. Where is Doctor Billman?
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia. I apologize for the wait. Maria informed me you had a… demanding experience. Let's go over these results, shall we?
PATIENT: "Demanding"? That is… a rather understated assessment. And I trust you are prepared to discuss the results in a… comprehensive manner? I require clarity, not speculation. And do refrain from any… unnecessary medical jargon. I am not a medical professional, and I require explanations in… layman’s terms. Now. Proceed. And do be concise. I have a branding proposal awaiting my attention this afternoon, and I cannot afford to be delayed indefinitely by… clinical procedures. Now. What precisely did these… tests reveal?
DOCTOR: Alright. Your complete blood count came back normal—no sign of infection. Your metabolic panel is also within normal limits. However, your white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and we found some atypical lymphocytes, which means your immune system is reacting to something. We’ll need to do a monospot test to rule out mononucleosis, but it’s likely this is something else. We also need to run a more specific test to check for Epstein-Barr virus. It’s not a serious condition, but we need to determine the cause. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: “Atypical lymphocytes”? And “Epstein-Barr virus”? Those sound… most alarming. And what precisely does this “elevated white blood cell count” signify? Are you suggesting I am… ill? This is… quite distressing. And what precisely is “mononucleosis”? Is it… contagious? And what precisely is this “cause” you are attempting to determine? Are you suggesting there is something… seriously wrong with my constitution? And do refrain from any… medical jargon. I am not a medical professional, and I require explanations in… layman’s terms. Now. Explain precisely what this signifies. And do be concise. I have a branding proposal awaiting my attention this afternoon, and I cannot afford to be delayed indefinitely by… clinical procedures. Now. And do refrain from insinuating I am… ill. This is most… trying.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia. Let me explain. An elevated white blood cell count simply means your body is fighting something off. It could be a minor infection, like a cold, or it could be something else. Atypical lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that appear when your immune system is reacting to an infection. Mononucleosis is a viral infection—often called “mono”—that causes fatigue, fever, and sore throat. It is contagious, but it's usually spread through saliva—kissing, sharing drinks, things like that. We're not saying anything is seriously wrong. We just need to figure out what is causing your immune system to react. The Epstein-Barr virus is one possibility, and that’s what the test will determine. It’s very common, and most people have been exposed to it at some point in their lives. It usually doesn’t cause any serious problems. Does that make any more sense?
PATIENT: “A minor infection”? And “kissing”? I assure you, my social life is… carefully curated. And the implication that I might have contracted an infection through… casual contact is most… distressing. And “carefully curated”? Is that implying something, Doctor? And what precisely does this "Epstein-Barr virus" entail? Is it… painful? And what precisely are the implications if I have been exposed to it? Are you suggesting I might be… contagious? This is… quite alarming. And do refrain from insinuating anything about my… personal life. This is most… trying. And do explain precisely what this "test" entails. Will it be… painful? And how long will it take? I have a branding proposal awaiting my attention this afternoon, and I cannot afford to be delayed indefinitely by… clinical procedures. Now. Explain. Concisely.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia. Let me be as clear as possible. The Epstein-Barr virus is a very common virus that most people are exposed to at some point in their lives. It usually causes a mild illness, or no symptoms at all. If you do have symptoms, they can include fatigue, fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes. The test is a simple blood draw—just a few vials of blood. It will not be painful—just a quick pinch. The results will take about a week to come back. And no, you are not necessarily contagious. If you do have the virus, the risk of spreading it is very low. But we need to confirm the diagnosis before we can say for sure. And no, I was not insinuating anything about your personal life. I was simply explaining the facts. Does that clarify things?
PATIENT: “A week”? A week? I have a branding proposal awaiting my attention this afternoon! I cannot afford to be delayed for an entire week while you determine whether I might or might not have contracted some… common virus! This is… unacceptable. And do refrain from referring to it as “some common virus”. It sounds… trivial. And what precisely are the implications if I do have this… Epstein-Barr virus? Will I be… incapacitated? Will I be unable to fulfill my… professional obligations? And what precisely are the implications if I do have to postpone my… branding proposal? This is… quite alarming. And do refrain from referring to it as “some common virus”. It is most… trying. Explain. Concisely. And do not refer to it as “some common virus”. Now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia. Look, if you have the Epstein-Barr virus, most people recover completely within a few weeks. The symptoms usually subside on their own, with rest and fluids. In rare cases, it can cause more serious complications, but that's very unlikely. You likely wouldn't be incapacitated. You might feel tired and weak for a few days, but you should be able to continue with your normal activities, as long as you rest when you need to. As for your branding proposal, you might want to consider rescheduling it for a week, just to be on the safe side. But it's unlikely you'd be unable to fulfill your obligations altogether. Does that answer your questions?
PATIENT: “Reschedule”? “Reschedule”? Are you suggesting I reschedule a critical branding proposal based on the possibility of a “minor illness”? This is… preposterous! My reputation is at stake! And do refrain from referring to it as a “minor illness”! It is most… trying. And what precisely are the implications if I do feel “tired and weak”? Will I be unable to concentrate? Will I be unable to articulate my… creative vision? And do explain precisely what constitutes “rest”? Will I be confined to my bed? This is… quite alarming. And do refrain from insinuating anything about my… professional abilities. Now. Explain. Concisely. And do not refer to it as a “minor illness”. Now. Tell me, Doctor, if I insist on proceeding with my branding proposal, what precisely are the risks? Now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia. Look. If you insist on proceeding with your branding proposal despite feeling tired and weak, the risks are minimal. You might feel less focused, less articulate, and more easily fatigued. Your creative vision might not be at its peak. You might also be slightly more susceptible to other illnesses. But it's unlikely you'd be unable to fulfill your obligations altogether. The biggest risk is simply that you might not be at your best. But I strongly advise against it. It's better to reschedule the proposal and ensure you're at your full capacity. It's a matter of professional courtesy, and frankly, your own well-being. Does that answer your question?
PATIENT: “Professional courtesy”? Are you suggesting my clients are incapable of understanding a minor indisposition? My reputation precedes me! They value my vision, not my… physical stamina! And frankly, I find the suggestion that my clients would be… offended by a slight fatigue to be… insulting! And do refrain from insinuating anything about my… professional abilities! My vision is paramount! And frankly, I find your entire assessment to be… trivializing! And do refrain from insinuating anything about my… professional capabilities! Now. Let me be clear. I will proceed with my branding proposal as scheduled. Are there any… medical interventions you recommend to mitigate the potential for… diminished focus? Now. Explain. Concisely. And do refrain from offering any… platitudes. Now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia. Look, if you’re determined to proceed with your branding proposal, there's not much I can recommend. A strong cup of coffee might help with the focus. Staying hydrated is also important. And make sure you get enough rest tonight—even if it means postponing some other commitments. But frankly, I advise against it. You're setting yourself up for potential disappointment. But if you insist, just try to pace yourself and take breaks when you need to. And if you start to feel unwell, please, stop and rest. Is there anything else I can do for you?
PATIENT: “Strong cup of coffee”? That is… hardly a medical intervention! And frankly, I find the suggestion that a caffeinated beverage constitutes… adequate preparation to be… insulting! And frankly, I find your entire assessment to be… trivializing! Now. Let me be clear. I will proceed with my branding proposal as scheduled. Are there any… pharmaceuticals you recommend to enhance my… cognitive function? Now. Explain. Concisely. And do refrain from offering any… platitudes. Now. And do refrain from insinuating anything about my… professional capabilities. Now. Explain. Concisely. And do clarify, Doctor, if I experience any… cognitive impairment during my presentation, will you provide a… written apology to my clients? Now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia. Look, I strongly advise against taking any pharmaceuticals to enhance your cognitive function. There are potential side effects, and frankly, they're not worth the risk. The best thing you can do is get enough rest, stay hydrated, and pace yourself. As for a written apology, that’s… not something I can provide. I'm a doctor, not an insurance adjuster. I can’t be responsible for the outcome of your presentation. I’ve given you my medical advice. It’s up to you to decide what to do with it. Is there anything else I can do for you?
PATIENT: “Insurance adjuster”? Are you suggesting my professional endeavors are… frivolous? My reputation precedes me! They value my vision, not your… medical opinions! And frankly, I find the implication that I require a… written apology to be… insulting! Now. Let me be clear. If I experience any… diminished focus during my presentation, will you at least provide a… referral to a… cognitive rehabilitation specialist? Now. Explain. Concisely. And do refrain from offering any… platitudes. Now. And do clarify, Doctor, if my clients express any… dissatisfaction with my presentation, will your clinic provide a… partial refund for your… inadequate assessment? Now. Explain. Concisely. And do clarify, Doctor, if I experience any… cognitive impairment during my presentation, will you provide a… written statement confirming my… pre-existing cognitive abilities? Now. Explain. Concisely.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia. Look, this is… unprecedented. I can provide a referral to a cognitive rehabilitation specialist, but that would be a long-term process. It’s not a quick fix. As for a partial refund or a written statement confirming your pre-existing cognitive abilities… that’s simply not something I can provide. It’s not within my professional scope. I’ve given you my medical advice, and I’ve answered your questions to the best of my ability. I can’t be responsible for the outcome of your presentation, or for satisfying your… requests. This consultation is over. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: “Unprecedented”? Are you suggesting I am… demanding? My reputation precedes me! They value my vision, not your… medical opinions! Now. Let me be clear. If my clients express any… dissatisfaction with my presentation, will your clinic provide a… complimentary branding consultation with a specialist of my choosing? Now. Explain. Concisely. And do refrain from offering any… platitudes. Now. And do clarify, Doctor, if I experience any… cognitive impairment during my presentation, will you provide a… full refund for this… inadequate consultation? Now. Explain. Concisely. And do clarify, Doctor, if I experience any… diminished focus during my presentation, will you personally… apologize to my clients? Now. Explain. Concisely. And do clarify, Doctor, if I experience any… dissatisfaction with my presentation, will your clinic provide a… complimentary branding consultation with a specialist of my choosing, and a full refund for this… inadequate consultation? Now. Explain. Concisely. And do clarify, Doctor, if my clients express any… dissatisfaction with my presentation, will your clinic provide a… complimentary branding consultation with a specialist of my choosing, and a full refund for this… inadequate consultation, and a personal apology from you? Now. Explain. Concisely.
DOCTOR: This consultation is over. I've answered your questions, to the best of my ability. Further requests are… unreasonable. I wish you the best of luck with your presentation.
