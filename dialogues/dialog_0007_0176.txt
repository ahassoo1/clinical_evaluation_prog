DOCTOR: Hi Ivette, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Valerie Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just…won’t. Stop. It’s been almost two days now, and it's really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for almost two days. That is pretty persistent. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Sure. They started…let me think…Tuesday afternoon, I believe. I was having lunch with a friend, and I just…hic…started. At first, it wasn't a big deal, you know? A few hiccups, we laughed it off. But they just kept coming and coming. hic It doesn’t matter what I do, they just won't go away. I’ve tried holding my breath, drinking water quickly…nothing works.
DOCTOR: Alright. So they started Tuesday afternoon while you were eating, and haven't responded to any home remedies. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. hic I was drinking a sparkling water with my lunch, maybe that had something to do with it? But I've had sparkling water before and never had this happen. hic And I was a little stressed yesterday, dealing with some…paperwork, but honestly, I’m always a little stressed about paperwork. hic So, I don't know if that’s it either. It just feels random.
DOCTOR: Okay, random hiccups that started with lunch, possibly linked to sparkling water, but not definitively. And a bit of stress yesterday. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. hic Just the hiccups. I haven’t felt sick, no fever or anything. No pain, not even a tummy ache. hic I'm just tired, to be honest. It’s exhausting having to hiccup constantly! hic I haven't been able to sleep properly. It wakes me up every time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms – no fever, no pain, just fatigue from the hiccups disrupting your sleep. Let's get a quick look at your medical history. Do you mind if I pull up your chart on the computer here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That’s fine. I haven't been to a doctor in a while, though, so it probably won’t be very detailed. I think I gave them my basic information when I made the appointment. hic And I am divorced, if that’s relevant. It’s not a medical thing, but…sometimes things get mixed up. hic
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you're 50 years old, 5’0”, and weigh around 153 pounds. No listed allergies or current medications. And I appreciate you mentioning the divorce – sometimes life stressors can contribute to these things, even if indirectly. Now, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, um…let me think. hic Nothing major, really. I had my tonsils out when I was a child. And I had a bad bout of the flu a few years ago, but everyone gets the flu, right? hic I've always been pretty healthy. I try to eat well, mostly. hic I haven’t been to the hospital for anything serious in…well, I don't even remember. I avoid doctors if I can, to be honest. hic It’s usually just a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, a bout of the flu a few years ago, otherwise generally healthy. I understand your hesitation with doctors. Let’s talk about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a tough one. hic My mother had…high blood pressure, I think. hic And my father had some problems with his…heart, later in life. But they both lived to be quite old, so it wasn’t anything too serious. hic My brother is healthy as a horse, always has been. hic Honestly, we don’t really talk about health things much. It’s considered a bit…rude, in my family. hic We focus on happier things.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother, heart problems in your father, brother is healthy. And a family preference for avoiding health discussions. Finally, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. hic And I used to drink a little wine with dinner, but I stopped a few years ago. hic It wasn’t agreeing with me, and frankly, I just didn’t enjoy it as much anymore. hic I prefer tea. Lots and lots of tea. Mostly herbal teas, chamomile and things like that. hic Helps me relax…though it’s not helping with the hiccups, obviously. hic
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, stopped drinking wine a few years ago, and you drink a lot of herbal tea. Alright, well, that gives me a good overview. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your throat. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. hic Go ahead. I’m not sure what you’re going to find, but I’m happy to cooperate. hic I just want these hiccups to stop! hic It’s driving me mad.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything sounds clear. Heart and lungs are normal, and your throat looks fine. No obvious signs of infection or irritation. I'm not detecting anything physically that would explain the hiccups. Given the duration, and the lack of any other symptoms, it sounds like we’re dealing with a case of persistent, idiopathic hiccups. Which basically means hiccups with no clear cause.
PATIENT: Idiopathic? hic What does that even mean? hic No clear cause? hic So…you don’t know why I have them? hic I feel like I’m going crazy! hic Is there anything you can do to make them stop? hic Please? hic
DOCTOR: It means we haven’t found a specific reason yet. It's not uncommon, honestly. Sometimes hiccups just happen, and they can be stubborn. It doesn’t mean anything is seriously wrong, most of the time. There are a few things we can try. I can prescribe a medication called baclofen, which is sometimes used to help calm the nerves that trigger hiccups. It’s not a guaranteed fix, but it can be effective for some people. We can also try some maneuvers to reset your diaphragm, like holding your breath for a longer period, or drinking a glass of water slowly through a straw. I’ll show you those now, and if they don't help, we can discuss the baclofen. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay…that sounds…better, at least. hic Medication…I’m not a big fan of taking pills, but I’m desperate. hic And I’m happy to try anything at this point. hic Show me the…maneuvers. hic What does the diaphragm even do? hic I feel so silly asking all these questions. hic But really, what is the diaphragm?
DOCTOR: No silly questions at all! It's perfectly reasonable to want to understand what's going on. Your diaphragm is a large muscle under your lungs that helps you breathe. It contracts and relaxes to pull air in and push it out. Hiccups happen when that muscle spasms involuntarily. Okay, let’s try a few things. First, try taking a deep breath and holding it for as long as you comfortably can—about 10-15 seconds—and then exhale slowly. Repeat that a few times. Then, we can try drinking a glass of water slowly, taking small sips, without stopping to breathe. It’s a bit of a distraction technique as well. Let's start with the deep breathing. Try that now, and let me know if you feel any difference.
PATIENT: Okay…deep breath… hic …That didn’t do anything. hic Still hiccuping. hic It feels like they're getting worse, actually. hic Maybe it’s just my imagination. hic This is so frustrating! hic I’m starting to get a headache. hic Can we just skip to the medication? hic Please? hic
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. And it sounds like the maneuvers aren't helping. Let’s go ahead and discuss the baclofen. It's a muscle relaxant, and it can sometimes help calm the diaphragm. It’s a relatively low dose, and the side effects are usually mild—mostly drowsiness. However, it’s important to be aware that it’s not a miracle cure, and it doesn’t work for everyone. We can start with a low dose and see how you respond. Given that you're uninsured, I can write you a prescription for the generic version, which is less expensive. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. hic Anything is better than this. hic The generic is fine. hic I can’t afford anything expensive. hic Will it interact with…anything? hic I don’t really take any other medications, but I have a cup of chamomile tea every night. hic Does chamomile interact with muscle relaxants? hic I really need to know, because I need that tea to sleep! hic
DOCTOR: Okay, good question. Chamomile tea generally doesn’t have any significant interactions with baclofen, but it can have a mild sedative effect, so combining the two might make you a little more drowsy. Just be careful if you’re driving or operating machinery. Otherwise, it should be fine. Okay, I’m writing you a prescription for baclofen 10mg, three times a day. Take it with meals, and see how you feel. If it doesn’t help after a few days, or if you experience any side effects, call my office. And remember, if you develop any other symptoms—like chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe abdominal pain—seek immediate medical attention. Here’s the prescription. I'm also going to print out a sheet with some information about hiccups, just in case you want to read more about them. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. hic Thank you, Doctor. hic I really appreciate your help. hic Hopefully, this medication will finally make them stop. hic It’s been a terrible two days. hic I'm exhausted. hic I guess I’ll go home and try to sleep. hic And drink some chamomile tea. hic Thank you again. hic
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I hope it does help, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Get some rest, and try to relax. And yes, enjoy that chamomile tea! Take care.
