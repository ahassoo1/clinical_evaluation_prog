DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh… it is my… sinuses, I think. They feel… not good. It’s been… a little while, maybe? I forget exactly when it started. It’s just… pressure, mostly.
DOCTOR: "A little while"... alright. And when you say "not good," can you describe that pressure a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm… it is like… a heavy feeling. Behind my eyes, and… in my cheeks. It does not hurt bad, but it is always there. Like… when the weather changes, you know? Sometimes it is worse. I… I work outside, so maybe it is the weather?
DOCTOR: You work outside, yes. And does anything else happen when your sinuses are bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Sometimes my nose… it feels stuffy. And… I have to blow it a lot. Not… blood, just… stuff. And sometimes… I feel very tired. But I work long hours, so maybe that is just from work? I… I am not sure. It is hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any fever, cough, or sore throat with this?
PATIENT: Fever… I don’t think so. I have not… checked. Cough… no, not really. Maybe a little, sometimes, but I think that is just from the dust at work. And my throat… no, it does not hurt. It just feels… dry, maybe? But I drink a lot of water. I am not sure if that helps, though. It is… everything feels mixed up, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. And have you tried anything to relieve this pressure – any over-the-counter medications, like decongestants or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Oh… I think… my husband, he gave me something once. A pill? It did not… do much, I don’t think. I forget what it was called. I do not like to take many pills, if I can help it. I just… try to rest when I can. It is hard when you work, you know? I just want to feel… normal. Is that okay to say?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, perfectly okay. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this for some time. Let's do a quick examination, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Could you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want this feeling to go away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your ears look clear. Throat is a little dry, as you mentioned. Palpating your sinuses… there's some tenderness here and here. Your nasal passages seem a bit congested, but no significant discharge that I can see. Let me listen to your lungs quickly. Lungs are clear. Hmm. It sounds like a sinus issue, but the lack of fever and significant discharge is a little unusual.
PATIENT: Unusual? Is that… bad, Doctor? I worry sometimes… I have to work, you know? I cannot afford to be sick. My husband… he works hard too, but… we need the money. Is it something serious? I am sorry… I am asking too many questions, I think.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, but it is… persistent. And the fact that over-the-counter medications haven't helped is concerning. It could be a simple sinus infection, but given your work environment and the length of time you’ve been experiencing these symptoms, we should rule out other possibilities. Do you have any allergies, Mikeisha?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Oh… I don't think so. I have never been told I have allergies. But I work with a lot of dust and… things. Sometimes my eyes itch, but I thought that was just the dust. My husband… he sneezes a lot in the spring, but I do not. I don’t know… It’s hard to remember what is normal and what is not, with everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms and the lack of improvement, I'm going to order a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection. And I'd also like you to get a CT scan of your sinuses to get a better look at what's going on in there. It’ll help us determine if it's a simple sinus infection or something else. Do you have any insurance?
PATIENT: Insurance…? No, Doctor. We… we do not have insurance. It is… very expensive. I worry about the cost… Can we not just… try something else? A different pill, maybe? My husband… he will worry very much about the money. I do not want to cause more stress.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, without a clearer picture, I can’t responsibly prescribe anything else. We need to know what we’re dealing with. The CT scan is the best way to do that. As for the cost… the clinic does have a financial assistance program. Let me have the billing department contact you to discuss that. In the meantime, I recommend saline nasal sprays to help relieve the congestion and drinking plenty of fluids. But without knowing the cause, we're just treating symptoms. I'm going to write you a referral for the CT scan, and we’ll proceed from there. It’s important, Mikeisha. We need to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: … I understand, Doctor. Financial assistance… that would be good. Very good. Thank you. I… I just want to feel better. My husband… he will be relieved to hear we are trying. I hope it is not too expensive. Thank you. I will… call the billing department.
