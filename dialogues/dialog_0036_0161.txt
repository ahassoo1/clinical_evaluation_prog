DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I look into something… about preventing HIV. She called it PrEP, I think. I don’t really know much about it, but I figured it couldn't hurt to ask. I want to be careful, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible thing to do, Helaina. It’s excellent that you’re being proactive about your health. PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis – is a great option for HIV prevention, and I’m happy to discuss it with you. First, let’s talk a bit about your risk factors. To help me understand if PrEP is right for you, could you tell me a little about your sexual activity?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Well… this is a little awkward. I haven’t been with anyone regularly for a long time, but I do have… occasional partners. Just a few, and it’s not like every month or anything. And I always use protection… or, try to. Honestly, that’s why I'm here. Sometimes things don't go as planned, and I'm getting older and… well, you worry more, I guess. I’ve never been tested for anything, not recently anyway. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Helaina. It's very common to have those concerns, and it's good you're addressing them now. It's also helpful to know you haven't been regularly tested. To clarify, when you say "protection," what methods are you typically using?
PATIENT: Usually condoms, if I’m being honest. Sometimes… other things, but condoms are the main thing. And I really do try to make sure they’re not expired or damaged. It’s just… sometimes it’s a last-minute thing, you know? Not a lot of planning involved. That’s probably a bad thing. I just… it’s hard to talk about. But I’m trying to be open with you.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your openness, Helaina. It takes courage to discuss these things, and you're doing great. Okay, so condoms are the primary method, but not always used consistently. Before we discuss PrEP further, let's briefly review your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney problems, or liver disease?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I had a bad flu a few years back, and my cholesterol is a little high, the doctor told me at a checkup, but nothing serious. No kidney problems, no liver issues… just the usual aches and pains for someone my age. I have Medicare, so they usually catch anything major if there is something. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly since my mother passed away, though. It just… hasn’t been a priority, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand, Helaina. Losing your mother must have been very difficult. It’s common for things to fall by the wayside during times of grief. And good to know about the cholesterol - we'll want to check levels if we move forward with PrEP. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I broke my wrist when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that was it. No major surgeries, no long hospital stays. I'm pretty healthy, all things considered. I eat okay, I try to walk every day… you know, normal stuff. I'm just worried about… catching something, and PrEP sounded like a good way to prevent that. It’s just… I don’t even know what it is exactly. What does it involve?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Helaina. It’s good to be informed before making any decisions. PrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. It involves taking a daily pill – or sometimes an injection – to prevent HIV infection. The medication prevents the virus from establishing itself in your body if you're exposed. It’s highly effective – over 99% when taken consistently – but it does require regular doctor visits to monitor your kidney function and check for any side effects. We’d also need to do a baseline HIV test to ensure you’re not already infected. And we'll need to test you for other sexually transmitted infections as well, before starting. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. A daily pill… regular checkups… tests… Okay. It sounds like a bit of a commitment, but if it really works, I guess it’s worth it. I’m just… worried about side effects. I don't need another thing to worry about, you know? And the kidney stuff… is that serious? I’ve always been good about drinking water, but still. What kind of side effects are we talking about?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Helaina. It’s wise to be cautious and weigh the risks and benefits. The most common side effects are generally mild. Some people experience nausea, diarrhea, headache, or fatigue, especially when first starting the medication. These usually resolve within a few weeks as your body adjusts. Less commonly, there can be some minor changes in kidney function, which is why we monitor it regularly. The kidney changes are usually reversible if caught early, which is why those checkups are so important. We'd also check your liver function. It's important to note that PrEP doesn’t protect against other sexually transmitted infections, so practicing safe sex – using condoms consistently – is still crucial. To get a better idea of your overall health and whether PrEP is a good fit for you, I’d like to do a brief physical exam and order some blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A physical exam and blood tests… okay. I suppose that’s the only way to know for sure. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… I’d like to get this sorted out. I’m tired of worrying. What exactly does the physical exam involve? Just the usual, I guess? Listening to my heart and lungs? Is it going to be… uncomfortable? I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, so I’m a little nervous.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Helaina. It’s completely normal to feel a little nervous when you haven’t been to the doctor in a while. The physical exam will be fairly routine. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your throat and skin. I'll also palpate your abdomen, feeling for any abnormalities. I may listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. I will also want to check your reflexes. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all – just a quick assessment of your overall health. I'll need to take your weight and height as well. If you’re comfortable, we can start with that. And please, feel free to stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable or have any questions. We can take things at your own pace.
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. Let’s just get it over with. I’m not a fan of doctors, to be honest, but I’m willing to do whatever it takes to feel safe. Is there anything I need to do before you start? Take off my shoes? Take off my jacket? Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Helaina. Many people feel that way. No need to apologize. You can go ahead and remove your jacket and shoes, and then have a seat on the examination table. We'll start with your weight and height. Then we’ll do the other parts of the exam. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of before we begin?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to take penicillin as a kid, but that was ages ago. No food allergies, no skin allergies… nothing. I’m pretty good, all things considered. Just a bit anxious about all this, I suppose. Is this going to take long? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Helaina. No known allergies is helpful. And no, it shouldn’t take long – perhaps 15-20 minutes for the physical exam itself. I’ll need to review the blood test results afterward, which could take a few days. If you could step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: There. Done. Is that all? Honestly, I'm not a fan of scales. They always make me feel worse. My mother used to… well, never mind. Just tell me what the results are, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, 185 pounds. And you mentioned your height is 192 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Six foot, almost. I used to be taller, I think. But I've been slouching more lately. It's probably just old age. Is my weight… bad? Don't tell me if it is, I don’t want to hear it.
DOCTOR: It’s not about “good” or “bad”, Helaina. It’s about what’s healthy for you. Your weight is within a normal range for your height, at a BMI of 24.5. Take a deep breath for me, please… and again… Your lungs sound clear. Heart rate is regular. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness. Just… a little bit of gas, maybe. I had a big lunch. I shouldn’t have had that extra piece of baklava, I suppose. But it was delicious. Is that all you need to do? Can we get the blood tests done now? I just want to get this over with. Honestly, the waiting is the worst part. Is it going to hurt? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Baklava is hard to resist, I understand! No, we're almost finished with the physical exam. Just checking your reflexes now. Good reflexes. And yes, we’ll get the blood tests done now. It will be a few small vials of blood. There will be a brief pinch, but it shouldn't hurt much. The phlebotomist is very skilled. We'll have you sit down in a comfortable chair. Do you have a preferred arm for the blood draw?
PATIENT: My left arm, I think. It’s usually less sensitive. And please, go easy on me. I really, really hate needles. I used to faint when I got shots as a kid. It's embarrassing, I know. But it's true. Just… try to be quick, okay? And tell me when you're about to poke me. I need to brace myself. I don't want to make a scene. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Like, should I drink more water or something?
DOCTOR: Of course, Helaina. We'll take it slow and easy. I'll let you know exactly what I'm doing every step of the way. And I’ll alert the phlebotomist about your aversion to needles so she can be extra careful. Drinking more water is always a good idea, and you've likely already done so, but it helps with vein access. No need to worry about making a scene, we've seen it all. If you’ll just sit here, the phlebotomist, Maria, will be right with you. She’ll clean the area and then draw a few vials of blood. It will be over before you know it. I’ll be just outside if you need anything at all. And remember to breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. Just… hurry up, please. I hate this. I really, really hate this. I’m going to close my eyes. Don't say anything unless absolutely necessary. And tell me when it's over. Please. Just... get it over with.
DOCTOR: Maria is very gentle and experienced, Helaina. Just focus on your breathing. I'll be right outside.
