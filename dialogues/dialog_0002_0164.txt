DOCTOR: Hi Mande, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really weak and tired lately, and my skin and eyes have gotten kind of yellow. It started after I ate some fava beans, which I usually love, but now… not so much. I thought maybe it was something I ate, but it just keeps happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is a bit unusual. Weakness, tiredness, and yellowing of the skin and eyes… that yellowing is called jaundice, by the way. And it started after eating fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Jaundice… okay, good to know the name for it. And yes, every time I eat fava beans. It doesn't happen right away, maybe a day or two later. It’s… worrying, because I’ve never had this happen before. I eat them pretty regularly, or used to, before this started.
DOCTOR: Alright. That timing is definitely something we need to explore. It sounds like there might be a connection with the fava beans. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness, tiredness, and jaundice?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been a little short of breath sometimes, especially when I climb the stairs. And my urine… it’s darker than usual, almost a brownish color. I also feel a bit of pain in my belly, but it’s not very strong, just a dull ache. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense. Dark urine and shortness of breath are important things to note, along with the belly pain. And the dull ache… where exactly in your belly are you feeling that pain?
PATIENT: It’s mostly on the right side, kind of under my ribs, but it’s hard to pinpoint exactly. It's not a sharp pain, more like… a heavy feeling. And it doesn't come and go very often, it’s just… there, most of the time, when I think about it. I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing perfectly fine, Mande. It's helpful to know it’s a dull ache on the right side under your ribs. Okay, let's go through some more questions. Have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no fever at all. And I haven’t been sick to my stomach, no nausea or vomiting. Just the tiredness, the yellow skin, the dark urine and that ache in my belly, and feeling breathless easily. It’s just… a lot all at once. It’s making me a little nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, it is a lot to be experiencing. Alright, let’s talk about your medical history a little bit. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. I’ve been pretty healthy my whole life, to be honest. I’ve had the usual colds and flus, but nothing serious. I don’t take any regular medication, either. Just over-the-counter pain relievers when I need them, for a headache or something. I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Appendix removal when you were a teenager, and otherwise healthy. Any surgeries besides that?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the appendix. And I haven’t been in the hospital for anything other than that. I've always been careful to eat well and exercise, so I was surprised when all of this started. It really came out of nowhere.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had some problems with her gallbladder when she was older, and my grandfather… he was often tired and weak, but the doctors never really figured out what was wrong with him. No one else that I know of had anything similar to what I'm experiencing now.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder issues in your mother and fatigue in your grandfather. That’s helpful to know. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. No reactions to any foods or medications, as far as I'm aware. I haven’t changed anything in my diet recently, other than trying to avoid fava beans, of course! I’m starting to feel a little silly even talking about them so much. They’re usually such a nice treat.
DOCTOR: No, you're not silly at all. It’s important to investigate everything, and fava beans are definitely a lead we need to follow up on. Alright, last few questions for now. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I’ve never smoked. I don’t like the smell of it, and it never appealed to me. And I don’t drink alcohol very often, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I try to stay healthy, as I said before. This whole thing is just… frustrating. I want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol. Alright, Mande, based on what you've told me—the jaundice, fatigue, dark urine, belly pain, and the connection with the fava beans—I'm concerned about a possible condition called Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency. It's a genetic condition where people can have a reaction to certain foods or medications, and fava beans are a common trigger. We need to do some blood tests to confirm this, and we’ll also check your liver function, just to be on the safe side. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That… sounds a little scary. I’ve never heard of that before. A genetic condition… so it’s something I was born with? But blood tests are fine, yes. If that’s what we need to do to figure out what’s going on, then let’s do it. What kind of blood tests are we talking about? And will it take long to get the results? I’m a bit worried about what it all means.
DOCTOR: It can sound scary, I understand, but it's good that we're looking into it. A lot of people live perfectly normal lives with G6PD deficiency, they just need to avoid certain triggers. We’ll do a complete blood count , a metabolic panel to check your liver and kidney function, and a specific test to measure your G6PD enzyme levels. We'll also check your bilirubin levels – that will give us more information about the jaundice. The lab is very efficient; results usually come back within 24-48 hours. While we’re waiting, I want to be cautious. I'm going to order a urinalysis as well. I'm also going to have my nurse take your blood pressure and pulse, and do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds good. Blood pressure, pulse, physical exam… absolutely. Anything that helps. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours… that feels like a long time to wait, but I understand. It's good to know what's going on, even if it's not what I want to hear. Will I need to change anything about my diet before the tests? Besides avoiding fava beans, of course. Should I avoid any other foods? Or medications? I take ibuprofen sometimes, for headaches.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. While we wait for the results, I would recommend avoiding ibuprofen and any other NSAIDs – those can sometimes trigger a reaction in people with G6PD deficiency. Stick to acetaminophen for pain relief if you need it. And as for diet, no specific changes other than avoiding fava beans for now. We'll get more specific recommendations once we have the results. Alright, let's get started with the physical exam. If you don’t mind, could you lie back on the exam table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. No problem. Acetaminophen… okay, I can do that. It's good to know. I’m just… hoping it’s not too serious. I feel a little better knowing you're looking into it though. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. We'll figure this out together. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and look at your skin and eyes a little more closely. Take some deep breaths for me, please… in and out. Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear… any shortness of breath when you lie flat?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little bit more aware of my breathing, but not really short of breath when I lie flat. It's mostly when I'm doing something active, like climbing the stairs, or walking uphill.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. I'm just gently pressing on your abdomen now. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little bit there, on the right side, under my ribs. Not a sharp pain, but definitely a little tender. It's been like that for a few days now, just a dull ache that’s a bit more sensitive when you press on it. It doesn’t really go away completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. It's definitely tender in the right upper quadrant. And your liver feels slightly enlarged. Now I'm just going to look at your skin and eyes a little more closely. I notice some mild jaundice in your sclera – the whites of your eyes – and your skin has a slightly yellow tinge to it. No rashes or other abnormalities. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Overall, things are stable, but we need to get those blood tests back to understand what's going on. Alright, Mande. I’ve documented my findings. Now we'll wait for those lab results. In the meantime, avoid ibuprofen and any other NSAIDs, stay hydrated, and call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms – like severe abdominal pain, fever, or significant fatigue. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Avoid ibuprofen, stay hydrated, and call if things get worse. Thank you, Doctor Ranjan. I feel a little bit better knowing we’re doing something, and that you’ve checked everything. Waiting is always the hardest part, but… I’ll try to be patient. Will the lab call me with the results, or should I call the office? How long should I expect to wait? And… is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. It's good you're taking an active role. The lab will send the results directly to me. My nurse will be in touch with you within 24-48 hours with the results and any further instructions. I wouldn’t worry about calling unless it's to report worsening symptoms. As for anything else… try to get plenty of rest, and eat a light, healthy diet. There’s no need to restrict anything specific other than the NSAIDs for now. And really, just listen to your body. If you feel tired, rest. I’m also going to write you a note explaining that you've been evaluated for possible G6PD deficiency and are awaiting results, just in case you need to see another doctor in the meantime. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. You’ve explained everything so clearly, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and attention. I really appreciate it. I’ll just… wait for my nurse to call. And try to relax. It’s easier said than done, but… I’ll try.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. I understand it’s not easy waiting, but you’ve been very cooperative and I’m confident we'll figure this out. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns at all. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
