DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Panjoj. The pleasure is all mine. I requested a general wellness check, a lab panel, if you will. Just wanting to see how things are holding up, you know? At my age, it’s good to be proactive. Nothing specific troubling me, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise of you, Mr. Mombrun. Proactive care is excellent. A general wellness check and lab panel – certainly. We can do that. To get started, let's go through some of your history. First, can you tell me about any past medical problems you've had?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let me see… well, nothing terribly serious, thankfully. When I was a young man, back in Venezuela, I had a rather nasty bout of malaria, but that was… oh, goodness, nearly fifty years ago now. I recovered fully, of course. Apart from that, just the usual aches and pains that come with a life of… physical labor, shall we say? I’ve been a construction worker all my life. Nothing that ever kept me from working, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, malaria as a young man, fully recovered – that’s good to know. And you've been a construction worker—that certainly explains the usual aches and pains! Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the malaria?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. Never been hospitalized aside from that bout of malaria when I was younger. And no surgeries either, thankfully. I’ve always been quite lucky, I suppose. A few broken bones over the years – a wrist here, an ankle there – but those were all taken care of with casts and time. Nothing that required a proper operation.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Mombrun. No surgeries or hospitalizations besides the malaria—that simplifies things nicely. Now, could you tell me a little about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Ah, family history… that’s a bit of a complicated one, Doctor. My mother lived a long life, into her eighties, but she suffered with… well, what you call high blood pressure, I believe. And my father, he passed away relatively young from a heart ailment, I was told. Not a heart attack precisely, more… a weakening, they said. As for siblings, I have a younger sister, she's still living in Venezuela, as far as I know, and she seems to be in good health. I haven't seen her in quite some time, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mother with high blood pressure, father with a heart ailment, and a sister who appears healthy. That’s helpful to know. And what about your social history, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’ve been married to my wonderful wife, Elena, for forty-two years now. We moved here from Venezuela about twenty years ago, seeking a quieter life. I’ve always been a non-smoker, and I only drink socially—a glass of wine with dinner perhaps, on occasion. As for work, as I mentioned, I’m a construction laborer. Still enjoying it, though I am considering slowing down a bit, eventually.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Mombrun. Forty-two years with Elena is quite a milestone! And good to hear about no smoking and only social drinking. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything. I can take most medications without any trouble, as far as I know. Elena always double-checks, of course, but I’ve never had a problem. I'm fortunate that way, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, no known allergies. Okay, Mr. Mombrun, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I'd like to ask about any medications you’re currently taking, if any. Do you take any prescriptions or over-the-counter medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. I pride myself on not needing any medications, if I can avoid it. I do take a multivitamin every morning, just to keep things topped up, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, and no over-the-counter remedies regularly. I’ve always believed in a good diet and plenty of exercise.
DOCTOR: Very good. No medications, just a multivitamin. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do, just let me know. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I trust your judgment completely.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not alarming given your age and activity level. I’m hearing normal heart sounds, no murmurs or irregularities. Lungs are clear bilaterally. I'm going to palpate your abdomen now, feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Now, can you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There you go, tracking it perfectly. I can see quite well, thankfully. Elena always jokes that I have the eyes of a hawk.
DOCTOR: Very good, excellent tracking. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Strength appears to be 5/5 in all extremities. Overall, your neurological exam is unremarkable. Now, to complete the exam, I'll quickly listen to your joints. Please let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: No pain at all, Doctor. Just a little creaking, perhaps, but that’s to be expected after a lifetime of physical work, wouldn’t you say?
DOCTOR: You are right, a little creaking is perfectly normal with your history. Overall, your physical exam is largely unremarkable, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure. Now, to get a more comprehensive picture, I’d like to order a basic lab panel – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever tests you deem necessary, I’m happy to oblige. A thorough check is always best, in my opinion. I trust your professional judgment completely. When can we expect the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We should have the results back within 3 to 5 business days. The lab will send them directly to me, and I will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with your healthy lifestyle – good diet, regular exercise, and continuing to avoid smoking. And given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend monitoring it at home, if possible. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: Unfortunately, Doctor, no, I don’t have a blood pressure cuff at home. Elena and I haven’t really felt the need for one until now. But I can certainly purchase one. Is there a particular brand or type you would recommend?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. A home blood pressure cuff isn’t essential, but it would be helpful in this case. I recommend an automatic upper arm cuff. Omron and Withings are both reputable brands. They are widely available online or at most pharmacies. Try to take your blood pressure at the same time each day, preferably in the morning before you have breakfast or caffeine. Record your readings so you can share them with me at our next appointment. Do you have any other questions or concerns for me today, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and answered all my questions. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and address my concerns. I feel much more reassured now, knowing we’re taking a proactive approach. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. I’m glad I could reassure you. Remember, proactive care is key. We'll review your lab results in a few days and go from there. If anything changes before then, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a wonderful day.
