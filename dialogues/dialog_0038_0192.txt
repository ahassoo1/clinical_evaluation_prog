DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is the name. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, I’m here for this… exam. Military thing. Gotta get it done, you know? They want a check-up first. Don’t really see the point, but… rules are rules.
DOCTOR: Right, a military exam. I understand. No problem at all, we can certainly get that done for you. Just to clarify, is this for re-enlistment, or…?
PATIENT: Re-enlistment? No, no. First time. Always wanted to be in the… the mechanics, fixing things. Not fighting. Definitely not fighting. Just… engines and gears, that's me. Don’t have the stomach for… other stuff. Though my wife, Ingrid, thinks it's a silly idea at my age, honestly. She says I’m too old for all that running around. She’s probably right. But… here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, so first time enlistment, aiming for a mechanics role. And Ingrid has some concerns about the physical demands… That’s fair enough. Well, let’s get through this exam and see where we stand, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Just… don’t expect much. I haven’t… really done much exercise lately. Mostly just tightening bolts in the garage, if you get my meaning. Though I can still lift a fair bit. Used to, anyway. And my eyesight’s still good. I can still see all the little parts, which is important. Real important. You need good eyes for this line of work.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about your eyesight. And tightening bolts definitely counts as strength training! We’ll assess everything, don't worry. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Hmm. Not much to tell, really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. Stupid thing to do. Ingrid still reminds me of it, even now. And… I had the flu a couple of times, I suppose. Nothing serious. Oh! And my back gets a bit stiff sometimes, after a long day in the garage. But that’s just old age, I reckon. Nothing a bit of stretching can’t fix. Never been to a proper doctor before this, if you want to know the truth. Thought I was tough enough to deal with things myself. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child, occasional flu, and some back stiffness after physical activity. No other significant medical issues?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing else. No allergies, either. Ingrid tried to get me to take some sort of allergy test once, said I was always sneezing. But I told her I was just dust. Garage dust, you know? Gets everywhere. She’s a worrier, that one. Always has been. But she makes a good herring, so I tolerate it. Are we getting somewhere with this exam? I’ve got things to do, you know. Bolts to tighten.
DOCTOR: Yes, we're getting there, Mr. Hartness. And a good herring is definitely worth tolerating a bit of worry! Let’s just run through a few more questions to be thorough. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never taken a pill in my life, if you can believe it. Ingrid keeps trying to get me to take something for my… well, she says it’s “prevention.” Something for my heart. But I told her I was fine. And I am! Mostly. Though sometimes my chest feels a bit… tight. Just after lifting something heavy, usually. But it goes away. Always does. Honestly, I don’t trust those pills. Full of chemicals, probably. Give me a good wrench any day. More reliable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no medications currently, and you’ve noticed some chest tightness after exertion. Just to be sure, could you describe that tightness?
PATIENT: Describe it? Hmm. It’s like… a squeezing. Right here. Not a pain, exactly. More… uncomfortable. Like someone’s sitting on me, a bit. It usually goes away after a few minutes, if I stop what I’m doing. Like I said, it doesn’t happen often. Only when I really push myself. I’m a strong lad, you see. Maybe I just overdo it sometimes. Ingrid says I should slow down. She's probably right. Again. But tightening bolts is important work. Can't have loose bolts, can you?
DOCTOR: Okay, squeezing sensation in the chest after exertion. That's important information. And you're right, loose bolts are a serious matter! To get a clearer picture, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Fine. Get it over with. Just… don't expect much flexibility. Like I said, I haven’t been doing much exercise. And try not to poke me too hard. Old bones, you know? Let’s just get this done, shall we? Ingrid’s probably wondering where I am. And those bolts aren’t going to tighten themselves.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out.
PATIENT: There. Done. Feels a bit strange, having someone listen to your insides. Always thought I was pretty private about that sort of thing. Is everything alright? Sounds like a bit of a racket in there, doesn't it? Probably just old age. Used to be able to hold my breath for ages, when I was a kid. Not anymore, though. Lungs aren't what they used to be, I reckon.
DOCTOR: I do hear some wheezing, Mr. Hartness. It’s not necessarily cause for alarm, but it's something we need to investigate further. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Blood pressure, eh? Always thought those things were a bit of a bother. Feels a bit tight on the arm. Not as strong as they used to be, these muscles. Used to be able to lift… well, never mind. Never mind. Just get it over with. What are you looking for, anyway? Is my blood pressure bad? Ingrid keeps telling me I need to watch my salt intake. She's probably right. Again. This is a bit of a bother, isn’t it? All this poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, Mr. Hartness, and your pulse is a bit fast. We'll talk about that in a moment. Now, could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Lie down? Now? What are you planning to do? Is this going to involve… poking? I really don't like poking. And I haven’t got all day, you know. Ingrid will be wondering where I am. And those bolts… What exactly are you looking for when I lie down? Just tell me straight. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: No surprises, I promise. I just want to listen to your heart and lungs again while you're lying flat, and do a quick examination of your abdomen. It’s a standard part of a physical exam. It will just take a few minutes, and it will help me get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’m not going to do anything that will hurt you, I assure you. And I’ll explain everything as I go. How about we start with listening to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Fine. But be gentle, alright? And tell me what you’re listening for. I don't like feeling helpless, lying here like a… a fish. And try not to take too long. Those bolts… Just get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, just breathe normally, Mr. Hartness. I’m listening for any unusual sounds – crackles, wheezes, or murmurs. It sounds like you do have some slight wheezing in your lungs, as we heard before. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Does this cause any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Ouch! A bit tender there, on the left side. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Feels a bit… bloated, sometimes. Ingrid says it’s probably gas. She’s probably right. Again. Just try not to poke too hard, alright? And hurry up. I’m starting to feel a bit… exposed. Never been much for lying around like this. Too many things to do. Bolts to tighten, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I've noted the tenderness on the left side. It could be a number of things – indigestion, gas, or something else. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength. Could you please extend your arms in front of you?
PATIENT: There. Done. Not as strong as they used to be, these arms. Used to be able to lift… well, never mind. What are you looking for? Is something wrong? And try not to make me do anything too strenuous. I’m not as young as I used to be, you know. And I've got things to do. Bolts to tighten.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, and your grip strength is somewhat weaker than expected for someone your age. Now, let’s have you sit up slowly. I want to discuss some potential causes for your symptoms and order some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? More poking? I really don't like tests. I’d rather just… fix things myself. Honestly, I think I'm fine. Just a bit out of shape. A bit of exercise, that’s all I need. And maybe a bit less worrying from Ingrid. But tests… What kind of tests are we talking about? And will they take long? I’ve got those bolts, you know. Really important bolts. They need tightening. And Ingrid will be wondering where I am. Honestly, I don't like this at all. Is there any way we can just… skip the tests?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Hartness. I wouldn’t recommend tests if I didn’t think they were necessary. I’m concerned about your slightly elevated blood pressure, the wheezing in your lungs, and the diminished reflexes and grip strength. These things could indicate a more serious underlying issue. I'm recommending a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and a blood test to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. We'll also check your thyroid levels. The blood test will take about 15-20 minutes, and the X-ray will only take a few minutes. I can order them both here, and the results should be back in a few days. I wouldn’t want to dismiss your symptoms without investigating further. It’s better to be safe than sorry, and to get a clear diagnosis so we can develop a plan to get you feeling your best. Would you agree to those tests?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… and a blood test… Sounds… complicated. And expensive, probably. Ingrid will have my hide if I run up a big bill. Still… you seem pretty certain it’s important. And I suppose if something is wrong, it’s best to know about it. But… will it stop me from tightening those bolts? That’s the main thing. Those bolts are critical. Absolutely critical. Alright. Fine. Do the tests. But hurry up. And make sure it doesn’t interfere with my bolt-tightening schedule. And… try to be gentle. Especially with the blood test. I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do everything I can to make the process as quick and comfortable as possible. The lab is just down the hall, and the radiology department is on the second floor. I'll write you the orders now. Once you’ve had the tests done, you can come back here, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant weakness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here are the orders. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Chest pain… Shortness of breath… That sounds… serious. But I’m fine. I’ll be fine. I just need to get back to those bolts. Alright. No questions. I think. Just… make sure those results come back quickly. And… try not to worry Ingrid too much. She worries enough as it is. And… thanks. I guess.
