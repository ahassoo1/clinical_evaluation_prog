DOCTOR: Alright, Claudene, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor... Havird, is it? Yes, well, it's… my water. It bothers me. A lot. It keeps… happening. I don't quite recall all the details, but it's not good, you see. It's been going on for some time now. I just want it to stop happening, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. “Happening.” Okay. And when you say “happening,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Specific… That's difficult. It's… a burning feeling, mostly. And I have to go to the… the little room. Often. More than a person should, I think. It’s uncomfortable, and it worries me. I don’t remember when it started exactly, but I’ve had it a few times now. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: A burning feeling… and frequent trips to the restroom. Okay. So, it sounds like you're having some trouble with your bladder. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… Not that I recall. My life is rather… quiet, Doctor. I mostly fix RVs. Recreational Vehicles. I do that for a living. And… I got divorced, years ago. But that wasn’t recent. Everything else is… the same. I eat, I sleep, I work on the RVs… and this keeps happening. I don't understand why.
DOCTOR: RV repair... alright. And you haven't noticed any blood in your urine, fever, or pain in your back or sides, have you?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, no, no blood. Not that I've seen. And a fever… I don’t think so. I don’t usually bother with thermometers. As for pain… Sometimes my back aches, but that's just from bending over the RVs all day, I suppose. Old age, you know. It doesn’t feel… related to the water problem. I think. It’s hard to say, really. Everything feels a bit mixed up these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to clarify, when you say it's "happening," are you able to urinate when you need to, or is it difficult?
PATIENT: Oh, I can go, Doctor. Yes, it's not like I’m blocked up or anything. It just feels like I need to go all the time. Even when I’ve just gone! It's… inconvenient. And it keeps me up at night sometimes, if you know what I mean. It's a nuisance, mostly. A very annoying nuisance. But I worry it's something serious, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Frequent urination, no blood, able to urinate when you need to, and some back discomfort from work… We'll need to do a quick exam, just to rule things out. And I’ll want to order a urine test. It will help us see if there’s an infection or anything else going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A test? Oh, dear. Well… if you think it's necessary, Doctor. Yes, alright. A test sounds… reasonable. I just want this to stop. Whatever it is. I don't like being a bother, you understand. And I have a few RVs needing repairs. So, the quicker we figure this out, the better. Is it a painful test?
DOCTOR: No, it's not painful at all. It’s just a sample. We’ll give you a container, and you’ll just… collect a bit when you’re able. Nothing to worry about. Let’s start with the exam. If you don't mind, could you please follow me to the examination room?
PATIENT: An examination room… right. Oh, very well. Lead the way, Doctor. I hope it won’t take too long. I do have Mr. Henderson’s Fleetwood to look at this afternoon. He’s very particular about his plumbing, you see. I’m not usually one for doctors, if I’m honest. But if it will help with the… water problem, I suppose I can manage.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just change into this gown, and we'll get started. We'll just check your abdomen and do a quick neurological exam to see if there’s anything obvious going on. Try not to worry. It will be quick, I assure you.
PATIENT: A gown… Oh. Well. It’s not very… flattering, is it? But alright. If you say it's necessary. I suppose I can manage. This is all rather undignified, you know. I’m used to getting my hands dirty with engines, not… this. Hurry it up, if you don't mind. I'm a busy woman.
DOCTOR: Just lie back on the table when you're ready. I'll be right back with the stethoscope. It will just be a simple listen to your abdomen and a few basic reflexes. Try to relax. We'll figure this out.
PATIENT: Relaxing is easier said than done, Doctor. And I’d appreciate it if you didn’t rush me. I haven’t done this in… well, a very long time. Are you certain this is necessary? I just want the water problem to stop, that’s all. I don’t need a full… investigation. There. I’m ready now. If you’re quite finished poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie flat on your back, please. I'm going to listen to your abdomen first. Just breathe normally. Hmm. Sounds normal. No unusual bowel sounds. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Just let your legs hang loose. And the other side… Reflexes are a little diminished, but that could be age-related. Now, could you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Squeezing… Very well. I used to have quite a grip, you know. Working on RVs keeps you strong. But the arthritis is acting up lately. Are you finding anything? Is it something serious? I have a bad feeling about this. I just want to go back to fixing things. That's what I'm good at. This is all very… unsettling. Are we nearly finished?
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything seems relatively normal on the physical exam. Diminished reflexes, as I mentioned, but likely age-related. No tenderness in your abdomen. However, given your symptoms, and your history of frequent urination, we still need to rule out a urinary tract infection. The urine test will confirm that. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh dear. Let me think… I don’t recall any specific allergies. I've never been one for taking a lot of pills, you see. A bit of aspirin for a headache now and then, but that’s it. Nothing serious. I don't think I'm allergic to anything… but I wouldn’t swear to it. It’s been a long time since anyone asked me about allergies. My ex-husband was allergic to cats, if that counts. But that's not relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As I said, I don't take much. Maybe some ibuprofen if my back's really bothering me from the RVs, but that's it. I prefer to let things heal on their own, if possible. Pills just make me feel… sluggish. And I need my energy to fix those plumbing issues. Honestly, I think a good night's sleep is better medicine than anything they can prescribe. Are we finished with the questions now? I do have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications. Okay. Now, we'll send the urine sample to the lab. It should be back within a couple of days. In the meantime, I want you to increase your fluid intake – water is best – and try to avoid caffeine and alcohol. These can irritate your bladder. If you develop a fever, pain in your back or sides, or notice any blood in your urine, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Increase fluids… no caffeine… no alcohol… A fever… blood… Honestly, Doctor, that sounds like a lot to remember. I'm getting old, you know. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Water, yes. I can manage water. But no caffeine… I do enjoy a cup of tea in the afternoon. Will that be all? I'm afraid I'm not very good at following complicated instructions. I just want this water problem to go away. And I really must get back to Mr. Henderson’s Fleetwood. He's a very impatient man.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just focus on the water intake for now. And avoiding caffeine. If the symptoms don’t improve within a few days, or if they get worse, please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment. We'll repeat the urine test and discuss other options. I’ll have the nurse give you a sheet with these instructions written down. Just follow those, and hopefully, we’ll have an answer soon. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Just… get rid of the water problem, if you can. That's all I ask. And perhaps a strong cup of tea afterwards. If that's not too much trouble. A nurse will give me a paper, you say? Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I do hope this doesn't take too long. Mr. Henderson gets quite agitated when his plumbing isn't working properly.
