DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s this sleepiness, really. Even with the machine, I’m just… tired all the time during the day. It’s a bit of a nuisance, to be honest. I was hoping you could take a look at it.
DOCTOR: Alright, tiredness even with the machine… that is a nuisance, you’re right. And we definitely want to get to the bottom of that. Just to be clear, is this the machine for sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Yes, that's the one. Sleep apnea. They diagnosed it a few years back, and gave me this CPAP machine. I use it every night, like they told me to. At least, I try to. Sometimes it's a bit uncomfortable, but mostly I manage. But it doesn’t seem to be doing the trick, you know? I still feel like I’m dragging myself through the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've been using the CPAP for a few years now, mostly consistently, but it’s not fully resolving the tiredness. And you mentioned it can be uncomfortable sometimes. We'll need to explore that a little bit. Can you tell me more about when you feel the most tired?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It's not really a specific time, Doctor. More like… all day, but worse in the afternoon, I suppose. After lunch, especially. I could be sitting and reading, or even just chatting with someone, and suddenly I feel this… wave of sleepiness come over me. It’s not like I’m falling asleep right away, but I’m definitely not at my best. It makes it hard to concentrate, and I don’t enjoy things as much. I used to love gardening, but even that feels like a chore now sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, so the tiredness is pretty consistent throughout the day, but worse in the afternoons, especially after lunch. It's impacting your ability to concentrate and enjoy activities… gardening specifically, you mentioned. That's helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, sometimes I wake up with a bit of a headache. Not a terrible one, but enough to notice. And my wife… well, she says I snore, even with the machine on. She doesn’t complain too much, but I can tell it bothers her a little. I also feel… a bit foggy, you know? Like my brain isn’t quite working right. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like I’m confused or anything, just… slow.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches upon waking, continued snoring despite CPAP use, and a feeling of mental fogginess… that paints a clearer picture. Let's see… the EHR shows your CPAP prescription is a few years old. Have you had any recent follow-up appointments with the sleep specialist to check the settings or mask fit?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t, actually. They just gave me the machine and told me to use it. I think they said to come back if I had problems, but… well, I just figured I was just getting used to it. And then things didn’t really improve, so I kept trying, but never went back to see them. I suppose I should have, shouldn’t I? I just didn’t want to bother them, really. They seemed very busy.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Mr. Paske. Many people don't follow up as diligently as they should. It's good you're bringing it up now. It's very common for CPAP settings to need adjustment over time, or for the mask to need replacing to ensure a good fit. Before we consider a referral back to the sleep specialist, let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything else that might be contributing to your tiredness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A check-up is a good idea. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? I miss being able to enjoy a full day without feeling like I'm wading through mud. Let’s get started.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's do that. If you don’t mind, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and nasal passages. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Throat is clear, no obvious signs of infection. Nasal passages… some mild congestion, but nothing significant. Now, do you have any history of high blood pressure, or have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been diagnosed with high blood pressure. My wife always checks it, and it's usually around normal, or just a little bit high sometimes. And no diabetes either. My father had it, but I’ve always been careful with my diet and try to stay active, you know? I eat a lot of vegetables and fruit, and I used to walk a lot, before I got so tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no personal history of high blood pressure or diabetes, though a family history of diabetes. That’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any medications that you are currently taking?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. And I don't take any regular medications, apart from an occasional aspirin if I have a headache. That’s it, really. I try to avoid taking pills as much as possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself, you know? Though, I have to admit, this tiredness is making that rather difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Now, before we discuss a potential plan, let's review your sleep habits a bit more. On a typical night, how many hours of sleep do you get?
PATIENT: Well, that's a bit of a tricky question, Doctor. With the machine on, I manage about six, maybe seven hours, if I’m lucky. But it’s not always restful sleep. I wake up several times during the night, usually to adjust the mask, or because I’m feeling uncomfortable. And sometimes, I just can’t get to sleep in the first place. My mind races, and I end up tossing and turning for hours. It’s frustrating, to be honest. I used to be a sound sleeper, but those days seem long gone.
DOCTOR: Alright, six to seven hours of sleep with the CPAP, but frequently interrupted and not restful. Difficulty falling asleep as well. And you mentioned the mask can be uncomfortable. Given your symptoms – the persistent tiredness despite CPAP use, the continued snoring, the headaches, the mental fogginess, the interrupted sleep, and the discomfort with the mask – I think we need to investigate a few possibilities. I suspect the CPAP machine may not be optimally adjusted for you anymore. It's also possible that something else is contributing to your tiredness, such as a sleep disorder like restless legs syndrome, or even a thyroid problem. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and a vitamin D level. I also recommend a referral back to the sleep specialist for a repeat sleep study to reassess your CPAP settings and mask fit. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. Blood tests and another sleep study… I’m happy to do whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. I just want to feel better, you know? It’s been a long time since I’ve felt truly rested. Please, go ahead and order the tests and make the referral. I trust your judgment. And thank you for listening to me. It helps just to talk about it, honestly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad you feel that way. We'll get those tests ordered right away. I’ll also send a referral to Dr. Ramirez, the sleep specialist at St. Jude’s Hospital. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, try to maintain a regular sleep schedule as much as possible, and avoid caffeine and alcohol before bedtime. I'll also write you a prescription for a mild sleep aid, just to help you get through the nights until we get the results back. It’s not a long-term solution, but it might provide some temporary relief. Here's a list of instructions regarding the blood tests and sleep study, as well as the information about the prescription. We'll review the results together once they come in, and develop a plan based on what we find. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. I'll follow the instructions and schedule the sleep study as soon as possible. Thank you again for taking the time to listen to me and for your help. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Get some rest, and we'll talk soon. .
