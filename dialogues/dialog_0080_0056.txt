DOCTOR: Hi Erle, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, well. It’s… complicated. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this. I suppose… the library. It’s… stressful. Young people these days have no respect for order. No respect at all. I've been a teacher for… a very long time, and things aren't as they used to be. Is that sufficient? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like the stress from your work at the library is what's concerning you. Just to clarify – you're experiencing stress related to the changes and interactions at the library, and that's impacting you?
PATIENT: “Impacting me”? Is that what the young people say these days? Yes, it’s… bothersome. Very bothersome. It’s not simply “bothersome”, it’s… a decline. A societal decline! And frankly, my nerves are not what they used to be. I used to have a very… steady hand. Now? Not so much. Though I doubt that’s relevant. Are we getting somewhere? Because, truly, I have other commitments.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting somewhere. It’s good you’ve mentioned the change in your hand steadiness – that is relevant. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hand steadiness… well, it’s… difficult to explain. Things… wobble. When I’m cataloging, for example. Or writing notes to… the administration. It’s not constant, you understand. Just… when I’m trying to be precise. I used to be able to write beautifully, with a very fine script. Now… it’s… less so. And it’s… frustrating. Extremely frustrating. Is that what you needed to know? Because I really must say, this line of questioning feels rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Erle, and I apologize if I’m being intrusive. I’m just trying to get a clear picture of what’s going on so I can help. It's helpful to know it happens particularly when you're focusing on precise tasks. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I suppose. Though I rarely pay attention to such things. One doesn’t concern oneself with trivial matters when one has important work to do. It started… oh, perhaps six months ago? Maybe longer. It’s all a bit of a blur, truthfully. I have a very active mind, you see. Always thinking. Always organizing. It’s exhausting, really. Are we nearing a conclusion? I do believe my luncheon begins promptly at one.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months gradual onset. And you mentioned it happens when you’re focusing intently. Have you noticed anything else associated with it?
PATIENT: Associated with it…? Goodness. Let me think. Well… I do find myself… a little more irritable, perhaps. Snapping at the… assistants. Which is most unbecoming, I assure you. And… I sleep less well. My mind races, you see. It simply won’t stop. It's always cataloging, arranging, correcting… even when I’m trying to rest. Is that helpful? Really, I feel as though I'm reciting my life story to a complete stranger. It’s rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Erle, thank you. It sounds like you’re experiencing some stress and potentially some anxiety as well, alongside the hand tremor. Before we proceed, do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Well, I had a… a touch of the flu, perhaps five years ago. Nothing serious. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, naturally. I wear glasses. Beyond that… no. I’ve always been a very… robust individual. A strong constitution. My mother always said so. Though, as I said, my nerves are not what they used to be. Honestly, I suspect it's simply… the modern world. It's all so… chaotic. Is that a medical condition? Because I assure you, it’s quite debilitating.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed by the changes around you, and it absolutely can contribute to feeling unwell. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just the occasional aspirin for a headache. And… a small something for my waterworks, prescribed by Dr. Petrov, years ago. I can’t recall the name. As for surgeries… no. Never. I’ve always been far too sensible to allow anyone to cut into me. It’s a barbaric practice, frankly. Though, I did have my tonsils out as a child, if that counts. A very unpleasant experience, I assure you. Are we finished now? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that information. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It will only take a few minutes. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a basic neurological exam, including checking your reflexes and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Neurological exam...? Coordination...? Honestly, Dr. Rosanova, is this truly necessary? I've already explained everything. I'm a perfectly rational, perfectly capable individual. I’ve spent my life organizing information, maintaining order. A neurological exam feels… rather insulting. Still, if it will expedite matters, I suppose I can endure it. But please, be quick. And gentle. I have a very sensitive constitution, you see. And absolutely no patience for unnecessary poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Erle. It’s simply a standard part of evaluating these types of symptoms, and it will help me rule out any other potential causes. I assure you, it will be quick and gentle. We'll start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not overly concerning. Now, let's just listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Just look at it as I move it around. And now, I'll check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that can be common with age. Finally, I'll ask you to touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed. There is a slight tremor when reaching for your nose, and a little difficulty with accuracy.
PATIENT: Tremor? Difficulty with accuracy? I assure you, Dr. Rosanova, I am perfectly capable. It’s simply… the stress. All this poking and prodding is making me nervous, naturally. It’s hardly a scientific assessment. Frankly, I’m beginning to feel quite agitated. Are we finished yet? I believe I’ve endured quite enough. A perfectly reasonable physician would have gathered sufficient information by now. This is… rather demeaning. Perhaps a nice cup of tea would be more beneficial. And a quiet room. A very quiet room. .
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Erle, and I apologize if the exam has been unsettling. Based on what you've told me, and the findings of the exam, it seems you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with essential tremor, possibly exacerbated by stress and anxiety. Essential tremor is a common neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking. It's not life-threatening, but it can be bothersome. The good news is, there are treatment options available. However, before we proceed, it's important to rule out other potential causes. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function and vitamin levels, and I'd also recommend a consultation with a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation. How does that sound?
