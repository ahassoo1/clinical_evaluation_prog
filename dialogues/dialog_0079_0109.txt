DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… the back of my head. It hurts. Been hurting for… maybe three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache, you know? Not a sharp pain.
DOCTOR: I see. A dull ache at the back of your head for approximately three days, intermittent. Alright. Could you describe where exactly at the back of your head the pain is located?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s… right at the base of my skull. Where your neck meets your head. Both sides, mostly. Not just one spot. It’s hard to point, you know? It feels… wide. Like a band.
DOCTOR: Both sides of the occiput, at the base of the skull. A band-like sensation. And would you characterize this pain as constant, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: Fluctuate, yes. It’s not always there. Some hours I don’t feel nothing. Then… boom. It’ll come back. It’s worse when I… when I bend my head down. Like when I was working on the trains, fixing things. That made it bad. Not now, though. I’m retired, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: So, the pain is exacerbated by flexion of the neck. And you mentioned previous work… Were you involved in any activities that might have caused trauma to the head or neck?
PATIENT: Trauma? Hmm… well, working on the trains… lots of bumping, you know? And sometimes, things would fall. Not on me, thankfully, but close. And… we had to lift a lot. Heavy things. And sometimes, you’d hit your head on the metal… little bumps, nothing serious. But lots of little bumps over many years. It was a rough job. Never thought much of it at the time.
DOCTOR: History of repetitive minor head trauma and heavy lifting. Alright. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with this headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. Not really. Maybe… a little tired sometimes. But I’m 90 years old, Doctor! A little tired is normal, right? No dizziness. No blurry vision. No… what do you call them… the shakes? No, nothing like that. Just the headache. Sometimes it makes it hard to sleep, that's all.
DOCTOR: No dizziness, blurry vision, tremors… Difficulty sleeping related to the headache. Very well. Do you have any medical conditions that you are currently being treated for, or have been treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, my blood pressure used to be high. Doctor gave me pills for it. But I stopped taking them a long time ago. Doctor said it was okay. Said I was getting too old for pills. And… my wife, God rest her soul, she always took care of the health stuff. I don't remember much about it. Just the pills, I think. And… I broke my arm once, a long time ago. But that healed.
DOCTOR: History of hypertension, medication discontinued per physician’s orders. Previous fractured radius. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Not even aspirin. I try to stay away from those pills if I can. My wife used to say they were poison. Maybe she was right. Just… a little bit of coffee in the morning, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Very well. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always said I was a tough old goat. I eat anything. Everything. She used to make all sorts of foods, and I never had a problem. I think I'm pretty lucky, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. We'll start with your vital signs, and then I'll take a look at your neck and head. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. You're the doctor. I trust your judgement. Just… be gentle, okay? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Brum. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Please extend your arm. Blood pressure is 148/82. Pulse is 76 and regular. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Palpation of the cervical spine elicits mild tenderness to the lower cervical vertebrae and the occipital region. No palpable step-offs or spasms. Range of motion in the cervical spine is limited due to pain. Cranial nerves appear grossly intact. Motor strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Sensation is intact to light touch. Alright, Mr. Brum. The examination reveals tenderness in your lower neck and at the base of your skull. Your neurological function appears to be intact, but you do have some limited range of motion in your neck.
PATIENT: That… that doesn’t sound too good, does it? Limited range of motion… That’s what it feels like, though. I haven’t been able to turn my head as far as I used to. So, what does it mean, Doctor? Is it serious? Is it… the trains? All that bumping and lifting?
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to say definitively, Mr. Brum. Your symptoms, along with the examination findings, are suggestive of cervical strain or possibly early degenerative changes in the cervical spine – what we commonly refer to as arthritis. The previous minor trauma you experienced working on the trains could certainly be a contributing factor. However, at your age, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. I would like to order some imaging – an X-ray of your cervical spine – to better visualize the bony structures and assess the extent of any degeneration or other abnormalities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: X-ray… yes, okay. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Will it… will it hurt? And how long will I have to wait? I don’t like being in pain, and I don’t want to be a bother. And… how much will it cost? I don’t have much money, you see.
DOCTOR: The X-ray itself is relatively quick and painless, Mr. Brum. You’ll simply lie on a table while the technician takes a few images. As for cost… unfortunately, as you are uninsured, you will be responsible for the full cost. It is approximately $250. I understand that is a significant expense, and the clinic does have a limited financial assistance program. I can have our billing department contact you with information on that. In the meantime, I would also like to prescribe you a mild anti-inflammatory medication to help manage your pain and inflammation while we await the results of the X-ray. It’s ibuprofen, 200mg, three times a day with food. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… yes, that’s alright. $250… that’s a lot of money. But… I suppose I have to know what’s going on, right? Tell me about the pills. Any side effects? I don’t want to end up worse than I already am. And can I get it here, at the clinic? Or do I have to go to the… the pharmacy? I don’t have a car, Doctor. My wife used to drive…
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Brum, knowing what’s going on is important. The ibuprofen can have some mild side effects, such as stomach upset or heartburn. It's important to take it with food to minimize those risks. Avoid taking it if you have any history of stomach ulcers or kidney problems. We can dispense the medication here at the clinic for a cost of $20. That will cover the cost of the medication itself and the dispensing fee. As for the X-ray, we will need to refer you to an imaging center nearby. I can provide you with a list of centers that offer discounted rates for uninsured patients. It’s also important to understand that the X-ray will only show us the bony structures. If your symptoms persist despite these measures, we may need to consider further imaging, such as an MRI, to assess the soft tissues in your neck. However, let's start with the X-ray and the ibuprofen, and see how you respond. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds alright, Doctor. $20 for the pills, that's… manageable. And a list of places for the X-ray… thank you. I appreciate your help. My wife would have known what to do. She always handled everything. So, I get the pills here, and then… you give me the list? And then I call those places to see about the X-ray? Is that right? I just… I don’t want to forget anything. I’m an old man, you know.
DOCTOR: Precisely, Mr. Brum. I am writing a prescription for ibuprofen 200mg. You can obtain it from the pharmacy here at the clinic. I will also print out a list of local imaging centers that offer discounted rates for uninsured patients. The front desk staff can assist you with obtaining the medication, and they will also be happy to answer any questions you may have regarding the imaging centers. I will also document these findings in your chart and schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to review the results of the X-ray and assess your progress. Does that sound satisfactory?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you so much. Two weeks… I’ll remember that. You’ve been very kind. I suppose I should be going now? I don’t want to take up any more of your time. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re most welcome, Mr. Brum. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And please, take care. .
