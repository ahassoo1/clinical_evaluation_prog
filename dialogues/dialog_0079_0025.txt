DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I want to know… about my people. Where they come from, a long time ago. I hear you can find out with… a test? With my spit, maybe? I want to know where my family really from.
DOCTOR: I see. Mr. Scobie, while I am a physician specializing in family medicine, my expertise does not lie in genealogical research or ancestry testing. I understand your curiosity about your heritage, but that falls outside of my scope of practice. However, I can certainly discuss your medical history with you, and how that might be relevant to your family. Perhaps understanding any predispositions to certain conditions within your family line would be beneficial?
PATIENT: Oh. I… see. You no do that test then? The spit test? I thought… well, the lady at the front desk, she said you could. Maybe… maybe the medical history is good too. I don't know much about it. My mama, she… gone a long time ago. And my papa, he no talk much about his side. Mostly just fishin'.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be confused, Mr. Scobie. Sometimes information gets miscommunicated. I assure you, this clinic does not offer direct ancestry testing. The front desk staff may have been referring to genetic health screenings, which can sometimes provide incidental findings related to ethnicity, but that is not their primary purpose. Let's focus on your health, then. You mentioned your mother passed away and your father was not forthcoming with details about his medical background. That does make things more challenging, but we can still work with what we have. To begin, can you recall any significant illnesses your mother suffered from?
PATIENT: Hmm… Mama… she get sick with the cough. Bad cough. Long time. She stay in bed a lot, towards the end. And… her legs, they get swollen. Big. That’s all I remember, really. She no go to the doctor much. Old ways, you know? We just… take care of her at home.
DOCTOR: A persistent cough and leg swelling… I see. This information is helpful, Mr. Scobie. Swelling in the legs, or edema, can be indicative of several conditions, including heart problems or kidney issues. A prolonged cough could suggest a respiratory illness, or something more chronic. Do you recall when this happened, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh… a long time ago. When I was… maybe ten? Twelve? It was before the big storm. Before the boats were all gone. So… a long time ago. I no good with dates. Everything kinda… blends together when you get old.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Scobie. Estimating dates can be difficult. Let’s not dwell on the precise timeline. Now, concerning your own health… are you currently experiencing any symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, or any other discomfort?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not much trouble now. I get… tired easy, sometimes. But that’s just old age, I think. I still go fishin’ most days. Still make the boats. But no pain. No cough. Just… slow. Old and slow.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Scobie. A decrease in energy levels is common with age, of course. However, it's important to rule out any underlying medical causes. Before we proceed with a physical examination, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh… just the pills the nurse give me at the clinic sometimes. For my water. She say I get too much water in my body. Little white pills. That’s all. I no remember the name. I just take them when she tell me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. We’ll need to clarify exactly which medication you are taking. It's essential to know the dosage and frequency for your safety. I'll have the nurse review your medication list after this consultation. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I'd like to check your heart and lungs, blood pressure, and assess the swelling you mentioned. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think. I trust you. Just… be gentle, okay? My bones… they not so strong anymore.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. I will be as gentle as possible. Please take deep breaths for me. In… and out… Excellent. Your heart sounds… somewhat regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds. Blood pressure is 140/90. A bit elevated, but not alarmingly so. I do detect some mild edema in both lower extremities, as you mentioned. Not severe, but present. I'd like to order some basic blood work to assess your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out any underlying heart issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? Okay. If you think it’s needed. I don't like needles much, but… if it will help. Will it take long? I got the boat to finish for old Man Hemmings.
DOCTOR: It's a simple blood draw, Mr. Scobie, and it shouldn’t take long at all. Perhaps ten to fifteen minutes, including the wait for the results. The phlebotomist is very skilled. It’s important to get a baseline assessment of your health, especially given your age and the mild edema we observed. The blood work will help us determine if any further investigation is required. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your salt intake and staying well-hydrated. We can discuss that in more detail once we have the results. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, or any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, Doctor. Never had any allergies. I eat everything. Fish, mostly. And whatever Mama cooked. And… I got a little trouble with my knees sometimes. Old war wound, they say. But that’s just aches and pains. Old age. No, no allergies. Just… old.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, and some knee discomfort. Very well. Now, Mr. Scobie, I’m noting your concern about your heritage. While I can’t fulfill your request for an ancestry test directly, I can suggest some resources that might be helpful. There are genealogical societies and online databases that can assist with family history research. I can have the nurse provide you with some information pamphlets at the end of your visit. For now, let’s focus on your current health. We will review the blood work results and discuss a plan of action at your follow-up appointment. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: That’s… nice of you, Doctor. The papers about my family, that would be good. And the blood work. If you think it’s best. I’m just… tired of feelin’ slow. Want to be strong enough to finish the boat. And maybe… maybe learn a little more about where I come from. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Mr. Scobie. I understand your desire to feel stronger and learn more about your heritage. We will do our best to address both of those concerns. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She will also provide you with the information pamphlets regarding genealogical resources. In the meantime, are there any other questions or concerns you have for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. Just… thank you. You been very patient with an old man.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Mr. Scobie. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or experience any new symptoms. The nurse will be with you shortly.
