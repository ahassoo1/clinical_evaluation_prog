DOCTOR: Hi Rayshon, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Okay… cough. I been coughing… a long time now. And tired. Very tired. Feels like… sinus also. Hurts in my face sometimes. I dunno… been happening a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough, fatigue, and some facial pain... that gives us a few things to look at. When you say “a long time”, could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Maybe… six months? Or more? Hard to say exactly. It comes and goes. Worse in the cold… I think. Not sure. I work outside a lot, changing tires… maybe from that?
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or more of intermittent cough and fatigue. And it seems to worsen with cold weather, or potentially with your work. Changing tires is physical work, so that’s good to know. Does anything specifically trigger the cough?
PATIENT: Trigger…? Uh… dust, maybe? When I’m changing the tires, there’s a lot of dust. And… sometimes when I lie down. At night, it’s worse. I have to… sit up.
DOCTOR: Okay, dust and lying down seem to be triggers. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the cough – like a fever, chills, shortness of breath, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Fever… not really. Sometimes a little warm, but nothing bad. No… chest pain. Hard to breathe… sometimes, when I cough a lot. Then it's okay again. Chills… maybe a little, when I feel very tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant fever or chest pain, some shortness of breath with coughing, and chills with fatigue. Okay. Have you noticed any mucus with the cough?
PATIENT: Mucus…? Yeah. Sometimes. White… or yellow sometimes. Not always. Sometimes just dry cough.
DOCTOR: Okay, white or yellow mucus, sometimes a dry cough. Do you have any other symptoms like a sore throat, runny nose, or body aches?
PATIENT: Sore throat… not much. Runny nose… a little, when I have the cough. Body aches… yeah, sometimes. Like… when you have the flu? Not as bad, but… similar.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk about your past medical history quickly. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before – like asthma, allergies, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… I don’t think so. Never been to the doctor much. Just… small things. Aches and pains. Nothing serious. My wife… she knows more about these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no prior medical diagnoses that you're aware of. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgery. Never. Just… work injuries. Small things. Scratches… bumps… nothing that needed a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father… he had… something with his lungs. I dunno what. He smoked a lot. My mother… she was okay. Just… old age. She passed away.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lung issues in your father, and your mother passed away from old age. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No smoke. Never. My wife… she doesn’t like smoke. Bad for health, she says.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don't think so. Maybe a little itchy sometimes after eating some fruits… like mangoes. But not bad. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medicine. Just… water. And sometimes tea when I cough. My wife makes it with honey.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your lungs, check your throat, and feel your sinuses. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah… okay. Sounds good. My lungs… they’re probably dusty. Changing tires… a lot of dust.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath in… and out… again… Alright. Your lungs sound a little wheezy, particularly on the left side. Some mild congestion as well. Your throat is slightly red, but no significant swelling. Your sinuses are tender to the touch, particularly around your forehead.
PATIENT: Wheezy…? What does that mean? Is that bad? And tender…? Sinuses… yeah, hurts a little when I press.
DOCTOR: Wheezing means there's some narrowing in your airways, which can make it harder to breathe. It can be caused by a lot of things, like inflammation or mucus. And the tenderness in your sinuses suggests some inflammation there too. Given your cough, fatigue, and these findings, it sounds like you might have bronchitis with a possible sinus infection. To be sure, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to rule out anything more serious like pneumonia. We can also do a quick test to check for flu and COVID, just to rule those out. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: X-ray…? Is that safe? And flu… COVID… I heard it's bad. I haven't been feeling that sick… Just tired. Maybe it’s not COVID?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question. X-rays use a very small amount of radiation, and the benefits of ruling out something serious like pneumonia outweigh the risks. As for COVID, symptoms can vary, and it's always best to rule it out, especially given the potential for spread. The flu test is a simple nasal swab. For now, since you’re not feeling severely ill, we can start with some supportive care. I’m going to recommend a cough suppressant with guaifenesin to help loosen the mucus, and a saline nasal spray to help with the sinus congestion. I also recommend plenty of fluids and rest. If the X-ray comes back clear and the flu/COVID tests are negative, we can assume it's bronchitis with a sinus infection. In that case, I’ll prescribe an antibiotic for the sinus infection. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Sounds… complicated. But… yeah, I guess. Antibiotics… that’s good? To kill the… bugs? I don’t want to get sicker.
DOCTOR: That's right, antibiotics help kill the bacteria causing the sinus infection. It’s good you’re thinking ahead. We only prescribe them when needed, though, because overuse can lead to resistance. Okay, I'll get the orders for the X-ray and the tests started. The nurse will be in shortly to get you set up. She’ll also explain the process and answer any questions you have. I'll also have her print out a prescription for the cough suppressant and saline spray. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – like a high fever, severe shortness of breath, or chest pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Emergency room…? Okay. No, I think… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything… slowly. My wife will be happy to know you're helping.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Rayshon. I’m glad I could help, and I’m glad your wife will be happy to hear that. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns. Let's get those tests done and see what we're dealing with. Have a good day, and get some rest. The nurse will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: Okay… thank you, Doctor. You too.
