DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is good to meet you too. I… how you say… I am here for the… the talk on the computer? The one they schedule for me. My back is… not so good lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that you have a scheduled appointment for a back issue. And it seems you've been experiencing some discomfort. Could you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… ache, mostly. Not sharp pain, you understand? Just… tired feeling. It is worse when I… when I bend over. I work with cars, you see. A lot of bending. It has been maybe… two months now? Maybe a little longer. I try to take it easy, but… the work, it must be done.
DOCTOR: Okay, so an achy sensation, not a sharp pain, primarily in your back. It’s been going on for about two months, and it seems to be exacerbated by bending, especially with your work as a mechanic. And you've been trying to take it easy, but the work requires it. To get a better understanding, could you tell me exactly where in your back you're feeling this ache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Is… low back. Here. . Not so high up, you understand? Right here, on both sides. Sometimes, it goes a little into the… the bottom, but not the leg. Just the bottom. Is hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright, low back, on both sides, sometimes radiating a bit into the buttocks, but not down the legs. That's helpful. And would you describe this pain as constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… come and go. More when I work. If I sit for too long, also. When I sleep, is usually okay. But after I wake up… sometimes a little stiff. Then I move around and is better. Not always, though. Some days is worse than others. Is… unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable, and worse with work and prolonged sitting, but generally okay during sleep, though sometimes a little stiff upon waking. Okay. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this back pain?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Hmm. Not really. I… I feel tired sometimes, but I work very hard. I don't know if that is the back, or just… being old. No numbness, no… how you say… shooting pains down the legs. Just the ache. And a little… clicking sometimes when I bend. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, no shooting pains or numbness, which is good. And the clicking… sometimes clicking can be harmless, associated with minor joint movement. We'll assess that. Let's move on to some other questions. Have you had any previous injuries to your back?
PATIENT: Injuries… hmm. Not serious. When I was young, I lift a heavy engine, I think. I pull something, but I rest for a few days and is okay. Nothing broken, I don't think. Many years ago. Maybe twenty years? I don't remember exactly. I work with cars, you see, you get little bumps and bruises all the time. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, a minor muscle strain about twenty years ago while lifting an engine, which resolved with rest. And typical minor injuries associated with your work. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no. Never had surgery. I try to stay healthy. And I am… I am not a fan of hospitals. No surgeries, no. Nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And that’s perfectly alright. Now, do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, such as arthritis, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Doctor tell me… high blood pressure. Yes. But is okay. I take pills. And… sometimes, the doctor say my cholesterol is high. I take pills for that too. Everything else is… good, I think. Medicare check me every year.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you manage high blood pressure and high cholesterol with medication. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides those for blood pressure and cholesterol?
PATIENT: Just those two. The blue one for blood pressure, and the white one for… you know… the fat. No vitamins, no nothing else. I don't believe in all that. Just the pills the doctor give me. And sometimes, I take something for… for the pain, but is not every day. Just when is really bad. Is… ibuprofen, I think? The little white tablets.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take medication for high blood pressure and cholesterol, and occasionally ibuprofen for pain. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no. I don't think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. I am Czech, you see. We eat a lot of… everything. No allergies, no. Nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. And that’s good. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never smoke. My husband, he smoke, but he… he is gone now. Alcohol? Sometimes, a little wine with dinner. Very little. And… no. No drugs. I am a good girl.
DOCTOR: Thank you for all that information, Ms. Benites. That's very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what’s going on with your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is good. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. I… I just want to feel better. The bending… is hard. Yes, please, examine me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please, if you would, just lie down on your back on the examination table for me. We'll start there. First, I'm just going to take a look at your back and see if there’s any visible swelling or redness. Okay, a little tenderness here on the left side, and a bit here on the right. Not anything dramatic, but noticeable. Okay, bending forward… any pain with that?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. Not sharp, but… ache. Is more when I go down, then when I come back up. It feels… tight. Like something is stuck. Is hard to explain. And… when I bend sideways, is a little bit better, but still… ache. The left side feels… tighter than the right. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion, especially with forward bending, and tenderness along the lower back muscles. You're right, the left side does feel a little tighter. I don’t feel any obvious abnormalities, no masses or anything like that. Now, I’m going to lift your leg up like this. Any pain shooting down your leg with that?
PATIENT: No… no shooting pain. A little stretch, maybe, but no pain. I can feel my leg, is okay. Just… stretch. Is like when I… when I stretch before I work. Not bad pain. Just… feels it. Is that good?
DOCTOR: That's good, Ms. Benites. No radiating pain with the straight leg raise tests is a positive sign. Alright, I'm just checking your hips...everything feels normal there. And I've observed your gait - you're walking normally, without any obvious limping. Okay. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it seems you're experiencing muscle strain in your lower back, likely aggravated by the repetitive bending and strain from your work. The absence of radiating pain and neurological deficits is encouraging. I don’t believe there is a need for imaging at this time. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… muscle strain. That makes sense. I think so. Bending, lifting… yes. It is my job. No… no shooting pain. Good. No imaging? That is good too. Less… less trouble. So… what do I do? How do I fix it? The doctor always say “rest”, but I must work.
DOCTOR: You’re right, rest isn’t always practical, especially with your profession. We'll focus on management rather than complete rest. I recommend the following: First, over-the-counter pain relief, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, as you’ve already been doing, can help reduce inflammation and pain. Follow the dosage instructions on the package. Second, heat or ice packs applied to your lower back for 15-20 minutes at a time can help relieve muscle spasms. Alternate between heat and ice to see what feels better for you. Third, gentle stretching and exercises to strengthen your core and back muscles. I can give you a handout with some simple exercises you can do at home. Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, proper lifting technique. Try to avoid bending at the waist and lift with your legs, keeping your back straight. Finally, avoid prolonged sitting or standing in one position. Take breaks to move around and stretch every 20-30 minutes. We can also discuss a referral to a physical therapist if your symptoms don't improve with these measures. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. Pain relief, I already do. Heat or ice, okay. Stretching, yes, maybe. I forget sometimes, though. Proper lifting… yes, I try. But it is hard when the engine is heavy! Physical therapist… maybe later. Let me try this first. The handout… with the stretching… yes, please. And… is important to keep my back straight when I lift? Even if is heavy? Is very important, that part. I want to remember.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here’s the handout. It includes exercises like pelvic tilts, knee-to-chest stretches, and gentle back extensions. Start slowly and listen to your body. Don't push yourself too hard. And you’re right to emphasize proper lifting technique. Keeping your back straight is crucial. Even with heavy engines. Bend your knees, keep your back straight, and lift with your legs. Hold the engine close to your body, and avoid twisting. It's better to ask for help if something is too heavy than to risk injuring your back. Here are some visuals that may help. We will monitor your progress. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within a few weeks despite these measures, we can discuss a referral to a physical therapist or further imaging, if needed. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that is… good. Stretching, pain relief, proper lifting. And the handout. I understand. Thank you, Doctor. You explain very well. I will try my best. I think… I think that is all. Thank you for your help. I feel better already, just knowing what to do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. I’m glad I could help. Remember to listen to your body and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I’m confident that with a little effort, you’ll be able to manage this and get back to feeling better. Here’s my card with the clinic number. If anything changes, or if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call. Have a good day, Ms. Benites, and take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye. .
