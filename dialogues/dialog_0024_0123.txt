DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my skin… it’s been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy, really. It started a few weeks ago, I think, and it just hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: “A few weeks ago,” you say. Vague. Very vague. Alright. And where, precisely, is this… itchiness located?
PATIENT: Oh, excuse me. I didn’t mean to be vague! It’s… well, pretty much everywhere, honestly. My arms, my legs, my back… even my stomach a little. Not my face, thank goodness. But yeah, all over. It’s not like one specific spot, it’s just… general. Does that make more sense?
DOCTOR: Somewhat. “General” is still not particularly helpful for a diagnosis, Ms. Cassimatis. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh dear, I’m sorry! I’m not very good at this doctor stuff, am I? It comes and goes, yes. It’s worse at night, definitely. When I’m trying to sleep… that’s the hardest. During the day it’s… manageable, I guess. Just annoying. But at night? Forget about it. I’m scratching all the time.
DOCTOR: Worse at night. Noted. And have you noticed anything that specifically seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific, no. I changed laundry detergents recently… a new brand, supposed to be good for sensitive skin, but I don’t think that’s it. It started before that, I think. I haven’t eaten anything different, haven’t been anywhere new… I just woke up one day and it was itchy. It's just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: “Just woke up one day.” Right. And you are currently taking any medications, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not. I try to stay away from them as much as possible, if I can. Never been much of a pill-taker. Just… the usual things, you know? Vitamins, occasionally. Nothing prescribed. I try to keep things natural, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at the affected areas. Please, if you would, turn around. And please, try to refrain from scratching while I examine you. It complicates matters.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Complicates matters, you say? I’ll try my best, Doctor. It's just… difficult. It really is. But I’ll try.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No visible rash, no excoriations beyond what would be expected from scratching. Skin appears generally…normal. Dry, perhaps. Alright. And are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything, honestly. Maybe a little sniffle with pollen sometimes, but that’s it. Nothing serious. No food allergies, no reactions to plants… I’m pretty lucky that way, I think.
DOCTOR: Lucky, perhaps. Alright. Given your history, or lack thereof, and the unremarkable physical exam, I suspect this is likely a case of… idiopathic pruritus. In simpler terms, itchy skin with no obvious cause.
PATIENT: Idiopathic… what now? No obvious cause? So… you don’t know why I’m itchy? That doesn’t sound very good, Doctor. Is there… anything you can do about it? I mean, it’s driving me crazy! It’s making it hard to sleep, and I need my sleep.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cassimatis, sometimes the body simply… behaves in inexplicable ways. It doesn't always have a neat and tidy explanation. Now, we can try some symptomatic relief. I'm going to prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream and an oral antihistamine. Apply the cream thinly to the affected areas twice daily and take the antihistamine before bed. This may help reduce the itching. It's not a cure, understand.
PATIENT: Oh. Topical cream and… pills. I was hoping for something… more. But, alright. If it might help, I’ll try it. And the antihistamine… will that make me sleepy? Because I really do need my sleep, like I said. And is there anything I should watch out for with the cream? Any side effects?
DOCTOR: The antihistamine can cause drowsiness in some patients, yes. It's generally mild, but avoid operating heavy machinery. As for the cream, prolonged use can thin the skin, so use it sparingly and only as directed. If the itching worsens or you develop any redness, swelling, or blistering, discontinue use immediately and contact my office. Here are your instructions. And Ms. Cassimatis, if the symptoms persist for more than a few weeks, or if they become significantly worse, I recommend consulting a dermatologist. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay. Sparingly… and watch for redness. I can do that. No, I don’t think so. That’s… everything, I guess. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you seeing me. I hope it helps. Really. It’s just… I’m so tired of itching.
DOCTOR: Very well. I trust these measures will provide some relief. And Ms. Cassimatis, perhaps try to reduce stress. Stress can exacerbate these conditions. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
