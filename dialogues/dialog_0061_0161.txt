DOCTOR: Bula and hello! I’m Dr. Kimm. It's lovely to meet you, Helaina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… honestly, a friend suggested I come talk about… preventative things. She said there’s a way to, you know, really lower your chances of getting… well, you know. HIV. I don't really understand all the details, but she said it's something I should look into. Is that what you do here?
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful idea, Helaina! Absolutely, that’s something we can definitely talk about. Your friend is very thoughtful to suggest PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis. It’s a medication that can significantly lower your risk of HIV, and it's great you’re being proactive about your health. Before we dive into that, though, I'd like to get a better understanding of your overall health and risk factors. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds sensible. I… I don’t really have any major health problems, to be honest. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, I suppose. And I have Medicare, which is good. As for… risk factors. I haven't been with anyone regularly for a long time, but… you know. It’s good to be careful, right? I just want to make sure I'm doing everything I can.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, it is always good to be careful, and it's wonderful you're thinking about this. "Aches and pains for someone your age" is pretty common – we can chat about those later if they bother you. And Medicare is great, good to know. When you say you haven’t been with anyone regularly for a long time, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well… it's been a good few years, honestly. Since my husband passed away. It's been mostly just… casual things, when they happen. Nothing serious. I haven't really been looking for anything, but... you meet people. I don't use dating apps or anything like that. Mostly just friends of friends, if that makes sense. And I always… try to be careful. But my friend said even being careful isn't enough sometimes, and that's why she suggested this. Is that right?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Helaina. And your friend is right to be thoughtful. Even with precautions, there’s still a small risk, and PrEP can help reduce that risk even further. It’s a really smart thing to consider, especially given your situation. Just to clarify for my records, when you say "casual things," are you referring to sexual encounters?
PATIENT: Yes, that's… that’s what I meant. Sorry, I wasn’t really sure how to phrase it. It hasn’t been a lot, honestly. Maybe once or twice a year, if that. And I always… we always use protection. But like I said, I’m just trying to be as safe as possible. It’s probably silly to worry about it at my age, but… better safe than sorry, I always say. Is this what PrEP helps with? Preventing things even with protection?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Helaina, and you're phrasing things perfectly fine. It's excellent that you are using protection, and you are right to think about layers of protection. PrEP is very effective even when used with condoms. It provides another layer of defense against HIV. It's not about thinking something will happen, it’s about minimizing risk as much as possible. To see if PrEP is right for you, I need to ask a few more questions, if you don't mind. It’s like a little health check to make sure there aren't any reasons why it wouldn't be suitable. We'll go through your medical history, any allergies you might have, and maybe some lifestyle questions. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Go ahead. I don't have any major allergies, thankfully. Just a little hay fever in the spring, but that's it. And I don't really have a complicated medical history. I’ve had the usual vaccinations, and… oh, I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that was all. Everything else is pretty straightforward, I think. I'm a pretty healthy person, generally. Although… I do get a bit winded easily climbing stairs. But that's probably just age, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No major allergies, gallbladder removal ten years ago, and generally healthy – excellent. And yes, getting a bit winded climbing stairs can be perfectly normal with age, but we can chat about that later to make sure there's nothing else going on. Just to confirm, the gallbladder removal – was that done here at the clinic, or at another hospital?
PATIENT: It was at St. Jude's Hospital, in Bethlehem. A long time ago now. It wasn’t any trouble, thankfully. They sent me home the same day. I don’t think I’ve had any problems with it since. I mostly just worry about eating too much rich food now, haha. But that’s a different story. Is this information important for the PrEP thing? I just want to make sure I'm giving you everything you need.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and thank you for letting me know. It is helpful to have that history. Knowing where procedures were done and if there were any complications is always good practice. And yes, it's potentially relevant. We just need to make sure everything's accounted for. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… an occasional pain reliever for aches and pains. Usually ibuprofen, but not regularly. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I prefer a cup of tea and a lie-down, honestly. And I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because it's so gloomy here. But that's it. Nothing else. I really don't like taking medication unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Occasional ibuprofen, vitamin D in the winter – excellent. So, it sounds like you generally avoid medications, which is perfectly fine. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or HIV?
PATIENT: Well… my mother had diabetes, sadly. She passed away a few years ago because of it. And my father… he had heart problems. He had a stroke, I think. As for anything else… not that I'm aware of. No one in my family ever talked about anything like cancer or HIV. It wasn't something people discussed openly back then, honestly. It was all very hush-hush. But as far as I know, there haven’t been any major health problems on either side of the family, besides my parents' issues. Is that helpful? I don't have a lot of information to give you, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Helaina, thank you. Knowing about your parents’ diabetes and heart problems is important information. It’s perfectly normal not to have a lot of details, especially if it wasn’t something that was openly discussed. Now, I’d like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never smoked a cigarette in my life, and I haven’t touched a drop of alcohol since my husband passed away. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but… it just doesn't feel right anymore. And I certainly don’t do any drugs. Never have, never will. I believe in keeping a clean and healthy life. That’s why I’m here, isn’t it? Trying to be proactive and take care of myself. Is that a silly answer? I just want to be clear. I'm a very straightforward person.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Helaina, and it’s a very good answer! It’s wonderful to hear that you prioritize a clean and healthy lifestyle. It’s very admirable. Now, just one last quick set of questions to complete the health history, then we can move onto a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections, like chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, or herpes?
PATIENT: No, never. Not in my life. I… I've always been very careful, as I've said. And my husband and I were very faithful to each other. It's… it's a difficult question to ask, I suppose. But the answer is no. Never. I can honestly say that. I hope that's okay. I’m just trying to be completely honest with you. I want to make sure I'm making the right decision here. I'm getting a bit tired now, though. Is this physical exam going to be… invasive? I just want to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Helaina, and thank you for being so honest with me. It's important you feel comfortable, and I appreciate you sharing that. And no, the physical exam won't be invasive. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick general exam. I’ll also want to take a blood sample to check your kidney function and screen for any STIs, even though you've never been diagnosed with any. This is standard procedure before starting PrEP, just to make sure everything is okay. It's a precaution, nothing to worry about. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. As long as it’s not too complicated, I suppose. I'm a bit squeamish, to be honest. But I understand it's necessary. A blood test is fine, and listening to my heart and lungs… alright, I can handle that. Just… please be gentle. And try not to take too long, if that’s possible? I have a few errands to run this afternoon. I don’t want to be out all day. Is there anything else I need to know before we start?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Helaina. I will definitely be gentle, and I'll be as quick as possible. I understand your concerns, and I’ll make sure you’re comfortable throughout the entire exam. Before we begin, I just need to confirm that you understand what PrEP is. It’s a daily medication that prevents HIV infection. It’s highly effective when taken consistently, but it doesn’t protect against other sexually transmitted infections, so using condoms is still recommended. And it requires regular blood tests to monitor your kidney function and check for any side effects. Does that all sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds clear. A daily pill, protects against HIV but not everything, and needs regular blood tests. Right. I think I've got it. It sounds… a bit complicated, to be honest. But I’m willing to try it, if it helps keep me safe. It’s just… a lot to take in. And I’m a bit worried about side effects. Will it make me feel sick? Or tired? I get tired enough as it is. Alright, let's just get it over with, I suppose. Where do we start? I hope this room isn’t too cold. I always feel the chill.
DOCTOR: Okay, Helaina. It is a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly normal to feel a bit overwhelmed. We’ll take it one step at a time. Side effects are usually mild if they occur at all. Some people experience a bit of nausea or headache when they first start taking PrEP, but those usually go away within a few weeks. We'll monitor you closely to make sure you're tolerating the medication well. Let's start with your blood pressure. I'll just wrap this cuff around your arm. And yes, I can adjust the temperature in the room if you’re feeling cold. Is that better?
PATIENT: Yes, that's much better, thank you. A bit warmer is always good. Alright, go ahead with the blood pressure. I haven’t had it checked in ages, probably. I always avoid going to the doctor if I can help it. It's just… I don’t like feeling poked and prodded. But I’m trying to be brave. Just let me know if it’s going to hurt, alright? I'm a bit of a wimp, I'll admit it. Is this cuff tight? It feels a bit tight. But go ahead, I suppose. I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: It’s just a little tight, Helaina. It needs to be snug to get an accurate reading. Okay, your blood pressure is 135/85. That’s slightly elevated, but not too concerning. We can keep an eye on it. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally, and try to relax. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Everything sounds good so far. Now, just a quick look in your ears and throat……Everything looks normal there too. Now, we'll just need a small blood sample. Do you have a preferred arm?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Everything sounds good is always good to hear. Alright, my left arm is fine, I think. It's a bit veiny, if that makes a difference. I always bruise easily, so try not to poke around too much, alright? And I hate needles. Just a warning. I get very faint. I need to look away, I think. Do you have a picture on the wall I can stare at? Anything to distract me. Oh, and can I sit up afterwards? I feel a bit dizzy just thinking about it. Alright, just get it over with quickly, please. I’m starting to sweat now.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, focus on the painting, and take some deep breaths. I'll be as quick as possible. And yes, you can sit up immediately afterwards. Just a little pinch… There we go, all done. See?
PATIENT: Oh… that did pinch. Not very nice. Alright, it’s over. Thank you. Can I sit up now? I feel a bit wobbly. And… what happens next? Do I need to wait here? Or can I go home? I really need a cup of tea. And a lie-down. I feel completely drained. What about the results? How long will it take to get them? I have errands to run, you know. I don’t want to be waiting around all day. I hope this isn’t going to be too complicated. This is all a bit much, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, take your time. You’re doing great. The results will take about a week to come back from the lab. I’ll give you a call as soon as they’re ready. And if everything looks good, we can discuss starting PrEP. It’s a daily pill, and we’ll need to schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor your kidney function and check for any side effects. For now, you can go home and rest. I’ll give you a prescription for a multivitamin, just to keep you feeling your best. And if you feel any unusual symptoms, like nausea, headache, or fatigue, don’t hesitate to give us a call. Here are the instructions for the blood test, and my contact information. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything. A week for the results, daily pill, follow-up appointments, and call if I feel unwell. Right. I’ll try to remember all that. It’s just… a lot. Thank you, Doctor Kimm. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate it. I think I’ll just go home and have that cup of tea now. And a lie-down. Yes. A long lie-down. Oh, and… what if I forget to take the pill? Will something terrible happen? I have a terrible memory, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Helaina. And don't worry, forgetting a pill occasionally won’t cause any harm. It’s important to take it consistently, but a missed dose here or there isn’t the end of the world. We can discuss strategies to help you remember, like setting an alarm or using a pill organizer. I'll give you a call next week with the results, and we'll go from there. Get home safely, and take care of yourself. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Bula vinaka!
