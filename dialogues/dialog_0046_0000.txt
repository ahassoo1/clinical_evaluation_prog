DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's…fine, I suppose. Though I must say, this clinic is a bit…rustic. Anyway, I came in because my legs just suddenly feel like jelly. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a nasty cold. Not a pleasant experience, let me tell you. I haven’t felt this weak in years. It’s making it difficult to do my tours, and that simply won’t do.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds concerning that your legs feel weak, especially after recovering from a cold. And I appreciate you mentioning the impact on your tours – it’s important to understand how this is affecting your daily life. Could you tell me a little more about when this weakness started exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, it was…let me think. Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday morning. I woke up and just felt…off. Then, by the afternoon, it was definitely noticeable. Trying to walk felt like wading through molasses. And it hasn’t gotten any better, quite the opposite, actually. Though, honestly, I don't recall exactly what I did on Tuesday. Just a lot of tourists, I presume. It’s all a bit of a blur, you know how it is. But the legs…that started Tuesday. Definitely.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can appreciate that it’s hard to recall specifics. So, the weakness began Tuesday and has been progressively worsening since then. Has the weakness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not like it vanishes completely, Doctor. But it’s definitely worse at times. Like, if I try to walk a lot, or stand for long periods. That makes it significantly worse. This morning, trying to get my things ready for a particularly…demanding group of tourists…it was awful. Just exhausting. So, it comes and goes, but mostly it’s…there. A constant, annoying presence, really. It’s quite inconvenient, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s exacerbated by activity, particularly walking and standing for prolonged periods. And it's a constant sensation, even when you’re resting, though it’s more noticeable with exertion. Now, besides the weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, there was a bit of tingling. In my feet, mostly. Not terribly uncomfortable, just…odd. And my back has been aching. Lower back, specifically. I assumed it was from schlepping tourists around, honestly. They all seem to have ridiculously heavy suitcases these days. But maybe it’s related? Honestly, it’s hard to tell. I just assumed it was my age catching up with me. But I suppose that’s what you’re here for, isn’t it? To figure things out.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s absolutely what I’m here for. The tingling in your feet and the lower back pain are both important details. When did the tingling start, and is it constant or intermittent like the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… the tingling. That started… a day or so after the legs, I think. Wednesday, perhaps? It’s not constant, no. It comes and goes, mostly in the evenings. After a long day. It’s a bit unsettling, I must say. And it’s not painful, just…weird. Like pins and needles. Though, honestly, I've always been a bit sensitive. I prefer a firm mattress, you know. Anything too soft and I feel…disconnected. But that’s probably irrelevant. The tingling comes and goes, mostly in the evenings after standing all day. Is that helpful? I do try to be precise.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Ms. Firestone. The fact that the tingling started after the legs and is worse in the evenings is significant. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me see. I had my gallbladder removed years ago. That was… unpleasant. And I had a touch of bronchitis a few winters back. Nothing major. Honestly, I’m generally quite healthy. I eat reasonably well, I try to get enough sleep – though tourists don’t always allow for that – and I stay active. I don’t like being sick. It disrupts my schedule, you see. I don’t think I’ve been diagnosed with anything…serious. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Though my ex-husband always claimed I was a hypochondriac. But he was a dreadful man, really. So, gallbladder, bronchitis… and perhaps a bit of complaining. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Firestone. No major medical conditions other than gallbladder removal and a history of bronchitis. And we'll disregard your ex-husband’s opinion. Have you had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, no other surgeries. Just the gallbladder, and that was…oh, must be fifteen years ago now? Perhaps longer. I try to avoid hospitals whenever possible. They're so…sterile. And the food is dreadful. Honestly, I’d rather just tough things out. But this leg weakness…this is interfering with my livelihood, you see. I can’t exactly take a group of tourists around on a stretcher. So, no, just the gallbladder. And a rather unfortunate incident with a wisdom tooth when I was younger, but that wasn’t exactly a surgery, was it? More of a…pulling. A very unpleasant pulling. But no surgeries. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries. Now, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, I take a multivitamin, of course. And sometimes, if my back is particularly bad, I’ll take ibuprofen. But that’s it, really. I don’t like taking a lot of pills. They make me feel…sluggish. And honestly, I don’t trust doctors very much. They always want to put you on something. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. A warm bath, a good night’s sleep… that sort of thing. So, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen occasionally. That’s it. Nothing serious. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Hmm. Not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a particularly bad reaction to anything. I’m a bit sensitive to dust, I suppose. My nose gets a bit runny. But that’s not exactly an allergy, is it? I used to get hay fever when I was younger, but that’s gone away. And I don't eat shellfish. Not because I'm allergic, just… I don't like it. It tastes… unpleasant. So, no allergies, really. Just a dislike of shellfish and a slight sensitivity to dust. Is that helpful? I pride myself on having a strong constitution. Though this leg weakness is… vexing.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. No known allergies. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history. That’s…complicated. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father…well, he wasn’t around much, honestly. My maternal grandmother had arthritis, terribly bad arthritis. She could barely walk in her later years. And I have an aunt who had diabetes, type 2, I think. But that’s about it, really. Honestly, we weren’t a particularly close-knit family. So, I don’t know a lot about their medical histories. High blood pressure, arthritis, diabetes… on my mother’s side, mostly. And a general disregard for preventative care, if I’m being honest. It was always “tough it out” with my family. Is that sufficient? I worry I'm not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Firestone. History of high blood pressure, arthritis, and diabetes in your family. Now, let's talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no! I would never smoke. Absolutely dreadful habit. It smells terrible, it’s bad for your health…and it wrinkles your skin! No, I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don't approve of people who do. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, you see. Even though my ex-husband always claimed I was obsessive. He was a dreadful man, really. No, I don’t smoke. And I don’t drink much either, a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. But mostly, I just prefer a good night’s sleep and a sensible diet. Does that answer your question? I find it rather… crass, to even be asked. But I suppose it’s your job.
DOCTOR: Yes, that answers the question perfectly. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about your typical daily activities and what your work involves?
PATIENT: Well, my work is…demanding. I'm a tour and travel guide, you see. Which means I spend most of my day on my feet, walking, pointing things out, explaining history…and trying to keep tourists from wandering off. It’s a lot of walking. A lot. Sometimes we’re walking for hours. Through cobblestone streets, up hills… It requires a certain level of fitness, you see. And stamina. I lead groups of varying sizes, usually between ten and twenty people. And I have to be knowledgeable about the local area, the history, the culture… It’s quite exhausting, honestly. And lately, with these legs… it’s becoming increasingly difficult. I try to maintain a brisk pace, to keep things interesting, but it’s becoming…challenging. Beyond that, I do a lot of planning, booking hotels, arranging transportation… It’s a full-time job, really. And I take it very seriously. It's my livelihood, you see. And I’m rather good at it, if I do say so myself. But these legs… they’re making it very difficult. Is that a sufficient description?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a very helpful description. It sounds like a physically demanding job requiring significant stamina and walking. Now, Ms. Firestone, before we move on to a physical exam, I just want to reiterate everything you’ve told me. You’ve experienced progressively worsening leg weakness that started after a cold, accompanied by tingling in your feet and lower back pain. You have a history of gallbladder removal, no known allergies, and a family history of high blood pressure, arthritis, and diabetes. You’re a very active tour guide, which requires a lot of walking and stamina. Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that is…remarkably accurate, Doctor. You've listened very well. Though I must say, you make it sound rather… dire. It’s just legs, after all. But yes, that’s an accurate summary. Leg weakness, tingling, back pain…exhausting job. And, frankly, a bit of a nuisance. I just want to be able to do my job, you see? I don't want to be sidelined. So, yes, that’s accurate. Now, what do you think is going on? And more importantly, what can we do about it? I’ve got a tour planned for next week, and I can’t afford to cancel.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone, and I appreciate you being so thorough. It doesn't necessarily mean it's dire, but it’s important to understand the cause of your symptoms so we can develop an appropriate plan. Based on what you've told me, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. We could be looking at something related to nerve compression, a vitamin deficiency, or even a musculoskeletal issue. There are also less common possibilities, but we want to rule those out. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to perform a physical exam. I’ll be checking your reflexes, muscle strength, sensation in your legs and feet, and examining your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That sounds…invasive. But I suppose if it’s necessary. I’m not particularly fond of being poked and prodded, but I understand. Very well, Doctor. Proceed. But please be gentle. And try not to take too long. I have things to do, you know. Tours to plan, tourists to accommodate… I just want to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. And please explain everything you’re doing as you go along. I don’t like surprises. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Firestone. I completely understand. I’ll explain everything as I go, and I'll be as gentle as possible. We'll take things at your pace. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning. Your pulse is 72, and your temperature is normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear there. Next, I’m going to check your reflexes in your legs. Your reflexes are a bit diminished in both legs, which could indicate some nerve involvement. Now, I'm going to test your muscle strength. Could you please try to push against my hand as I resist?
PATIENT: Oh, pushing. Very well. But please don't strain me. I’m not as strong as I used to be, you know. There. Is that sufficient? It feels rather… undignified, to be honest. Being tested like this. I’m a tour guide, not an athlete. I use my brain, not my brawn. But I’m cooperating, you see. Just tell me what you’re looking for. And please be gentle. I don't want to pull anything. This leg weakness is already troublesome enough. And it's rather cold in here, isn’t it? I prefer a warmer climate, personally. But I digress. Push against your hand… I’m pushing. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Ms. Firestone. Thank you for cooperating. Your muscle strength is a bit reduced in both legs, particularly when extending your ankles and toes. It’s not significantly weak, but it’s noticeable. Now, I'm going to check your sensation in your feet and legs. I’m going to lightly touch your feet with this cotton ball. Can you tell me when you feel it?
PATIENT: Oh, a cotton ball. How…subtle. Very well. But please don’t tickle me. I detest being tickled. Yes, I feel it. There. And there. A bit numb, perhaps? It’s hard to say. The shoes I wear for touring aren’t exactly known for their comfort. But yes, I feel it. Though it’s not as strong as it should be, is it? It’s rather unsettling, to be honest. Losing sensation in my feet. I need to be able to feel the ground beneath me, you know. Especially when leading a group of tourists through cobblestone streets. It’s a safety hazard, if you ask me. Is this test telling you something serious? I’m starting to get rather anxious, Doctor. Please tell me everything is alright.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, Ms. Firestone. The sensation is slightly diminished in both feet, particularly on the outer sides. It's not a complete loss of sensation, but it is reduced. Now, I'm going to examine your back. Please lie on your stomach. I’m going to palpate your spine and surrounding muscles to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. There is some tenderness along your lower spine, particularly on the left side. I don’t feel any obvious abnormalities, but there is some muscle spasm. Based on the physical exam, Ms. Firestone, the diminished reflexes, reduced sensation in your feet, and tenderness in your lower back suggest possible nerve compression, potentially related to a condition like sciatica. However, other possibilities need to be ruled out. To get a clearer picture, I recommend ordering some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies and inflammatory markers. I also recommend an MRI of your lower spine to visualize the nerves and rule out any structural abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI… Oh dear. That sounds…expensive. And rather claustrophobic. I’ve heard stories. But… if it’s necessary. Vitamin deficiencies… I do try to eat well, but tourists don't always allow for leisurely meals. Very well. Blood tests and an MRI. What kind of vitamin deficiencies are we looking for? And what does an MRI even show? You need to explain everything to me, Doctor. I don’t like surprises, you see. And what about the cost? My insurance…is that Medicare, I believe. Will it cover all of this? I have a tour planned for next week, you see. I can’t afford to be sidelined. And I certainly can’t afford a hefty medical bill. Please tell me everything will be alright. And please, try to be optimistic. I’m starting to get rather worried. This leg weakness is simply unacceptable.
DOCTOR: I understand your worries, Ms. Firestone. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about the cost and the MRI procedure. The blood tests will check for deficiencies in vitamins like B12, D, and folate, as these can sometimes cause nerve-related symptoms. The MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your spine, allowing us to visualize the nerves, spinal cord, and surrounding tissues. It can help us identify any compression, inflammation, or structural abnormalities that might be causing your symptoms. Regarding the cost, you are correct, you do have Medicare. Medicare should cover the majority of the costs for both the blood tests and the MRI. However, there may be a deductible or copay depending on your specific plan. Our billing department will verify your coverage and provide you with an estimate before proceeding with any tests. I will have them contact you directly. As for the MRI itself, it’s a painless procedure. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-like machine. It can be a bit claustrophobic for some people, but you can close your eyes, listen to music, and we can provide you with anti-anxiety medication if needed. The procedure typically takes about 30-60 minutes. In the meantime, while we’re waiting for the test results, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity, taking over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, and applying heat or ice to your lower back. We'll proceed methodically, Ms. Firestone, and get to the bottom of this. I’m optimistic that we can identify the cause of your symptoms and develop a plan to get you back on your feet. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I suppose not. That’s… reassuring, at least. Though I still don’t like the sound of an MRI. And the thought of being sidelined for a tour…it’s simply dreadful. But I understand. We need to rule things out. Very well. I’ll let your billing department contact me. And I’ll try to avoid strenuous activity, though it’s rather difficult when leading a group of tourists through cobblestone streets. Perhaps… perhaps you could prescribe something for the pain? Just in case? Something mild, of course. I don’t want to become dependent on anything. And I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. But just in case. Is that alright? And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your patience. I tend to worry, you see. It’s a family trait. But I’m trusting you to get to the bottom of this. And please, try to be quick. I have a tour planned for next week, you see. I simply must be on my feet.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Firestone. I completely understand your concerns. I can certainly prescribe something for the pain. Given your preference for natural remedies and your concern about dependence, I recommend a low dose of naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug . It’s available over the counter, but I can write you a prescription to ensure you have the correct dosage. It’s generally well-tolerated, but be sure to take it with food to avoid stomach upset. I will also provide you with some instructions on how to manage your pain with heat and ice. I'll get the orders sent to the pharmacy, and the billing department will contact you shortly. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for after the MRI so we can discuss the results and develop a treatment plan. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I want to assure you that we’ll work together to get you back on your feet as quickly as possible. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. That sounds…reasonable. Naproxen, heat, ice… and a follow-up appointment. Very well. Thank you, Doctor. For your patience and your thoroughness. I appreciate it. I suppose… I suppose I should be going. I have a tour to plan, you see. Though I’m not sure how much planning I can do with these legs. But I’ll try. Thank you again, Doctor. And please, try to be quick with the test results. I simply must be on my feet for my tour next week. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you. Again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Firestone. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. We’ll do everything we can to get you feeling better. Be careful on your way out, and try to rest your legs as much as possible. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. Goodbye, Ms. Firestone. And please, don't worry. We'll figure this out.
