DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It's nice to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I don’t have a lot of time for chit-chat. It’s my stomach, alright? It’s… bloated. Just feels full of air, mostly. Been happening for a bit now. Honestly, I just want something to make it stop. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. I appreciate you being direct. Bloating can be quite uncomfortable, and I want to help you find some relief. “A bit now” is a little vague though – could you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, look, dates aren’t my thing, okay? My wife… she handled all that. It’s been… months, I guess? Maybe six? Something like that. It comes and goes, but it's been more lately. It's not like it's crippling, but it's annoying. Really annoying. Does it matter exactly when it started?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Kristofik, don't worry about precise dates. “Months” is helpful. And yes, knowing roughly when it started can help me narrow down potential causes. You said it comes and goes, and it’s been more frequent lately. Can you describe what triggers it, if anything?
PATIENT: Triggers? I don't know. I eat normal stuff. Burgers, fries… you know. I haven't changed my diet or anything. Honestly, I think it just happens. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes not. It's random. Look, I work hard, I don’t have time to be analyzing every single thing I put in my mouth. It's probably just… gas. Can’t you give me something for gas?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. It sounds very bothersome. While it could be simple gas, it’s important to rule out other possibilities, even if it seems unlikely. When you say “normal stuff,” could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, are you seriously asking me what I eat? I told you, normal food! Okay, fine. Breakfast is usually a coffee and maybe a pastry if I’m feeling it. Lunch is a burger and fries, usually from that place down the street. Dinner… sometimes I cook, sometimes I order takeout. Pizza, maybe. Or a steak. I don’t know! It’s not rocket science. I’m a pile driver operator, not a nutritionist. Are we getting anywhere with this or what?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel repetitive, Mr. Kristofik. I'm just trying to gather enough information to understand what might be going on. Knowing what you typically eat helps me understand if there might be something contributing to your bloating. Okay, so coffee, pastries, burgers, fries, pizza, steak… That's helpful. Do you notice any specific foods that seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Like I said, it's random. Sometimes a burger doesn't bother me, sometimes it feels like a balloon is inflating in my stomach. It's frustrating! I just want it to stop. Maybe it's the coffee? I drink a lot of coffee. But I need the coffee to get through the day. Are you going to tell me to stop drinking coffee? Because that’s not going to happen.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I’m not going to tell you to stop drinking coffee. It sounds like you’ve already considered that might be a factor. Okay, so it’s been happening for about six months, it’s random, doesn’t seem linked to any specific foods, and it’s not consistently related to coffee. Besides the bloating, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that's just from the job. I lift heavy stuff all day. No pain, no… nothing else. Just the bloating. And it’s embarrassing, alright? I don't want to be… gassy… at work. Is that good enough? Can we just get to the part where you give me something to take? I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Kristofik. It’s good you’ve mentioned the fatigue, even if it’s likely related to your work. No pain or other symptoms is helpful to know. Before I consider a medication, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for anything unusual. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I got things to do. But if it's going to take long, I'm warning you now. I'm not a fan of doctors poking around.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on the examination table, that would be great. I’ll just listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. It shouldn’t take more than a couple of minutes. Okay, everything sounds normal so far. No unusual sounds or tenderness. Your abdomen feels soft. Now, can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Done. Can we just… get this over with now? This is a waste of my time. I feel fine, I told you. It’s just bloating. It'll probably go away on its own. Look, I'm a busy guy. Just give me something for the gas, alright? Something strong.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I appreciate your patience. However, given that this has been going on for six months, and without knowing the cause, I’m hesitant to just prescribe something without further investigation. While a simple gas medication might provide temporary relief, it won't address the underlying issue. It could be something as simple as a dietary adjustment, but it could also be something more serious, like Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or even a mild blockage. To rule out anything more concerning, I’d like to order a simple blood test and a stool test. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Blood test? Stool test? Are you kidding me? Look, Doc, I'm not paying for a bunch of tests for something that's just gas. I work hard for my money, I don't have time for this. You want to know what's going on? Give me something for the gas, and I'll be on my way. I don't need a diagnosis for being a little bloated. Honestly, this is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Kristofik. However, as your physician, I have a responsibility to ensure we’re not overlooking anything serious. I’m concerned about the duration of your symptoms. Given your strong opposition to testing, and your desire for immediate relief, I can offer you a trial of an over-the-counter medication for gas and bloating, such as simethicone. However, I strongly advise you that if your symptoms worsen, or don’t improve within two weeks, you must return for further evaluation. We may need to consider those tests then. Do you understand?
