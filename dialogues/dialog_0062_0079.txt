DOCTOR: Hi Courtnye, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, hi Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you too. Basically, I’ve been bruising a lot easier lately. It’s kinda scary, honestly. I'm on a blood thinner, so I figured I should get it checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good you're getting it checked out, and yes, being on a blood thinner definitely makes that something we want to look into. “Bruising a lot easier” – can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Sure. It's not like, from big falls or anything. I’ll bump into a table, or even just press a little too hard when I’m washing, and boom – big purple spot. And they seem to last longer than they used to, too. Like, a week or more sometimes. It's been going on for maybe a month now? I can't pinpoint the exact date, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Alright, a month of easier bruising and longer-lasting bruises...that's helpful to know. And you said it happens with very minor trauma, like bumping into things or even just normal pressure. Have you noticed the bruising in any specific areas more than others?
PATIENT: Hmm... Not really, no. It seems pretty random. I've got one on my leg right now, I think from just… sitting on the couch. And I had one on my arm a few days ago, don’t even remember how that happened! So, no, not a specific spot. It's all over.
DOCTOR: Okay, “all over” and with minimal recall of injury… Good. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. Just the usual, I guess. High blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. And… oh, I had my gallbladder out a few years ago. Other than that, I'm pretty healthy. Why do you ask? Is this normal with the blood thinner? I'm a little worried.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know about the high blood pressure and the gallbladder removal, thank you. And it is good you're asking about the blood thinner, it's definitely something we need to consider, but bruising can have lots of causes. It’s important to rule out other possibilities as well. Let me pull up your records…Okay, I see your blood pressure medication here. And the cholecystectomy in 2020. Have you had any other surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just those two things. I haven’t been sick or anything in ages, honestly. I'm usually pretty good about taking care of myself, eating right, you know. I just want to figure out what’s going on with the bruising. Is there a test you can do? I've got a family thing coming up, and I really don’t want to be covered in purple spots!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially with the family event coming up. Yes, absolutely, there are tests we can do. Before we order anything, let’s quickly go over a few more things to get a complete picture. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Is this going to take long? I've got an appointment later this afternoon… I'm trying to keep it brief if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, good. And I'll definitely try to be as efficient as possible. Just a few more questions, then we can do a quick physical exam and get some tests ordered. Now, do you take any other medications besides the blood pressure one?
PATIENT: No, just the blood pressure medication. Nothing else. I take it every morning, like the doctor told me. And I haven't changed the dosage or anything. Is the blood thinner causing this? I keep thinking about that. It just seems like a weird coincidence that it started happening after I started it.
DOCTOR: It's good you haven't changed anything with your medications, and it's completely reasonable to think the blood thinner could be involved. We will look into that. Now, just to be thorough, can you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm... Okay, well, my mom had high blood pressure too. And she had some problems with her heart later in life. My dad was pretty healthy, actually, lived to be 80. No bleeding problems that I know of on either side, honestly. Not that we talked about much, if I’m being honest. We weren’t a big family for sharing medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. High blood pressure on your mother's side. And no known bleeding disorders in the family. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Um... Just sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing crazy. I definitely don’t drink every day. And I don't smoke. Does that matter? Is there something I shouldn’t be doing?
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional wine, no smoking, that's good to know. And yes, lifestyle factors can play a role, but it doesn't sound like those are major contributors here. Okay, Courtnye, I think we have enough information for now. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better look at the bruising and check for any other signs. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Let's get it over with. I just want to know what’s going on. Hopefully, it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could just hop up on the table here, that would be great. I'm going to start by just listening to your heart and lungs, then I’ll take a look at the bruising more closely. I'll also feel your abdomen and check your extremities. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Alright. Just let me know if anything hurts. I'm a little tender all over, to be honest, but I'm not sure why. Let’s get this done.
DOCTOR: Okay. Deep breaths in… and out… Everything sounds clear. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little sensitive, maybe, but not actual pain. It just feels… bruised. Is it normal to feel bruised even when you haven't bumped into anything?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. It’s not typical, which is why we're investigating. And any pain or tenderness in your legs?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… the purple spots, obviously. They feel a little warm, maybe? Like a sunburn, but not itchy. See? Like this one. It just showed up out of nowhere. It's weird. I don't even remember hitting my leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. This is a fairly substantial bruise, and it does look a little different than a typical bump bruise. The color suggests it’s a few days old. Now, let's take a look at your arms. I do see several other bruises on your forearms, varying in size and color. They appear to be mostly on the inner side of your forearms. No noticeable swelling or warmth beyond the bruising. The skin feels normal overall. Okay, that’s enough for the physical exam for now. Let’s get some labs ordered.
PATIENT: Okay. What kind of labs? And how long will it take to get the results? I really need to know what's going on soon, with my family thing coming up.
DOCTOR: I'm going to order a complete blood count to check your platelet count and look for any other abnormalities in your blood cells. We’ll also do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes. And I'll add a coagulation panel – that will give us a detailed look at how well your blood is clotting. It usually takes about 24-48 hours to get the results back, sometimes a little longer depending on the lab. I'll have the nurse call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if you notice any new or excessive bleeding – like nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in your stool – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. CBC, BMP, and that clotting thing. And watch out for bleeding. Okay. Will the results tell me if it’s definitely the blood thinner? Or if it’s something else? I'm just really worried, honestly. Is it possible it's something serious?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, and it's good you're asking. The labs will give us a lot of information. The CBC will tell us if your platelet count is low – platelets are essential for clotting, so a low count can cause bruising and bleeding. The coagulation panel will assess how well your blood is forming clots. If your blood thinner is the cause, we’ll likely see abnormalities in the coagulation panel. However, bruising can also be caused by other things, like vitamin deficiencies, liver problems, or even certain medications. That's why it's important to rule out those possibilities as well. We’ll interpret the results together, and if needed, I’ll refer you to a hematologist – a specialist in blood disorders – for further evaluation. I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but it’s important to be thorough. We’ll get the answers we need, and we'll take it from there. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Platelets, clotting, and maybe a specialist if needed. Okay. So, what do I do now? Do I need to fast for any of these tests? And… where do I go to get them done? I just want to get this over with and know what's going on. Is there anything I should do in the meantime, besides watch for bleeding? Like, any creams or anything?
