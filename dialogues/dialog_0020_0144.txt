DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Beinborn. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Dr. Beinborn, is it? Well, honestly? Curiosity, mostly. I just... wanted to see what a young doctor these days is like. Not that my doctor was bad, heavens no. Just… times change, you know? I suppose I haven't really needed anything specific, but figured I'd use my Medicare while I could. It's a lovely little clinic you have here, very…rural.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. Preventative care is excellent, and a check-up is always a good idea. And you’re right, things do change. It is a lovely area here, isn't it?
PATIENT: Oh, it is. Quiet, though. Too quiet for some, perhaps. I used to live in the city, you know. A much busier place. Lots of…well, lots of everything. Not that I'm complaining now, of course. A body gets tired of all that hustle and bustle. Now, what were we talking about? My…check-up, was it? Is that what young people call it these days? A check-up?
DOCTOR: Yes, a check-up is perfect. We can certainly do a full assessment. To start, could you tell me a little bit about any health concerns you do have?
PATIENT: Hmm. Concerns… well, aches and pains, naturally. At my age, one expects them, doesn't one? My knees bother me sometimes, especially when the weather changes. And my back… oh, don’t even ask about my back. I used to be very active, you see. A lot of…bending and lifting, in my line of work. Surgical tech, you know. Though it was a long time ago now. I can’t really remember all the details… it’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. Do you need me to be more specific? It’s just… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Calvery. Knee and back pain, especially with weather changes and a history of surgical tech work. That gives me a good starting point. Just to be thorough, are these pains constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, they come and go. Mostly go, thankfully! There are days I feel…well, not young, but certainly not crippled. And then there are days… well, let's just say I move a little slower on those days. The weather does seem to play a part, though. Damp weather is the worst. Makes everything ache. And sometimes, if I overdo it… gardening, mostly. I like to keep busy, you see. Can’t just sit around, can I? It’s not good for the soul. Now, are you going to poke and prod me now? I hope not too much!
DOCTOR: We will do a bit of a physical exam, Ms. Calvery, but I'll be gentle. It helps me get a better understanding of what’s going on. First, let's just talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think...Chronic conditions... My… first husband, bless his soul, he had something. Heart, I think? Or was it the lungs? It was a long time ago, and I wasn't much good with medical things even then, always leaving it to the doctors. I think I was told I had slightly high blood pressure once, but it wasn't anything serious. They told me to watch my salt intake. Which I mostly do. Though a little soy sauce never hurt anyone, now did it? Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. I go to the doctor when something hurts, not to prevent things. Is that bad? I’m probably a terrible patient.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Calvery. Many people are the same way. We’ll take things at your pace. So, just to clarify, no specific chronic conditions diagnosed in you?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I mean, I've had the usual…colds, flu, a bit of arthritis in my hands. But nothing a good cup of tea and a lie-down couldn’t fix. Oh! And I broke my wrist once, a long time ago. Fell down the stairs, silly thing. But it healed perfectly well. Honestly, I think I'm quite resilient, for an old woman. Now, are we getting anywhere with this? Or are we just talking about my life story? I’m probably boring you to tears.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Calvery. Your history is very helpful. No major illnesses, a broken wrist that healed well… That’s all good to know. Let's move onto medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think...well, I take a little something for my knees now and then, when they’re really acting up. Ibuprofen, I think it is. The over-the-counter kind. And I try to take a vitamin D supplement, especially in the winter. It’s awfully dark here, you know. And…oh! A little fish oil, for my heart. I read somewhere it was good for you. But that’s about it, really. Nothing fancy. I don’t believe in loading up on pills. Makes me feel sluggish. Now, do you think I should be taking more? My neighbor, Martha, she takes a whole handful every morning! Says it keeps her young. But I think she’s just… optimistic.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen as needed, vitamin D and fish oil. That’s good to know. We can discuss whether those are appropriate for you long-term, or if there are other options to consider. Just one more question about your medical history, and then we'll move to a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… oh, heavens, no. I used to eat everything! Back in my day, we didn't worry about allergies. Maybe I’m a little sensitive to shellfish, now that I think about it. My lips get a bit tingly if I eat too much shrimp. But it's not serious. I just avoid it mostly. And… I think I sneezed a lot around cats when I was a child. But I haven’t been around many cats lately. Honestly, I can’t really remember. It was a long time ago! Are we almost done with the questions now? I’m starting to feel a bit… interrogated. Not that I’m complaining, dear. You’re a very nice young woman.
DOCTOR: Almost finished with the questions, Ms. Calvery. Just a few more quick things, and then we can do a brief physical exam. Shellfish sensitivity, slight sneezing around cats. Good to know. Have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. And my appendix, when I was just a girl. And… let me think… Oh! A hysterectomy. That was… a long time ago too. I don't really like to think about it. It was all a bit… unpleasant. Honestly, I've had enough poking and prodding for one lifetime. Are you going to poke now? I really hope not too much. I’m a bit sensitive, you see. Especially around the tummy. Now, is there anything I can ask you? I mean, you seem very competent, but… are you getting enough sleep? You young people work so hard!
DOCTOR: We'll keep the exam brief and gentle, Ms. Calvery, I promise. And thank you for asking, I am getting enough sleep. You are very thoughtful. Alright, before we move onto the physical exam, could you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… Well, my mother lived to be a very old age, nearly ninety. She died peacefully in her sleep. My father… he had something with his heart, I think. High blood pressure too. Lots of heart problems on his side of the family. My brother… he had diabetes, unfortunately. And my sister… she had arthritis, very bad. So, lots of heart trouble, diabetes, and arthritis. Seems to run in the family, doesn’t it? Honestly, I’m surprised I’m still standing! Now, is that enough family history for you? Or do you need me to dig up any more skeletons? I’m starting to feel like a detective novel. Now, can we please get this poking and prodding over with? I’m getting nervous.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Calvery. A family history of heart problems, diabetes, and arthritis. That gives me a better understanding of your risk factors. Alright, let's proceed with a quick physical exam. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, a check of your blood pressure, and a quick look at your tummy. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. But be gentle, dear. Very gentle. And don’t be surprised if I flinch. I’m a bit sensitive, you see. Now, get it over with quickly, please. My nerves are starting to get the better of me. I’m trusting you, young lady. Don’t let me down. And tell me if you find anything alarming, will you? I don’t want any surprises. Now, hurry up!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. I will be as gentle as possible. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… Very good. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s likely benign, but we'll want to monitor it. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Now, let's check your blood pressure. 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm just going to gently palpate your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a bit tender there, on the left side. Not terribly painful, but… noticeable. I get a bit of cramping sometimes, especially after I eat something heavy. Could be gas, I suppose. I do eat a lot of beans! Honestly, I don’t know why I bother. Now, is that all the poking and prodding? My tummy is starting to rumble. And I think I’m starting to sweat. This is all very stressful, you know. Now, tell me what you found. Don’t sugarcoat it, dear. I can handle the truth. Now, hurry up! I’m getting impatient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. Your heart sounds are regular with a slight murmur, lungs are clear, and your blood pressure is a little elevated. Your abdomen is tender to palpation on the left side, which could be related to digestive issues. Considering your history and the exam findings, I'm not overly concerned at this moment, but I do want to investigate further. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order a few basic blood tests – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol. I also recommend a stool test to rule out any infection or inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests, stool tests… honestly, it never ends, does it? But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Just… try to make it as painless as possible, dear. I don't like needles. And I certainly don't want to think about… that test. Honestly, I'm starting to feel like a science experiment. Now, where do I go to get these tests done? And how long will it take? I have a gardening club meeting on Thursday. I don’t want to miss that. Now, hurry up! My patience is wearing thin.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. I understand your concerns. The blood tests will only require a small sample of blood, and the phlebotomist will be very gentle. As for the stool test, there are collection kits available, and the process is relatively simple. Here is the lab requisition form. You can go to the clinic lab, located just down the hall. They're open Monday through Friday, from 8 AM to 5 PM. The results should be available in about a week. Once I have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat a healthy diet, staying active, and managing your stress levels. And don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: A week? A whole week? Honestly, these things take forever, don’t they? Alright, alright. I’ll go get these tests done. But I expect you to call me as soon as the results are in. No dilly-dallying, you hear? Now, as for my gardening club meeting… I hope I don’t miss it. I’m the president, you know. It’s very important. Now… I think that’s all. Unless… do you think I should be taking any vitamins? Martha, my neighbor, she swears by them. But I’m a bit skeptical. Honestly, I’m starting to feel overwhelmed. Now, can I go now? I need to rest. This has been very stressful, you know. Now, hurry up! I’m getting tired.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Calvery. You’ve been very brave today. As for vitamins, it’s a bit of a complex topic. Vitamin D can be beneficial, especially if you’re not getting enough sun exposure. But it's best to discuss it further once we have your lab results. In the meantime, don’t worry about it. Just focus on getting those tests done and resting up. Here’s a copy of your lab request and a summary of our conversation. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to call. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Calvery. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
