DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, it's good to meet you too. I think... I'm here about getting surgery? For, you know, weight loss. My wife helped set it all up, honestly. I don’t really remember all the details. It’s… a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be overwhelming navigating these processes. No need to worry about recalling everything at once. We’ll take our time. So, you’re interested in exploring weight loss surgery options. To start, could you tell me a bit about your journey with your weight?
PATIENT: Um… well, I’ve always been a bigger guy, I guess. Growing up… it was just kind of how I was built. But it’s gotten worse over the years, especially after I got married. My wife is a fantastic cook, and… well, I enjoy eating. I don't really know why it’s gotten so bad, just that it has. It makes things… harder, you know? Walking around, keeping up with my kids… things like that.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Kochubey. It's very common for weight to fluctuate throughout life, and it sounds like it’s impacting your quality of life, which is certainly something we want to address. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me approximately how much weight have you gained in recent years?
PATIENT: Recent years… hmm. That’s a good question. I honestly don’t know the exact number. Maybe… 50, 60 pounds? It feels like a lot, but I haven’t weighed myself regularly in ages. My wife has a scale, but I try not to look. It’s… discouraging. Is that okay? I’m not very good with numbers, sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. Numbers aren’t everything, and I understand it can be difficult to focus on them. An approximate is perfectly sufficient. To help me understand your overall health picture, could you tell me about any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… let me think. I had… high blood pressure, I think? The doctor told me a while ago. I'm taking pills for it. And… something with my cholesterol? My wife handles all the appointments and medication, so I don't really remember the details. I'm sorry. Nothing else, I don’t think. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time, honestly. Except for the check-up before this, of course.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Kochubey. It’s common for patients to rely on family members for managing their healthcare. It’s helpful to know you're currently being treated for high blood pressure and have been told about elevated cholesterol. Do you happen to know the names of the medications you are taking for your blood pressure and cholesterol?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I really don't. They’re… little white pills, mostly. And some bigger orange ones. I take them every morning with breakfast. I know it’s not very helpful, but I promise I can ask my wife when I get home. She keeps everything organized. I’m really bad at remembering things like that. Is that okay? I feel bad not knowing.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. Medication details are important, and it’s very helpful to know your wife can provide that information. We can certainly obtain those details from her later. Now, are you currently experiencing any other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, joint pain, or fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… Shortness of breath sometimes, especially when I’m walking uphill. And my joints… they ache a lot, especially my knees. I figured it was just from carrying the weight around. And… yeah, I’m tired a lot. Really tired. It’s hard to get motivated to do anything, even just playing with my kids. Does that make sense? I just feel… worn out.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Kochubey. Fatigue, shortness of breath, and joint pain can certainly be associated with excess weight and are important symptoms to note. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of diabetes, heart disease, or obesity?
PATIENT: My dad… he had heart problems, I think? He had a heart attack when he was pretty young. And… my grandma, on my mom’s side, she had diabetes. She was always tired and sick. That’s about all I know, honestly. My family doesn’t really talk about health stuff much. It’s… not really a topic. Is that okay? I’m trying to remember everything, but it’s hard.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. Knowing about a family history of heart disease and diabetes is helpful. It doesn’t mean you’ll necessarily develop those conditions, but it’s good information to have. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Not very active, I’m afraid. I work in retail, so I’m on my feet a bit, but mostly just walking around the store. I don't really exercise. I used to play soccer when I was younger, but… that was a long time ago. And I love to eat. Like, really love to eat. My wife is a fantastic cook, and… well, it’s hard to resist. I know it’s not very healthy, but it's hard to change habits.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kochubey. It’s often challenging to make significant lifestyle changes. It's good to be honest about this, and it’s helpful to understand your current habits. Before we move on to a physical examination, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little sniffles when pollen is bad in the spring, but that’s about it. No serious allergies, no. My wife would definitely know if I was allergic to something, she’s always careful about what I eat. She worries about me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies are helpful. Now, Mr. Kochubey, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and palpating your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That’s… that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just… I hope it’s not too bad. I get a little anxious about doctor stuff. Just let me know if it's going to hurt.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kochubey. I will explain everything as I go, and we will go at your pace. I'll let you know if anything will be uncomfortable. Your heart sounds regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily cause for immediate concern, but we’ll want to monitor it. Your lungs are clear, with normal breath sounds. Your blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg, and your pulse is 88 beats per minute. This blood pressure is elevated and consistent with hypertension. Your abdomen is soft, but I can feel some fullness. There's no tenderness to palpation. I can also feel some enlargement of the liver and spleen. This could be related to your weight and potentially some underlying fatty liver disease. Alright, Mr. Kochubey. That completes the physical examination. Based on your history and this examination, we have several findings we need to address – elevated blood pressure, potential fatty liver disease, and some signs consistent with metabolic syndrome. We will need to order some lab work to get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out other potential causes. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Lab work… yeah, okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. It sounds… serious, though. Is it really that bad? I just… I want to feel better, you know? I want to be able to play with my kids without getting tired all the time. I trust you, Doctor. Just tell me what needs to be done.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed, Mr. Kochubey, and it's admirable that you’re seeking help. While we do have some findings that need attention, it doesn't necessarily mean it's dire. The good news is that many of these conditions are manageable with lifestyle modifications and, if necessary, medication. The lab work will give us a clearer picture of your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, liver function, and kidney function. We’ll also check for any signs of diabetes. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, a fasting blood glucose, and a liver function test. We’ll also need a urinalysis to check your kidney function. Would you be comfortable providing a urine sample today?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. I can do that. A urine sample… easy enough. Where do I go? And… how long will it take to get the results? My wife is going to want to know. She’s really been worried about me. Do you think… do you think surgery is still a possibility?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kochubey. The lab will be just down the hall to your left. They will provide you with a cup and instructions. It should only take a few minutes. Regarding the results, it typically takes about 3-5 business days for the lab to process everything and send them to me. I will review them thoroughly and then schedule a follow-up appointment with you to discuss them in detail. As for the possibility of surgery, it’s still a possibility, but it's important that we fully evaluate your overall health first. The lab results will help us determine if you are a suitable candidate and what type of surgery would be most appropriate. We want to ensure your safety and maximize your chances of a successful outcome. In the meantime, I would recommend starting to make some small lifestyle changes, such as incorporating more fruits and vegetables into your diet and trying to get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. Even small changes can make a big difference. Would you be open to discussing some resources that can help with this?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Resources would be good. I… I really want to do this. For my kids, you know? I want to be able to keep up with them. My wife will be happy to hear that you’re suggesting something. She’s always trying to get me to eat healthier. Maybe… maybe this time I’ll actually listen. So, what happens next? Should I go give the urine sample now?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Kochubey. It’s wonderful that your wife is supportive, and your willingness to make changes is a great first step. Yes, please go ahead and provide the urine sample now. After that, the nurse will take your vital signs again. Once that’s done, we can discuss some resources for diet and exercise. I can also provide you with a referral to a registered dietitian who can help you create a personalized meal plan. I also have some pamphlets on healthy eating and exercise that I can give you. There are also some excellent online resources, such as the American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health websites. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything for now. Just the urine sample and then the nurse, right? Thank you, Doctor. For everything. I really appreciate it. I guess I’ll see you in a few days when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I’m glad I could help. Yes, just the urine sample and then a quick check-in with the nurse. I look forward to seeing you in a few days to discuss the results. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
