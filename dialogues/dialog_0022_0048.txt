DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Well, it’s about my head. Been a bit… fuzzy lately. Not all the time, mind you. Happens in spells. My wife, Srey, she says I ask the same questions twice, sometimes three times in an hour. It’s… annoying, to be honest. Not for her, of course, but it's a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Fuzzy” and repeating questions. That's definitely something we should look into. When did this start, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It wasn’t sudden, like a switch flipped. More… gradual. I'd say, oh, maybe six months ago? It started with just forgetting where I put things. Keys, glasses, the remote. Usual old man stuff, really. But then it started being… what was I saying? Oh yes, the questions. About four months ago, Srey pointed it out. Said I asked her if our grandson had eaten already three times before lunch. Honestly, it's a little embarrassing. I used to have a very good memory for numbers, with my tile work, you see. Precise measurements are everything.
DOCTOR: Right, so starting with misplacing things about six months ago, then the repeated questions around four months ago. And you do tile work, which requires good attention to detail and memory for measurements. That's helpful information. Besides the memory issues and the “fuzziness”, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… No, not really. I get tired quicker, maybe. But I'm sixty-six years old! That's to be expected. Srey keeps telling me to slow down, but a man’s gotta work, you know? Keeps me busy. I haven’t fallen or anything. No trouble with my vision. No headaches. Just… this. This frustrating little… blankness. It’s not constant, that's the thing. Some days I'm perfectly fine. Other days… well, other days Srey has to practically hold my hand to remember what day it is. It’s not dementia, is it? Because my aunt had that, and it wasn’t pretty.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue is the only other thing you’ve noticed, and it’s intermittent. No falls, no vision changes, no headaches. You're understandably concerned about dementia, given your aunt's experience. We'll certainly explore that possibility, but it’s important not to jump to conclusions. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… let’s see. High blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a little pill for that, every morning. And my knees are bad, arthritis, from all the kneeling on the job. I get shots for that sometimes, when they really bother me. Oh, and I had my gallbladder taken out, must be twenty years ago now. Other than that… I think that’s it. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. Worked hard all my life, never smoked, never much of a drinker. Srey always said I was too stubborn to let anything ail me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure managed with medication, arthritis in your knees, and a gallbladder removal twenty years ago. That’s helpful. And you have a history of being generally healthy. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Srey handles most of that paperwork. She keeps the little bottles organized. I think… it's Lisinopril? Yes, Lisinopril. That's it. Small white pill. Take one every morning with my coffee. And I've been taking it for, oh, must be ten years now, maybe a bit longer. It does the trick, keeps the doctor happy. I get my blood checked regularly, you know. I’m not completely negligent about my health.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, ten years, regular bloodwork. That’s good. And you said you get shots for your knees when they flare up. Are you currently taking any other medications, over-the-counter or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing else regularly. Sometimes I take Tylenol for the pain in my knees if the shots haven’t kicked in yet. But that's it. Srey keeps telling me to take glucosamine and chondroitin, says it's good for the joints. But I don’t believe in those things, all fancy marketing. I'm a practical man. If it's not a proper doctor's prescription, I don’t bother. Honestly, all those supplements… a waste of money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, just Tylenol as needed for knee pain, no regular supplements. And you're skeptical about supplements, which is perfectly fine. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Srey always checks before she gives me anything new, though. She's very careful. I think I might be a little sensitive to shellfish, maybe? I get a bit of a stomach ache if I eat too much shrimp, but it’s not a proper allergy, more like… indigestion. I haven't eaten shrimp in years, to be safe. Nothing serious, really. Nothing that requires an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just potential mild sensitivity to shellfish. That's good to know. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, like I said, my aunt had dementia. That's the big one. Her memory just… faded away. Very sad. My father had diabetes, type 2, I think. He lost a leg because of it, eventually. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, like me, and died of a stroke when she was old. Other than that… not much. A few heart problems here and there, but nothing major. Most of my family were just… sturdy folk. Worked hard, lived long lives. I don't know if any of that's relevant. It's a big family, you know. Hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, dementia in your aunt, type 2 diabetes and stroke in your mother, and generally a family history of being “sturdy folk.” That's helpful information. Finally, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Srey wouldn't allow it, even when we were courting. And I'm not much of a drinker. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe on special occasions. That's it. Definitely no drugs. I'm a tile setter, not a… a layabout. I need a clear head for my work, you know? Precise cuts, level floors… can't be doing that if you're… I work hard, I come home, I eat dinner with Srey, and I go to bed. Simple life. A good life.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, no recreational drugs. A very healthy lifestyle overall. Thank you, Mr. Lason. That gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just try to be gentle with my knees, alright? They've seen a lot of work.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible. Alright, let's start with your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. That’s within normal limits, considering your blood pressure medication. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I’m going to check your neurological function now, which will involve some simple tests of your memory and coordination. Can you tell me your date of birth?
PATIENT: August 14th, 1959. I remember everything. My wife always said I have a good memory for numbers. It's useful in my trade, you see. A good tile job is all about precision.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Go ahead. Three words? Alright. Say them, doctor. I’m ready. Don’t go making them too difficult now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason, I’m going to ask you to do something else for a moment, then I’ll ask you to recall those three words. Now, I’d like you to please close your eyes and follow my finger with your eyes only. No moving your head.
PATIENT: Alright. Closed. And I'm following your finger. Slowly now, doctor. I don't want to get dizzy. This tile work requires good balance, you know. I've got to be steady on my feet.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. Now, can you tell me the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Three words… It was… apple… something… and… oh dear. That's… difficult. It's right on the tip of my tongue! Apple… table… no, that’s not right. And… something shiny… Was it penny? Yes! Apple, table… and penny. I think. Are those correct? I’m usually very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason, you remembered two out of three correctly, which is… within normal limits, but we’ll keep that in mind. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. That's normal. Finally, I'd like to take a look at your feet and knees. Your feet show some mild age-related changes, but no signs of neuropathy. Your knees have some crepitus and mild swelling, consistent with arthritis. You have full range of motion, although it's slightly uncomfortable. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Based on your history and this exam, the main concerns are your recent memory issues and fatigue. It’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but we need to investigate further. I recommend a few blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. And I’d also like to order a brain scan, such as an MRI, to get a better look at your brain structure and rule out any other possible causes of your memory problems. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood tests and a scan… That sounds… thorough. I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. Srey always said I worry too much. But… a scan sounds expensive. And I don't want to be put on any of those strong medications, if you know what I mean. I've heard they can make you… foggy. But if it’s necessary… then alright. Do what you think is best, doctor. Just… explain everything carefully. And tell me how much it’s going to cost. My wife handles the finances, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. We’ll proceed cautiously and I will explain everything thoroughly. The blood tests are relatively inexpensive, and covered by Medicare, so there should be minimal out-of-pocket cost for those. The MRI is more expensive, but we can submit it to Medicare and see what they cover. I'll have the billing department contact your wife to discuss the potential costs and payment options before proceeding. As for medications, we're not at that point yet. The goal right now is to figure out what’s causing your memory problems. If we find something that requires medication, we’ll discuss all the potential risks and benefits before making any decisions. There are many different types of medications, and we’ll choose one that's appropriate for your situation. In the meantime, I'm going to order those blood tests and the MRI. I'll also give you a referral to a neurologist, a specialist in brain and nerve disorders, for a second opinion. Would you like me to schedule that appointment for you, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: A neurologist… That sounds serious. But alright, if you think it's best. Yes, please, schedule the appointment for me. I’m not very good at navigating all that paperwork. And the less I have to worry about, the better. Just… make sure it’s a good one. Srey always researches everything before we go to a new doctor. You’re a good doctor, aren't you? You seem very… thorough. That’s important.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. I appreciate that. I assure you, I will do my best to find out what's going on and get you the best possible care. I'll schedule an appointment with Dr. Eleanor Vance – she’s a highly respected neurologist here in town. Her office will contact you to confirm the date and time. To summarize, we’ve ordered blood tests, scheduled an MRI, and booked an appointment with Dr. Vance. I'll have the results of the blood tests sent to you and Dr. Vance once they are available. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… try not to rush things, alright? I don't want to be put on any unnecessary tests or medications. And please… keep Srey informed. She worries about me, you see. She’s the one who remembers everything, anyway. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Lason. We will proceed at a pace that you're comfortable with, and I will keep your wife fully informed every step of the way. I understand her concerns, and I’ll be happy to speak with her directly if she prefers. Here’s a printout with all the information about the tests and appointments, as well as my contact information. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Lason. I look forward to seeing you again soon. Take care, and try not to worry too much.
