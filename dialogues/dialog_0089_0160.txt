DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I wish I didn’t have to be here. It’s just… I’m tired. Really tired. And it’s not the normal old-lady tired, you know? It's…different. And I’ve been…well, it’s embarrassing, but I’ve been eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to know something isn’t right.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you came in to get this checked out, even if it feels a bit embarrassing to talk about. “Different tired” and eating dirt… those are definitely things we need to explore. Let's start with the tiredness. When did you first start noticing it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It started… probably six months ago, maybe a little longer. It just crept up on me, you know? At first, I just thought I was getting older. But it's not going away. It's gotten worse, actually. I used to be able to get everything done around the house, garden, you name it. Now… I nap almost every afternoon. And it doesn't even help! Honestly, it's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of progressive fatigue… that’s helpful. And it’s impacting your daily activities, even with naps. Do you feel weak, or is it more like just… overwhelming sleepiness?
PATIENT: Weak? No, not exactly weak. It’s… like my batteries are just draining too fast. I can do things, but then I just… crash. And it’s not a normal crash, either. It feels like… everything is heavy. Moving is just… effortful. And I get these headaches, too. Dull ones, mostly, but they're always there, lurking in the background. It's just… draining, Doctor. Really draining.
DOCTOR: Okay, "batteries draining," feeling heavy, and constant dull headaches… I’m writing all of this down. And you mentioned eating dirt. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Ugh. Don’t make me. It’s… shameful. I grew up on a farm, you see? And sometimes… sometimes I just… crave it. The red clay, mostly. It’s silly, I know. I try not to, but… it feels good in my mouth. Like something’s missing. And when I don't have it… I just feel… off. It started small, just a little nibble here and there. Now, it’s… I don't know, a couple of spoonfuls a week? It’s awful. Don’t judge me.
DOCTOR: I absolutely don’t judge you, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s important to be honest about everything, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. This is actually very important information. Craving dirt – specifically red clay – can be a sign of something called pica, which can sometimes be related to nutritional deficiencies. Now, let’s get a little more detail about the tiredness and headaches. Do they come on at a certain time of day, or after specific activities?
PATIENT: Oh, good, you’ve heard of it. I thought I was losing my mind. And no, it doesn’t really come at a specific time. It just… builds. I might feel okay in the morning, but by afternoon… that’s when it hits. And after I've been doing something – even something simple like weeding the garden – it gets worse, faster. And the headaches… they're pretty constant, like I said. Just a dull ache. Sometimes they feel a bit better after a nap, but they never really go away completely. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay. Progressive fatigue, headaches, cravings for red clay… This is giving me a few ideas. Now, I’m going to ask you some general health questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite’s been dreadful. I used to enjoy cooking, a good hearty meal, but now… food just doesn’t appeal. I mostly pick at things. And yes, I’ve lost weight. Not a huge amount, but enough that my clothes feel a bit loose. Probably ten or fifteen pounds, I’d say. It’s been gradual, over the last few months, along with the tiredness. And honestly, I haven't even bothered going to the doctor about it. What's the point? They always tell you to eat more vegetables and get more exercise. I am trying, but it just doesn't seem to help.
DOCTOR: Okay, loss of appetite and weight loss alongside the other symptoms. That’s concerning. Now, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. My hands and feet get cold easily. Even in the summer. And I’ve been more… irritable, I suppose. My neighbor, bless her heart, keeps offering to help with the gardening, but sometimes I just snap at her. I feel awful afterward, but… I just don’t have the patience I used to. It’s not like me at all. I used to be so calm and even-tempered. Honestly, everything just feels… harder now.
DOCTOR: Okay. Cold hands and feet, irritability… I’m noting all of this. Now, do you have any history of medical problems – anything you’ve been diagnosed with or treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, when I was in my forties. And I’ve always had a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s usually well-controlled with medication. Just a small dose, nothing major. Other than that… not really. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life. Until… well, until recently. I had a bad cold last winter, though. A really bad one. Lasted for weeks. But that’s it, really. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. Gallbladder removal, controlled high blood pressure. And a bad cold last winter. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day for my blood pressure. And that's it. Just the one little pill. I don't like taking medications if I can avoid it. They always have side effects, you know? Honestly, I thought I could manage on my own. I didn't want to bother the doctor with a little tiredness. Now, look where I am.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lisinopril 10mg daily. And you’ve been hesitant to seek medical attention. I appreciate you being honest about that. Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh, I’m going to do a quick physical exam now. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. It will just take a few minutes. Also, I’d like to draw some blood to check your iron levels, complete blood count, and kidney function. That will help us figure out what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Blood tests. I really don't like needles. But… I suppose if you think it's necessary. Just… try to be quick, please. And don't tell me what you're looking for. I don't want to worry myself unnecessarily. Just tell me the results, when you have them. I just want to feel normal again. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. And I will just let you know the results, no unnecessary details. Okay, everything seems normal so far, but the blood tests will give us a clearer picture. I’m going to ask the nurse to draw a few vials of blood now. Afterwards, we'll sit and talk about next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. And please, don’t keep me waiting too long for the results. I have things to do, you know? I just want to get to the bottom of this and get back to my life. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. I’ll make sure the lab prioritizes your samples, and I'll review the results as soon as they're available. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. In the meantime, is there anything else you'd like to tell me, or any questions you have?
PATIENT: No. I think I've said everything. Honestly, I'm just tired of talking about it. And I’m really starting to feel anxious now, thinking about all the things that could be wrong. Just… please hurry. I'd just like to get this over with. And please, don’t tell me anything scary. Just give me the results. I can handle it, whatever it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I won't share anything until I have the results, and I’ll be as clear and concise as possible. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. She should be right in. In the meantime, try to take some deep breaths and relax. It’s okay to feel anxious, and we’ll get to the bottom of this together.
