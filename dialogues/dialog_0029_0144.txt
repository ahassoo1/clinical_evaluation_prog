DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I’m Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, honestly? Curiosity, mostly. I just…thought I should probably get a check-up. It’s been a while, and my daughter kept nagging me. She worries too much, that one. Though, I can’t really remember the last time I was here. Everything’s a bit fuzzy these days, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you're thinking about your health, and it’s very common for things to slip our minds as we get older. We’ll get everything checked out. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Do you have any current medical problems – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… My husband, God rest his soul, he had…something with his heart, I believe. But me? Not that I recall. The doctors always fussed over him more. I was always perfectly healthy, or so they said. High blood pressure…maybe? I took some pills for a while, years ago, but I don’t even remember why. It all blends together, you know? I'm on Medicare now, of course, but that's about all I can recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, Medicare is helpful. And we can definitely look into those past medications. Let’s try to narrow it down. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything specifically – arthritis, thyroid problems, asthma, anything at all?
PATIENT: Hmm…arthritis, now there’s a thought. My hands do ache sometimes, especially in the mornings. But my mother’s hands were always like that, so I figured it just runs in the family. I don’t think a doctor ever told me I had arthritis, though. As for the rest…no, I can’t really think of anything. I was a surgical tech for a long time, always busy, didn't have much time for being sick, you know? Mostly just tired. Is that a diagnosis? Being tired all the time?
DOCTOR: Fatigue can certainly be a symptom of many things, Ms. Calvery. We'll explore that. And being a surgical tech, that's a physically demanding job! Okay, let’s move on to past surgeries. Have you had any operations or procedures done in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… I assisted in so many surgeries, it's hard to remember which ones were on me. I think… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… maybe my appendix? It was all so very routine, I barely remember the details. They put you to sleep, and then you wake up. That’s about all I know. It was before your time, I'm sure. Everything was different back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder and possible appendix removal. We'll verify that with the records. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother, she lived to be almost ninety, but she had… what was it? Something with her nerves, I think. She was always shaky. And my father… he died young, from… well, I don’t really know. Just said it was his heart. Nobody talked much about it. It wasn't polite, you know? And my brother... he had high blood pressure, I think. But really, we weren't a family that shared medical details. Everyone kept to themselves.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Let’s talk about you, specifically. Do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Used to sneak a bite of everything in the operating room, just to be sure! No, I don’t think I’ve ever had a reaction to anything. Though, sometimes I get a little…itchy after eating shellfish. But that might just be old age. Is that a medical thing? Being itchy?
DOCTOR: It could be, Ms. Calvery. We’ll note that. Finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... I take a little vitamin D, sometimes. My daughter keeps reminding me. And…oh! Yes, a little pill for my knees. Something the doctor gave me a while back. It’s…white, I think. Small. I can’t remember the name. It helps a little, but honestly, I forget to take it half the time. Old age, you know? Everything slips my mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, vitamin D and a medication for your knees. We'll try to track down the name of that knee medication. Okay, Ms. Calvery, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see how things are looking. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just… don't poke too hard, alright? My skin is a little thin these days. And please, don't rush me. It takes a while for me to…unfold. I'm not as spry as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. No rushing at all. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, though a slight murmur can be heard. Lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your throat... Throat looks clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age. Finally, I’ll take a quick look at your hands and knees. Hands show some mild arthritis, with some swelling and limited range of motion. Knees also show some swelling and tenderness. Now, let's get some blood work ordered to have a clearer picture of everything.
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Arthritis, you say? Well, I knew something was wrong with my hands! Though I suppose a little murmur isn't too alarming, is it? I've lived a long life, you know. Things are bound to creak a little. Blood work sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… don't poke too much, alright? And tell me when it's over. My patience isn't what it used to be. It’s just… exhausting, all this fuss. But I appreciate you looking me over, truly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. No poking, I promise. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. We'll also check your sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein to look at the inflammation in your body, considering the arthritis. It will give us a clearer idea of what’s going on. The lab results usually take a few days. I’ll have my nurse call you when they’re available. In the meantime, let's discuss some basic things you can do at home to manage the arthritis – gentle exercises, warm compresses, and over-the-counter pain relief if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… very thorough. All those fancy words! I’m just glad you’re looking into it. Exercises… I suppose I could try some exercises. Though my daughter would probably have to remind me. Warm compresses… that sounds nice. And pain relief… well, I don't like taking pills if I can help it. But if I need to… Alright, yes, let's try that. Just… please, don't make me memorize any of those big words. It's hard enough remembering what I had for breakfast. And thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better just knowing someone is looking at all this. It’s been a long time since anyone fussed over me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. No memorizing required. We’ll just focus on simple things. I'll have my nurse print out some information about arthritis management before you leave. And we’ll go over the results together when they come back. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm… questions? Let me think… No, not really. You’ve explained everything so nicely. I suppose I just hope it's not anything too serious. I’m not one for a lot of fuss, you know. And…oh! Yes, one question. Will this cost me a fortune? My Medicare doesn't cover everything, and my daughter would kill me if I spent too much money. Is it going to break the bank?
DOCTOR: Let me check your coverage… Okay, good news, Ms. Calvery. Your Medicare plan should cover the majority of the costs for the blood work and this consultation. There may be a small co-pay, depending on your plan specifics, but it shouldn’t be a significant amount. My nurse can help you understand any potential costs before you leave. We'll also check with the lab to see if they offer any payment plans. I want to assure you that we'll do everything we can to keep the costs manageable. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a relief. A small co-pay I can handle. Thank you, Doctor. That takes a weight off my mind. No, I think that’s all for now. Just… remind me to take those vitamins, alright? And maybe my daughter will remind me about the exercises. You’ve been very kind and patient with an old lady like me. I appreciate it. I think I’m ready to go home now, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. It was my pleasure. My nurse will come in shortly to go over the paperwork and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. She'll also remind you about the vitamins and give you some information on exercises. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Thank you for coming in today. And remember, take care of yourself. Have a good day.
