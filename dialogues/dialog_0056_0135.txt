DOCTOR: Hi Gerhard, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. My name is Gerhard Radillo. I have… a problem with my ear. It is… leaking. A little bit of liquid comes out. It has been happening for… maybe three days now, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, leaking from your ear for about three days. That sounds concerning. Can you tell me a little more about the liquid?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little… yellowish. Not much smell. It does not hurt, exactly. Just… feels wet. And… strange. It makes a small stain on my cloth. A small, light stain. Is this… bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, clear to yellowish liquid, no significant smell, and doesn't really hurt, just feels wet and strange. And it's staining your clothes a little. Alright. Have you had any pain at all with this, even a little?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. Like I said, just… uncomfortable. And a little… worried. It is not a normal thing for liquid to come from your ear, yes? I have never had this happen before. I am… a teacher, you know. I need to hear well for my job.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, it's not normal to have liquid leaking from your ear. And yes, hearing is very important for your job. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the leaking?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. No fever. No… dizziness. My hearing… feels a little quiet, maybe. Not much different, though. It is hard to say. I have been… a little tired lately, but that is from work, I think. Long summer school. And… no, I don’t think so. No other things. Just the liquid. And the… worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, no dizziness, maybe a little decreased hearing, and you've been tired from work. Have you had any ear infections before, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Yes. When I was a small boy, in Somalia. Maybe two times. My mother… she used some herbs. And some warm cloths. It went away. But… it was a long time ago. I do not remember much. I was very young, you understand. It did not hurt so bad, I think. But… yes. I had ear trouble before. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of ear infections as a child, treated with herbs and warm cloths. And have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu, or any head injuries recently?
PATIENT: No cold, no flu. I had a small fall, maybe one month ago. I tripped on the stairs at my house. But nothing… serious. I did not hit my head hard. Just a little bump on my arm. I put some ice on it. It was fine the next day. No headache. No… dizziness. I did not think it was important. Is this… related, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, a minor fall about a month ago with a bump to your arm, but no head injury. Alright. I’d like to take a look at your ear now, if that’s alright with you. It'll help me understand what's going on.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… good. Please. I would like to know what is happening. I am ready. Just… tell me if it will be… uncomfortable. I do not like surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surprises. I'll explain everything as I go. Okay, I see some fluid in your ear canal, and the ear drum looks a little… swollen. It’s difficult to see clearly because of the fluid. There's also a little bit of redness. It looks like you might have an outer ear infection, also known as otitis externa, or swimmer's ear, and potentially a small perforation of the eardrum. Do you spend a lot of time swimming or in the water?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not much. I do not swim. I live… far from the sea. And I am busy with work. Summer school, you know. I do not have time for swimming. I sometimes wash my ears with a cloth, but not very often. I am careful. I do not put anything in my ears. Is this… something I did? Is it my fault? I am worried about this. And the perforation… what does this mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, no swimming, you're careful about not putting things in your ears, and you're concerned about the perforation. It’s not necessarily your fault, Gerhard. Sometimes these infections just happen. A small perforation means a tiny hole in your eardrum. It can happen with an infection, or sometimes with a change in pressure. It’s not always serious, but it can sometimes affect your hearing and make you more prone to infection. We'll need to treat the infection first, and then we'll see if the perforation heals on its own. I’m going to prescribe you some ear drops with an antibiotic and a steroid to reduce the inflammation. I also recommend keeping your ear dry – avoid getting water in it when you shower or wash your face. I’m also going to give you a pain reliever, just in case you experience any discomfort. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds alright, Doctor. Ear drops and no water. I can do that. I do not like pain, so I will take the pain reliever if I need it. How long… will this take to get better? And… will I still be able to teach? My students… they need me. Is there anything… special I should do? Or not do? I want to be very careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns about teaching and wanting to be careful. The ear drops should start to improve things within a few days, but it can take a week or two for the infection to fully clear. As long as you’re keeping your ear dry and following the instructions, you should be able to continue teaching. However, avoid loud noises if possible, as they might be uncomfortable. Do not put anything in your ear – no cotton swabs, no fingers. And avoid getting water in the ear. If you experience any increased pain, fever, or drainage, or if your hearing gets significantly worse, contact me immediately. I’m going to give you a follow-up appointment in one week to check your progress. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… very good, Doctor. No cotton swabs, no fingers, avoid loud noises, and one week follow-up. I will remember. Thank you. You have… made me feel much better. I am still worried, but… less so. And the prescription? How do I get this?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gerhard. I’m glad I could reassure you a little. I’ve sent the prescription electronically to your pharmacy, so you can pick it up whenever it’s convenient. It’s at [Pharmacy Name and Address - assuming this information is in the EHR]. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all. You have answered everything. Thank you very much for your time and your help. I will… see you in one week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gerhard. Take care, and try not to worry too much. I’ll see you next week. Have a good day.
