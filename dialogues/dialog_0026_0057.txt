DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Latisia Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Finco. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… about the cancer. It’s been a hard few months, and I… I wanted to get another opinion, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Of course, Chellsea. Getting a second opinion is always a good idea. It’s important you feel comfortable and confident in your care. Just take your time, and tell me everything you're comfortable sharing. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what kind of cancer you were diagnosed with, and when?
PATIENT: Um… it was… breast cancer. They found it last November, so about nine months ago now. It was… stage two, I think? My husband… he handled most of the details with the doctors. I… I don’t remember everything, to be honest. He… he passed away in April. So it’s been… a lot.
DOCTOR: Oh, Chellsea, I am so very sorry to hear about your husband. That is… a tremendous loss, on top of everything else. Please, don’t feel bad about not remembering all the details. It’s completely understandable. We can go through everything at your pace. So, stage two breast cancer diagnosed last November. Do you recall what type of breast cancer it was – for example, was it invasive ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, or something else?
PATIENT: I… I really don’t know. He said… invasive something. That sounds right, maybe? I just… I mostly focused on the treatments. He told me what they were, and I just tried to get through them. I didn't ask a lot of questions. He always did the talking. It feels bad saying that, I know.
DOCTOR: No, Chellsea, it doesn’t feel bad at all. It's perfectly normal to lean on someone during difficult times, and to trust them to handle the details. It’s wonderful that you had his support. Okay. Invasive… that’s helpful. And what treatments did you receive?
PATIENT: Um… I had chemotherapy first. Six rounds, I think. It made me very sick. Then I had a lumpectomy, to remove the lump. And after that, radiation. Five days a week for… I don’t know, maybe six weeks? It was a blur. They also gave me… pills. To take every day. I’m still taking them. Letrozole, I think it’s called.
DOCTOR: Okay, chemotherapy, lumpectomy, radiation, and currently on Letrozole. That gives me a good starting point. Do you recall if they did any genetic testing on the cancer cells – like to look for BRCA mutations or HER2 status?
PATIENT: I… I don’t think so. He might have mentioned something about a test, but I honestly can’t remember. It was all so much. I was just… trying to get through each day. I don't know if he did a test, or what it was for. He handled all of that. I am sorry. I'm not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely helpful, Chellsea. You’re doing wonderfully, sharing what you remember. It’s perfectly okay not to have all the details, especially given everything you’ve been through. It sounds like your husband was a wonderful advocate for you. Okay. Since we don’t have the genetic testing results readily available, let’s move on to how you are feeling now. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms that are concerning you?
PATIENT: Well… I’ve been very tired. More tired than usual, even for after treatment. And… my bones ache. Mostly my back and hips. And I’ve noticed… a lump. On the side of my chest. It’s small, but… it worries me. It wasn’t there before. That’s why I came. I thought… maybe the cancer came back.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, bone aches, and a new lump on your chest. It’s good you came in to get this checked out. The new lump is definitely something we need to investigate. I’d like to do a physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll carefully examine the area on your chest where you feel the lump. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Please. I just… I want to know what’s going on. I’ve been so worried. It’s just… everything felt like it was finally getting back to normal, and now this.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, regarding the lump… I feel a small, firm mass about two centimeters in diameter. It doesn't appear to be particularly painful to the touch, and it seems to be somewhat mobile. It’s located along the pectoral muscle, on your left side. It's good that it's mobile, but we still need to determine what it is. To get a clearer picture, I recommend an ultrasound of the area. That will help us distinguish between a solid mass and a fluid-filled cyst, and potentially guide further investigation if needed. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… yes, that sounds… good. If it will help find out what it is. I just… I don’t want to go through all of that again, if I don’t have to. But I understand if it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Chellsea. We’ll proceed cautiously and only do what’s necessary to get you a definitive answer. An ultrasound is a non-invasive way to get more information, and it’s a good next step. I'll order the ultrasound for you right now. The radiology department will call you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, are you experiencing any other symptoms – like night sweats, weight loss, or any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No… no night sweats or weight loss. My appetite is… okay. It’s been a little off, but I thought that was just from the stress. And… my bones just ache sometimes. Especially when I lay down. It's hard to get comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no night sweats, weight loss, or changes in appetite, just occasional bone aches, particularly when lying down. Given your history of breast cancer and the current symptoms, I'd also like to order some blood work. It will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and some markers to assess bone health. We should also check your vitamin D levels. Would you be alright with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. If it will help. I just… I'm a little worried about all of the tests. It feels like… a lot. But I trust your judgment, Doctor Finco.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Chellsea, and I want to assure you that we're being thorough to get a clear picture of what's going on. We're not necessarily looking for anything specific, but it’s always best to rule things out and address any potential concerns. So, to recap: I’ve ordered an ultrasound of the area on your chest and some blood work. The radiology department will contact you to schedule the ultrasound, and we'll have you come back for a blood draw as soon as possible. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And… will someone call me when they’re ready?
DOCTOR: Good questions. Typically, the ultrasound results are available within 24-48 hours. The blood work results usually take a few days, maybe 3-5 business days, as some tests require more processing. We will definitely call you as soon as the results are available. Our nurse, Sarah, will likely be the one to contact you. She’ll explain the results over the phone and schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss them in detail. Do you have a preferred phone number where you can be reached?
PATIENT: Yes, it’s… 555-123-4567. That’s the best number to reach me. And… thank you, Doctor Finco. For listening, and for not making me feel… stupid. It’s been a hard time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. And please, don't ever feel like you're being stupid. You've been through a lot, and it’s perfectly normal to have questions and concerns. I'm here to support you every step of the way. I've made a note of your phone number. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like severe pain, redness, or swelling – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Finco. I appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. It was my pleasure to meet you. Remember, we’re here to support you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and take care. .
