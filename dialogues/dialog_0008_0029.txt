DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I’m Dr. Cumper. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s about my stomach, mostly. I just get full awful quick these days. Even if I barely eat anything. It's been happening for a few months now, I'd say.
DOCTOR: Okay, getting full quickly, even with small amounts of food, for a few months now. Can you describe what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Breakfast is usually just toast and maybe a bit of fruit, if I'm feeling up to it. Lunch... sometimes a sandwich, or soup. Nothing too heavy. And for dinner, my wife usually makes something, fish usually, or chicken. Small portions, though, like I said. I don't go for big meals anymore, even before this started happening. It just doesn't seem to sit right.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say it doesn’t sit right, can you describe that feeling?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not pain, exactly. More like… uncomfortable fullness, really quick. Like my stomach just says "nope, no more" after only a few bites. And it kinda stays that way for a while, even if it's not a lot of food. It's not heartburn, though. I get heartburn sometimes, but this is different. It's just... full. Too full, too fast.
DOCTOR: Okay, uncomfortable fullness quickly after eating, not pain, and distinct from your typical heartburn. Do you experience any nausea or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no vomiting. And not much nausea, either. Maybe a little bit queasy sometimes, after I realize I'm full again so fast, but it doesn’t last long. Mostly just… frustrated, to be honest. It makes it hard to enjoy a meal with my wife, you know? She's a good cook!
DOCTOR: Alright, no nausea or vomiting, just frustration with early fullness. Have you noticed any weight loss since this started?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I think... I think I have lost a little bit. My wife says my trousers are a bit looser. I haven't weighed myself recently, to be honest. I try not to dwell on those numbers. But yeah, probably a few pounds, maybe. Not a lot, but noticeable, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unintentional weight loss. And have you had any changes in your bowel habits – any constipation, diarrhea, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No blood, no. And my… well, my bowel movements have been pretty regular, thankfully. Not constipation, not diarrhea, just… normal. Same as always, really. It's just this darn fullness that's bothering me. It's making me worry, I suppose. It's not like I'm doing anything different, eating-wise.
DOCTOR: Alright, no changes in bowel habits. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I have a bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a pill for it, every morning. And my knees are giving me trouble, arthritis. That's about it, really. Nothing else major. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and arthritis in the knees. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… my wife handles most of the refills, but I think… I think it’s lisinopril. Yes, that’s it. Lisinopril. Small white pill. Take it every morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Alright, lisinopril for blood pressure. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. We eat all sorts of things. My wife likes to try new recipes, you know. And I haven’t had any trouble with bee stings or anything like that either. Pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was… goodness, over sixty years ago now. And I had a cataract removed from one eye a few years back, but that was a simple procedure, nothing major. That’s it, I think. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and cataract surgery. Now, can you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 92, a long life. My father died younger, from a heart problem. My brother is still alive, he's a bit older than me, and he has diabetes. And my sister, she had trouble with her stomach when she was younger, but I don’t know what exactly. It was something to do with ulcers, I think. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with a long life, father with heart problems, brother with diabetes, and sister with a history of stomach problems possibly related to ulcers. Lastly, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I used to have a bit of a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I haven't had any in years, doctor. My knees bother me enough without adding that to the mix. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested. Just a quiet life with my wife, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, no alcohol, no drugs. Thank you for all of that information, Mr. Obarr. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll palpate your abdomen to see if I can feel anything unusual. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Go right ahead. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-distended, and non-tender to palpation in all quadrants. No masses appreciated. There is mild discomfort in the epigastric region with deep palpation. Okay, Mr. Obarr, the exam didn’t reveal anything alarming, but the mild discomfort in your upper stomach is worth noting. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing early satiety, which is feeling full quickly. This could be related to several things. It’s possible it’s something as simple as decreased stomach capacity with age, but we need to rule out other causes. I’m going to order some blood work - a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a test for Helicobacter pylori, which is a bacteria that can cause stomach problems. I also want to order an upper endoscopy, which is a procedure where we insert a small camera into your esophagus and stomach to take a look around. It's the best way to determine the cause of your discomfort. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… a bit involved, Doctor. But if that's what you think is best, then yes, it sounds reasonable. I just… I don't like the idea of a camera going down there. But I trust you. And I want to figure out what's going on. What does this Helicobacter pylori thing do, exactly? And how long will it take to get the results from the blood work?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the endoscopy, Mr. Obarr. We can discuss it in more detail later, and I'll make sure you’re as comfortable as possible if we proceed with it. Helicobacter pylori, or H. pylori, is a bacteria that infects the stomach lining. It can cause ulcers and inflammation, which can lead to symptoms like early satiety, nausea, and abdominal pain. If we find you have an H. pylori infection, it’s easily treatable with antibiotics. As for the blood work, the results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. Once we have those, we can discuss the next steps. If the blood work doesn't reveal anything, we'll likely schedule the endoscopy. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. 2-3 days… that’s manageable. And good to hear it’s treatable if that's what it is. I suppose I should just try not to worry too much until we have the results. Can I still eat normally while we're waiting? Or should I avoid certain foods?
DOCTOR: That’s right, let’s not worry prematurely. For now, you can continue eating normally, but I would suggest avoiding large meals and foods that tend to upset your stomach - things like spicy foods, fatty foods, and caffeine. Stick to smaller, more frequent meals, and see if that helps alleviate your symptoms. And if you notice any worsening symptoms – like severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool – please contact the office immediately. I’m going to have the nurse draw your blood now, and we’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all makes sense. Small meals, avoid the spicy stuff. I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get those tests ordered and we'll be in touch soon. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
