DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have all day to explain everything. It’s… obvious, isn’t it? I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of one ear, and half my face feels like it’s drooping. Do you need me to draw you a picture? It’s rather inconvenient, to say the least.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your… directness, Ms. Nissenbaum, a medical evaluation requires specifics, even when the presentation appears straightforward. “Not hearing” and “face drooping” can stem from a variety of causes, some more serious than others. To begin, which ear is affected?
PATIENT: The left ear. Really, is this necessary? I pointed to it when the nurse took my vitals. Must I repeat everything? And it’s not just “not hearing”, it’s… complete silence. Like someone flipped a switch. It happened overnight.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Nissenbaum, it is necessary. While I understand the nurse documented the ear, I need to confirm the details myself, and ensure a thorough history. “Complete silence” is a useful descriptor, thank you. And you said this occurred overnight?
PATIENT: Yes, overnight. I went to bed perfectly fine, woke up and… this. No pain, no ringing, nothing. Just… gone. It’s extremely unsettling. I have a very important conference call tomorrow, you understand. This is terribly bad timing. Do you think it's something that can be fixed quickly?
DOCTOR: Sudden unilateral hearing loss, especially with the onset you describe, requires prompt investigation. We need to determine the cause to establish the best course of action. Before we proceed, have you experienced any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No fever, no headache. I haven't noticed any dizziness, though I haven't been getting up and down much, to be honest. My taste is normal, as far as I can tell. And no, I haven’t hit my head or anything. Honestly, I just woke up like this. Is this something contagious? I really don't have time to be quarantined.
DOCTOR: Contagious is unlikely, Ms. Nissenbaum, but we must rule out other possibilities. Have you experienced any facial weakness besides the hearing loss?
PATIENT: Facial weakness? Well, yes. That’s what I told you. Half my face feels… droopy. It’s hard to explain. It’s like I’m trying to smile and one side just… doesn’t cooperate. It’s subtle, but I can feel it. And it’s rather alarming, if you ask me. It makes me look… asymmetrical. Do you need me to demonstrate? Honestly, this is very distressing.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. A demonstration would be helpful. And could you also tell me if you’ve noticed any difficulty with your speech, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: There. Do you see? It’s quite obvious. As for speech… no, I don’t think so. I haven’t been talking much, to be frank, I didn’t want to strain anything. And my vision is perfectly normal. I have excellent eyesight, always have. This is all very… unsettling. Are you absolutely certain it’s not a stroke? My brother had a stroke a few years ago, and… well, I’d rather not go into details. It wasn’t pleasant.
DOCTOR: Thank you. The asymmetry is noted. While a stroke is a possibility, the presentation isn’t entirely typical. However, we absolutely must rule it out. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, I’m a very healthy person. I eat well, I exercise… well, I used to exercise more, before all of this. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, no heart disease. I had a bout of the flu a few years back, but that’s it. And I’m not taking any medications, not regularly. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache. I had my gallbladder removed years ago, but that was a routine procedure. Is this going anywhere? I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Alright. No chronic medical conditions, no regular medications, gallbladder removed. Family history, then. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – stroke, heart disease, cancer, neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, everyone in my family lives to be over ninety. My mother is still alive, she’s ninety-five! My father lived to be ninety-eight. Heart disease, perhaps, on my paternal side, but nothing major. My brother, as I mentioned, had a stroke, but he… well, he wasn't always responsible with his health. Cancer, yes, my aunt had breast cancer, but that was decades ago. Honestly, we have excellent genes. This is… concerning, to say the least. It doesn't fit the pattern. Are you sure you're not overlooking something?
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Nissenbaum, I am not overlooking anything. It’s precisely because of your otherwise excellent health history that this sudden onset is concerning, and requires thorough investigation. Now, before I proceed with the physical examination, I need to ask about allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I have no allergies whatsoever. I can eat anything, take anything. I’m remarkably resilient. I’ve travelled extensively, you know. All sorts of climates, all sorts of foods. No reactions. Never. This is… baffling. Are you going to actually do something, or are we just going to sit here and discuss my excellent health? My conference call is in… well, it’s getting close.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to perform a brief neurological examination and examine your ears. This will help me assess the extent of the issue and determine the next steps. Please remain still during the examination. First, let me examine your ears. Please look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Get on with it, then. Honestly, I haven’t got all day. And please be gentle. I have very sensitive ears. Do you need me to close my eyes? Should I hold perfectly still? Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: The external ear canals appear clear bilaterally. However, the left tympanic membrane is… slightly dull, and there's minimal cone of light reflex. The right tympanic membrane appears normal. Now, I’m going to assess your facial nerve function. I need you to close your eyes tightly, and I will gently resist as you try to open them. Do not strain.
PATIENT: There. Is that satisfactory? It’s a bit uncomfortable, you know. Honestly, I don’t understand why this is necessary. Is my face drooping any more than it was? This is all very disconcerting. I really need to get back to work. And are you going to tell me what’s wrong, or am I just supposed to sit here and be prodded?
DOCTOR: There is definite weakness on the left side. Now, I’m going to ask you to smile, raise your eyebrows, and puff out your cheeks. Please do each one individually, and as fully as possible.
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It’s… obvious, isn’t it? The left side just… doesn’t work. Honestly, I feel like I’m having a stroke! This is terrifying. Are you sure you’re not overlooking something? This isn’t normal. I demand a second opinion! I’m a very important person, you know. I can’t afford to be incapacitated.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your concern and frustration. Based on the neurological examination, the asymmetry, and the hearing loss, I am highly suspicious of Bell’s Palsy. However, given the sudden onset and the possibility of other causes, we need to rule out a more serious condition like stroke. I’m going to order an immediate MRI of the brain to determine the cause of your symptoms. While we await the results, I’m prescribing a course of high-dose prednisone, which may help reduce inflammation and improve your chances of recovery. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: MRI?! Prednisone?! Are you serious? I haven’t got time for MRIs! And prednisone has terrible side effects! I read about it. Weight gain, mood swings… absolutely not. I refuse. Is there anything else we can do? A CT scan? A blood test? Anything less… invasive? Honestly, I think you're overreacting. This sounds like a simple nerve issue. Why go to such extremes? And who is going to pay for this MRI? My insurance is… complicated. This is a disaster! A complete disaster. I need to call my lawyer. .
