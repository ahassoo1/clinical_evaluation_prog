DOCTOR: Hi Venard, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Hernandez, is it? Yes. It’s… a certification, I believe. Something to do with my work. Honestly, the details escape me. It's required, though. My… employer insists upon it. A hearing or eye thing, I suppose. It’s all rather tedious, if you must know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like this is a required medical exam for work. That's perfectly alright. We can definitely get that taken care of for you. Let me just confirm some basic information. I see here your name is Venard Oriley, age 60, and you have private insurance. Is that all correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s all… perfectly correct. Though, I do find it somewhat… presumptuous to simply tell me what you “see here.” I provided that information, you know. And yes, private insurance. A necessity, naturally. One doesn’t rely on… public options, if one can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Understood, Mr. Oriley. Apologies if I came across as presumptuous. Just trying to be efficient. To get started, could you tell me a little more about what specifically this certification requires?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the foggiest idea. Something about… decibel levels, perhaps? And visual acuity? My… administrative assistant handled the arrangements. She assured me it was all quite straightforward. I simply need a… piece of paper to present to… them. It’s all very bureaucratic, you see. A waste of perfectly good time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a hearing and vision test to satisfy a work requirement. That makes sense. To start, let’s do a quick vision screening. I’ll have you read some letters on a chart across the room. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A vision screening… yes, I suppose. Though I assure you, Doctor, my vision is perfectly adequate for my line of work. Still, if it’s required, I haven’t much choice, do I? Let’s get it over with. But do try to make it… swift.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll just confirm everything is as it should be. Please cover your left eye with your hand, and read the smallest line you can see on the chart. Take your time. Okay, go ahead…
PATIENT: “F… P… T… L… D… Hmm.” “Is that ‘C’ or a ‘G’?” “It’s terribly small, you know. And the lighting in here isn't optimal.”
DOCTOR: That's a good catch, it is a bit dim in here. And you are right to question that letter – it is a 'C'. Okay, let’s try the next line. Don’t worry if you can’t see everything perfectly. We’re just getting a baseline. Go ahead when you’re ready.
PATIENT: “H… R… K… N… B… Oh, and that one looks like a… a poorly formed ‘V’… or possibly a ‘W’. Really, the quality of this chart is rather substandard.” “Are you certain this is a… certified examination tool, Doctor?”
DOCTOR: That’s a fair point, Mr. Oriley. We'll make a note to replace it. It's a standard chart, but I can see your concerns. Okay, last line. Try your best. It's okay if it's difficult.
PATIENT: “No. Absolutely not. I can discern… vague shapes, but letters? Definitive letters? No. This is… quite preposterous. I assure you, Doctor, my vision is perfectly acceptable for… driving, for one. And quite adequate for assessing… paperwork. This chart is clearly defective.” “I believe we can conclude this… unnecessary ordeal.”
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Oriley. It sounds like we’re not getting a reliable reading with this chart. Let's move on to the hearing test. We’ll do a simple test where you listen for tones at different frequencies and volumes. This will give us a better idea of your hearing levels. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A hearing test… yes, I suppose. Though I must say, I have never experienced any… deficiencies in my auditory perception. I can hear perfectly well, thank you very much. My colleagues often remark upon my… clear enunciation. Still, if it’s required… proceed. But do make it swift, Doctor. And perhaps a less… antiquated apparatus this time? I trust your equipment is more… modern than that dreadful chart.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Oriley. The hearing test equipment is quite modern. We use digital tones and headphones. Okay, you'll be wearing these headphones. I’ll play a series of tones at different pitches and volumes in each ear. When you hear a tone, please press the button in your hand. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Very well. Tones, you say? Yes. I suppose it’s as good as any other… frivolous exercise. Just ensure the volume isn’t… excessive. My ears are rather sensitive, you know. And please, no… beeping noises. Those are particularly… grating. Proceed, Doctor. But I must warn you, if I detect any… anomalies, I shall request a full refund. This entire procedure is rather… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley, we'll start with your right ear. Just press the button whenever you hear a tone. It doesn't matter how faint it is. Press the button when you hear something…
PATIENT: “There. Did you detect that? A rather… subtle tone, I must say. Barely perceptible.” “And there. Another one. Though I suspect the equipment itself is emitting some… background static. It’s difficult to distinguish the actual tones from the… ambient noise.” “Are you certain this is functioning correctly, Doctor?”
DOCTOR: Yes, I’m checking the equipment now, Mr. Oriley. It appears to be functioning within normal parameters, though I noted your comment about the static. We can try adjusting the headphones to minimize background noise. Okay, let's continue with your right ear. Just focus on the tones and press the button whenever you hear one…
PATIENT: Very well. Though I maintain my skepticism regarding the accuracy of this… contraption. After a few moments of silence, I press the button again, then pause, and press it once more, seemingly at random. “There. And there. Though frankly, Doctor, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to discern any pattern. The tones are… indistinct, and the static persists. It’s rather… distracting.” “Are you absolutely certain this procedure is… necessary? I fail to see the practical application of such… imprecise measurements.”
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Oriley. I understand your frustration. Given the reported static and your difficulty discerning the tones, I'm concerned that we're not getting accurate results. To ensure we meet the requirements of your work certification, and to avoid any further inconvenience, I recommend a referral to an audiologist for a more comprehensive hearing evaluation. They have specialized equipment and a controlled environment that can provide a more definitive assessment. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An audiologist, you say? A specialist? Yes. That is… entirely reasonable. I suspected as much. This… rudimentary examination was clearly inadequate. A controlled environment, specialized equipment… yes, that is precisely what is required. Very well, Doctor. A referral to an audiologist. Please provide me with the necessary information. And do ensure they are… reputable. I will not tolerate any further… substandard evaluations. This entire ordeal has been… most inconvenient. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Oriley. I'll prepare a referral to a highly-rated audiologist in the area, and I'll include all the necessary information regarding your work certification requirements. I'll have my assistant forward the paperwork to you before you leave. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
