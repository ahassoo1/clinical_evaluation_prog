DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Andraca, you say? Yes, well… it’s about my work, I suppose. Though, frankly, I don't see what good talking about it will do. It’s just… tiresome. Terribly tiresome. Can we get this over with quickly? I have… arrangements.
DOCTOR: I understand you'd like to keep this brief, Mr. Schlatterer, and I’ll certainly do my best to respect your time. However, to help me understand what’s going on and how best to assist you, I do need to ask a few questions. When you say “work,” are you referring to your current employment?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. My employment. Though “employment” is a rather generous term for it these days. I am… a library science teacher. Postsecondary. At the community college. Though I doubt you’ve heard of it. It’s… not a prestigious institution. Are we quite finished with the introductions? This is all rather… elementary.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Schlatterer. Every job has its importance, and I appreciate you telling me what you do. So, you’re a library science teacher at the community college. And you mentioned it’s been…tiresome lately?
PATIENT: “Lately” is… a simplification. It’s been… building. For some time now. Honestly, the students… they simply don't appreciate knowledge anymore. It’s all these… digital devices. They think they can find everything on the internet. No discipline. No respect for proper research. It’s… infuriating. And the administration… well, let’s just say they’re more concerned with numbers than with… quality. Is that sufficient complaining for now? I’d rather not dwell on it. It’s a waste of perfectly good air.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of stress at work, both from the students and the administrative pressures. That can certainly be draining. Has this stress been affecting you physically or emotionally in any way?
PATIENT: Physically? Emotionally? Goodness. Well… I suppose I’ve been… less enthusiastic. About things. Yes. And… I don’t sleep as well. Though that could be the neighbors' dog. It barks incessantly. And my appetite… fluctuates. Is that what you’re looking for? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for… self-pity. I simply want to know if there’s a quick solution to this… predicament. A pill, perhaps? Something to get me through the remaining months. I’m nearing retirement, you see. Just a few months left.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Schlatterer. Those are all things that can be related to stress, and it’s good you’re acknowledging them. Before we discuss potential solutions, could you tell me a little more about the sleep disturbance?
PATIENT: What exactly do you want to know? I lie in bed. I toss and turn. I think about… things. Mostly the incompetence of my colleagues and the dreadful state of modern education. Sometimes I get up and read. Though even that isn’t enjoyable anymore. It’s just… restless. A general sense of… unease. It’s hardly a medical marvel, Doctor. I’m an old man. Old men don’t sleep well. It's a given. Now, if we could expedite this process…
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out, Mr. Schlatterer. Sleep patterns do change with age. However, it's still important to rule out any underlying causes or contributing factors, even if it seems straightforward. Do you find yourself waking up during the night, and if so, how often?
PATIENT: Oh, very often. Several times. I… I used to be able to sleep through anything. A veritable log. But now… it’s a constant interruption. I get up, I make a cup of tea, I pace. Then I try to go back to sleep, but… the thoughts return. It’s a vicious cycle. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for… detailing my nocturnal habits to strangers. It feels… undignified. Are we getting anywhere? Perhaps a referral to a… a sleep specialist? Someone who can prescribe something… potent?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Schlatterer, and I assure you everything we discuss is confidential. A referral to a sleep specialist is certainly an option, and we can discuss that further. However, before we go that route, let's quickly review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I had a rather unpleasant bout of bronchitis a few years ago. And my cholesterol is… elevated, I believe. The doctor keeps mentioning it. But generally, I’m quite robust for my age. I’ve always been a… a careful eater. Mostly. And I walk. When the weather permits. Is this relevant? Honestly, Doctor, I suspect the root of all my problems is simply… the modern world. It’s too fast. Too loud. Too… ignorant. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have arrangements. Very important arrangements. Can we wrap this up soon?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. And you’re right, it’s important to consider the impact of external factors. Before we discuss potential solutions, could you tell me if you are currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a small dose of loratadine. For the allergies. The pollen has been dreadful this year. And occasionally, ibuprofen for the arthritis in my hands. But nothing… substantial. Certainly nothing for… nerves. I pride myself on my self-reliance, Doctor. I’ve always preferred to… endure. Now, are we quite finished? I really must be going. This has been… unnecessarily protracted. I have arrangements, you see. Very important arrangements. It involves… a rare book auction. And I need to prepare. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. I understand. Based on what you've told me – the difficulty sleeping, decreased enthusiasm, appetite fluctuations, and stress at work – it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms consistent with stress and possibly some mild anxiety. Given your history of bronchitis and elevated cholesterol, I recommend we start with some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes. I also think it would be beneficial to explore some relaxation techniques or perhaps consider brief therapy to help manage the stress. We can discuss a referral to a therapist if you’re interested. In the meantime, if you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or having difficulty coping, please don't hesitate to reach out to a friend, family member, or mental health professional. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood work requisition for you now. Does that sound alright?
