DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Carmaleta. I'm Dr. Galena. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don't even know where to start. Look, I just… I want to have a baby. And I want it to be easy. My first one… well, it wasn’t. And I don't have the energy for a repeat of that. Is that making any sense? I just want to know if there's anything I can do to make sure it doesn't happen again. Quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That makes perfect sense. It’s very reasonable to want to be proactive, especially after a difficult experience. Hmm… “quickly, if possible”… I appreciate that. Let’s try to get a good picture of things. So, when you say it wasn’t easy, can you tell me a little more about your first pregnancy?
PATIENT: Honestly? It was years ago. Like, a long time. I remember a lot of… waiting. And then… tests. Lots of poking and prodding. And then… disappointment. A lot of it. I don't really want to go into all the details. It was just… stressful. And I was younger then, I guess. I just want to make sure this time around is… simpler. Is there a test I can take or something? Something that just tells me if I’m going to have problems?
DOCTOR: Right, a lot of stress… and you'd like to avoid repeating that. I understand completely. It sounds like it was a difficult time, and it’s perfectly okay if you don’t want to rehash everything right now. “Simpler” is a good goal. There isn't one single test that predicts all potential problems, unfortunately. But we can do some things to assess your current health and look for any potential factors that might make things more challenging. We'll start with a thorough medical history. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: Ugh, a history? Seriously? Okay, fine. I… think I used to. Dr. Abernathy, maybe? But that was before… well, before everything. Honestly, I haven't been to a doctor in… years. I mostly just try to stay healthy on my own. Lots of fruits and vegetables, you know? I don't really like going to doctors. It always feels like a waste of time. Can’t we just skip that part?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Carmaleta. It’s good you prioritize a healthy lifestyle, that's a wonderful foundation. But a little information can really help us personalize things and rule things out, even if everything is going well. Dr. Abernathy… okay, good to know. Let's just start with the basics, then. Any major medical problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. No. None of that. I really am quite healthy, you know. I eat well, I try to get some exercise, I don’t… well, I didn’t used to smoke, and I hardly ever drink. I think I had a glass of wine, maybe, at Christmas last year. Honestly, I’m more worried about… age. I’m not a spring chicken anymore. Is that going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Carmaleta. Very good habits. And you’re right to think about age; it’s a valid concern. At 43, the chance of some complications does increase slightly, but it certainly doesn't mean it won't be possible to have a healthy pregnancy. Have you had any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think… There was… something with my appendix, when I was a teenager. A long time ago. And… I had a C-section with my first. That was… unpleasant. Other than that? Nothing I can remember. Honestly, I try not to dwell on hospitals. They give me the creeps. Can we just move on? I really don't want to spend all day here.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy and a C-section… okay, good to know. I understand your reluctance to dwell on things, and we won't. Now, regarding medications… are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, just a multivitamin. Nothing fancy. And sometimes, if my joints are acting up, I take some ibuprofen. But that’s it. Honestly, I really try to avoid pills as much as possible. They always make me feel strange. Can we please just get to the part where you tell me what I need to do? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Carmaleta. I appreciate your patience. Let’s move on to a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. It will be quick. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just... don't poke me too much. And hurry, please. I really don't like being touched by strangers. Seriously. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is good. Pulse is 72, regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Alright, everything sounds good so far. Now, just a quick abdominal exam, just to feel for anything unusual. It’s very routine.
PATIENT: Ugh, abdominal exam? Seriously? Can’t you just skip that part? I really don’t like people touching my stomach. It’s… private. I just want to know what tests I need to take, not get a full physical. Honestly, this is taking way too long. I’m starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: You’re right. I apologize. I’m pushing too far. You’re understandably anxious, and I should be more sensitive to that. I’m very sorry. Let’s skip the abdominal exam for now. I can order some blood work, which will give us a lot of information. We'll check your hormone levels, thyroid function, and basic blood counts. It will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally! Yes, blood work is fine. As long as it doesn't take forever. And you promise you won’t make me come back for a million different tests? Honestly, I just want to get this over with. Just tell me what I need to do, and let me get on with my life. Can I get the paperwork now? And is there anything I need to do to prepare for it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Paperwork will be right with you. The blood work will require a simple fasting glucose and lipid panel - that means no food or drinks for about 8-12 hours before the appointment. It’s standard procedure. We'll also need a complete blood count, a hormone panel to assess your ovarian reserve, and a thyroid panel. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a plan that is tailored to your needs. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. No food for eight hours. Got it. Sounds… complicated. Honestly, I just hope it doesn’t show anything bad. I really don't want to deal with any drama. Just tell me when and where to go for the blood work, and I'll try to get it done as quickly as possible. And please, no more poking and prodding. I’m really starting to get stressed out. Can I go now? I have a lot on my mind. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. The lab is right down the hall, room 203. The order is already submitted, so they’ll be expecting you. And you’re right, no more poking and prodding for now. We’ll review the results together, and then we can decide on the next steps. Here's the lab order. Please take your time, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions.
