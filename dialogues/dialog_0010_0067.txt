DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Ruocco, yes. Well… it’s my chest, I think. Hurts when I… when I take a deep breath. It’s been happening for a little while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. And you said it’s worse when you take a deep breath?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. When I try to fill my lungs up… oof. Not a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. It doesn't last long, but it's… uncomfortable. I mostly try to avoid taking big breaths because of it. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: It’s good you're paying attention to your body and letting me know. Avoiding deep breaths isn’t ideal, so we want to figure out what’s causing it. Now, can you tell me a little more about where exactly you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It's… somewhere in the middle of my chest. Not on the side, not towards my back… just… here. It’s hard to say exactly. Like I said, memory isn’t what it used to be. I mostly just feel it when I breathe, not necessarily where. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. And has anything made it better or worse – certain positions, activities, or times of day?
PATIENT: Well… I don’t think so. It seems to just… happen. Maybe it's worse when I’ve been… moving around a lot? I used to do a lot of building, you know, construction. But that was a long time ago. Now I mostly just sit. It's hard to say if that makes it better or worse. Everything just hurts a little bit these days, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. And to get a better understanding, can you tell me if you've had any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn't? I haven’t been coughing or anything like that. No fever, no… shortness of breath, except when I try to take a deep breath because of the pain. It’s just… the pain. Honestly, I don’t remember anything else. I’m not very good at remembering things these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like heart problems, lung problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a hard question. I’ve seen doctors over the years, of course. When I was younger, I was pretty healthy. Worked hard, didn’t get sick much. I think I had high blood pressure once, a long time ago, but I don’t remember if they gave me anything for it. I really couldn’t tell you. I don't keep track of those things. It’s all a blur. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Ruocco. We can try to piece things together. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. I don't take anything. Never really been one for pills. I tried some ibuprofen for my arthritis a few years back, but it didn't seem to help much. So I stopped taking it. I mostly just try to… tough it out, you know? I don't like bothering people.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of. I've never had a really bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I'm around cats, but that's just a mild annoyance. Nothing serious. I don't think I'm allergic to anything, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Ruocco. Just to finish up with the background information, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That's a tricky one. My wife… she passed away a long time ago. We didn't have any children. I had a brother, but he lived far away and we didn’t see each other much. I don't really know much about his health. As far as I know, nobody in my family had… heart trouble or lung problems. But honestly, it's been so long, I couldn't say for sure. I don’t keep up with those things. I’m sorry. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful information, but it's okay if you don’t know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, do you smoke or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never smoked. My wife… she didn’t like it. Always told me it was bad for my health. So I never started. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don’t drink much either. A beer now and then, but that’s about it. I always preferred water.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs and do a quick exam of your chest. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… get it over with quickly if you could, please. I have… things to do. But yes, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you could please sit back and relax. I’m going to listen to your breathing first. Take deep breaths in and out for me, please. I'm listening for any unusual sounds. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Oof… a little bit. It's not… sharp, but it’s… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, just like the breathing. It's hard to breathe deep when it hurts, you know? But… no, it's not terrible. Just… annoying. Can we hurry this up a bit? I feel a little dizzy already.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. We can slow down. That discomfort is good to know. Your pulse is a little elevated, and you mentioned feeling dizzy. Let’s just take a moment. I’m just feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. Does this hurt more than when I listened to your lungs?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… more uncomfortable. It feels… bruised, almost. But I haven’t injured myself, I don’t think. Just… tender. It's hard to explain. Like someone’s been pressing on my chest for a long time. Can we… stop now? I'm starting to feel really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Ruocco. We can stop. Your blood pressure is also a little higher than I’d like, and with the dizziness and tenderness, I want to be cautious. Given your symptoms and what I’m finding on the exam, I’m concerned about possible musculoskeletal pain, potentially costochondritis - inflammation of the cartilage in your chest wall - but with the elevated blood pressure and dizziness, we need to rule out anything more serious. I’m going to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray just to be safe. Would you be able to go to the lab and radiology department downstairs?
PATIENT: Blood tests… an X-ray? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is something really wrong? I just thought it was a little chest pain. I don't like hospitals. Or… labs. I get anxious. Can't I just… take some pills or something? I really don't want to go through all that. And… will it cost a lot of money? I don’t have much savings.
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you we’re taking these precautions to be thorough. These tests will help us understand exactly what's going on, and it doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. It's better to be safe and know for sure. As for the cost, I can arrange for a financial counselor to speak with you about potential assistance programs and payment options. We don't want financial concerns to prevent you from getting the care you need. Now, these tests are really important. I'll write you a referral to the lab and radiology downstairs, and the technicians will be able to explain the procedures. It shouldn’t take very long, and I’ll be here to discuss the results with you as soon as they’re available. Would you like me to call a nurse to sit with you while you go downstairs, just for support?
PATIENT: I… I guess. Tests… alright. But please… make it quick. And yes, a nurse would be nice. I don’t want to be alone. And… will I need to come back tomorrow? I have… appointments. I don’t want to have to reschedule everything. This is all very inconvenient. But… alright. Let’s get it over with. Just… please hurry.
