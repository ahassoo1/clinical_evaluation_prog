DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I shouldn’t have to be here. But yesterday, I woke up and… well, I couldn’t hear out of my left ear. And my face feels… funny. Droopy, I suppose. It's quite inconvenient, really. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Inconvenient is… understandable. Not being able to hear and a facial droop… that is concerning. When exactly yesterday did you notice this?
PATIENT: Yesterday morning. I woke up, and it was just… there. Not gradually, not anything. Just… gone, and this… slackness. Honestly, I assumed it was something temporary. I didn’t think I needed to bother a doctor for a simple thing. But it hasn’t gotten better, obviously.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to clarify, this happened while you were still asleep, or immediately after waking up?
PATIENT: Immediately after. I woke up, and then I noticed. Do you always need such precise details? It’s not like it’s a complex operation, you know. It just happened. And it's quite frustrating, I assure you.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Stephane. I just want to make sure I have all the information. Okay, immediately after waking up. Have you experienced any other symptoms – dizziness, headache, trouble speaking, vision changes, or weakness on one side of your body?
PATIENT: No. Just the ear and the face. I can speak perfectly fine, thank you very much. And no dizziness, headaches… honestly, I’m quite healthy. This is… unusual. I don’t get sick. This is probably some minor… irritation. It has been rather humid lately. Though, I can’t imagine that causing this.
DOCTOR: Okay. No other symptoms. And you said you’re generally healthy?
PATIENT: Yes. I’ve always taken good care of myself. I eat well, I exercise… well, I used to, before this inconvenience. And I’ve never had any serious health problems. Nothing like this, anyway. I'm a radiologist, you know. I understand anatomy. This isn't something minor, is it?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And it's helpful you're familiar with anatomy. I'd like to do a quick exam just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don’t keep me all day. I have appointments, you know. Important ones.
DOCTOR: <stage>I nod, and begin the exam. “Okay, Stephane, I’m going to check your facial movements. Can you smile for me, and then frown?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It’s clearly not symmetrical, is it? I already told you something was wrong with my face. This is rather obvious, wouldn’t you say?
DOCTOR: <stage>I carefully observe her facial movements, noting the asymmetry. I then ask her to close both eyes tightly, and then open them. "And can you close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that satisfactory? It's harder to close this eye, obviously. Do you need me to spell it out for you? I am a radiologist, after all. I understand what a functional nervous system looks like. This isn't normal.
DOCTOR: <stage>I make a note of the incomplete eyelid closure. “Okay. And can you stick your tongue out?
PATIENT: Honestly. What is the point of all of this? It's clearly deviated to one side. I can feel it. Are you going to ask me to balance on one leg now? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Hurry up. This is quite unpleasant. And what exactly are you hoping to hear? It's already deaf, remember? I'd appreciate a quick diagnosis, if that's possible. I have a life to get back to, you know. And an important appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, Stephane. Based on the exam, you’re exhibiting signs of left-sided facial weakness and hearing loss in your left ear. While it's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, these symptoms are concerning for a possible stroke, or Bell's palsy. To rule out a stroke, we’ll need to get some imaging done—a CT scan of your brain. Would you be able to undergo a CT scan today?
PATIENT: A stroke? You think I’m having a stroke? Honestly! I am a radiologist! I know strokes. I’ve read the scans. I understand the implications. You think I wouldn't know if I was having a stroke? This is… insulting. And expensive. What about Bell's palsy? Is that something... less serious? And what’s the waiting time for this… CT scan? I don’t have all day, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your expertise, Stephane. It’s simply protocol to rule out stroke when we see these symptoms, given the potential seriousness. Bell’s palsy is a temporary paralysis of the facial nerve, often resolving on its own, but it's important to differentiate between the two. Waiting times vary, but I can check availability at the nearest imaging center immediately. It’s crucial we get this scanned as quickly as possible. Do you have any allergies or metal implants that I should be aware of before scheduling the scan?
PATIENT: No allergies. No implants. I told you, I’m quite healthy. Though I used to have a wisdom tooth removed, years ago. But that's hardly relevant. Just… get the scan done. As quickly as possible. And make sure it’s a good quality scan. I’m a radiologist, remember? I’ll know if it's subpar. Frankly, I probably could do it myself. Just… prioritize it, please. I have a life.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m prioritizing the scan now. I've contacted the imaging center. They have an opening in one hour. They've been alerted to your profession, and will ensure a high-quality scan. I'm also going to write you a referral note. In the meantime, I'd like to check your blood pressure and heart rate, just as a precaution. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Blood pressure, heart rate… whatever. As long as this doesn’t delay the scan. And ensure the technician is competent. I don’t want to waste my time on blurry images. I'm a radiologist. I have standards. Now, hurry up. One hour, you said? Make sure it's exactly one hour. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 135/85 and your heart rate is 78, both within normal limits. I’ve confirmed the scan appointment for exactly one hour. I’m writing the referral note now, and will have it ready for you shortly. While we wait, I'll also ask you about your medical history, just in case. Do you have any pre-existing conditions, like diabetes or high cholesterol?
