DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you. Uh, well, it's this swelling, see? Face and legs, mostly. It just… happened. Don’t rightly know when exactly, but it’s been botherin’ me. Feels kinda puffy, you know? Not painful, just… there.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Swelling in the face and legs can be concerning. When you say it “just happened,” can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? Hmm. Honestly, Doc, I'm not real good with dates. It wasn't yesterday, that I’m sure of. Maybe a week ago? Longer? Everything kinda blurs together these days, since… well, since Martha passed. It just sort of noticed itself, if that makes any sense. I didn't do anything to cause it.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Miner. Losing someone can certainly disrupt your routine and awareness of things. We’ll figure this out together, don't worry. So, the swelling started roughly a week or more ago, and you haven't noticed any specific injury or event that might have triggered it?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I can put my finger on. I haven’t been fallin’ or bumpin’ into things, not that I remember. Been keepin’ to myself mostly, workin’ in the shop. Welding, like always. Though… I’ve been feelin’ a bit more tired than usual, now that you mention it. Just chalked it up to gettin’ older.
DOCTOR: Okay, so swelling, fatigue, and it’s been going on for at least a week. Have you noticed any changes in your urine—either the amount you’re producing, or the color of it?
PATIENT: Urine? Doc, I don’t go inspectin’ my… you know. If it looks normal, I don't bother. I reckon it's been… regular. Same as always, I suppose. Look, I'm a welder, not a doctor. I deal with metal, not… fluids. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Mr. Miner. I apologize if I'm asking overly detailed questions. It is important, as changes in urination can sometimes provide clues. Let's move on then. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, or any discomfort in your chest?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath... Not really. I get winded after climbin' a few stairs, but that's always been the case. Old lungs, you know? But no, not like… struggling to breathe or anything. And my chest feels fine. A little ache now and then, but that's probably just from bendin' over the workbench all day. Don't see how that’s related.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight… Well, I ain't been weighin' myself, Doc. If anything, I reckon I've been eatin' a bit less. Not much of an appetite these days. Martha always made such good meals, but… it's hard to bother with cookin' for one. Food just doesn't taste the same anymore, either. So, probably less weight, I'd guess. Not that it matters much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Miner. It's completely normal to experience changes in appetite and weight during times of grief. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… I think the Doc back in the city mentioned somethin’ about it a few years back, but I don’t remember much. I never liked takin’ pills, so I didn't bother with it. Diabetes? No, never been told that. And my heart… feels alright. Beats when it’s supposed to, I suppose. Never had any trouble with it. I was always a strong fella. Used to be, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… there was that time I sliced my hand open when I was younger, workin’ with sheet metal. Had to get stitches, but that was a long time ago. And… Martha had a hip replacement a few years before she passed, but that wasn't me. Other than that, I don't recall bein’ in the hospital. Nothing serious, anyway. Mostly just sniffles and colds over the years.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, a few questions about your family. Do you have a family history of heart disease, kidney problems, or swelling in the legs or face?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my father, he had a bad heart. Always complainin' about chest pains. Passed away when I was still pretty young. And my mother… she had some kind of trouble with her legs, always swellin' up towards the end. I don't rightly know what it was, Doc. Never asked much about it. Folks didn’t talk about such things back then. Just figured it was old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful information. Now, do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. I told you, I don’t like takin’ pills. Never been a fan. Just a bit of aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. Don’t believe in loadin’ up on all those chemicals. My body’s done alright on its own for this long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Go ahead, Doc. Whatever you need to do. Just try not to poke around too much, alright? Old bones, you know. And be gentle with the face, I’ve got sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Miner. I will be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and I’m noticing some swelling in your legs and face, as we discussed. The swelling is present bilaterally, meaning on both sides. I didn’t feel any pain upon palpation of your abdomen. Given your history and the physical exam findings, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the swelling at this point. Several things could be contributing to this, including kidney problems, heart failure, or a fluid imbalance. To get a better understanding, I would like to order some blood tests and a urine analysis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Blood tests and… you said urine analysis? Now hold on a minute, Doc. What exactly are you lookin’ for? And how much will this cost? I ain’t got insurance, you know. Martha… well, things are tight. I just want to know what’s wrong, not bankrupt myself tryin’ to fix it. What are we talkin’ here? Is it somethin' serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Miner, and I’ll do my best to address them. The blood tests will help us assess your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any underlying infections. The urine analysis will provide information about your kidney function and check for protein in your urine, which can be a sign of kidney problems. As for the cost, I'll be upfront with you. Without insurance, the blood tests will likely cost around $150-$200, and the urine analysis around $50-$75. I know this is a financial burden, and we can discuss options to help reduce the cost, such as a payment plan. Based on your history, the swelling, and the elevated blood pressure, it is important to investigate this further. While it may not be something serious, it is always best to rule out any potential problems. We’re looking to see if your kidneys are functioning properly, to assess your heart health, and to check for any fluid imbalances. Would you like me to proceed with the tests, and we can discuss payment options afterward?
PATIENT: $200… and another $75? That’s… that’s a lot of money, Doc. Martha always said I wasn’t good with finances. I just… I don’t know. Is there anything else we can do? Can’t you just… tell me what it is just by lookin’ at me? I mean, you’re the doctor. I thought that’s what doctors did.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Miner. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about the cost, and I wish I could simply tell you what's wrong without any further testing. Unfortunately, medicine isn’t always that straightforward. While I can observe certain signs and symptoms, those can be caused by many different things, and it’s important to have objective data—like the results of blood tests and a urine analysis—to get an accurate diagnosis. Think of it like trying to fix a car engine. I can listen to the engine and hear a strange noise, but I need to open it up and examine the parts to figure out what’s actually causing the problem. To be as helpful as possible, I can order the most essential tests first - a basic metabolic panel and a urinalysis - which will give us a good starting point for around $100-$125 total. This will help rule out some of the more serious possibilities. We can then discuss additional tests if needed. If the results come back normal, we can explore other potential causes and focus on symptom management. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: $125… Okay. Okay, I guess so. It's better than not knowin', I suppose. Just promise me you won't order a bunch of extra tests without talkin' to me first. And tell me what everything means, in plain English. None of that doctor talk. Alright, let's get it over with. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: I promise, Mr. Miner. I will only order necessary tests and will explain the results in plain English. You have my word. Excellent. There's a lab just down the hall, room 203. The phlebotomist there will draw your blood and collect a urine sample. They'll give you instructions on how to collect the sample properly. Once you’ve completed the tests, they'll send the results to me, and I'll review them as soon as they're available. It usually takes 24-48 hours. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… don't scare me, Doc. Alright, room 203, you said? I guess I’ll go get this over with. Thank you… I think.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Miner. I'll do my best to provide you with the best possible care. And I understand your apprehension – it’s perfectly normal to be anxious in situations like this. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
