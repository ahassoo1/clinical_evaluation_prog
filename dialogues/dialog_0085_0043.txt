DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbbel. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Devetta Lahn, and I'm one of the family medicine doctors here. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been having this headache… right in the back of my head. It’s been going on for a little bit now, and I figured I should get it checked out. It just… feels like pressure, mostly. Not a real sharp pain, but it’s annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head that feels like pressure. I understand. And when you say “a little bit now,” about how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably around the beginning of July, I’d say. Maybe the 10th? It comes and goes, not constant, thankfully. Some days it's barely there, other days it's more noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright, so starting around July 10th, coming and going. And when it is there, would you describe it as a constant pressure, or does it fluctuate throughout the day?
PATIENT: It definitely fluctuates. It’s not like a steady, all-day thing. It’ll come on, and then ease off. Sometimes it's worse in the afternoon, I think. And if I'm… really concentrating on something, like looking at a spreadsheet for work, it seems to get a bit worse then too. Not always, but often. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it's intermittent pressure, potentially worse in the afternoons and with concentration. Have you noticed anything that relieves it?
PATIENT: Well… resting helps. If I lie down for a bit, it usually eases up. And… honestly, sometimes a cup of strong tea. Not sure if that’s just a coincidence or not, but it seems to calm me down and the headache feels better after. Nothing really makes it go away completely, just takes the edge off.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting and a cup of tea seem to help take the edge off. And you mentioned doing work – do you do a lot of close-up work, like reading or using a computer?
PATIENT: Yes, a lot. I'm a financial advisor, so lots of spreadsheets, reports, looking at numbers all day. And I meet with clients a couple times a week, which usually involves taking notes on my laptop. It's… mostly computer work, really. I've been doing it for a long time now, so it's second nature, but I suppose it could be something to do with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a lot of close-up work. That's helpful information. Now, besides the headache, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No dizziness, no blurry vision, no nausea or anything like that. Just the headache. I have been a little more tired lately, but honestly, at my age, who isn’t? I wouldn’t say it’s unusual. Everything else feels normal, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms like dizziness, vision changes, or nausea. Just the headache and a bit of fatigue, which you attribute to age. That's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the flu a couple times, like everyone else, but nothing serious. My blood pressure was a little high a few years back, but it came down with diet and exercise. I don’t take any regular medications right now. Oh… and I had my appendix out when I was a kid. That's about it, honestly. Pretty healthy for an old man, I think.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Gibbbel. So, history of appendectomy, previously elevated blood pressure that was managed with diet and exercise. No current medications. And you said no allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not to food, not to medications, nothing like that. My wife used to try and get me to eat more vegetables, but that wasn't an allergy, just a preference! She always said I needed more color in my diet. But, no, no allergies at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my father had heart trouble later in life, needed a bypass surgery, I think. And my mother… she had arthritis, mostly in her hands. And her mother, my grandmother, she had diabetes. Nothing else really jumps to mind. We weren't a family that talked about health much, if I’m being honest. Just kind of dealt with things as they came.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart trouble, arthritis, and diabetes. Alright. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I live alone now. My wife passed away a few years back. I try to stay active, walk the dog most days, maybe a mile or so. I eat pretty well, mostly. I like to cook for myself. And I still work full-time, keeps me busy. I don't smoke, haven't for decades, and I only have a drink or two with dinner sometimes. Nothing too wild.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you live alone, walk the dog daily, work full-time, and maintain a generally healthy lifestyle. That's all very good. Before we proceed with a physical exam, is there anything else at all you think I should know about this headache or your overall health?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think one more time. Oh! I did bump my head, lightly, a couple of months ago. I was getting something down from a high shelf, and just… not a hard bump, barely felt it, but maybe that started something? It wasn’t bad enough to go to the doctor or anything, just a little tap. But now that I think about it… maybe. I didn’t mention it before because it didn’t seem important at the time. But I guess it's worth saying.
DOCTOR: Okay, a light bump to the head a couple of months ago. That is good to know. It's always helpful to have the complete picture. Alright, Mr. Gibbbel, I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if that's alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also do a neurological exam to assess your reflexes and coordination, and I’ll take a look at your eyes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Dr. Lahn. Go ahead. I'll do whatever you need. Just let me know if anything feels… weird.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not significantly so. Your pulse is 72, regular and strong. Now I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs… Everything sounds clear on both sides, no wheezing or crackles. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light, and your retinas look normal. Now I’m going to check your reflexes… Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. And finally, I’ll just ask you to follow my finger with your eyes… and touch your nose with your finger. Good. Everything appears normal neurologically. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your head to check for any tenderness. There's a little bit of tenderness at the back of your head, right where you said the headache is, but no obvious signs of trauma. Everything else feels normal.
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds… well, normal, I guess. That little tenderness… that’s probably from the bump then, right? It doesn't hurt too bad, just a little sensitive. Is that something to worry about?
DOCTOR: It’s likely related to the bump, yes. The tenderness isn’t severe, which is reassuring. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, it’s most likely a tension headache, possibly aggravated by the minor head trauma, and potentially related to the stress of work and focusing for long periods. However, given your age and the persistence of the headache, I want to be cautious. I’d like to order a complete blood count just to rule out any underlying infection or anemia. And, to be absolutely sure, I think a CT scan of the head would be prudent to rule out any subtle structural issues. Do you have any concerns about getting a CT scan?
PATIENT: A CT scan… hmm. Is that… is that a lot of radiation? I’ve heard things about that. And I don’t really like hospitals much, if I’m being honest. But I understand you want to be careful, and I want to make sure it's nothing serious. If you think it’s important, then… then I guess I’m okay with it. But I’d like to know what we’re looking for, exactly. And how much radiation it is.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Mr. Gibbbel. It’s always good to be informed. A CT scan does involve a small amount of radiation, but it’s a relatively low dose, comparable to what you receive from a few years of background radiation. We use the lowest possible dose to get a clear image. We’re looking for any signs of bleeding, swelling, or structural abnormalities in the brain. Given the headache’s persistence and your age, it’s important to rule out anything serious, even if it’s unlikely. Would you like me to explain the process in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. What does the scan actually feel like? And how long does it take? I've never had one before, so I'm a little nervous. And… will I have to do anything special to prepare? Like, can I eat beforehand?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The CT scan itself is very quick and painless. You'll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. You'll need to lie very still for a few minutes – usually around 5-10 minutes – while the machine takes images. It doesn't involve any injections or needles. You won't need to do anything special to prepare. You can eat and drink normally beforehand. We’ll just ask you to remove any metal objects, like jewelry or dentures, as they can interfere with the images. The radiology technician will be with you throughout the entire process and will explain everything step-by-step. Do you have any other concerns about the scan?
PATIENT: No, I think that explains it pretty well. Not needles, good. And I can eat… that's a relief. Okay. If that’s what you think is best, then let’s do the scan. And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can get the scan scheduled for tomorrow morning. The results usually take about an hour or two to come back. Once I have them, I'll review them carefully and contact you immediately to discuss the findings. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever, ibuprofen 200mg, to take as needed for the headache. And I recommend trying to reduce stress as much as possible – perhaps some gentle exercise or relaxation techniques. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Ibuprofen is fine, I’ve used that before. And I’ll try to take it easy. Thank you, Dr. Lahn. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. It makes me feel a lot better. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Gibbbel. I'm glad I could help. We’ll get the scan scheduled and I'll be in touch as soon as I have the results. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as severe headache, fever, dizziness, or vision changes – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here's the prescription for the ibuprofen, and a referral order for the CT scan. The radiology department will call you to schedule the appointment. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Gibbbel.
