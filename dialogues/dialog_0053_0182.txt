DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s just get on with it. I need a signature so I can get this… this improvement done. It's for my face, you see. The clinic sent me to you for clearance. It’s all very silly, really. A man my age… but my daughter insisted.
DOCTOR: Right. An… improvement, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, an improvement. A little tightening, you know? The skin… it sags. It's not dignified. And frankly, the pictures they take these days… unforgiving. I just want it done quickly and properly. Is that so much to ask? I have a bridge game this afternoon.
DOCTOR: So, to be clear, you're requesting my medical opinion to ensure you are a suitable candidate for a cosmetic procedure – a facial tightening, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's exactly it. A tightening. And look, I'm a healthy man. Always have been. Worked with terrazzo my entire life – that’s hard work, let me tell you. Never smoked, hardly drank. Just… time takes its toll. I don’t need a lecture about aging gracefully, I assure you. Just tell me if I’m healthy enough for the procedure and sign the papers.
DOCTOR: Certainly. While I understand your desire for expediency, I do need to perform a basic assessment to determine suitability and rule out any contraindications. It wouldn’t be responsible of me to simply sign off without doing so. Terrazzo work sounds strenuous – a good test of endurance, certainly. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Conditions? At my age? Probably a few aches and pains, but nothing a little liniment doesn’t fix. My doctor—Dr. Albright, good man, retired last year—used to say I was as tough as nails. High blood pressure, maybe, a few years back, but it’s under control. I take a small pill for it. And my knees… they aren’t what they used to be. But again, what do you expect?
DOCTOR: Right. High blood pressure, managed with medication. And some knee discomfort. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Goodness, I haven't the faintest. One of those… little white pills. My wife handled all the medication, you see. She passed… three years ago. I just… take it every morning with my breakfast. It's a small one. Don't make a fuss about it, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Good heavens, no! A man of my generation doesn’t go around getting things cut off unless absolutely necessary. Had my tonsils out when I was a boy. That’s about it. Maybe a broken arm once, falling off a ladder, but that was… a long time ago. Nothing serious. I told you, I’m a healthy man.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else, Mr. Orwin?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, no allergies. Dust, perhaps, but who isn't allergic to dust? Nothing serious enough to write home about. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like I'm in an interrogation.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin, but this is standard procedure to ensure your safety. Now, let's just confirm…no known drug allergies, no known food allergies, no environmental allergies besides perhaps a little dust. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's correct. Just a bit of dust. Are we done now? I really need to be going. That bridge game won’t play itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just quickly, I’d like to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, just as a formality. It will only take a few minutes. Please, have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. Alright, alright. Just get it over with. But do hurry. I haven't got all day, you know. And please be gentle, my knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. If you could just relax, please. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Hmm. That’s a little elevated, Mr. Orwin. 150/90. And your pulse is a bit irregular. I hear a slight murmur. Are you experiencing any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Elevated? Elevated how? I told you, I’m generally in good health. A murmur? Nonsense. A little… puffing after climbing stairs, perhaps, but that’s just age, you know? And dizziness… sometimes when I stand up too quickly. It’s nothing to worry about. My wife always said I was a bit lightheaded. Now, are we getting anywhere with this, or are you just going to poke and prod me all afternoon? I have people waiting.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, with your blood pressure and pulse readings, as well as the murmur I detected, I would not feel comfortable signing off on a cosmetic procedure at this time. It would be irresponsible of me to do so without further investigation. We need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues.
PATIENT: Cardiac issues? Are you serious? After eighty-one years, now you tell me I might have a problem with my heart? That's ridiculous! I told you, I work with terrazzo, that's hard labour! I can still outwork most of those youngsters. This is a waste of my time! Get me a referral to someone who isn't going to try and scare me with nonsense. I need this done. My daughter is planning a party. Now, are you going to help me or not?
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration, but I am acting in your best interest. It’s not my intention to “scare” you, but ignoring these findings could be detrimental to your health. I will, of course, provide a referral to a cardiologist for a full evaluation. I’m recommending Dr. Evelyn Reed. She’s excellent. However, I strongly advise against undergoing any elective procedures until we have a clear understanding of your cardiac status. I will also send your primary care physician a summary of my findings. Here is the referral information. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Now, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! See if I care! Another doctor, another appointment... this is all so ridiculous. Just… ridiculous. I suppose it's better than nothing. And Dr. Albright always said I was a bit stubborn. But really, I just want this over with. My daughter... she'll be so disappointed. No, I don’t have any other questions. Just... thank you, I suppose. But frankly, I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill. Eighty-one years... and now this. .
