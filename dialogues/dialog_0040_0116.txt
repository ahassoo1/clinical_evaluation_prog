DOCTOR: Right. Genette Bilstein, 84. Okay. Well, let’s get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… my legs, mostly. They bother me something awful at night. Cramps, you see. Just… awful squeezing pains. It’s been going on for a bit now, but it’s getting harder to ignore. I don’t rightly recall when it started, dear. A while. A good while.
DOCTOR: Right. Leg cramps. “A good while.” That’s… helpful. Are these cramps in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, both, I think. Yes, both legs. Though sometimes one is worse than the other. Hard to say which, really. They just… seize up. It wakes me up at night, you see. Quite unpleasant. I used to stretch them out, but that doesn't seem to help much anymore. Do you… need me to be more specific? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Stretching… okay. And where exactly on your legs are you feeling these cramps?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Everywhere, I suppose. Mostly in the calves, I think. The back of my legs. Sometimes up higher, in the thighs, but mostly the calves. It's a squeezing feeling, like a tight band. It’s hard to pinpoint, dear. They just hurt. Do you... does that make sense? It's not one specific spot, it sort of travels around.
DOCTOR: Okay, calves, thighs… traveling pain. Any other symptoms alongside the cramps?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I recall. No swelling, no numbness… just the pain. It doesn't feel hot or anything. Sometimes my feet feel a little cold, but that's mostly just because of the house, I suspect. It gets drafty, you see. I don't know if that’s related, though. It just… hurts. A lot. Is there something wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Right. No swelling, no numbness. Cold feet… likely just the house. Have you tried anything else for the cramps besides stretching?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My daughter, bless her heart, she told me to drink more water. I’ve been trying to do that. And I’ve been taking a little walk each day, but it doesn’t seem to make much difference. Used to help, but… not anymore. I don't take any other medicines, Doctor. Just a little bit of something for my arthritis, but that’s all. Does that matter? I’m afraid I can’t remember what it’s called.
DOCTOR: Arthritis medication… Okay. And how long have you been having arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time, dear. Years and years. Since before… well, before my husband passed, certainly. It’s mostly in my hands, you see. Makes it hard to do things sometimes. But the leg cramps are… newer, I think. Or maybe they’re just worse now. It's difficult to keep track. I don't recall when the pain really started bothering me. Everything just sort of… blurs together after a while, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Right. So, leg cramps, worsening over… some time. No other symptoms. Let me just take a quick look at your legs. Can you hop up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Though I’m not as nimble as I used to be. Here we go… careful now. It’s a bit of a climb, you see. Slow and steady. Is this alright?
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not unusual for your age. No significant swelling or redness. Calves are firm, but nothing alarming. Do the cramps happen when you're resting, or when you're active?
PATIENT: Oh, mostly when I’m resting, I think. At night, in bed, mostly. Though sometimes they happen when I’m sitting for too long, watching television. But usually when I'm trying to sleep. That’s when they’re the worst, you see. Keeps me up half the night. It’s very bothersome. Is there something seriously wrong, Doctor? I'm a bit worried.
DOCTOR: Okay. Resting cramps, mostly at night. I'm thinking it could be restless legs syndrome or just simple nocturnal leg cramps, often related to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances. I'm going to order some blood work to check your potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels, just to be safe. We'll rule out anything serious. And I want you to try taking a magnesium supplement before bed – 200-400mg. See if that helps.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood work, you say? And a supplement. Alright. Is that the little pill kind? I have trouble with the big ones, you see. And will the blood work take long? I have a luncheon next week, and I wouldn't want to miss that. And…what about the luncheon? Will it interfere? I'm not good with all these medical things, dear. It makes me quite anxious.
DOCTOR: Yes, the pills. They come in small pills. And the blood work won’t take long. Just a quick draw. Shouldn’t interfere with your luncheon. The lab will give you the results. If it's still bothering you after a week with the magnesium, come back and we can discuss other options. Anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, well… I suppose that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you. It's kind of you to look into it. I just… I hate being bothered with all of this, you see. It feels like I’m just falling apart. But thank you. And the magnesium… you said how much, exactly? Before bed?
DOCTOR: 200 to 400 milligrams before bed. And yes, it’s quite alright. Try that, and if you’re still having trouble, give the office a call. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Oh. Well, thank you again, Doctor. Good day to you, too. 200 to 400 milligrams… before bed… I hope I can remember all that.
