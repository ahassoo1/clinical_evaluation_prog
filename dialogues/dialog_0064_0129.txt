DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let's get this over with. It’s my… well, it’s my stool. It’s black. Been taking these pain pills for years, you know, for my arthritis, and now it's black. It's probably nothing, but my daughter insisted I come. Honestly, doctors these days… always fussing over something.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to rush, but I understand you want to get to the bottom of this quickly. Black stool, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, black! Like… tar. Not bright red, thankfully, but still. And it's been going on for… oh, a week or so, maybe? Honestly, I don't pay that much attention to things like that unless it's really bad. I've had worse, believe me. Spent years fixing engines, you see. That was messy.
DOCTOR: A week, alright. And you mentioned taking pain pills for your arthritis for some time now. Can you tell me which pain pills those are, Dawnetta?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… they’re the little white ones… no, the yellow ones. No, wait! They’re pink! Ugh, this is ridiculous. My memory isn’t that bad. It's… Naproxen, I think? Yes, Naproxen. 500 milligrams. Two of them, twice a day. Been on them for… well, longer than I care to admit, frankly. It helps with the pain, and that’s all that matters.
DOCTOR: Naproxen, 500 milligrams twice a day. Okay. And have you noticed any other changes along with the black stool?
PATIENT: Changes? Like what? Look, I'm not going to list every single thing I eat, or don't eat, or feel. It's just black stool. Is it serious? Because if it isn't, I'd really like to get going. I have a casserole in the oven. A nice apple one. It needs watching.
DOCTOR: I understand. No need to list everything, Dawnetta. Just trying to get a full picture. Have you felt any weakness, dizziness, or fatigue lately?
PATIENT: Weakness? No. I'm as strong as I ever was, thank you very much. Still out-lift my grandson, and he's a big boy. Dizziness, no. Fatigue… well, I'm 73, of course I get tired sometimes! That’s just old age, isn't it? I haven't been collapsing or anything, if that's what you're asking. Honestly, I just want to know if this stool business is something to worry about, or if I can get back to my casserole.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just to be thorough, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs and feel your abdomen, if that’s alright. It will only take a few moments. That way, I can get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Fine. Get it over with. Just don't take too long, alright? And be gentle. I bruise easily. Honestly, I’ve had more thorough examinations from mechanics checking my car. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing deeply for me… and relax. Alright. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is… slightly tender in the lower region, but no significant masses or rigidity. I don't hear any unusual sounds either. Blood pressure is 130/80, and pulse is 72. Now, black stool can be caused by several things. The Naproxen can sometimes cause gastrointestinal bleeding, but there are other possibilities. Given your age and the tenderness I felt, I think it’s best to run a few tests to be on the safe side. How does a stool test to check for blood sound?
PATIENT: A stool test? Honestly. More fussing. Is it going to be one of those unpleasant ones? I swear, they just want to make your life miserable. Look, I’ve lived a long life, I’ve had worse things happen than a bit of black stool. But fine. If it'll get me out of here, yes. Do the test. But I want the results fast. And I expect a full explanation. No fancy doctor talk, alright? I need to know if I'm dying, or if I can just go back to my casserole.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta. We’ll get this done as quickly as possible. It’s a simple test, and we’ll send it to the lab right away. It’s not usually unpleasant, just requires a small sample. We'll also do a quick blood test to check your iron levels, just to be thorough. As for explaining the results, I promise I'll keep it simple and straightforward. No medical jargon, just the facts. We’ll get the results back within a couple of days. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you temporarily stop taking the Naproxen, if that's alright. We can discuss alternatives to manage your arthritis pain once we have the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Stop taking the Naproxen? Oh, for goodness sake. That’s just wonderful. Now my arthritis will flare up. You doctors never think things through, do you? Alright, fine. I'll stop the pills. But if I'm in agony, I'm coming back here and I’m holding you personally responsible. And a couple of days? That’s an eternity! Is there absolutely no way to get them back quicker? Honestly… Alright. Let's just get this over with. Where do I go for these tests? And please, make it quick. My casserole is depending on me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the pain, and we can certainly discuss options for managing that once we have the test results. And I’ll see what I can do to expedite the lab work. I’ll put a note on the request emphasizing the urgency. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. The front desk can provide instructions on how to collect the stool sample. The blood draw will be done right here in the examination room. Once you’ve completed both tests, the lab will send the results directly to me. They should be available within 48 hours, but I’ll do my best to get them back to you sooner. Do you have any questions before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just get it over with. And tell the lab people to be gentle, alright? I don't need any more fussing. Right. I’m going. And I expect a phone call the instant the results are back. Don't keep me waiting. My casserole… well, you wouldn’t understand. .
