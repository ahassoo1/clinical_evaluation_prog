DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… something down there. A little… leak, you could say. Been happenin’ for a bit now. Not sure how long, really. Things get fuzzy, you know? It's just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: “Fuzzy,” you say. Right. And when you say “down there,” are we discussing vaginal discharge, Ms. Genard?
PATIENT: Vaginal? Oh, no, no. Not me. It’s… him. My friend, Tony. He’s got the leak. He asked me to come in 'cause… well, he doesn't like doctors. Too many questions, he says. It's comin' from… you know… there. Between his legs. Is that what you wanted to know? Honestly, I don't know what it is, just that it's wet. And smells a little funny, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, with all due respect, you’ve come to an Internal Medicine physician, and are discussing a male patient’s…genital issue. I specialize in the internal organs of people, not…friends. While I appreciate you bringing this to my attention, I am not equipped to assess Tony’s condition. He really should see a doctor himself. A urologist would be the appropriate specialist. Perhaps I could provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: A… a urologist? What is that? Sounds fancy. He just said it was botherin' him and I told him I’d take care of it. He doesn't like goin' to doctors, I told you! Honestly, all these specialists… back in my day, you just went to the doctor. One doctor! Is it… serious? Should I be worried? He’s a good friend, you know. Doesn’t have many people lookin’ out for him.
DOCTOR: A urologist specializes in the male reproductive and urinary systems, Ms. Genard. It's quite a specific field. And yes, while I understand your friend isn't keen on seeking medical attention, this could be a number of things, some of which require prompt treatment. I cannot diagnose him over the phone, or through your description. Frankly, attempting to do so would be irresponsible. A persistent leak, as you describe it, could indicate an infection, a prostate issue, or something else entirely. It's best to have him evaluated properly. I can certainly provide you with a list of urologists in the area. Do you have his insurance information, or is he also uninsured?
PATIENT: Uninsured. Definitely uninsured. Tony doesn’t trust those things. Says they’re a waste of money. He usually just… ignores things, you know? If it hurts real bad, he takes some of that… what’s it called… ibuprofen? Is that enough? I don't know much about medicine, Doctor. He just asked me to come 'cause I’m… well, I’m good at talkin’ to people. I can explain things, make 'em less scary. But I can't fix him, and I sure don't know what a urologist does! Can you just tell me if it's gonna kill him? That's all I really need to know. Is it something dangerous?
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, I understand your concern, but I cannot provide a diagnosis based on second-hand information and a vague description of symptoms. To say whether something is “going to kill him” is not only unprofessional, but frankly, impossible without a proper examination and likely some testing. Ignoring a medical issue, particularly one involving discharge, is never a good idea. Because Tony is uninsured, I can direct you to some free or low-cost clinics in the area that have urologists on staff. Would you like that information?
PATIENT: Free clinics? Hmm. He might go to one of those. He’s stubborn, that Tony. Real stubborn. Okay, yes. Give me the information. Free is good. But… will they really help? He says doctors just want your money. He doesn’t trust 'em, you know? But… if it’s serious, I guess he’ll have to try. Write it down real clear, okay? He doesn't like complicated things. Just the name and address. And maybe a phone number.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Ms. Genard. I’ve listed three clinics that offer urology services and accept patients regardless of insurance status. The addresses and phone numbers are clearly printed. I strongly urge Tony to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. While I appreciate your concern for your friend, I must reiterate that I cannot provide any further medical advice without examining him myself. My expertise lies in the internal organs of people, and this situation is outside of my scope of practice. Do you have any other questions for me, unrelated to Tony’s condition?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… patient with me. It's just… he's a good friend. And he gets scared easily. I just want to make sure he's okay. I’ll tell him about these places. Hopefully, he’ll listen to me this time. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Genard. I hope Tony seeks medical attention. Have a good day. .
