DOCTOR: Hello, Margret. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Thank you. It is nice to meet you too. I… I have been breathing… funny. Like a whistle. Especially when I walk. It makes me… tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, “breathing funny, like a whistle,” and especially with walking… and that's making you tired. Hmm. Can you tell me a little more about this whistling sound?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… hard to explain. It is not a cough. It comes from… deep inside. When I breathe out, mostly. And it is… louder when I have been walking up a hill. Or… if I try to hurry. It does not hurt, but it is… worrying. My daughter says I should come.
DOCTOR: So it's more noticeable when you exhale, especially with exertion like walking uphill or when you try to speed up. And it doesn't cause any pain, but it’s concerning you and your daughter. That's good she encouraged you to come in. Have you noticed this happening for a long time, or is it something relatively new?
PATIENT: It is… new. Maybe… three weeks? At first, it was just after a long walk. But now… even when I go to the store, if I carry too many bags, I hear it. Before, I could walk anywhere. Now… I try not to. It makes me sad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been about three weeks, and it's gradually getting worse – starting with longer walks and now happening with less exertion, even carrying groceries. And it’s understandably making you feel a bit down. Have you had any other symptoms along with this whistling sound?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever. No cough, like I said. Sometimes… my chest feels… tight. Not always. Just… sometimes after I walk. And… I get a little dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, but… like the room is spinning a little. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all important, thank you for telling me. Chest tightness sometimes after walking, and a little dizziness – not severe enough to fall, but a spinning sensation. Now, just to get a better picture of things, have you had any heart problems in the past?
PATIENT: No. No heart problems. My husband… he had some problems. But I have not. I walk a lot. I used to be a trainer, you see. For athletes. Now… not so much. But I have always been healthy. I eat good food. I do not smoke. I just… this breathing. It scares me.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. So, no history of heart problems yourself, and you’ve been generally healthy and active, even up until recently. That’s helpful. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and maybe check your oxygen levels with a little clip on your finger. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what is happening. The clip on the finger… does it hurt? I do not like needles.
DOCTOR: No, the clip doesn’t hurt at all. It just gently goes on your fingertip and measures your oxygen level – completely painless. No needles involved, I promise. If you could just sit up here for me, that would be great. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope.
PATIENT: Alright. Here. I hope I am not too much trouble. I used to tell my patients how to sit… now look at me.
DOCTOR: Not at all, you’re doing perfectly fine. It’s my job to make sure you’re comfortable. Okay… take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. I’m hearing… a slight wheeze in your lower lungs, mostly on the left side. It's not very prominent, but it's there. And your heart rate is a little elevated, which could be from the walking, or… we’ll see. Now, let’s check your oxygen level with this little clip. Your oxygen level is 93%. That's a little on the lower end of normal, but not terribly concerning right now.
PATIENT: 93… is that bad? My daughter, she always worries about numbers. Is that why I am tired? The wheeze… is that the whistling sound? I just want to be able to walk again.
DOCTOR: 93% is a little lower than we’d like to see, but it’s not drastically low, and it could be normal for you. It’s good we’re checking it, though. It's possible the wheeze is the source of the whistling sound you're describing. It’s a sign that your airways are a little narrowed, which can make breathing harder and cause that sound. The tiredness could definitely be related. When your airways are constricted, your body has to work harder to get oxygen, which can leave you feeling fatigued. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I think it would be helpful to get a chest X-ray. That will help us rule out anything serious and see if there's anything else contributing to your symptoms. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray… I do not know. Are there… bad radiations? I have heard things. But… if it helps me walk again… yes. I think so. I do not want to be a burden. My daughter does so much already.
DOCTOR: That's a very fair question. X-rays do use a small amount of radiation, but it’s a very low dose, and the benefits of finding out what’s going on usually outweigh the risks. Modern X-ray machines use the lowest dose possible. And we always use lead aprons to protect other parts of your body. I completely understand your concern, and we wouldn’t recommend it if we didn’t think it was necessary. It will really help us get to the bottom of this and make sure you get the right treatment. Okay, let's go ahead and schedule that X-ray. Then, we can review the results together and discuss the best plan to get you back to walking comfortably. Would you like me to explain the process?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain it to me. I do not want any surprises. My daughter likes to tell me things step-by-step. It makes me feel better. And… thank you. You are very kind. It is scary, feeling like you are losing things. Like your strength.
DOCTOR: Of course. You're very welcome. It is scary feeling like you're losing things, and I want to make sure you feel as comfortable and informed as possible. Okay, so for the X-ray, you'll go down the hall to the radiology department. You’ll sit or stand in front of a special machine. A technician will position you so we can get a clear picture of your lungs. You’ll need to remain very still for a few seconds while the picture is taken. It doesn’t hurt at all. The technician will be behind a protective shield, and they'll give you instructions throughout the process. It usually takes about 5-10 minutes total. Then, the radiologist will look at the images and send a report to me. I'll review it carefully and discuss the findings with you as soon as I have them. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes. That does not sound too bad. A few minutes. Stillness. I can do stillness. And a technician… they will tell me what to do. I always worry about doing it wrong. But if they tell me… that is good. Okay. Let’s do it. I want to walk again. Even if it is just to the store.
DOCTOR: That's the spirit! And you will walk again. We'll figure this out together. Here's the order. The receptionist will schedule the appointment for you before you leave. They’ll also let you know where to go in the radiology department. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity that makes you feel short of breath. And if you experience any new symptoms, like a fever or severe chest pain, please call the office right away. Now, do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. You have explained everything very well. And… thank you. You have made me feel much better. I was very scared. Now… I have a plan. That is good. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Margret. That’s my job. And you're right, having a plan is always a good thing. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. And I look forward to seeing you again to discuss the results. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
