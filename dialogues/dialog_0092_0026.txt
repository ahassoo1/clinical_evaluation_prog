DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Giganti, you said? Well, it’s this tiredness, see. Just… wears me right out. And the young man at the lab, he said something about my numbers being… off. Creatine… something. Honestly, I don't keep up with all that. It’s just… exhausting, this whole thing.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Oitker. It sounds frustrating to be dealing with this tiredness and to have lab results that are concerning without a clear explanation. Let's try to get to the bottom of it. I see here you had some lab work done recently. You mentioned creatine levels being off – do you recall when those were checked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When? Everything’s a bit of a blur these days. I think… maybe last week? Or was it the week before? Honestly, Doctor, I go to so many appointments with my husband, and then I have appointments… it all just runs together. The nice lady drew blood, that’s all I really remember. She said it was for… muscles, I think. Something about my muscles?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Oitker. It's easy to get dates mixed up with multiple appointments. We'll figure it out. Okay, I see here the Creatinine level was indeed elevated on July 24th. It was 1.8 mg/dL. Normal range for someone your age is typically between 0.5 and 1.2 mg/dL. Now, this can indicate a problem with your kidneys, but it can also be caused by other things like dehydration, certain medications, or even a high protein diet. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about your usual fluid intake?
PATIENT: Oh, kidneys! Now, don’t tell me I’ve got something wrong with my kidneys. My mother, bless her soul, she had terrible kidney trouble. Just awful. I try to drink water, you know, like they say. But it’s not like I’m constantly sipping on it. I prefer a nice cup of tea, really. Several cups, actually. And a little bit of juice with my breakfast. Is tea bad for kidneys? It’s the only thing that settles my stomach these days.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your mother, Ms. Oitker. It’s natural to be worried when there’s a family history of a condition. We’re not saying you have kidney trouble, just exploring possibilities. Tea itself isn't necessarily bad for the kidneys, but some types have compounds that could affect hydration, and frequent tea drinking might contribute to slightly higher creatinine levels. Now, besides the tiredness and the elevated creatinine, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, goodness. Let me think. My joints ache a bit, you know, getting old isn’t for the faint of heart. And I seem to be… well, I’m a bit winded if I walk up the stairs. Nothing major, though. Just… old age, I suppose. My husband keeps telling me I need more rest. He’s a worrier, that one. And sometimes my ankles swell up a bit at the end of the day. Is that a symptom? I’ve been wearing these support stockings, though, they help a bit. Honestly, Doctor, I’m probably just being a fussbudget.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re sharing all of this, Ms. Oitker, even if you think it’s just “fussbudgeting.” All these details are important. Joint aches, shortness of breath, and ankle swelling can be related to kidney function, but they can also be caused by other things like arthritis, heart conditions, or just general deconditioning. Now, have you been taking any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens, let me see. I take something for my blood pressure, a little white pill. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me I was low. And… oh, yes! I take this herbal tea for my nerves. It's got chamomile in it, and something else… lavender, I think. My neighbor swears by it, says it helps her sleep. And sometimes, if I’m really achy, I take ibuprofen. Just a couple, when I need it. Does ibuprofen do anything to… those kidney things? Honestly, Doctor, I’m just trying to get through the day. It all feels so overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so thorough, Ms. Oitker. That's very helpful. Ibuprofen, like other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , can sometimes affect kidney function, especially with regular use. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. My doctor mentioned something about my blood sugar being a little high a few years ago, but he said it wasn't anything to worry about, just watch my diet. And I’ve got arthritis, definitely. In my hands, mostly. It flares up sometimes, makes it hard to open jars. And... I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but that was years ago. I don’t really remember much about it. It’s all a bit of a blur, you know. My memory just isn’t what it used to be. Is this important? Are we talking about serious things? I get so anxious sometimes.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Oitker, and you’re right to share all of this. The history of slightly elevated blood sugar and the arthritis are both relevant. And the pneumonia, while in the past, is good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for other reasons?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. That was… unpleasant. And I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist. Fell down the stairs, silly of me. And… oh, yes! When I gave birth to my son, of course. That was… a long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, I have so many memories, it’s hard to keep track of everything. Are you writing all this down? I hope so, because I certainly can't remember it all! Is this going to take much longer? I have a bridge game this afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am writing everything down, Ms. Oitker, so don’t you worry. Your history is very important. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, really. I get a bit of a rash sometimes if I touch certain flowers, but that’s just a little irritation. And I can’t eat shellfish, makes me terribly sick. But that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… doesn’t agree with me. Honestly, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I’ve always been a pretty healthy person, despite my aches and pains. Are we almost finished? I really should be getting home soon. That bridge game won't wait forever.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies. That’s good to know. Alright, Ms. Oitker, thank you for all of that information. It’s very helpful. Now, based on what you've told me and the lab results, it sounds like you’re experiencing fatigue, likely with some contributing factors. The elevated creatinine is a concern, and we need to investigate that further to rule out any kidney problems. It’s important to address your joint pain as well, and your report of ankle swelling is noted. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some additional blood work. This will include a more comprehensive kidney function panel and some tests to rule out other potential causes of fatigue. I also want to check your blood sugar levels again.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More blood work? Honestly, I'm starting to feel like a pin cushion. But alright, if you think it's necessary. But will it take long? And will it interfere with my bridge game? I’ve got a partner, you see, and we’re trying to qualify for the regional tournament. And what about those kidneys? Are you really worried about my kidneys? This is all very unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Oitker. It’s never pleasant to have repeated blood draws, and I apologize for that. The blood work shouldn’t take long, just a few minutes at the lab. I’ll write the order for you, and you can go whenever it's convenient for you, and it shouldn’t interfere with your bridge game, unless the lab is particularly busy. Regarding your kidneys, I'm not saying you definitely have kidney problems, but it's important to investigate the elevated creatinine to be sure. It could be something simple like dehydration, but we need to rule out anything more serious. The additional tests will help us determine the cause. While we are waiting for the results, I recommend increasing your fluid intake – aim for at least 6-8 glasses of water a day. And please avoid taking ibuprofen unless absolutely necessary. We can discuss alternative pain relief options. Are you agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. More water, less ibuprofen. I suppose I can manage that. It's just… all this fuss! I used to be so active, you know. Gardening, walking, playing with my grandchildren. Now, I just feel… tired all the time. And what if it is something serious with my kidneys? What then? Will I have to go on dialysis? My neighbor, bless her heart, she had dialysis for years. It sounded awful. I really don’t want to end up like her. Doctor, please tell me it's nothing serious. It’s just the tiredness, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Oitker, and it’s perfectly natural to be worried about the possibility of something serious. Let’s not jump to conclusions before we have the results of the tests. Dialysis is a treatment for severe kidney failure, and we are far from knowing if that is necessary in your case. Most likely, if there is an issue, it can be managed with medication, diet changes, and close monitoring. We'll address things one step at a time. Right now, our priority is to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I am going to write a referral to a nephrologist – a kidney specialist – as a precaution. That way, if the results do indicate a kidney problem, you’ll already have an appointment scheduled. It doesn’t mean you’ll automatically see the specialist, just that we'll have the option if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A specialist… oh, goodness. More doctors. I seem to be collecting doctors like stamps these days. But alright, if you think it’s best. It’s just… all this fuss. I wish I could just go back to gardening. So, I get more blood work, and you’re sending me to a kidney doctor, just in case. And I’m supposed to drink more water and stop taking the ibuprofen. Is that everything? Can I go now? I really do need to get home before my husband starts worrying. He gets very anxious when I’m gone too long. And he’ll be expecting me to make the bridge snacks. It’s a whole production, you know. Doctor, are you sure there's nothing else I need to do? Are you sure it’s not just the tiredness?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Oitker, that summarizes everything for now. More blood work, increased fluid intake, avoid ibuprofen, and a referral to the nephrologist as a precaution. I understand your desire to get home, and I want to assure you that we are doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this. To reiterate, it’s highly likely that the tiredness has a simple explanation. But we are ruling out all possibilities to ensure we provide the best possible care. I will call you with the results of the blood work as soon as they are available, typically within a few days. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as significant swelling, difficulty breathing, or a change in urine output, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… try not to worry me too much, alright? My husband gets very upset when I’m anxious. He’s a good man, but… he worries a lot. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. I suppose I’ll go now. And you try to have a good day. Don’t work too hard.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Oitker. I’ll do my best to keep you informed. And you take care of yourself, and try to relax. I wish you all the best with your bridge game. .
