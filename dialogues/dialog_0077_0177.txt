DOCTOR: Good morning, Jimmi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh… morning. Doctor, right? Well, it’s… down there. Something’s… leaking. It’s not good. I don’t like it. Been happening a little while now. Not sure how long, honestly. Old lady problems, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Down there”... Alright. And when you say leaking, could you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Describe? Like… wet. It’s… kinda slimy. Not blood, not much anyway. Just… stuff. It smells funny too. Like… old fish, maybe? I try to keep it clean, but it keeps… happening. It's embarrassing, you know? A lady shouldn’t have to deal with this.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your embarrassment, Jimmi. It’s certainly not something anyone wants to experience. And it’s good you’re trying to keep the area clean. “Slimy” and a “funny smell, like old fish”... that’s helpful. Now, has this been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I… well, when I’m resting. Or after. Not all the time, thank goodness. Sometimes a day or two it's fine, then… poof. There it is again. It doesn't hurt, really. Just… icky. And the smell! My goodness. I use soap, but it doesn’t get rid of it.
DOCTOR: Alright, “comes and goes, mostly with resting or afterwards, no pain, but… icky and a persistent smell.” Now, Jimmi, have you noticed any changes in your urination – frequency, urgency, any burning sensation?
PATIENT: Urination? Let me think… I go… you know… when I need to. Maybe a little more often lately, but I drink a lot of water. Old age, probably. No burning. Never that. Just… regular. Like always, mostly. I don’t pay too much attention to that stuff, honestly. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay. No burning, frequency is perhaps slightly increased but related to water intake. Now, have you experienced any itching, redness, or sores in that area?
PATIENT: Itching… sometimes. Not a lot. Just… a little tickle. Like bugs crawling, maybe. But it goes away. Redness? I don’t think so. I try to look, but it's hard to see. My eyes aren’t what they used to be, you know? No sores, no. Definitely no sores. I’d know about sores. That’d be… bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, “occasional itching, no redness, no sores.” Now, Jimmi, and please don't feel embarrassed, have you been sexually active recently?
PATIENT: Well now! What kind of question is that? I’m an old lady! What do you think? Of course not! Haven’t been with anyone in… well, a long time. A very long time. That's not what's bothering me, I assure you. Honestly!
DOCTOR: I apologize if that question was inappropriate, Jimmi. It’s simply part of a thorough examination to rule out all possibilities. I assure you, it wasn’t meant to offend. Now, let’s move on. Have you noticed any changes in your vaginal discharge before this leaking started?
PATIENT: Vaginal discharge? You’re asking a lot of personal questions, Doctor. I'm telling you, it's leaking. That's the problem! I don't think about vaginal discharge. I just keep things… tidy. Things were fine before, and now they're not. I don't understand why we need to talk about all this… stuff. Just fix the leaking, please.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jimmi. And I apologize again if I'm asking too many personal questions. It's just that understanding the entire picture is important. It helps me determine the best course of action, and to ensure we don't miss anything. Now, to help me get a clearer idea, would you mind if I just took a quick look?
PATIENT: A look? You want to look down there? Oh, no. Absolutely not. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor, and I don't appreciate strangers looking at… that. No. Just tell me what I need to do to make it stop leaking. Pills? Cream? Something. I’m not letting you poke around.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jimmi. Your comfort is my priority. A physical exam is often helpful, but it's absolutely not required if you're not comfortable. Given that I haven't been able to do an exam, and based on what you've told me – the leaking, the smell, and the occasional itching – it could be a number of things. It could be a vaginal infection, or potentially a mild prolapse. Without a proper examination, it's difficult to say for certain. Given your age and lack of insurance, I would suggest a course of treatment for a potential vaginal infection, just to rule that out. I can prescribe a topical cream, but I want to be clear – if this doesn’t improve within a week, or if it gets worse, you must seek further evaluation. Would you be agreeable to trying a topical cream, and then following up with me if it doesn't resolve the issue?
PATIENT: Cream… alright. If it’s just a cream. I don’t want anything complicated. And no poking, you hear? If it doesn’t work, then I don’t know what I’ll do. I don't have money for fancy tests. Just… make it stop leaking. That’s all I ask. And please, write down the instructions clearly. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jimmi. I’m prescribing a topical cream called Metronidazole, which is commonly used for vaginal infections. Here are the instructions, printed in large type for you. It's a seven-day course. Insert one applicatorful each night for seven nights. It’s important to finish the entire course, even if your symptoms improve before then. And, as I mentioned, if this doesn’t improve within a week, or if you experience any new symptoms – such as pain, fever, or heavy bleeding – please contact me immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions about the cream or the instructions?
PATIENT: Metronidazole… seven days… each night… Hmm. Sounds… complicated. Okay. No poking, right? And if it gets worse, go to the emergency room. Okay, okay. I think I got it. Honestly, all this talk just makes me nervous. I just want to be normal again. Thank you, Doctor. I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jimmi. And no, no poking! I understand your nervousness, and I hope the cream helps. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best. .
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You too. I hope this works. I really do. Leaking… honestly. Old age. It's terrible.
