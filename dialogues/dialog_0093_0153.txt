DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, hello. Um… something about a check-up? For… work, I think. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. Something about needing to be cleared for… performances? Yes, that’s it. They sent me. I just want to get this over with quickly, if that’s alright. It’s hard for me to remember details these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. No need to worry about details being fuzzy; we'll take our time and get everything sorted. A work clearance check-up, then, specifically related to performances. That’s perfectly alright. To help me understand what’s needed for this clearance, could you tell me a little bit about the nature of these performances?
PATIENT: Performances… Oh dear. That’s… tricky. I’ve done a bit of everything, over the years. Mostly front of house, you see. Ushering, taking tickets… sometimes helping people find their seats in the lobby. It wasn’t very… strenuous, if that makes sense. Just a lot of standing, I suppose. And smiling. Lots and lots of smiling. I don't really perform perform, you know? More… facilitate the performance. Does that… clarify things? I'm sorry, it's all so vague.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krahn, that clarifies things considerably. So, primarily standing and assisting patrons – a role involving a good deal of customer interaction. That’s very helpful. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health and ensure you’re fit for this role, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Significant illnesses… Hmm. Well, I had the flu a few times, I suppose. Nothing major. And I broke my wrist when I was a boy, climbing a tree. That needed a cast, but it healed alright. I… honestly don’t remember anything else serious. I saw a doctor regularly for a while, when my wife was sick, but that was years ago. She had… heart trouble. It's all a bit of a blur, I'm afraid. I’m not very good with dates or specifics. Would it help if I had someone with me? Someone who remembers better?
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Krahn. We’ll proceed at your pace, and it’s perfectly acceptable if details are unclear. The flu and a childhood wrist fracture – good to know. And I understand the difficulty recalling past medical events, especially during emotionally challenging times. Regarding your wife’s heart trouble, that must have been a difficult time. Did you ever discuss any family history of heart disease with her doctors, or perhaps have any knowledge of it on either side of your family?
PATIENT: Yes, it was… very difficult. She saw a specialist for years. I… think she mentioned something about her father having high blood pressure. And maybe an uncle with… palpitations? Something like that. It wasn’t a clear-cut history, though. Lots of talk, lots of tests… I mostly drove her to the appointments and tried to be supportive. I wasn't really the one asking the questions. She was very organized, you see. She always took care of things like that. I’m just trying to recall what I overheard, really. It was a long time ago. I'm sorry I'm not more helpful. Is this… important? For the clearance?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Mr. Krahn. Knowing about the potential family history of high blood pressure and palpitations is valuable information. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything concerning, but it’s good to be aware of. Now, just to complete a general picture, do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. I don't take anything. Never have, really. I always believed in letting the body heal itself, if possible. A bit of rest, a good diet… that’s always been my approach. I take a multivitamin occasionally, just to be on the safe side, but that's it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, though. Just… something I picked up at the drugstore. It might be expired, actually. I should probably check. I’m not very good at keeping track of these things. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Krahn. No current medications is helpful information. And it’s perfectly alright if that multivitamin is expired; we’re more focused on anything regularly prescribed. Now, are you allergic to anything – medications, foods, or environmental factors like pollen or animals?
PATIENT: Hmm. Allergies… Let me think. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle during pollen season, but nothing serious. And I like cats, actually. Always have. I used to have a tabby when I was a boy. Lovely creature. So, no, I don’t believe I have any allergies. Unless… is a sensitivity to dust considered an allergy? I sometimes cough a bit when I'm cleaning. But that's probably just… old age. Is that important? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Krahn, you're not rambling at all. It’s perfectly normal to be thorough when discussing your health. And no, a slight cough during cleaning likely isn’t a significant allergy. Now, before we move on to a brief physical examination, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… oh dear. What does that even mean? I… I live alone now, in a small apartment. I mostly keep to myself. I enjoy reading, when my eyes allow. And I like to take walks in the park, when the weather is nice. I try to eat healthy, but I confess I have a weakness for sweets. It’s hard to resist a good pastry, you know? Not very active, I suppose. Definitely not a gym person. Is that what you mean by lifestyle? I mostly just… exist, peacefully. And try not to bother anyone.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krahn, that’s precisely what I meant. It gives me a better understanding of your daily routines. It sounds like you enjoy a quiet and peaceful life. Now, to get a better picture of your current health, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination. It’s nothing to be concerned about, just a standard check-up. We’ll start with your height and weight, then listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. As long as it’s quick, Doctor. I appreciate you being so patient with my… foggy memory. I’m not very good with medical things, you see. I always leave that to the experts. Just… try not to poke around too much, if you don’t mind. And let me know if you need me to do anything. I tend to get flustered easily. Fine, let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. We'll proceed at your pace, and I assure you it will be a gentle examination. I will explain everything as we go. First, let's get your height and weight. If you could step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: There we go. It feels… a bit rickety. I haven't weighed myself in ages, to be honest. Probably shouldn't have had that pastry this morning. Is it telling you anything interesting? I’m afraid my balance isn't what it used to be. Stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Your height is approximately 199 centimeters, and your weight is 118 pounds. That gives us a BMI of… approximately 29.8. It falls into the overweight category, but we'll discuss that later. It’s important to remember this is just one factor in your overall health. Now, if you’d be comfortable, could you please have a seat on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. This is… surprisingly cold. And hard. I much prefer my armchair at home. Oh dear. Are we going to be doing this for long? I hope not. I get chilly easily, you see. I feel a bit… vulnerable up here. Don't mind me rambling again, Doctor. I'm just… a bit of an old man. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. We won’t be long. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Could you please take a deep breath for me, and then exhale slowly?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It feels a bit strange, having someone listen to my insides. I always thought stethoscopes were a bit… intimidating. Are you hearing anything… bad? I’m afraid my chest has been a bit tight lately, especially when I walk uphill. But that’s probably just my age, isn’t it? I’m not one to complain, you know. Just tell me if there’s something seriously wrong, Doctor. I can handle the truth. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. I’m hearing a slightly diminished breath sound on both lower lobes, which could be due to a number of factors. We may want to investigate that further with a chest X-ray, just to rule anything out. Your heart rhythm is regular, but a bit faint. I'd like to check your blood pressure now. Just relax your arm, please. This might feel a little tight, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Oh dear, that is a bit tight. Are you sure it’s not too tight? I have circulation problems, you see. My legs swell up sometimes, especially in the evenings. Is that something I should be concerned about? It always feels like my blood is struggling to get through. Maybe we should skip this part? I'm starting to feel a bit faint… and I'm really not good with constricted spaces. Is the number going to be bad? Just tell me quickly, so I can prepare myself. Stop.
DOCTOR: You're right to tell me, Mr. Krahn. It seems the cuff is a bit uncomfortable for you, and we don't want to cause any distress. We'll skip the blood pressure measurement for now. I apologize for the discomfort. Given your history of swelling and your concerns about circulation, and the diminished breath sounds, I think it's best to proceed with some further investigations. Would you be comfortable with a chest X-ray and an EKG to check your heart function?
PATIENT: Oh, an X-ray and an EKG… that sounds… serious. Are you sure it’s necessary? I always try to avoid medical procedures if possible. I'm a bit claustrophobic, you see. And I don’t like radiation. Is there… any other way? Maybe just some rest and a good diet? I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed. This is all very stressful. I just wanted to get cleared for my work, not… become a medical case. I'm an old man, Doctor. Maybe it's just… old age catching up with me. Is there a chance you're overreacting? Stop.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those questions, Mr. Krahn. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed, and it’s important to address your concerns. While the diminished breath sounds and your history of swelling do warrant further investigation, we can certainly discuss the options. The X-ray would give us a clearer picture of your lungs, and the EKG would assess your heart's electrical activity. The radiation exposure from the X-ray is minimal, but I understand your concerns. We could potentially explore a referral to a cardiologist for an evaluation without immediate testing, if you prefer. However, delaying investigation could potentially delay diagnosis and treatment if there is something concerning. Given your concerns about claustrophobia and radiation, and wanting to avoid unnecessary procedures, I suggest we start with a referral to a cardiologist for a comprehensive assessment. They can discuss the best course of action based on your individual needs and preferences. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… That sounds… even more serious. But… I suppose it’s better than an X-ray. I don’t like being confined, you see. And I worry about radiation. If the cardiologist thinks it’s unnecessary, then I won’t have to do anything, right? Yes, a referral to a cardiologist sounds… acceptable. As long as they listen to me and don’t push me into anything I’m not comfortable with. And can they explain everything in plain English? I don’t understand all those medical terms. Is there a good one nearby? One who’s… patient with old men? And kind? And doesn’t rush? That would be… ideal. I'm an old man, Doctor. And I just want to get back to my quiet life. Stop.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krahn. I completely understand. I will refer you to Dr. Anya Sharma, a cardiologist at City General Hospital. She is known for her excellent bedside manner, takes the time to explain things thoroughly, and is very patient with her patients. I’ve worked with her before and she’s highly recommended. Here's the referral slip and her contact information. You can schedule an appointment at your convenience. She will discuss your concerns, review your medical history, and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant swelling in your legs – please don't hesitate to contact us or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Krahn?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all. You’ve been very… understanding. More understanding than I expected, actually. I appreciate you listening to my rambling and not pushing me into anything I wasn’t comfortable with. I suppose I should… be going now. Thank you for your help. And for referring me to Dr. Sharma. Hopefully, she’ll tell me I’m just an old man and can go back to my quiet life. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. It was my pleasure. Please, take your time. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. I hope Dr. Sharma provides you with the reassurance you need. .
