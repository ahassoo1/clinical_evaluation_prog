DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel, good to see you… I guess. Let’s get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Pehrson. It's nice to meet you too. I've got this headache, right in the back of my head. It's been bugging me for a little while now, nothin' too serious, but it won't quite go away, you know? It’s kinda… a dull ache, not a sharp pain.
DOCTOR: Dull ache, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's the best way to put it. It feels like… pressure, almost. Like someone’s tightening a band around my head, but just in the back. It comes and goes, mostly when I'm tryin' to concentrate on somethin', like my finances. Funny, huh? A financial advisor with a headache worryin' about his own money... and now his head!
DOCTOR: Finances, right. How long has this “pressure” been going on?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started maybe three weeks ago? Around the 15th of July, I reckon. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little twinge now and then. But it’s been gettin’ worse the last week or so. Not enough to stop me completely, but enough to be a real nuisance. I'm usually pretty good at focusin', gotta be for this job, you know? But this makes it hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks. And it’s worse with concentration. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really, not that I've noticed. No blurry vision, no dizziness… no fever, definitely not. I haven't been feelin' sick to my stomach or anything like that. Just the headache. Sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, but I thought that was just from sleepin' in a bad position. I’m an older fella, you know, things creak a little.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any past medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder taken out when I was… oh, goodness, must be forty years ago now. And I broke my wrist a few years back when I tripped over a rug. Nothing major, really. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Good Hmong blood, I always say! My wife… well, my ex-wife, she used to take care of all the doctor appointments. I’m not much for goin’ unless I really need to. She liked to worry, you see.
DOCTOR: Any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. I don't believe in takin' pills unless absolutely necessary. Always preferred a good cup of herbal tea if I was feelin' under the weather. My wife… again, my ex-wife… she tried to get me to take somethin’ for my blood pressure once, but I refused. I like to keep things natural, you see. I eat pretty well, mostly vegetables and rice. And a little bit of everything else, of course. Can’t deprive myself completely!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just do a quick exam, just to be sure. Can you stand up and let me check your reflexes?
PATIENT: Sure thing, Doctor. No problem at all. Just let me know what you need. Old bones ain’t as nimble as they used to be, but I can manage. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious, eh? I got clients waitin' on me this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes are… present. A little diminished, but that's to be expected at your age. Let me check your range of motion… turn your head slowly to the right… and now to the left. Good. Now, I'm gonna palpate your neck muscles… Tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Okay. A little tightness there, but nothing alarming. Blood pressure is… 140/90. A little elevated, but not critically so. I’m gonna listen to your heart and lungs, just for completeness. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… normal.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. Everything alright so far, then? It doesn’t feel too bad when you press, just a little stiff. I've been spendin' a lot of time lookin' at spreadsheets lately, maybe that’s it? I’m tellin’ you, the stress of finances can do a number on a fella. My ex-wife used to say I worried too much. She had a point, I guess. But someone's gotta look after people's money, right? Is that blood pressure somethin' I should worry about?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Gibbel, everything seems okay. It’s likely just tension headache, possibly related to stress and posture. The blood pressure is slightly elevated, but we can monitor it. I’m not going to prescribe anything right now. Just try to reduce stress, maintain a good posture, and get some rest. If it gets worse, or if you develop any new symptoms, come back. But honestly, I doubt it’s anything serious. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Well… that’s good to hear, I suppose. Less stress… easier said than done, Doctor, with the market the way it is. But I’ll try. And I’ll pay attention to my posture, you're right, I do slouch a bit when I'm workin’. Hmm… No, I guess I don’t have any questions right now. Just… thank you for takin' a look at me. I appreciate it. How much do I owe? And should I be worryin' about that blood pressure, really? Is it somethin' that could turn into somethin'… bad?
DOCTOR: The bill is… $125. And look, honestly, it’s not my biggest concern right now. It’s slightly elevated, you monitor it. If it keeps going up, then we talk about it. But right now, I don’t see a need for medication or further testing. I have other patients waiting. Just try to relax, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. $125… Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you squeezin' me in. I'll try to relax, I promise. And I'll keep an eye on that blood pressure. You have a good day now, Doctor Pehrson. And try to take a little time for yourself, too, eh? Seems like a stressful job. .
