DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, my chest... it hurts. Not all the time, but sometimes. It's... in my breast. It's a little strange, I know.
DOCTOR: A little strange is… an understatement, frankly. But we shall proceed. Can you describe this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm. It's not a sharp pain, more like... a heavy ache. Like when you use your muscles too much, but in my chest. And it's not always in the same spot. Sometimes it's more on the left side, sometimes on the right. It doesn't feel like... a bad pain, just... annoying. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Annoying is not a medical term, Mr. Bulaong. But I gather it’s intermittent. How long has this “annoying” ache been occurring?
PATIENT: Uh... maybe a couple weeks now? I think so. It comes and goes. It's hard to remember exactly. Things have been busy with work, you know? Roofing is hard work. I didn't think much of it at first, just figured it was from using my arms so much. But it hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: Roofing… yes. Physically demanding. And you haven’t noticed anything else accompanying this pain?
PATIENT: No... not really. No fever, no bumps, no... anything. Just the ache. Sometimes it feels a little tender to the touch, but not always. My wife, she checked, and she didn't feel anything strange, you know? Just a little sore when I told her it hurt.
DOCTOR: Your wife is not a medical professional, Mr. Bulaong. While I appreciate her input, we require more… objective data. Do you have any past medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've been pretty healthy, I think. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that healed fine. Nothing serious. No big illnesses, no surgeries. Just the usual colds sometimes. I don’t go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It's good to be healthy. Any family history of… cardiac issues?
PATIENT: Cardiac…? You mean… heart problems? Hmm. My father, he had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother… she had something with her chest, but I don't remember what. She was old. I don’t know much about her health, really. We didn’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure… and vague familial history. Alright. And do you smoke, Mr. Bulaong?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't smoke. Never have. My wife doesn't like it. And it's bad for you, you know? I drink sometimes, a beer or two with dinner, but not a lot. Mostly just water when I'm working. It gets hot on the roof.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let us proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I will need to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I will palpate your chest to assess the source of this discomfort. Please remove your shirt.
PATIENT: Okay… uh, alright. I can do that. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: It shouldn't, Mr. Bulaong. However, if you experience any sharp pain during palpation, inform me immediately. Let's begin. Take a deep breath… and exhale.
PATIENT: Okay… I’m breathing. It feels a little cold in here. Is it okay if I keep my shorts on?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bulaong, keep your shorts on. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Tenderness to palpation on the left pectoral region. No obvious masses. Mild tenderness noted here as well, but less pronounced. No visible inflammation or skin changes.
PATIENT: Okay... that didn't hurt too bad, just a little pressure. So... what does that mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? My wife is going to worry if I tell her I saw a doctor about my chest. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: It is unlikely to be anything overtly serious, Mr. Bulaong. However, given your occupation and the intermittent nature of the pain, my initial assessment points towards… musculoskeletal strain. Perhaps a mild inflammation of the intercostal muscles or pectoral tendons due to repetitive exertion. I would like to order a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying pulmonary issues, though I do not strongly suspect anything of that nature. And I will prescribe a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication to manage the discomfort. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I don’t think so. My wife gives me medicine sometimes when I have a cold, and I’ve never had a problem. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. But… what about the X-ray? Is that… safe? I don’t want to get sick from it. My wife says too much radiation is bad.
DOCTOR: The radiation exposure from a single chest X-ray is minimal, Mr. Bulaong. It is significantly less than, for example, a cross-country flight. It is a standard diagnostic procedure to ensure we are not overlooking anything. Your wife, while well-intentioned, is likely misinformed. No known allergies. Ordering chest X-ray and prescribing naproxen 500mg twice daily for one week. I want you to follow up with me in one week to assess your response to the medication. If the pain worsens or you develop any shortness of breath, fever, or other concerning symptoms, seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. Naproxen… and the X-ray. One week. And if it gets worse, I should come back. My wife is going to be mad about the X-ray, but… okay. Thank you, Doctor. Where do I go for the X-ray?
DOCTOR: The radiology department is located down the hall to your left. The receptionist will assist you with scheduling the procedure. I will have the results sent to my office. Do you require a work note?
PATIENT: Oh. Uh… yes, please. I missed some work coming here. And… I might need to take it easy for a few days if it still hurts. Roofing is hard work, you know? That would be a big help.
DOCTOR: Here. This will suffice. It states you were seen for a musculoskeletal issue and may require limited activity for a short period. Do not abuse this, Mr. Bulaong. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you for everything. I’ll go get the X-ray. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Another satisfied patient… hopefully. .
