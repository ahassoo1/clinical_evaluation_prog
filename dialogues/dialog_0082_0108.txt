DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, but… well, things came up. Been throwing up blood, mostly. Not a ton, you understand, but enough to worry a fella. It started a couple days ago. And it's… messy.
DOCTOR: Okay, throwing up blood… that is concerning, you’re right to come in. A couple of days ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, started Tuesday, I think. Hard to keep track when you’re… preoccupied. It’s not like a fountain, alright? More like… streaks. Dark red. And it smells… well, you can imagine. Look, I’m a practical man. What could be causing this? I haven’t been hit by a bus or anything, if that's what you're thinking.
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all. Just trying to get a full picture. Streaks of dark red… alright. And no recent injury, that's good to know. It can be a number of things, Mr. Gentz. Sometimes it's something relatively minor, sometimes it needs closer attention. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… I’ve been feeling tired, I suppose. More tired than usual, and I work a… a demanding job. And my stomach’s been upset, naturally. Sort of cramping, but nothing unbearable. Mostly just… weak. And thirsty. Real thirsty. I haven't been eating much either, don't really have an appetite. Is that important? It's probably just the blood, right? Makes you queasy.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, stomach cramping, thirst, and loss of appetite… yes, those are all important things to know. And you're right, throwing up blood would make anyone queasy. Do you recall anything specific that you ate or drank before the first time you noticed the blood?
PATIENT: Specific? Look, I eat pretty much the same thing every day. Lamb and rice, mostly. Sometimes dates. Nothing fancy. I definitely didn’t eat anything weird. And I had water with it, like always. I'm a simple man, Doc. I don’t go trying new things. Could be something in the water supply, maybe? We are out in the sticks here.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know – consistent diet is helpful. And you raise a fair point about the water supply. We can certainly consider that. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills, not really. I get a little cold sometimes, but that's just the drafty old house. And night sweats… well, I sleep pretty warm, if that counts. But I wouldn't call them sweats. Just… a bit damp. I’m a warm-blooded man. Look, Doc, I’m telling you, I feel fine. Just a bit weak and this… unpleasantness with the vomiting.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, or significant night sweats. You said you feel weak… can you describe that weakness a little more?
PATIENT: It's just… everything takes more effort. Getting up, walking around, even just thinking. Like someone drained the battery, you know? I used to be able to work all day without a problem. Now I'm needing to sit down every hour. And my hands feel shaky sometimes. Not constantly, but enough to notice. It’s… worrying, alright? A man needs to be strong, Doc. Especially in my line of work.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very concerning, Mr. Gentz. Okay. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, things like that. It will help me get a better idea of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I haven't got all day. But don't poke around too much. I’m a sensitive man, Doc. And try not to get any of that… stuff on your coat. It stains, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gentz. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I assure you, I take precautions. If you could just lie down on the examination table, please. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little low, and pulse is slightly elevated. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds are clear, but heart rate is a little fast. Now, can you point to where you're feeling the most discomfort in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Right here. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache. Gets worse when I eat. And when I lie down flat. Feels like something’s… heavy. Like a stone sitting there. Honestly, Doc, you’re not going to find anything. It's probably just… old age catching up.
DOCTOR: Alright. There is some tenderness here, and it feels a little… firm. Not significantly rigid, but definitely not soft. I also notice some mild yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes. Have you noticed that?
PATIENT: Yellowing? Now that you mention it… yeah. A little. Thought it was just the lighting in this old place. Always dim. I figured I was getting a bit pale, maybe. Haven't been getting out much, you know. But yellowing… that doesn’t sound good, does it? What could that be? Is it… contagious?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily contagious, Mr. Gentz. Yellowing of the skin and eyes – what we call jaundice – can be caused by a number of things. It often indicates a problem with the liver, gallbladder, or bile ducts. Given your symptoms – the vomiting blood, abdominal discomfort, weakness, jaundice, and low blood pressure – I’m concerned about a potential blockage or inflammation in your biliary system, or possibly a liver issue. I'm going to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of your liver function, and I'd like to get an ultrasound of your abdomen to visualize your liver, gallbladder and bile ducts. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ultrasound… blood tests… sounds expensive. Look, Doc, I don’t have insurance. Never had it, never needed it. Can’t we just give me something for the nausea and see if it gets better? I can’t afford a lot of fancy tests. I’m a practical man, remember? I’ll tell you what: a strong anti-nausea medication, and maybe a little something for the stomach pain. That's all I'm asking.
DOCTOR: I understand your financial situation, Mr. Gentz, and I’ll do my best to work with you. However, simply treating the symptoms without knowing the underlying cause could be dangerous. We need to find out what’s causing the vomiting blood and jaundice. These are serious signs that require investigation. I can discuss payment options with the billing department, and we may be able to find a more affordable lab. As for the ultrasound, I believe it is essential. I will also see if there are any charitable assistance programs that might help cover the costs. In the meantime, while we work on getting those tests scheduled, I can prescribe something for the nausea and stomach pain, but that is in addition to, not instead of, the necessary diagnostic tests. I would also strongly advise against delaying further investigation. It's better to rule things out and get you feeling better as quickly as possible. Would you like me to proceed with prescribing the medications?
PATIENT: Fine. Prescribe the… whatever. The nausea stuff and the stomach pain thing. But don’t expect me to run around getting a lot of expensive tests. And don't bother with the charitable programs, I've got my pride. Just… get me something that will stop this sickness. And write the prescriptions quickly, alright? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I’m prescribing you an anti-nausea medication, Metoclopramide, 10mg, three times a day as needed, and a proton pump inhibitor, Omeprazole, 20mg, once daily in the morning for stomach protection. These should help alleviate some of your symptoms. However, it's crucial to remember that these are temporary measures. We still need to get those tests done to determine the underlying cause. I will have the nurse come in and discuss the potential cost and options for the blood tests and ultrasound. I’ll also have her provide you with information on when to seek immediate medical attention – specifically if you notice any worsening of the vomiting blood, severe abdominal pain, or any signs of confusion. It’s very important to be vigilant. Do you have any questions for me before I let you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… thank you. I suppose. I’ll see what the nurse says about the money. And I'll try not to… worsen. Just let me get out of here, alright? I've got things to do. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. The nurse will be in shortly. Please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any concerning symptoms before then. Take care, and I hope you start feeling better soon. .
