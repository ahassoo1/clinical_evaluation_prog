DOCTOR: Right. Liza Sugino, 47 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Batara. Well, it's not a problem, exactly. I've been thinking… I'd like to learn more about mindfulness or meditation, if that’s something you could help with? I hear it’s good for… well, everything, really. I just feel like I could use a little more… peace, maybe?
DOCTOR: Mindfulness?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I keep seeing things about it – articles, on the television… friends talking about it. It sounds like a good way to calm your mind, and I find my mind does race quite a bit. I’m not sure I really understand it, to be honest. It seems… simple, but also… difficult? Like, how do you just stop thinking?
DOCTOR: Well, it's… not exactly a medical issue, is it?
PATIENT: No, no, you're right. It isn’t! I suppose I just… I thought maybe a doctor would have resources, or know where I could start. I mean, you deal with stress and things all the time, with patients, and I just figured… you might know good places to learn, or even if it's something that would be helpful for someone like me. I don’t want to waste your time if it’s not something you deal with here.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, I suppose there are some studies linking mindfulness to blood pressure… and anxiety… but frankly, I focus on actual medical conditions. Perhaps a yoga class?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Yoga… that's a thought. I’ve never really done yoga before, but I’m open to it. Is there… anything closer to guided meditation, though? Or maybe a class specifically for beginners? I just… I worry I’d get lost in a regular yoga class. It’s probably silly, but… everything feels so fast these days, and I’m hoping for something slower paced. Do you know if any local community centers offer anything like that? Or even a good website to start with? I just don’t know where to begin.
DOCTOR: Honestly, Mrs. Sugino, I’m a doctor, not a concierge service. I treat illnesses. But… there is a wellness center in Willow Creek. I believe they offer various classes. Their website is… let me see… willowcreekwellness.com. I wouldn't expect miracles, though. It’s not a substitute for proper medical care.
PATIENT: Oh, Willow Creek! That's… not too far from here, actually. willowcreekwellness.com, you said? Wonderful! Thank you so much, Doctor Batara. I appreciate you looking that up for me. I completely understand you're busy with actual illnesses, and I didn't mean to take up your time with something… less tangible. I’ll look them up tonight. This is very helpful.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, is there anything medical I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not really. Just that, actually. I just wanted to explore the mindfulness idea and see if you had any suggestions. Now that I have the website, I think I’m all set. Thank you again for your time, Doctor Batara. I appreciate it. I won’t take up any more of your afternoon.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, if you develop any actual symptoms, don't hesitate to schedule an appointment. Goodbye, Mrs. Sugino.
PATIENT: Alright, I will. Thank you very much, Doctor. Have a good day! Goodbye!
