DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let's not waste any time, shall we?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, alright. Just… get on with it, if you could. It’s this hand, you see. Shakes a bit. Been… well, it’s been a while now.
DOCTOR: A while, you say. Vague timelines are…unhelpful, Mr. Jezik. Perhaps you could attempt a slightly more precise description?
PATIENT: Precise… hmm. Oh, goodness. It’s… a few years, I suppose? Maybe five? Before that, it was just a little twitch now and then. Didn't bother me none. But it’s gotten worse, noticeably worse, in the last… year or so? Is that precise enough for you? Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Adequate, I suppose. And has this shaking… interfered with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Interfered… yes. A little. I used to do a lot of tinkering, you see. With pipes. For work, mostly, but also around the house. It’s… harder now. Dropping things. Not as steady. It’s just… frustrating. I don’t like not being able to do things. Especially not with my hands. They’ve always been good hands.
DOCTOR: Tinkering, you say. And what specifically are you…tinkering with?
PATIENT: Water, mostly. I worked at the plant, you see. Wastewater, mostly. Systems. Pipes. Keeping things flowing, that was my job. Before… well, before I retired. Now it’s just… odd jobs around the house. Used to fix the leaky faucets for the neighbors, but not so much anymore. It’s too embarrassing, dropping the wrench, you know?
DOCTOR: Wastewater. And were you exposed to any… unusual chemicals during your employment?
PATIENT: Unusual… goodness. Chemicals? Well, we used chlorine, of course. Lots of it. And… some others. Names… I can’t recall the names. It was a long time ago. Everything was pretty standard, I thought. We had safety procedures. I don’t think I was ever exposed to anything… dangerous. Not that I know of, anyway. It was just… water. Dirty water. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No readily apparent records of chemical exposure. Alright. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Physical… alright. Get it over with then. Don't take too long, please. I've got… things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. There is a resting tremor, as you’ve indicated. Muscle tone appears slightly diminished. Reflexes are… within normal limits, though somewhat sluggish. Let's check the other hand. Similar findings on this side. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. I'm following it... it's… a bit wobbly. My eyesight isn't what it used to be either, you know. Is this taking long? I've got appointments.
DOCTOR: The tremor is present in both hands, and… exacerbated by movement, as expected. Visual impairment could certainly contribute to some difficulty with coordination. Now, have you noticed any stiffness in your joints?
PATIENT: Stiffness… A little, maybe. In the mornings, mostly. I thought it was just… old age. Waking up creaky, you know? It eases off a bit after I get moving, but… yeah, a little stiff. Not terrible. It’s just… discomfort. Is that what you mean? I’ve never really thought about it much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history, the examination findings, and… your limited recall of details, it’s difficult to definitively pinpoint a cause. However, the presentation is suggestive of… essential tremor. It’s a common condition, particularly in older adults. It’s not life-threatening, but it can be… bothersome.
PATIENT: Essential… what now? Is that bad? Will I… will I be able to keep doing things? Fixing things? Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know if I’m going to fall apart. That’s all. Is it something serious? Just… tell me straight. I don’t need fancy words.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Jezik, it is not "falling apart." It's a neurological condition. It’s not fatal, and it doesn’t typically progress rapidly. However, it can worsen over time, affecting your ability to perform fine motor tasks, such as… fixing things. We can manage the symptoms with medication – primarily beta-blockers, though they may have side effects. Alternatively, there are… invasive procedures, such as deep brain stimulation, but those carry significant risks. Given your age and overall health, I would recommend starting with medication, if you are amenable. We'll need to monitor your response and adjust the dosage accordingly. Also, and this is important, avoidance of caffeine and stress could help manage symptoms. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Medication… Side effects? What kind of side effects? I don't want to be worse off. And what about… that other thing? The… brain thing? No, no. I don't want anything done to my brain. Caffeine? I have a cup of coffee every morning! Stress? Doctor, I’m an old man. What stress? Look, honestly, I don't know. This is… a lot. Can't I just… leave it alone? Is it going to get that bad?
DOCTOR: Leaving it alone is an option, Mr. Jezik, but it will likely worsen. Side effects from beta-blockers can include fatigue, dizziness, and… in rare cases, more serious cardiovascular issues. We would monitor you closely, of course. As for the “brain thing”, that is reserved for severe cases unresponsive to medication. Given your reluctance to consider medication, and the absence of… debilitating symptoms at this time, I recommend… we schedule a follow-up appointment in six months to reassess the situation. In the meantime, I suggest attempting to reduce your caffeine intake and… manage stress, as best as you can. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Six months… Alright. Six months. Just… don’t expect much improvement by then. I’m an old man, Doctor. Things are just… falling apart, one way or another. Tell me where to go to schedule that appointment, and let’s get this over with. .
DOCTOR: The receptionist will schedule that for you. Good day, Mr. Jezik. .
