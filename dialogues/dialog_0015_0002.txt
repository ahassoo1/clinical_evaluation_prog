DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm... what brings me in? It's... it's about going to the bathroom, dear. It’s a bit hard now, you see. Not like it used to be. It takes a while, and... well, it just isn't easy. My husband says I strain a little.
DOCTOR: Alright. So you're experiencing difficulty with bowel movements. It takes longer than usual, and your husband has noticed some straining. How long has this been going on, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long? That’s a good question. Not too long, I don’t think. Maybe… a few weeks? Or was it months? Everything feels a bit mixed up these days, you know. It’s just gotten… slower. Not sudden, just… gradual. I really can’t say exactly. My memory… it's not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A few weeks or months… gradual onset. Right. And would you describe the stool as normal in consistency when you are able to go?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. What did you say? “Stool”? Like… the… what comes out? Is that what you mean? I… it seems alright. Not runny, not hard. Just… normal, I guess. Like it always was. It’s just getting it out that’s the problem, not what is coming out. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Stoffregen, I understand. You’re experiencing difficulty passing stool, not necessarily a change in the stool itself. So, no blood, no significant change in color or shape?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, goodness, no! No blood, dear. Definitely no blood. And… color? Hmm… It looks like… brown. Isn't it always brown? I haven't really looked closely, to be honest. My husband uses the toilet more often, and he hasn't said anything about it being different. I just… I feel like I’m not emptying everything out, you know? Like there’s still some left.
DOCTOR: Alright. No blood, stool appears normal in color. Sensation of incomplete evacuation. Have you noticed any abdominal pain, bloating, or nausea associated with this?
PATIENT: Oh, pain… sometimes. Just a little cramping, you know? Not bad enough to worry about, just a little discomfort. And… bloating, maybe? My stomach does feel a bit full sometimes, even after I’ve… tried. Nausea? No, no sickness. I have a good appetite, thankfully. I like my food!
DOCTOR: Okay. So, intermittent cramping, some fullness, no nausea. And this is happening… how often would you say you’re attempting to have a bowel movement, and how many times a week are you successful?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a tricky one. I try… well, when I feel like I need to. Maybe… every day? Some days more than others. And successful… hmm. Maybe three times a week? Or is it four? It's hard to keep track, you know. My husband keeps telling me to drink more water, though. Says it might help.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to listen to your abdomen and do a quick rectal exam to assess the tone of your muscles and check for any abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? You mean… checking? Well… I don’t like being poked and prodded, dear. But if you think it’s important… I suppose. Just be gentle, alright? My husband always says I have sensitive skin. And… it feels a bit embarrassing, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s a perfectly normal feeling. And I assure you, I will be as gentle as possible. It’s important to rule out any underlying causes and determine the best course of action. First, I'll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then, a brief external examination, and finally, a quick digital rectal exam. It will be relatively quick, and I'll explain everything as I go. If you’re comfortable, let’s begin with listening to your abdomen. You can lie down on your back, please.
PATIENT: Alright… if you say it's important. Sensitive skin, you remember! It's not just me being fussy. So, you're just listening? No poking just yet? That’s good. Go ahead, dear. Just be gentle, alright? And tell me what you're doing so I don't get scared.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. And I will explain everything as I go. I’m simply listening to the sounds within your abdomen with this instrument. It will help me determine if there’s any unusual activity or blockage. I’m going to apply some gel to my stethoscope to help it make contact with your skin. Just breathe normally for me. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds, though a bit sluggish. No immediate signs of a blockage. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. This simply means feeling for any tenderness or masses. I'll start gently. Does this cause you any discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh… it feels a bit cold. Is that the gel? And… sluggish? What does sluggish mean? Is that bad? Ooh, a little tender there, dear. Just a little. Not awful, but… yes, that’s a bit uncomfortable. Like… a dull ache. Not sharp, just… there. It's right around there.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Tenderness to palpation in the lower left quadrant. Sluggish bowel sounds. Now, to complete the exam, I’d like to perform a brief digital rectal exam. This will allow me to assess the tone of your anal sphincter and check for any masses or abnormalities. I understand this can be uncomfortable, and I'll do my best to make it as quick and painless as possible. Would you please lie on your side with your knees drawn up towards your chest?
PATIENT: Oh… now you’re really poking around. I really don’t like this part, dear. Is it absolutely necessary? My husband says I worry too much, but… it just feels so… invasive. And what if you find something? I don’t want to know! Just… be quick, alright? And tell me if you find anything… even if it’s bad. But I'd rather not hear details, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Stoffregen. I wouldn't recommend this if it wasn't important. It’s a standard part of evaluating these types of concerns and helps us rule out more serious conditions. I'll be as gentle and as quick as possible. I’m simply checking for any abnormalities. Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm finished. The sphincter tone is slightly decreased, but not significantly. I didn't detect any obvious masses or tenderness internally. There was a small amount of stool present.
PATIENT: Oh… good. It's over. Slightly decreased? What does that even mean? Is that bad? And stool? Well, of course there was stool! That's where it goes, dear. So, what does all this mean? Am I sick? Do I need… medicine? Or surgery? Don’t tell me it’s something terrible.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stoffregen, the exam findings aren’t necessarily indicative of anything terrible, but they do suggest some degree of constipation and decreased muscle tone in the area, which is common with age. The sluggish bowel sounds and tenderness also support that. Based on these findings, I believe you're experiencing chronic constipation. It's not likely to be a serious condition requiring surgery, but it is something we should address to improve your comfort and quality of life. The decreased muscle tone means you might have some difficulty initiating bowel movements, and the tenderness could be from straining. I recommend starting with some lifestyle modifications and potentially a stool softener to help ease your discomfort. We can also discuss dietary changes. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… constipation. Not terrible? Just… constipation? That’s… better than surgery, certainly. Lifestyle modifications? What does that even mean? Do I have to change everything I eat? And stool softener? Is that like… a laxative? My mother used to take those, and she was always running to the bathroom… I don’t want to be running to the bathroom all the time. I just want to be able to go when I need to, you know? Without straining.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Stoffregen. Lifestyle modifications simply mean making some small changes to your daily routine. Primarily, increasing your fluid intake – aiming for at least eight glasses of water a day – and increasing your fiber intake through fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. As for the stool softener, it's not a harsh laxative. It works by adding moisture to the stool, making it easier to pass. It won't cause you to run to the bathroom; it simply makes things a little smoother. I'm going to recommend a stool softener called Docusate Sodium, 100mg twice a day. I'll also print out a handout with a list of high-fiber foods and tips for staying hydrated. We can start with that, and if that's not enough, we can discuss other options. I’d like you to follow these recommendations for two weeks and then schedule a follow-up appointment to see how you're doing. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Oh… eight glasses of water? That’s a lot of water, dear. But I can try. And the handout… that sounds helpful. Knowing what to eat. Docusate Sodium… I'll have to ask my husband to pick that up. He does all the shopping. And two weeks… that sounds reasonable. So, you think this will help? I won’t have to worry about surgery or… something terrible? Just water and… softer stool?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Stoffregen. That is my expectation. Surgery is highly unlikely, and based on your exam, I don't see any signs of anything terrible. We’re simply addressing a common issue with some simple measures. It will likely take a few days to see the full effects of the stool softener and the dietary changes, so please be patient. This handout also includes information about exercises that can help stimulate bowel movements. It’s important to remain active as well. I will also send the prescription for the Docusate Sodium to your usual pharmacy. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… exercises? Well… that’s a lot to remember. Water, fiber, exercises, stool softener… My poor husband! He’ll be running around like a chicken with its head cut off! No, I don’t think so, dear. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly. I’ll just… try to remember it all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. Remember to start slowly and focus on one change at a time. If you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to help. Please schedule your follow-up appointment with the receptionist before you leave. Have a good day, and please take care.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you again, Doctor. You're a very kind lady. I will, I will take care. And I will bother my husband to make a follow-up appointment. He’s good at those things. Goodbye now, and thank you again.
