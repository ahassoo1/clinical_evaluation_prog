DOCTOR: Alright then, Mrs. Geho. Have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Burlingham. Well, I got a letter, you see. From the lab. Said my cholesterol is… high. That’s what it said. Hyper… something. I don’t really understand all those big words. But it sounded important, so I thought I should come in and get it checked out. I’m Chelise, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, paperwork is a nuisance, isn’t it?
PATIENT: It really is! And honestly, I always worry I misread something. Numbers just…blur together after a while, you know? So I figured it was best to just ask a real person. Is it…bad? This cholesterol thing? I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly. Lots of vegetables.
DOCTOR: "Pretty healthy" is…subjective, Mrs. Geho. It can be a problem, yes. High cholesterol increases your risk of…well, let’s just say it's not something you want to ignore. Now, this “hyper…” – that’s hyperlipidemia. It means you have too much fat in your blood. We need to get a better handle on the numbers, specifically. Let's pull up those lab results on the computer here. Have you ever been told you have high cholesterol before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is the first I’ve heard of it, honestly. I see my general practitioner, Doctor Van Derlyn, every year for my check-up, and he never mentioned anything. He usually just checks my blood pressure and…you know, the usual. I feel fine, actually. A little tired sometimes, but I just figured that’s my age. Fifty-four isn’t exactly young anymore, is it?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, Doctor Van Derlyn may have different priorities, or perhaps the levels weren't elevated at your last check-up. It is possible for things to change. Alright, let's see… Total cholesterol is 245. LDL is 160, HDL is 40, and triglycerides are 150. Yes, those numbers are a bit elevated. The LDL, that's the "bad" cholesterol, is quite a bit higher than we like to see. Now, do you have any family history of heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Those numbers don’t sound good, do they? Let me think… family history… My father, he had a heart attack when he was 68. A pretty big one, I remember. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had chest pains a lot when she got older. They said it was angina, I think? But beyond that… not really. My mother lived to be 85, very healthy for her age, and my brother is still going strong, playing golf every day! Is 160…really high?
DOCTOR: Yes, 160 is…unideal, Mrs. Geho. While your mother’s longevity is encouraging, and your brother seems to be doing well, genetics only tells part of the story. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Aside from the vegetables, what does your diet consist of?
PATIENT: Well, I do love my cheese. Gouda, mostly. And I have a bit of a sweet tooth, I confess. I bake a lot – apple pie is my specialty! And I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner most nights, sometimes two. Not every night, mind you! But most. I try to walk when the weather is nice, but winter in the countryside isn’t exactly conducive to outdoor activities, you know? It gets very…icy. I don’t do a lot of strenuous exercise, if that’s what you mean. Just pottering around the garden, mostly.
DOCTOR: Pottering and baking…and cheese. Right. Well, Mrs. Geho, we need to address this before it becomes a more serious problem. We’ll start with some dietary modifications. Less cheese, less sugar, and perhaps a reduction in the wine. It’s not about deprivation, it’s about moderation. I'm going to order some blood work to re-check your cholesterol levels. Then, depending on those results, we may need to consider medication. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds…reasonable. Less cheese is going to be hard, but I can try. And perhaps I can switch to white wine instead? Does that make a difference? As for medications… let me think. No, I don’t think so. I had penicillin as a child, a very long time ago, but I don’t remember having any reaction. I haven’t taken anything regularly since. And I’ve never had any problems with antibiotics or anything like that. Is there anything else I should be telling you? Anything at all? I just want to make sure I’m being thorough.
DOCTOR: No, that's sufficient for now. We'll monitor your progress and adjust as needed. I'm going to give you a handout with some dietary guidelines and a list of exercises you can try. It's important to be proactive about your health, Mrs. Geho. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and palpate your abdomen. It’s just routine, but it’s good to have a complete picture. If you could just lie down on the table, please.
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds good. A complete picture is always best. I always did try to be proactive, Doctor. Just…sometimes it’s hard to know where to start. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if anything feels…unusual. Or if I need to adjust my position. It’s been a while since I had a proper check-up, you know. This table is a bit…firm, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. No significant findings, thankfully. Everything seems normal on examination, which is good. It just reinforces the need to address the cholesterol through lifestyle changes and, potentially, medication. Now, let’s get those blood tests ordered and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in two weeks. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks sounds perfect, Doctor. I have nothing planned then, as far as I know. So, no worries about anything serious? Just…high cholesterol? That's…reassuring, actually. And I promise, I will try to cut back on the cheese. And the wine. Maybe I’ll take up knitting instead? Is that…good for your heart? It seems awfully sedentary, but it’s better than baking, I suppose. Should I stop taking my vitamins? I take a multivitamin every day. Just a standard one, you know.
DOCTOR: Knitting...well, it's not strenuous, but it's better than nothing. As for the vitamins, continue taking them. They won't interfere with anything. Now, I'm going to give you a printed summary of today's discussion, the lab order form, and the dietary guidelines. Make sure to schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave the front desk. And please, Mrs. Geho, take this seriously. High cholesterol is a silent killer. Do you have any other questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate it. So, I just take this to the lab, and they’ll…draw blood? Is there anything I need to do beforehand? Fasting, or anything like that? I always forget these things. It's awful being old, you know. And thank you again, Doctor Burlingham. I feel much better knowing what’s going on, and having a plan. I suppose I’ll go schedule that appointment now.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to fast for 12 hours beforehand. No food or drink, except water. And yes, schedule that appointment before you leave. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions. Take care of yourself, Mrs. Geho. And remember, moderation is key. Goodbye.
