DOCTOR: Good morning, Velda. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Pfennig. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I'm here because I'm planning a cruise, you see, and the cruise line needs some information from a doctor before I can go. Just a formality, I believe. They sent me a form, and it asks about my medical history. I thought it best to get it filled out properly.
DOCTOR: That's very sensible of you, Velda. Cruise lines often have those requirements for everyone’s safety. It's good you're being proactive. I’m happy to help you complete that form. Let’s start with the basics. Can you tell me about any significant medical conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Let me think… Well, a few years back, I had a bit of trouble with my gallbladder, and they took it out. That was in 2018, I recall precisely – the 14th of June. Aside from that… I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and such, but nothing serious. And, sadly, my husband passed away five years ago from a heart condition. I haven’t had any major problems myself since the gallbladder. I do get a little ache in my knees sometimes, if I’m on my feet all day, but that’s probably just my age, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Gallbladder removal in 2018 – I’m noting June 14th. And I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. Losing someone close is never easy. And the knee pain… it’s good you recognize it's related to activity. We can certainly discuss that further. Just to clarify, is this pain in both knees, or just one?
PATIENT: It's both knees, Doctor. Not terribly bad, mind you. It's more of a… a stiffness, really. Especially after I’ve been bending and stretching a lot, arranging displays, you see. I’m a merchandise displayer, and window trimmer, so I’m on my feet and moving about quite a bit during the day. It usually eases up with a bit of rest, or a warm bath. It hasn’t stopped me from working, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bilateral knee pain, related to activity and relieved with rest and warmth. That gives me a good starting point. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve had regular check-ups with my previous doctor – Dr. MacLeod, lovely man – and he always said my blood pressure was fine. I’ve never been told I have diabetes, and I don’t believe I have arthritis, although my mother did suffer from it in her later years. Thankfully, it hasn’t bothered me at all. I do try to stay active, you see, and eat a balanced diet, although I do have a fondness for shortbread, I must admit.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Regular check-ups are excellent, and it sounds like you’re very mindful of your health. And a fondness for shortbread is perfectly acceptable! Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or vitamins on a regular basis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I'm not. I try to avoid taking anything if I can help it. I might take a paracetamol now and then for a headache, but that’s it. I used to take a vitamin D supplement in the winter months, as Dr. MacLeod suggested, but I haven't gotten around to buying any this year. I really try to get enough sunshine when I can. That's all, truly. Nothing regular, and nothing prescribed.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications or prescriptions. Just occasional paracetamol for headaches and intermittent Vitamin D. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors, like pollen or dust?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I don’t have any problems with pollen or dust, as far as I know. I've always been quite fortunate in that regard. I occasionally get a sniffle with a cold, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, a common cold is not an allergy. Good to know you haven't had any significant allergic reactions. Now, let’s move on to your past surgical history. You mentioned the gallbladder removal. Have you had any other surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that was the only surgery I've ever had. And thankfully, I haven't had to be hospitalized for anything else. I broke my arm as a child, climbing a tree, a rather silly accident, but that was just a simple fracture, and I was treated at the doctor's office. Nothing serious, and nothing requiring a hospital stay. The gallbladder removal was the only real operation, as it were.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the gallbladder removal in 2018, and a childhood arm fracture treated at the doctor’s office. Now, can you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, as I mentioned, suffered from arthritis in her later years, quite badly. My father had heart trouble, but he lived to a good age – eighty-seven, I believe. My only brother is still alive and well, thankfully, although he does have high blood pressure, he tells me. And my husband’s father had diabetes, but other than that, I don’t recall any significant health problems in either family, to be honest. It’s a relatively healthy family, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, so maternal history of arthritis, paternal history of heart trouble, and a brother with high blood pressure, and your husband’s father with diabetes. That’s helpful. Finally, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor! I’ve never smoked in my life. It’s a dreadful habit, isn’t it? And I rarely drink alcohol, only a small glass of sherry on special occasions, perhaps at Christmas or a birthday. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I enjoy a good cup of tea and a walk in the garden, that’s my idea of a good time! I lead a very quiet and healthy life, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Velda. Sounds like you prioritize your well-being. Alright, I’ve got quite a bit of information here. Just to confirm, is there anything I’ve missed or anything you’d like to add?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh, yes! I did have a bout of shingles a few years back, maybe six or seven years ago. It was quite painful, but the doctor treated it promptly, and it cleared up nicely. I haven't had any problems with it since. And… no, I think that's everything. You've been very thorough, Doctor, and I appreciate you taking the time to ask such detailed questions. It's good to be sure everything is documented correctly for the cruise line.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Velda. That’s very important information about the shingles. I'll add that to the notes right away. Now, a quick physical exam would be helpful to complete this form thoroughly. Would you mind if I listened to your heart and lungs, and just check your abdomen and reflexes?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. I’m happy to comply with whatever you deem necessary. It's best to be thorough, as you say. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement completely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… Okay, everything sounds clear and normal there. Now, I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen… any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s quite comfortable. Not a bit of tenderness. Just the usual… a little bit soft, perhaps, but nothing to worry about. As I said, I’m quite a healthy person, all things considered. It's probably just my age, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Good. Your reflexes are normal as well, equal and strong on both sides. Everything appears to be within normal limits on the physical exam. I’ll document all of this in your chart. “Heart and lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen soft, non-tender, non-distended. Reflexes 2+ and equal bilaterally.” Alright, Velda, I’ve completed the form. I’ll print it out for you to take to the cruise line. It summarizes your medical history, allergies, medications, and the findings from today’s exam. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful, Doctor. Thank you so much for your thoroughness and patience. You've been most helpful. No, I don't think I have any questions at the moment. You've covered everything so comprehensively. I just wanted to make sure I had everything in order for the cruise. I am rather looking forward to it, you see. A little bit of sunshine and relaxation is just what I need. Thank you again, Doctor Pfennig. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Velda. I’m glad I could help. Enjoy your cruise! It sounds like you deserve a relaxing getaway. Here you go. If you have any concerns arise before or during your trip, please don’t hesitate to contact your primary care physician. And if you don’t mind, I'd like to leave a note in your record about the knee pain, suggesting over-the-counter pain relief as needed, and encourage gentle exercise to maintain strength and flexibility. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very thoughtful of you, Doctor. That’s a good idea about the note in my record. I appreciate that. No, I believe that's everything. Truly. Thank you again for your kindness and professionalism. I shall be recommending you to my friends. Have a lovely day, Doctor Pfennig.
DOCTOR: You are very kind to say so, Velda. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. Have a wonderful time on your cruise, and please take care. .
