DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Limtiaco, yes, that’s me. Hmm… what did bring me in? My wife, bless her heart, she said something about… papers. Important papers. For work, I think? Something about needing time off… or maybe not being able to work? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. Something about FMLA, does that ring a bell?
DOCTOR: Yes, FMLA – the Family and Medical Leave Act. That often involves needing time off work for a medical reason, either for yourself or to care for a family member. It sounds like your wife is very thoughtful to get things started. Let's focus on you for now. Could you tell me a little more about what's been going on with your health that might be prompting this need for leave?
PATIENT: Oh dear… well, I’ve been… feeling a bit off, I suppose. Not sick, exactly. Just… tired. Very tired. And a bit… shaky, sometimes. It's hard to explain. It’s been going on for… a while now, I reckon. Months, maybe? It comes and goes. It doesn’t really stop me from doing things, but… it makes them harder. I still do my work with the church, you know, directing the activities… but even that takes more effort now. I just thought it was getting old, honestly. I’m 67 now, you know. Things start to… wear out.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling tired and shaky for months, even with activities you normally enjoy. That’s certainly worth investigating, and it’s good you’re coming in to discuss it. It’s never just “getting old,” Mr. Limtiaco. Could you describe the shakiness a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not a constant thing. It comes and goes, like I said. It’s mostly in my hands, I think. They just… tremble a little. Not a big shake, nothing dramatic. But enough that sometimes I have trouble holding things. Like a cup of coffee, or… writing. I used to have very neat handwriting, but now it’s a bit… wobbly. And sometimes my legs feel a little unsteady too, but that’s less often. It’s worse when I’m stressed, I think. Or… when I haven’t eaten in a while. Does that make sense? It’s hard to put into words.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Tremors in your hands, occasionally in your legs, worse with stress or when hungry. And you mentioned your handwriting has become less steady. To get a better picture, could you tell me if anything specifically triggers these tremors, or if they just seem to come on randomly?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… randomly is probably the best way to put it. Though, like I said, stress definitely makes it worse. And… sometimes when I’m talking to people? Especially if I’m nervous. It’s silly, I know. But if I’m giving a speech at the church, or… even just meeting someone new, it tends to happen. Nothing specific causes it, as far as I can tell. It just… shows up. I haven’t been able to link it to anything in particular. I tried to think about it, but my mind just… draws a blank. It's frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s helpful information. And it’s perfectly normal to feel frustrated when you can’t pinpoint the cause of something. Now, let's talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tiredness and shakiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me see. Well, I’ve been… a little forgetful lately. More so than usual, I think. My wife keeps having to remind me of things. Important things. Like appointments, or… what I was supposed to be doing. It’s not… serious, but it’s annoying. And… I’ve been feeling a little… down, sometimes. Not sad, exactly. Just… low energy. Like I don’t have much motivation to do things. Does that count? I haven't really told anyone this before, to be honest. It just feels like… part of getting older, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Limtiaco. It takes courage to talk about these things, and it’s very important information. Forgetfulness and low motivation, alongside the tiredness and tremors… those are all things we should investigate. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Well, I had my prostate checked a few years back, everything was fine then. And I’ve got a bit of high blood pressure, but I take medication for that. It seems to be under control. Other than that… not really. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. I haven’t been to the doctor much in the last few years, to be honest. Just for checkups, mostly. My wife keeps telling me I should go more often, but… I always feel fine. Mostly. Except for this, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, currently managed with medication, and a previous prostate check that was normal. That’s good to know. And you haven't had any other significant illnesses or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but that was a long time ago. And I had the flu a couple of times, like everyone does. But nothing that required a hospital stay. I've always been lucky, I suppose. I've avoided serious illness, thankfully. My wife always says it's because of my healthy diet. She's a good cook, you know. Lots of fresh fish and fruit.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant illnesses or hospitalizations. That’s helpful. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long, long time ago. And… I think I had a small mole removed from my back once, but that was years ago. Nothing else comes to mind. Just the tonsils and the mole. Is that important? I can’t really remember all the details. It was a long time ago, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful to know. Tonsillectomy as a child and a mole removed. Now, let’s talk about medications. You mentioned taking something for your blood pressure. Can you tell me the name of that medication, and the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. My wife handles all that. She fills the prescription and makes sure I take it. I just… take the pill. It’s a little white one, I think. And I take it every morning. I honestly don’t know the name of it. I’m terrible with names, you know. My wife will be furious if I can’t tell you. I'll have to ask her when I get home. I’m so sorry. I feel like I'm not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s very common for patients to not remember medication names. We can easily get that information from your pharmacy. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I eat all sorts of things. My wife makes a wonderful seafood stew, and I have no trouble with that. And I’ve never had any problems with medications either. I’ve taken a few different things over the years, for colds and things, but nothing ever bothered me. No, I don't think I have any allergies. But again, my wife might know better. She keeps track of all these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let's talk a bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s another tricky one. My mother… she had some trouble with her heart when she got older. I think it was something to do with her blood pressure. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. But he didn’t take very good care of himself. He loved sweets. Other than that… not that I know of. My siblings are all pretty healthy, as far as I know. But we don’t see each other very often, so I don’t really know what’s going on with them. It's hard to say. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your father. That's helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. Well, I’m retired now, so I don’t do much physical work. I used to be a carpenter, but my hands aren’t what they used to be. I still do some directing at the church, organizing activities and things. And I like to garden a little, but mostly my wife does the heavy lifting. I try to eat healthy, like I said, lots of fish and fruit. I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I don’t smoke. Never have. I try to stay active, but… it’s harder now than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, retired carpenter, active at church, healthy diet, minimal alcohol, and no smoking. That gives me a good picture. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh, alright. Yes, that’s fine. I suppose it’s necessary. I haven’t had one in a while, so it’s probably a good idea. Just let me know what you’re doing, alright? I get a little nervous with these things. I’m not very good with doctors, you know. But I trust you. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Limtiaco. I’ll explain everything as I go along. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Blood pressure is 148/92. Pulse is 78 and regular. That’s a little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Heart sounds are regular, but I can hear a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, but breathing seems a little shallow. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Grip strength is slightly weaker on your left hand compared to your right. Gait is slightly unsteady, and balance is a little impaired. I’ve noted some findings here: slightly elevated blood pressure, a murmur, diminished reflexes, reduced grip strength in the left hand, and some unsteadiness. These findings, along with your symptoms of fatigue, shakiness, forgetfulness, and a family history of heart trouble and diabetes, warrant further investigation. I'd like to order some blood work and a possible EKG to evaluate your heart function and rule out any underlying conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that sounds… serious. Blood work and an EKG? Is something really wrong? I just thought I was getting old, you know? What exactly are you looking for? And what does all this mean? I don’t understand… diminished reflexes, murmurs… it all sounds very complicated. Is it my heart? Is it diabetes? My wife is going to be so worried… I suppose if you think it’s necessary… yes, alright. Do what you think is best. But please explain everything to me afterwards, alright? I want to understand what’s going on. And please, don't tell me anything too frightening. I’m not very good with bad news.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Limtiaco. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious when you hear about needing further tests. I want to assure you that we're just gathering information at this point, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. The blood work will help us check your blood sugar levels, kidney and liver function, and your overall health. The EKG, or electrocardiogram, will record your heart's electrical activity and help us identify any irregular heartbeats or signs of heart disease. The diminished reflexes and murmur could be related to a number of things, including age, heart condition, or nerve problems. We need to rule out any underlying causes before we can determine the best course of action. It’s possible that it could be related to diabetes or a heart condition, but we need the test results to confirm or rule that out. I want to emphasize that we're just being thorough. I’ll order the blood work and EKG right away. The lab should be able to schedule you for an appointment within the next few days. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. I will explain everything to you in detail, and we’ll make a plan together. Here's the information for the lab. Please schedule your appointment as soon as possible. And don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything I can clarify for you at this moment?
PATIENT: Oh dear… so many numbers… and a website. My wife will have to do this. I’m terrible with computers, you know? No, I don’t think so… not right now. I think I just need to sit down for a minute. It’s all a bit overwhelming. Diabetes… heart condition… I just wanted to get some papers for work. You said we’ll make a plan together? That’s good… I like that. I don’t want to be alone in this. My wife… she’ll be so worried. And… will the tests be expensive? I have insurance, but… I don’t want to ruin her retirement. Just please, tell me everything in plain English, alright? No complicated medical terms. And be gentle. I’m an old man.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Limtiaco. I completely understand. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed, and I’ll do everything I can to make this as easy as possible for you and your wife. Let’s take it one step at a time. Your wife can definitely schedule the tests for you, and she’s welcome to join you for the follow-up appointment if you’d like. We'll discuss the results together. As for the cost, we’ll submit the tests to your insurance company. They should cover a significant portion of the expense. We have a billing department that can help you with any remaining balance and explore payment options if needed. I don't have the exact figures right now, but they can provide you with a detailed estimate. And you’re absolutely right to ask me to explain everything in plain English. I promise to avoid any complicated medical terms and will do my best to answer all your questions in a way that you can understand. We’re just trying to gather information at this point. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. And remember, we’ll make a plan together. We’ll figure out what’s going on and take the best course of action for your health. Now, let's just focus on scheduling those tests. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We’re here to help. Do you feel a bit better now?
PATIENT: A little, yes. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. It’s just… a lot to take in. My wife… she’s very good at these things. She’ll handle the scheduling and the insurance. I just… I don’t want to worry her too much. She’s been through a lot lately. Alright. I’ll let her know about the tests. And I’ll call if I have any questions… or if I just need to talk. I think… I think that’s all for now. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old man.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. It was my pleasure. And please, don’t apologize for being an “old man.” You’re a valued patient, and I’m here to help in any way I can. I understand your concerns about worrying your wife. Just let her know that we’re just being thorough, and we’ll figure out what’s going on together. Please take care of yourself, Mr. Limtiaco. And don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all.
