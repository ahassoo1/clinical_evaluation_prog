DOCTOR: Good morning, Elijiah. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, it’s kinda weird, to be honest. I’ve been havin’ trouble… gettin’ out of chairs. It started a few weeks back, and it's gettin' worse, nothin' serious, I hope. It just feels… stuck, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble getting out of chairs, starting a few weeks ago and progressively getting worse. That is a bit unusual. Let's try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Could you describe exactly what happens when you try to stand up?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I can't stand up, Doctor. I just… gotta push. Usually, I lean forward a bit, brace my hands on my knees, and then really force myself up. Sometimes my legs feel kinda shaky when I do it, and I feel like I’m gonna fall. It's not painful, exactly, more… effortful. Like there's somethin' holdin’ me back. It’s worse with some chairs than others, too. Like, the ones with arms are the hardest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s not pain, but a significant amount of effort, bracing with your hands, and shakiness. It's worse with chairs that have arms. That’s helpful. Do you notice it happening more in the morning, or is it consistent throughout the day?
PATIENT: It's… definitely worse in the mornings. When I first wake up, it’s really bad. Like, I gotta really concentrate just to get my feet on the floor, and then it takes a good few tries to actually stand up without wobblin’. It’s a little better later in the day after I’ve been movin’ around for a while, but it never completely goes away, y’know? Especially after I’ve been sittin’ for a long time. Like, on my lunch break.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mornings are the worst, improving with movement, but still present, especially after prolonged sitting. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not that I’ve noticed. No pain anywhere else, no numb spots, no weakness in my legs. I’ve been feelin’ kinda tired lately, but, uh, that’s just the job, I think. We work long hours out on the rigs, you know? Could just be that. I haven't fallen yet, thankfully. I just feel… unsteady.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, numbness, or weakness, just fatigue, which you attribute to your work. And no falls, thankfully, just a feeling of unsteadiness. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fallin’ outta a tree, but that healed up fine. And I had the flu a couple times, I guess, like everyone does. Other than that, I've been pretty healthy, honestly. Never been to the hospital for anything serious. I don’t really go to doctors much, to be honest. And… uh, my wife… she passed away a few years back. That's… that’s about it.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. That must have been incredibly difficult. Okay, so no major medical issues or surgeries in your past, just a broken arm as a child. Have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never any surgeries. Just the arm when I was a kid, and it didn’t need one, just a cast. I mostly get patched up on the rig if I cut myself or something, but nothing major. We got a medic out there. He's pretty good. Mostly scrapes and bruises, you know? It's a rough job.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No surgeries. And you've been patched up for minor injuries on the rig. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My mom had some trouble with her joints when she got older, kinda arthritis I think, but she didn’t really talk about it much. My dad… he was a pretty healthy guy, worked all his life, didn’t have much trouble with anything. My wife… her mom had high blood pressure, I think. But, honestly, we didn’t really keep up with family medical history, not like we should have. We were too busy livin’, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a bit of arthritis in your mother, high blood pressure in your wife's mother, but no strong family history of anything specific. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope, not takin' anything. Never really been one for pills, if I can help it. I drink a lot of water, try to eat right when I can, but the food on the rig ain’t always the best. And, uh… sometimes I have a beer after work, but that’s about it. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. And you drink water and occasionally have a beer. Lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I've never had to worry about carryin’ an EpiPen or anything. I can’t think of a single thing I’m allergic to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No allergies. Alright, Elijiah, thanks for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. It'll just involve checking your strength, balance, and reflexes. It'll help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Sounds good, Doctor. Just tell me what you need me to do. I'm ready when you are. I figure anything to get this sorted is worth tryin’.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, if you could sit on the table for me, please. First, I'm going to check your reflexes. I’ll tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer, and you just relax your legs. It won’t hurt, but let me know if it’s uncomfortable. Okay, reflexes are normal. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There you go. Feels pretty strong to me, if I do say so myself. Been doin’ a lot of heavy liftin' for years now.
DOCTOR: Good strength. Now, can you push against my hands with your legs?
PATIENT: Like this? I can push pretty hard, if you want. Been haulin' myself up those rig ladders all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Good strength. Now, let’s check your balance. I want you to stand up, feet together, and try to keep your balance without moving your feet. I'll stand close by, just in case. Okay, you can sit back down. I noticed a little bit of sway when you were standing, but nothing overly concerning. Do you normally feel unsteady when you stand?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually… now that you mention it, I do. Not all the time, but it happens. Especially if I’ve been sittin’ for a while, like you said. I kinda figured it was just me bein’ tired, or maybe not gettin’ enough sleep. Didn’t think much of it. But you're right, I do feel kinda wobbly sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Now, I want to check your range of motion in your hips and knees. Can you lie down on your back for me?
PATIENT: Sure thing, Doctor. Just let me know what you need me to do. I’ll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying flat, everything feels pretty good. There’s a bit of stiffness when I move your legs, but no pain, which is good. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found in the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing a bit of generalized weakness and some difficulty with balance, possibly exacerbated by prolonged sitting. Now, this could be due to a few things. It could be related to muscle weakness, a mild inner ear issue affecting your balance, or even a vitamin deficiency. It's hard to say definitively without some further testing. I’d like to order some bloodwork to check your vitamin levels, particularly Vitamin D and B12, and to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also think it would be helpful to do a simple balance test, just to get a better sense of how your balance is affected. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s goin’ on, and get it fixed, if possible. Bloodwork and a balance test… sounds good to me. I'm ready when you are. Hope it ain't too expensive, though… I don’t have insurance, so…
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost. We can discuss options for affordable testing, and I'll do my best to keep the costs as low as possible. We can also look into community resources that might be able to help. Okay, let's start with the bloodwork. I’ll write you a requisition form, and you can take it to the lab across the hall. It should take about 30 minutes. Then, after the bloodwork, I have my assistant, Maria, set up a simple balance test for you. It will just involve standing on a foam pad for a minute while we measure your stability. I'll also give you a handout with some exercises you can do at home to help improve your strength and balance. While we’re waiting for the results, I want you to pay attention to any new symptoms you experience, and let me know if anything changes. Also, try to avoid prolonged sitting as much as possible, and get up and move around every 30 minutes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that all sounds good, Doctor. Thank you. Avoiding sittin’… that might be tough on the rig, but I’ll do my best. And I’ll watch out for new symptoms. Maria and the balance test… okay. And I’ll try those exercises. I appreciate you helpin' me out, especially since I don’t have insurance. I just want to get back to normal. When do you think I'll get the results from the bloodwork?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Elijiah. I understand it's not easy, and we'll do our best to get you back to normal. The bloodwork usually takes 2-3 business days to come back. Maria will call you as soon as they're available. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss the results and create a plan. Here's the requisition form for the bloodwork. And here's the handout with the exercises. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything pretty clearly. I appreciate your time and help. I’ll get the bloodwork done right away, and I'll wait for Maria to call. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Elijiah. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
