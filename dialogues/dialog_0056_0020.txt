DOCTOR: Hi Avril, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Well, I am here for this… telephone visit, yes? My son, he made the appointment for me. I do not feel very well, but it is hard to say exactly what is wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, a telephone visit… right. And you said you’re not quite sure what’s going on – that’s alright, we’ll figure it out together. Can you tell me a little bit more about how you’re not feeling well?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. It is… a tiredness, always. Not like after work, you understand? This is… all the time. And my stomach, it does not like food much anymore. Everything feels… heavy. I also have… little pains, here and there, but they move. It is not one place.
DOCTOR: Okay, so constant tiredness, a loss of appetite and feeling of fullness, and some shifting abdominal pain. That gives us a starting point. How long have you been feeling this way, Avril?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I think… maybe two, three months now? It started slowly, just not wanting much to eat. Then the tiredness came. It is hard to remember exactly, because things… they blend together, you know? It is not like a sudden sickness. It just… grew.
DOCTOR: I understand, it’s helpful to know it was gradual. So, two or three months of increasing tiredness and decreased appetite, with abdominal pain developing around the same time. Has anything specifically made it worse, or better?
PATIENT: No, not really. Eating does not make it better, it just… sits. And resting does not help the tiredness much either. It is there all the time, no matter what I do. I did try some… tea, chamomile, my neighbor gave it to me, but that did not change anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – constipation, diarrhea, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. Sometimes… difficult. Not every day, but often. I have to… push. And it is not like before, you understand? Harder. Sorry to speak of this.
DOCTOR: No, don't apologize at all, Avril. That’s important information. So, constipation, requiring straining. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any changes in its color?
PATIENT: No, no blood. Just… hard. And sometimes… darker, I think. Not bright, but… not the usual color. It is hard to explain. I do not pay much attention to this usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, darker stools along with the constipation. Have you had any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I think so. My clothes… they are a little loose. I did not think much of it, because… well, I am older, things change. But now you ask, maybe I have lost some weight. I do not weigh myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, tiredness, decreased appetite, shifting abdominal pain, constipation with straining, darker stools, and some unintentional weight loss over the past few months. Do you have any other symptoms – like nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, or any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, no fever. No chills. I do not vomit. Sometimes I feel… a little sick to my stomach, but not often. And no pain… not anywhere else. Just the stomach, and the tiredness. Everything feels… slow, you understand? Like I am walking through water.
DOCTOR: Okay, “slow,” that’s a good way to put it. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. My doctor, he passed away a few years ago. I saw him regularly, but… I do not remember everything he said. He checked my blood pressure sometimes, said it was a little high, but he gave me pills. I take those pills every day, a small white one. And I had… a problem with my gallbladder many years ago, they took it out. Other than that… I do not think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and you had your gallbladder removed in the past. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, I do not remember the name. It is a small white pill, I take it every morning. My son, he brings it for me. I do not like to bother him too much with these things. I just take the pill he gives me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can look it up based on your insurance information. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything. My mother, she was allergic to bees, but I am not. I have never had a problem with any food or medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no. I do not smoke. I used to drink a little wine, with dinner, but not anymore. It does not agree with me. And no, I do not use any… those things. Never.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any major medical problems that run in your family – like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother, she had… problems with her heart. She passed away when I was young. And my father, he had… something with his stomach, I think. But I do not remember exactly what. No one else… not that I know of. It was a long time ago. We did not talk much about these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems in your mother and stomach issues in your father. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, I’m listening to your heart now… sounds a bit fast, but otherwise regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. I’m noticing some tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. It's not sharply painful, but you might feel a little discomfort when I press there. Is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… yes, a little uncomfortable. On the left side, you are right. It is not a bad pain, but I feel it when you press. Like a… dull ache, you know? Not sharp, just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in the lower left abdomen. And I'm not feeling any masses or enlarged organs. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be something related to your colon, like diverticulitis, or possibly a problem with your ovaries, depending on the specific location of the pain. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood tests and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and blood tests? Yes, okay. If you think it is necessary, Doctor. It sounds… complicated. Will it take long? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It's not overly complicated, Avril, and we'll take it one step at a time. The blood tests will just help us look for signs of infection or inflammation. The CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of your abdomen and pelvis. It’s painless – you’ll lie on a table, and a scanner will move around you. It takes about 20-30 minutes. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a medication to help with the constipation. It's a mild stool softener. Also, I'm going to give you a referral to a gastroenterologist - a specialist who can help us figure out what's going on in your digestive system. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. A stool softener… and a specialist. Yes, that sounds… good. If it will help. What about the pain? Is there anything I can take for the pain?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. You can take over-the-counter Tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain, as long as you don’t have any allergies or other medical conditions that prevent you from taking them. Just follow the instructions on the label. I'll also give you some written instructions with all of this information, including the name of the stool softener, the referral information for the gastroenterologist, and what to expect during the CT scan. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. You have explained everything very well, Doctor. Thank you. I will try the stool softener, and I will make an appointment with the specialist.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Remember, if you experience any worsening pain, fever, chills, or significant changes in your bowel movements, please call my office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw the blood tests and go over the written instructions with you. It was nice meeting you, Avril, and I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly.
