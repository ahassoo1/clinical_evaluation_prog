DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Chayer. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It’s… my breathing. It’s been kinda hard, you know? Like, I get really short of breath. It's been happening for… a little while now, I guess. I don't really keep track of dates, to be honest. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Right. "A little while." We’ll try to get a better sense of that. Is this shortness of breath constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Um… it comes and goes, yeah. Definitely not all the time. It feels worse when I… well, when I’m doing stuff. Like at work, I’m always moving around, checking things… and then it gets harder to breathe. When I’m just sitting, it’s usually okay. Mostly. It’s hard to explain. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It's…adequate. So it’s exertion-related. Can you describe the feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… like, it’s not… pain, exactly. It’s more like… I can't get enough air? Like my lungs aren’t… filling up all the way? And my chest feels… tight, sometimes. Not always, but when it’s bad, yeah, tight. I don’t know… it’s just… hard to breathe, you know? I feel kinda panicked when it happens. It's not fun.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed…? Gosh. Uh… work’s been kinda busy. We've been short-staffed, so I’ve been putting in extra hours. Maybe that? I don’t know. Nothing else really… My wife and I haven’t… gone anywhere. No new pets. Just… work. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It can be. Increased workload could certainly be a factor. Now, let's go through a bit of your history. Do you have any medical problems that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Medical problems… Not really. I mean, I get colds sometimes, like everyone else. But nothing… serious? I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time, honestly. I usually just try to tough it out. My wife keeps telling me I should come in, but… I just don't like doctors, you know? I don’t remember ever being told I had anything wrong with me. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Vague. Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Let me think… No. No surgeries, I don’t think. Not that I remember. Nothing… cut open or anything. When I was a kid maybe… I don't really recall. I had the usual childhood stuff, but nothing big. Definitely no surgeries as an adult. I would remember that, right?
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family…? Uh… my wife’s family is healthy, as far as I know. Her mom has… something with her knees, but that's it. My… my family back in Venezuela… I haven’t seen them in years. I don’t really know what’s going on with them. I think my… my grandfather had some heart trouble, maybe? But I’m not sure. It was a long time ago, and… well, it’s hard to keep track. Sorry. Is that useful?
DOCTOR: Marginally. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t think so. I haven't taken anything regularly in ages. Nothing I'm aware of. Sometimes I get a little itchy if I touch certain plants, but that's it. Not like a serious allergy, you know? No hives or anything. Just… a little itch. I don't think that's important, is it?
DOCTOR: It's… noted. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No. Nope. Not a single one. I haven't needed anything. I take vitamins sometimes, when I remember, but that's it. Just a multivitamin, the regular kind. I try to eat healthy, but… work makes it hard. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Could you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Just… take it easy, okay? I’m not exactly the most… coordinated person. What are we looking for?
DOCTOR: Your breathing sounds…slightly diminished bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles at this time. Resonance is normal. Your heart rate is a little elevated, 98 beats per minute, but that could be from standing. Pulse is regular. Now, take a deep breath for me. And again. Chest expansion appears symmetrical. No obvious signs of distress at rest.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Is everything alright? It feels… okay, but… you said my heart rate was high? Is that bad? I haven’t been feeling… particularly stressed, but work has been… you know. I'm not sure what all that means, to be honest. I just want to be able to breathe normally again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily alarming at this point, Mr. Chayer. Elevated heart rate can have many causes, including anxiety and exertion. However, given your complaints of shortness of breath, we need to investigate further. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. The X-ray will help us rule out any lung issues, and the blood count will check for anemia or infection.
PATIENT: An X-ray…? Oh. That sounds… serious. Is it something bad? I don't really like… hospitals and tests and stuff. What if it finds something really wrong? And… what about the blood count? Is that going to hurt? I get kinda nervous around needles, to be honest. Can we… can we just try something else first? Maybe some… medicine? Or… I don't know. I just want this to be over with.
DOCTOR: Mr. Chayer, I understand your apprehension, but these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your breathing difficulties. We can't simply guess what's wrong. The X-ray is a simple imaging procedure, and the blood draw is relatively painless. I'll write you a prescription for a short course of albuterol, an inhaler to help open your airways, but that's just to manage symptoms. It won't address the underlying problem. The lab and imaging results will provide more information. I want you to schedule these tests as soon as possible. I'll have the nurse provide you with the necessary paperwork and instructions. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Albuterol… that sounds… complicated. I’m not good with… instructions. I always forget stuff. And… paperwork? I haven't filled out paperwork in years. I don't even have a regular doctor, so I don't know where to go for the tests. And… I don't have insurance, so… how much is all this going to cost? I just… I just want to breathe normally again. Is there… is there anything else we can try? Maybe just… rest? Or some… herbal tea? I'm really not good with all this medical stuff. It just makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Chayer, I've explained the necessary steps for evaluating your condition. We are proceeding with the standard protocol. Rest and herbal tea are unlikely to resolve your symptoms. I will provide you with a list of local facilities that offer affordable or sliding-scale pricing for imaging and lab work. The nurse will also assist you with finding resources for financial assistance. I’m not able to provide any further recommendations beyond these tests. I suggest you schedule the tests immediately. The sooner we have the results, the sooner we can determine the appropriate course of action. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah… I understand. I just… it's a lot. I don't really handle stress very well. Okay, the tests. And… financial assistance. I’ll… I’ll ask the nurse. I guess. Thank you, Doctor. I think. I just… I really hope it’s nothing serious. I just want to go home and see my wife. Is that… is that alright? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Chayer. You may leave. The nurse will be with you shortly to discuss the paperwork and scheduling. .
