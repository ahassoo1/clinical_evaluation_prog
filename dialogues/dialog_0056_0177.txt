DOCTOR: Hi Jimmi, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Well, it’s…down there. Something’s kinda…leaking. I don’t know what it is, but it’s not right. Never happened before. It’s…gross.
DOCTOR: Okay, “down there.” Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More? What more is there to say? It’s… wet. And kinda…yellowish. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to bother me. I noticed it a couple days ago. It's…uncomfortable, ya know? Like somethin' ain't clean. I always keep things clean, always!
DOCTOR: Alright, wet and yellowish, noticed it for a couple of days. And it’s causing some discomfort…like it doesn't feel clean. Okay. Is there any odor associated with it?
PATIENT: Odor? Ugh. Maybe. I dunno. My nose ain’t what it used to be, ya know? I mean, it's a man's area. It's gonna smell somethin', right? But it don’t smell…rotten or nothin’. Just…regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, not a foul odor. And just to clarify, you said this started a couple of days ago - has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Like…what kinda change? I been livin’ the same way for seventy-three years, mostly. I… I don’t go out much. I paint. Mostly flowers. And I eat my rice. Hmm… oh! Old Man Hemminger’s dog been comin’ in my yard again. Pesky little thing. Could it be from that?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major changes to your routine, aside from the dog coming into your yard. We're going to need to do a quick exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: An exam? Ugh. Gotta touch it? Look at it? I don’t like people pokin’ around down there. It’s…private. But… I guess if you have to. Just be quick about it, okay? And don't you go makin’ a mess.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible, and we'll keep things covered. I’ll need you to lie down on the exam table. We’ll start with a visual inspection, and then I’ll likely do a gentle external exam. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Visual inspection… like you gonna stare? Fine, fine. But I’m keepin’ my dignity. And if it gets too weird, you stop. Right now. Just… hurry up, okay? I got flowers to paint.
DOCTOR: Okay, I completely understand. We'll be quick and respectful. I’ll step out so you can get settled on the table, and then I’ll come back in.
PATIENT: …Fine. Dignity. Gotta remember my dignity.
DOCTOR: Alright Jimmi, are you comfortable?
PATIENT: Comfy as I’m gonna be, I suppose. Just get it over with. And be gentle! Don't you go lookin' at nothin' you shouldn't.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm just going to take a look now. I'm seeing some mild redness and a small amount of discharge. No obvious signs of injury or sores. I’m not going to do a full internal exam today, given your discomfort. It appears to be a possible case of balanitis, which is inflammation of the head of the penis. It can be caused by a number of things, including irritation or infection.
PATIENT: Ba-la-what-itis? Inflammation? Is that…serious? Will I have to go to the hospital? I ain’t been to a hospital in… well, a long time. And I don’t want to go! I got my flowers, ya know. What do I do? Is it catchin'? Will Old Man Hemminger catch it from his dog?
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths, Jimmi. Balanitis itself isn’t usually serious, and you definitely won’t need to go to the hospital. It’s often treated with a topical cream. And no, it’s not contagious, so Old Man Hemminger and his dog are perfectly safe. I'm going to prescribe a topical antifungal cream to apply twice a day for a week. It’s important to keep the area clean and dry as well. We'll also want to rule out other possible causes, just to be safe. I'd like to order a urine test to check for any infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Topical cream… like, you put it on there? Ugh. But…if it helps. And a pee test? That's…less bad than the other thing. Fine. A cream and a pee test. Just…how do I get the cream? And what about the dog? Maybe I should call the animal control. He's a messy animal, ya know. Always diggin' up my garden.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'll send the prescription to your usual pharmacy. You’ll need to pick it up there. And we can discuss animal control if you’d like, but it’s unlikely the dog is related to this. I'll also give you written instructions on how to apply the cream and what to look out for. If the cream doesn't improve things within a week, or if you develop a fever, increased pain, or swelling, please call the office immediately. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Written instructions… okay. As long as it’s clear. I ain't good with complicated things, ya know. My eyesight ain’t what it used to be either. No fever, no swelling… I’ll remember. I think. And if the dog comes back, I am callin’ animal control. He's a menace, I tell ya! A menace! So…can I go now? My flowers are waitin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jimmi. Here are the written instructions – they’re in a larger font, I made a note of that for you. And I’ve also included the contact information for the office, in case you have any questions or concerns. Yes, you can absolutely go now. I’ll call in the order for the urine test to the lab. We'll give them a call in a day or two to check the results. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. And I hope you get back to your flowers soon. .
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you. I…I think that's all. I’ll try not to let that dog bother me. And I’ll remember the cream. Goodbye. .
