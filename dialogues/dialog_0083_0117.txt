DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, Devin Reyno. Yeah. I… I got a cough. Been coughin’ up… stuff. Red stuff. Not good. I smoke, you know. Been smokin’ a long time. That what it is, probably. Just want to get it checked, if that’s okay. Don’t wanna… waste your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Devin. It’s good you came in to get it checked. It’s never a waste of time to address a new symptom, and coughing up red material definitely warrants a look. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about this cough?
PATIENT: More… how long? Uh… a while. Maybe a month? Hard to say exactly. I don’t… I don’t pay much attention to dates, really. It started small, just a tickle. Then it got… wetter. And then… the red. It ain't a lot, but it's there. I mostly cough it up in the mornin’. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Devin. A month is helpful. And the fact that it’s worse in the morning is also good to know. You mentioned it started as a tickle and progressed. Has it been getting worse steadily, or has it been coming and going?
PATIENT: Comin’ and goin’. Mostly goin’ now, I think. Less coughin’ today than yesterday. But… I worry. It’s the red, see? Never coughed up red before. I try not to think about it too much. Just… want it to go away. I got things to do. Don't have time for… sickness.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the red material, Devin, and it's good you're taking it seriously. It's always best to investigate new symptoms like that. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the “stuff” you're coughing up a little more?
PATIENT: Uh… it’s… sticky. Red, like I said. Not bright red, more… dark. Kinda mixed with… phlegm, I guess. You know, the stuff you cough up when you got a cold. But darker. And sometimes… little bits in it. I don’t… I don’t look at it too close. Makes me nervous. It’s not a huge amount, though. Like I said, not a lot. I just… notice it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Devin. Dark, sticky, mixed with phlegm, and sometimes with small bits… I appreciate you being so honest with me, even though it’s uncomfortable to talk about. Now, let's talk a bit more broadly. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the cough?
PATIENT: Other… hmm. Let me think. I get tired easy. Been tired a long time, though. Hard to say if it’s… new. Maybe a little short of breath sometimes. When I walk up hills. Not a big walker, though, so… hard to tell. No fever, I don't think. And no chest pain. Just… tired. And the cough. That’s about it, I think. Really. I don't… I don’t notice much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, Devin. Fatigue and some shortness of breath with exertion. That's helpful to know. And it’s good you haven’t had any fever or chest pain. Now, could you tell me a bit about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Smoking… yeah. Started when I was young. Stupid, I know. Been smokin’ ever since. How many… I don’t even know. A pack a day? Maybe more. I try to cut back sometimes, but… it’s hard. Been smokin’ these past… fifty years, I guess. Something like that. Never quit for long. Just… can’t. Don’t like to think about it. Makes me anxious.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open about that, Devin. It takes courage to talk about habits like that. Fifty years of smoking is significant, and we need to consider that as we look at your cough. Now, let's move onto some other things. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I take a little somethin’ for my blood pressure, but that’s it. The doctor… the last doctor gave it to me. Can’t remember the name of it. And… I think I’m allergic to dust, maybe? Gets me sneezin’ sometimes. But that’s about it. Not much. Never been one for fancy things. Or allergies, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, Devin. No known drug allergies, just some possible sensitivity to dust, and you take medication for blood pressure. We can look up the name of that medication in your records in a moment. Now, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… yeah. That’s about it. I… I had the flu once, a long time ago. And… I broke my arm when I was a kid. But that was… a long time ago. Nothing serious, really. Just… the usual. I’ve been pretty healthy, I think. Knock on wood. Don't go to the doctor much. Don't like hospitals. They make me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Devin. High blood pressure, a past broken arm, and a bout of the flu. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to ask about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother… she had somethin’ with her heart, I think. Died when I was young. My father… he worked in the mines. Got sick later in life, lung problems, I think. But that was from the dust. I don't know… a lot of them smoked too. My brother… he had diabetes. But… I don’t really keep track. We don't see each other much. It’s been a long time. Don't know much about their… health. Really. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Devin. History of heart problems in your mother, lung problems potentially related to mining in your father, and diabetes in your brother. Thank you for sharing that. Now, to finish up with the history, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yeah. Live alone. Always have, pretty much. Never married. No kids. Just me. Got a small place. Quiet. I… I keep to myself. Don't have many visitors. It's… fine. Been that way a long time. Don't really need much. Just… peace and quiet. And my smoke. Sorry. I’m rambling. You probably don’t care.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Devin. I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. It all helps me to understand your overall health picture. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah. Okay. Fine. Get it over with. Don't like bein' poked and prodded, but… if you gotta, you gotta. Just… be quick, if you could. I got things to do. Not lookin' for trouble, just… want to know what's wrong. Hopefully nothin'. That’s all. Just get it done.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Devin. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Okay. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, particularly on the left side. It's subtle, but it's there. Your lymph nodes feel normal. No swelling. Your ears look clear and your throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 150/90, and your pulse is 78. And one final listen to your lungs. Still hearing some wheezing. Okay, Devin. That’s all for the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I heard during the exam, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a sputum sample to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray… sputum… more tests. Ugh. Fine. Whatever you gotta do. Just… tell me what it means. Don’t want a lot of fancy words. Just… is it bad? Is it the smoke? Hopefully it’s just the smoke. I've been smokin' a long time. Just tell me straight. No need to beat around the bush. I don't like bein' kept in the dark. And how long will it take? I got things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Devin, and I promise to keep it straightforward. The X-ray will help us see if there's any damage to your lungs, and the sputum sample will help us check for any infection. It could be related to your smoking history – smoking is a major risk factor for lung problems, and the wheezing I heard is consistent with that. However, we need the tests to rule out other possibilities. The X-ray shouldn’t take long at all – just a few minutes. The sputum sample involves coughing up a bit of mucus into a cup, and it might take a few attempts to get enough. The results usually take a few days to come back. I’ll order those tests for you now, and the nurse will explain the logistics. In the meantime, I’m going to start you on an inhaler to help open up your airways and ease the wheezing. It’s a bronchodilator, and it can provide some immediate relief. Would you like me to explain how to use it?
PATIENT: Inhaler… okay. Fine. Relief sounds good. Explain it. I’m not good with… fancy things. Just… simple. Show me. And… will it stop me from smokin’? I don't wanna be thinkin' about smokin' all the time. Just… explain the inhaler. That’s all. Keep it simple. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Devin. This inhaler is very simple to use. It delivers medication directly to your lungs to help open up your airways. First, you remove the cap. Then, you shake the inhaler well. Next, you take a deep breath and put the inhaler in your mouth, making sure your lips are sealed around it. As you start to breathe in slowly, you press down on the canister to release the medication. Continue breathing in deeply and slowly. Hold your breath for about ten seconds to allow the medication to reach your lungs. Then exhale slowly. We can also use a spacer with the inhaler, which makes it easier to get the medication into your lungs. The nurse will show you how to use the spacer as well. It won’t stop you from smoking, Devin. It simply helps manage the symptoms. The best way to protect your lungs is to quit smoking, and I can provide resources to help you if you’re interested. Do you have any questions about how to use the inhaler?
PATIENT: Resources… maybe later. Right now, just… the inhaler. So, shake it, put it in my mouth, breathe in while pressin’ the thing. Hold my breath. That it? Sounds… complicated. But I guess I can try. I got a lot on my mind. Just… try to remember that. Shake, mouth, press, hold. Is that right? And how often? Don't wanna mess it up. Just… tell me how often. Please. Keep it simple.
DOCTOR: You’ve got it exactly right, Devin. Shake, mouth, press, hold. It sounds complicated, but it becomes easier with practice. You should use two puffs of the inhaler every four to six hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing. Don’t exceed eight puffs in a 24-hour period. And remember, it’s important to rinse your mouth out with water after each use to prevent thrush, a mouth infection. The nurse will go over all of this with you again before you leave, and she can answer any other questions you may have. For now, the nurse will schedule your chest X-ray and collect a sputum sample. After we have those results, we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s it. Just… get it done. I wanna go home. Hopefully, nothin’ bad. Just… get it done. And… thank you. For… explainin’ it. And… bein’ patient. Just… get it done. Now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Devin. I understand wanting to get this over with. The nurse will be in shortly to get you set up for the tests. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. .
