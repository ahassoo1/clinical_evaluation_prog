DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion, good morning. Have a seat, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Vilma. Well, it’s my chest. It’s been… hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. It feels like… a squeezing, sometimes. Like a tight band.
DOCTOR: A squeezing, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, squeezing. And… heavy. Like someone is sitting on my chest. It started, oh, maybe a week ago? I don’t remember the exact day, but around then. It happens when I walk, mostly. Not when I’m resting. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. And you’re saying it only bothers you with exertion, like walking?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Walking, or… if I climb the stairs at church. Things like that. When I’m sitting and watching the telenovelas, I’m fine. No pain at all. My husband, he says I worry too much, but it feels different this time. He doesn't understand. He's always been a strong man. Never gets sick.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s good you’re paying attention to your body. A lot of people ignore these things until it’s too late. Now, tell me… have you had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I've had… aches, you know, from gardening, or a bad shoulder when I was younger. But this is… different. It’s in my chest, and it makes me feel… breathless sometimes. Not always, but a few times when I’m walking uphill, I have to stop and catch my breath. It's scary.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness with the pain… alright. And when you say “pain,” where exactly are you feeling it?
PATIENT: Right here. More on this side, I think. Not sharp, not stabbing. Just… heavy and tight. It goes away when I stop walking, but it comes back quickly if I start again. It's like trying to push through something. Does that… explain it better?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you having any pain in your arm, your jaw, your back, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, no pain anywhere else. Just the chest. And… sometimes I get a little dizzy, but I don't know if that's the pain, or just me getting old! My husband says it's the telenovelas making my head spin, but I think he's just teasing me.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Alright. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any problems with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… The doctor, a few years ago, he told me my blood pressure was a little high. He gave me a little pill to take. I take it every morning. I don’t know the name of it. And… no, no diabetes. I do like my arepas, but my husband makes me eat a lot of vegetables too! High cholesterol… I don’t think so. I’ve never been told that. I have Medicare, so they do a lot of tests, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, let me just pull up your records here… Okay, I see you're on lisinopril for hypertension. Good. And no history of diabetes or high cholesterol documented. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A long time ago, I had my gallbladder out. When I was younger, maybe thirty years ago? And… I was in the hospital when I had my son, of course. But that was normal, right? Nothing else. No other surgeries. I try to stay healthy, you know? I walk every day, I eat my vegetables… well, most days.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… Well, my mother, she had some problems with her heart when she was old. She was always tired, and… she died when I was still young. I don’t remember exactly what was wrong, but the doctors said it was her heart. My father, he lived a long time, very strong. He never had any problems with his heart, as far as I know. My brother, he’s okay. A little overweight, but healthy enough. Does that help? It’s hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. And do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never. My mother, she smoked a little when I was a girl, but I never liked it. And… I drink a little wine sometimes. Maybe a glass with dinner, on the weekends. Nothing more. My husband likes his beer, but I don’t. He snores enough already! I don't need anything to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, based on what you’ve told me, and given your age and history, it sounds like you might be experiencing angina. That’s chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. It's something we need to investigate further. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to get an EKG done to see what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Angina… Is that… bad? I mean, what does that mean? And an EKG? Is that… painful? I don’t like tests. But… if you think it’s important, I’ll do it. Just… please tell me what’s happening, okay? I get scared easily.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Angina isn't necessarily bad, but it’s a sign that your heart isn't getting enough oxygen, and we need to find out why. The EKG—electrocardiogram—is a simple, painless test. We put some stickers on your chest to measure the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn’t hurt at all. It just takes a few minutes. We’ll get some results right away, and then we can discuss what the next steps are, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… stickers… no pain… That sounds… better. But… what if it is something bad? What if I need… surgery? My husband, he worries so much. He’s a good man, but he gets very upset. He’ll want to come with me everywhere.
DOCTOR: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We don’t know anything yet. First, we do the EKG. Then we see what it shows. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Worrying yourself sick isn’t going to help anything. Now, let’s get started. If you’ll just lie back on the examination table…
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Just… please be quick, okay? And tell me everything you’re doing. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will place these stickers—electrodes—on your chest, arms, and legs. They’re just going to pick up the electrical signals from your heart. It might be a little cold, but it won’t hurt. I’ll be right here, monitoring the results. Try to relax and breathe normally. Don't worry, I'll explain everything as we go. Now, nurse, let's get started.
PATIENT: Okay… That’s… cold! But I’m trying to relax. Just… tell me when it’s over, okay? I don’t like being poked and prodded. And… what exactly are you looking for on that screen? Is it… something bad if it looks different?
DOCTOR: Just make sure the leads are secure, nurse. We’re looking for ST-segment changes, arrhythmias, and overall waveform morphology. Don’t worry, Mrs. Chelberg, it’s a standard procedure. It helps us see how your heart is functioning right now. Ah, here we are. We're seeing some… slight ST-segment depression in leads V4 through V6. This could indicate ischemia, meaning reduced blood flow to the heart. We need to run some further tests to confirm this.
PATIENT: Ischemia… Reduced blood flow… That sounds… very bad. Is that why I’m having the pain? And what tests? More poking and prodding? Will it hurt? My husband… he’s going to be so worried. What does this mean? Please, just tell me the truth. I can handle it, but I need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Chelberg, calm down. Ischemia doesn't necessarily mean it's very bad, it just means we need to investigate further. The pain you’re experiencing is likely related to this reduced blood flow. As for further tests, we'll need to do a blood draw to check your cardiac enzymes – these can indicate whether there's been any damage to the heart muscle. And I’m going to order a stress test, where you’ll walk on a treadmill while we monitor your heart’s activity. It’s not as bad as it sounds, but it will require some exertion. It’s important to get this checked out, Mrs. Chelberg. Ignoring it won't make it go away. And frankly, your husband's worry isn't my primary concern. Your health is.
PATIENT: .
