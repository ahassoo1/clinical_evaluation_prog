DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bahta, let’s get this over with. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. My name is Lonell Bahta. I am here… because I received a paper, a notice, about seeing you for… home health, yes? To see if I am able to receive help at home. It was suggested after my… recent hospital stay. It was quite a long one, you see.
DOCTOR: Home health, right. Hospital stay… vaguely remember something about that. Long one, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Six weeks. Six full weeks at St. Jude’s. Pneumonia, quite severe. They said I need help when I go home, with… everything. I live alone, you see. My ex-wife… well, that is another story. But I need to know if this home health is… possible, if I qualify. It’s a bit… overwhelming to think about, managing on my own after all that time in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia… six weeks… Okay, I think I’m pulling up your records now. St. Jude’s… right. Alright, well, let's not get ahead of ourselves with “qualifying.” We need to figure out what kind of help you actually need, first. Tell me, what were you doing before you went into the hospital?
PATIENT: Before the hospital? I am a pediatric surgeon, Doctor. I was working, quite actively, at Children’s Hospital, downtown. Though, with my age… and the recovery, I do not know if I will be able to return to such… demanding work. I enjoyed it, very much, but… stamina is a concern, now. I had to stop a few months back when I began to feel… weak. Then the pneumonia came swiftly after.
DOCTOR: A surgeon, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. For thirty years. Thirty years of… operating. Though, as I said, that was before. It feels… a lifetime ago, now. I am concerned about what I can do, going forward. And if this home health can assist with… getting back on my feet, so to speak. I have a small apartment, but… stairs, you see. And cooking… it was always a necessity, but now… it is a challenge.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright. So, stairs and cooking are issues. Anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My strength is… diminished. Lifting, even small things, is difficult. And… bathing. It is… embarrassing to admit, but I require assistance with washing myself. Also, the medication. There are many pills, several times a day. Remembering them all is… becoming difficult, though I assure you my mind is still sharp. I simply… forget, sometimes. A small detail, perhaps, but important nonetheless.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Weakness, bathing assistance, medication management… Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Though, please excuse my… slowness. And do not be alarmed if I wobble a bit. It is a new experience, this fragility. I was always… quite steady on my feet, before.
DOCTOR: Alright. Bit unsteady, as you say. Noticeable weakness in the lower extremities. Blood pressure is… 130/80. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs… still a bit congested, though not acutely wheezing. Can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is that sufficient? I do not wish to… overexert myself. It is difficult to gauge strength, now. I used to have a very firm grip, you see. Instruments, delicate sutures… required precision. It is… frustrating, this loss of ability.
DOCTOR: Weak grip strength, as expected. Alright. We’ll need to get some blood work done, just to rule out anything else contributing to the weakness. And I'm going to order a chest X-ray to see how those lungs are healing. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood and schedule the X-ray for you.
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Blood work and an X-ray. I trust your judgment. I simply wish to… understand what is happening, and what assistance is available. This home health… is it likely, in your opinion? I understand you cannot guarantee anything, but… a general assessment would be appreciated. It’s the uncertainty that is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Bahta, you've been through a lot. Six weeks in the hospital, pneumonia... Of course, you're weak. And yes, based on this quick exam, you would likely qualify for some level of home health care. But don't get your hopes up. It's a bureaucratic mess, lots of paperwork. And it's not going to magically fix everything. We'll see what the blood work and X-ray show. I'll have the nurse explain the process. Don’t expect a quick resolution. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: I… understand, Doctor. Bureaucracy. Paperwork. I anticipated as much. No, there is nothing else, at present. I simply… wished for clarity. Thank you for your time, and for the… assessment. I will await the results of the tests, and the nurse’s explanation. It was… a pleasure meeting you. Though, I suspect ‘pleasure’ is… a strong word.
DOCTOR: .
