DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It's nice to meet you. Why don't we start by you telling me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about it for my arthritis. Says it'll do wonders. Frankly, I think it’s a bit… much. But she insisted I get a “certification,” as she calls it. So here I am.
DOCTOR: I see. So you're exploring medical marijuana as a potential treatment for your arthritis, and your daughter encouraged you to seek a certification. That's good of her to be looking out for you. And you’re wanting to discuss whether it's appropriate for you, and perhaps get some more information?
PATIENT: Appropriate is… a strong word, Doctor. I’m merely indulging her. I have always managed perfectly well with what the doctor prescribes, you understand. This…alternative medicine…it seems rather frivolous. Though, I must admit, the pain has been worse lately. Still, I’m a woman of a certain age. I don’t need…experiments.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely, Ellan. It's perfectly reasonable to be cautious about trying something new, especially when you've been managing well with traditional treatments. And you're right to want to be thorough. Let’s talk about that increased pain you mentioned. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s in my knees, mostly. And my hips. It’s not a sharp pain, you understand. More of a…dull ache. Constant, really. It's worse in the mornings, of course. And after I’ve been on my feet for too long. Gardening, you see. I love my garden. But getting up and down... it's becoming quite the ordeal. I take two ibuprofen in the morning, and sometimes another two before bed. But it doesn’t always…suffice.
DOCTOR: I see. So the pain is primarily in your knees and hips, a dull ache that’s worse in the mornings and with activity, like gardening. And the ibuprofen is helping, but not completely relieving the discomfort. That gives me a good starting point. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the pain?
PATIENT: Well… stiffness, certainly. Especially in the mornings. It takes me a good hour to feel…looser. And sometimes, after a particularly strenuous day – weeding, mostly – my knees feel…warm. Not hot, you understand. Just…warm to the touch. And a bit… swollen, perhaps. Though my daughter says I don't notice things like that. She’s always fussing.
DOCTOR: Stiffness in the mornings lasting about an hour, and some warmth and swelling in your knees after activity. That's helpful to know. It sounds like you may have some inflammation contributing to your pain. Now, thinking beyond the pain and stiffness, have you experienced any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor, I’m not a complicated case. I’m a healthy woman, for my age. I eat well, I don’t smoke, I drink a glass of wine with dinner, and I take my vitamins. I’ve always been very particular about my health. I simply came at the behest of my daughter to explore this… marijuana option. I haven't been feeling ill, if that's what you're asking. Just…a bit achy. And frankly, irritated by all this fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ellan. You’re understandably frustrated, and it sounds like you generally maintain a very healthy lifestyle. I'm not trying to suggest you have a complicated case. It's standard practice to gather a full picture of your health, including a review of your medical history, just to be thorough. Perhaps we can start with that. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, like arthritis or anything else?
PATIENT: Well… Doctor Ramirez diagnosed me with osteoarthritis in my knees about ten years ago, I suppose. But it wasn't bad enough to warrant any… drastic measures. Just some physical therapy, which I did for a few months. It helped a little. But honestly, I mostly just learned to manage. I’ve also had the usual things – the flu, a bad cold now and then. Nothing serious. I had my gallbladder removed twenty years ago, but that was…routine. And my blood pressure has been a bit elevated lately, but it's nothing a small dose of lisinopril can't handle. Really, Doctor, I’m a remarkably healthy woman. This marijuana business seems rather… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ellan. That's very helpful. So, a history of osteoarthritis in the knees diagnosed ten years ago, managed with physical therapy, a cholecystectomy twenty years ago, and recently diagnosed, and treated, hypertension. It sounds like you’ve been proactive about your health. And before we discuss the medical marijuana further, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, besides the lisinopril?
PATIENT: Just the lisinopril, Doctor. Ten milligrams daily. And sometimes, when the arthritis flares up, I'll take ibuprofen. Two to four tablets, as needed. That's it. I really don’t like taking pills. I prefer to rely on my own strength, you understand. And a good cup of chamomile tea. Really, Doctor, I’m a very simple woman with very simple needs. And this whole marijuana situation feels… entirely unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ellan. Just lisinopril 10mg daily, and ibuprofen as needed. I appreciate you sharing that information with me. Now, before we proceed, I would like to do a brief physical examination of your knees and hips, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Is that necessary, Doctor? I came here for a certification, not a…show and tell. I suppose… if you insist. But please be gentle. My knees are rather sensitive, you understand. And I’d prefer not to be… prodded and poked unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about discomfort. This is simply a standard part of the evaluation process to get a better understanding of your condition. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t been on one of these contraptions in years. I hope this doesn’t take long. And please, do be careful. I'm not as nimble as I used to be, you understand. This whole process is quite…undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ellan. We'll be as quick and thorough as possible. Now, let's start with your knees. I'm just going to gently bend and straighten your legs to assess your range of motion. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort during this process. Alright, and now I’m just going to feel around your knee to check for any swelling or tenderness. Does this feel alright?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s…tender. Yes, very tender. Right there, on the inside. And it’s…warm. Not burning, you understand. Just…warm. Honestly, Doctor, I told you. It’s always been this way. I suppose it’s the arthritis. Though, as I said, I’ve managed perfectly well on my own for years. This poking and prodding is hardly necessary. And frankly, it’s quite uncomfortable. Could we please just get this certification over with? I have a garden to tend to, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ellan. Thank you for letting me know. Tenderness and warmth to the inside of the right knee. Now, let's check the left knee. I'm going to gently bend and straighten your leg, just like I did with the right. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. And now, feeling around the left knee... does this feel alright?
PATIENT: It’s…similar to the right, Doctor. Tender on the inside. Not as bad, perhaps, but definitely tender. And also warm. Honestly, Doctor, it’s the same story. I told you, I have arthritis. I don't need you to tell me what’s wrong with my knees. It’s rather obvious, isn’t it? And frankly, this whole examination is making my knees hurt even more. Could we please just get this over with? I’m beginning to feel rather…aggravated. This is entirely unnecessary, you know. A simple certification is all I came for. Not a medical inquisition.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ellan. Tenderness and warmth to the inside of the left knee, similar to the right. Now, let’s quickly assess your hips. Can you gently rotate your hips for me?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, Doctor. This is… quite difficult. And rather painful, if I may say so. My hips aren't as flexible as they used to be, you understand. And this poking and prodding… it’s really not helping. It's just making everything hurt even more. I told you, I have arthritis! A simple certification is all I came for. This whole examination is… utterly ridiculous. Honestly, I’m beginning to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ellan. I apologize for any pain this examination has caused you. It sounds like you are experiencing significant discomfort in both your knees and hips, and I appreciate your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and my brief examination, it appears you have chronic arthritis affecting both your knees and hips. The tenderness, warmth, and stiffness are consistent with this diagnosis. Now, regarding the medical marijuana certification, I want to be upfront with you. While medical marijuana can be helpful for managing arthritis symptoms, it’s not a cure-all and it has potential risks and side effects. I want to make sure you understand these before we proceed.
PATIENT: Risks and side effects? Honestly, Doctor, what risks? What side effects? I simply came at the behest of my daughter, you understand. I don’t want to become…addicted, or… confused, or… whatever it is people worry about. I have a perfectly good life, Doctor. I don’t need any… complications. I simply want something to ease the pain, if anything. And frankly, I’m beginning to doubt this marijuana is the answer. I’ve managed perfectly well on my own for years, and I don’t want to risk jeopardizing that. This whole process is becoming rather… unpleasant. Perhaps I should just go home.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Ellan. It’s perfectly reasonable to be hesitant, and it's important to weigh the potential benefits against the risks. Some potential side effects of medical marijuana include dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, and changes in appetite. There is also a risk of cognitive impairment, especially with long-term use. And while addiction is rare, it is a possibility. Furthermore, medical marijuana can interact with other medications you're taking, and it may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with certain medical conditions. Given your concerns, and the fact that you've been managing your arthritis symptoms on your own for years, I don't feel comfortable recommending a medical marijuana certification at this time. I think it’s best to explore other options for managing your pain.
PATIENT: Well, that’s… a relief, Doctor. Honestly, I suspected as much. I don’t need any…complications. I’m perfectly capable of managing on my own, thank you very much. Perhaps a stronger ibuprofen would be sufficient? Or a referral to a good physical therapist? I don’t need any…alternative medicine. I simply came at the behest of my daughter, you understand. She means well, but… honestly, I’m perfectly capable of making my own decisions. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I think I’ll just go home now. And perhaps have a nice cup of chamomile tea. That usually does the trick.
