DOCTOR: Alright, Lindra, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good to meet you too, Doctor... Doctor Gorga, yes? My family... they want me to maybe go live in one of those places for old people. A senior... living place. They say I need to... how you say... get okayed by a doctor first? To make sure I am... good for it.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Gorga. That's right. A lot of those places require a medical evaluation, just to make sure you're healthy enough and they can provide the right level of care. It’s a good thing your family is thinking ahead. So, let's talk a bit about what’s been going on with you, generally. Anything bothering you specifically, or are we just doing a check-up for the senior living place?
PATIENT: Just... the check-up, I think. Nothing really bothering me. Old, you know? Things ache sometimes, but what old person doesn’t ache? I still cook for my husband, I still go to church… I walk to the store if the weather is nice. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn’t?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s good to hear. “Aches and fatigue, normal for age.” Alright. Let’s just go through some basics, just to get a full picture. Do you have any problems with your heart, like shortness of breath or chest pain?
PATIENT: No, no heart problems. Sometimes my heart goes… fast if I climb the stairs too quick, but it goes back down. No pain, though. Never pain. And I don’t get… how you say… winded too bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good. Palpitations with exertion only, no chest pain or shortness of breath. Okay. And what about diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? I don’t think so. The doctor… back home, he always checked, but he never said anything about sugar. I like sweet things, yes, but… not too much. Just a little piece of cake sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me just pull up your records… …Ah, yes. No history of diabetes listed here either. Good. Any problems with your kidneys or bladder?
PATIENT: Kidneys? Oh… Sometimes I have to go to the bathroom… more than before. Especially at night. But I just thought that was… old age again. My husband says I drink too much water!
DOCTOR: Alright, nocturia, possibly related to fluid intake. Okay. And what about any problems with your stomach or intestines?
PATIENT: Sometimes... a little trouble, yes. Not big trouble. Maybe... constipated sometimes. I eat a lot of fruit, but... it doesn't always help. And sometimes... my stomach feels upset. Not sick, just... uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Constipation and occasional upset stomach. Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: My vision... it's not so good anymore, Doctor. Everything is a little blurry. I have glasses, but sometimes they don't help enough. And my hearing... my husband has to talk louder sometimes. I don't think I hear quiet sounds so well.
DOCTOR: Alright, blurry vision and some hearing loss, both typical with age. Okay. Now, let's talk about any medications you're currently taking, if you don't mind. And also, any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a little pill for my blood pressure. The doctor gave it to me a long time ago. It’s… pink, I think. And sometimes, if my arthritis hurts bad, I take something for that. It’s… white. I don’t have… allergies, no. Never had any trouble with allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me just confirm these medications. Pink pill for blood pressure, white pill for arthritis… … Alright, looks like you’re on Lisinopril 10mg daily for blood pressure, and Naproxen as needed for arthritis. Correct?
PATIENT: Yes, yes! That sounds right. Lisinopril and... Naproxen. You know my pills! That's good, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good. Just checking. Alright, Lindra, let’s do a quick physical exam now, just to get a better picture of everything. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is fine. Whatever you need to do. I want to get this done so I can maybe... you know... go to the nice place.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat there. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look in your ears and throat. Then we'll do a brief neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and balance. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I am ready. But… don’t take too long, please? My husband… he worries when I am gone too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as quick as possible. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Another deep breath… Heart sounds are regular, rate is around 78. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Blood pressure is 135/80, pulse is 78 and regular. Ears appear normal, mild cerumen present. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. Reflexes… What does that mean?
DOCTOR: Just a simple test to see how quickly your nerves are responding. I'm going to tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. It doesn't hurt, just a quick tap. Okay… reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let's just do a quick balance test. Could you stand up for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Yes, I can stand. But… my knees… they aren't so good. I might need to hold onto something.
DOCTOR: Of course. Hold onto the table, please. I just want to see if you can stand without losing your balance. Now, close your eyes for a moment, if you’re comfortable. Alright, you can open your eyes now. Good. Mild unsteadiness with eyes closed, but overall stable. Okay, Lindra, that concludes the physical exam. Everything appears generally stable, with some expected age-related changes.
PATIENT: So…? Is that good enough for the nice place? Will they let me go? My husband… he wants me to go. He says it will be easier for him.
DOCTOR: Well, based on my examination today, you appear generally healthy enough to consider a move to assisted living. However, there are a few things we should address. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and the mild unsteadiness I observed suggests a possible risk of falls. I also noted some hearing loss and blurry vision, which could impact your safety and independence. I recommend a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician to discuss managing your blood pressure and potential vision and hearing aids. I also suggest a fall risk assessment, just to make sure you’re safe. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to admit you rests with the assisted living facility, and they may require additional testing. I'm happy to provide them with my findings, and I can write a referral for a fall risk assessment if you’d like.
PATIENT: Oh dear. So… not good enough yet? Blood pressure… falls… I don't understand. My husband… he is good with things like that. Maybe he should talk to the doctor with me. And… what is a fall risk assessment? Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Lindra. A fall risk assessment is simply a test to identify factors that might increase your chance of falling. Things like your balance, strength, and how well you see. Knowing those things helps us prevent falls, and keep you safe. And you are absolutely right, it's best if your husband is involved in these discussions. I can schedule a joint appointment with both of you, if you'd like. We can talk about your blood pressure, and I can explain the fall risk assessment in more detail. Regarding the assisted living facility, I can fax my findings to them, and I recommend you both contact them to discuss their specific requirements. They may want to review your medical history, and potentially request additional testing. Do you want me to schedule that joint appointment, and fax my findings to the facility?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be good. My husband… he likes to know everything. And… fax the findings. I don’t know how to do that. He can talk to them. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lindra. I’m happy to help. Let me just get your husband’s contact information, and we’ll schedule that appointment for you both. And I'll get the fax authorization form ready for you to sign, so I can send your findings to the assisted living facility. It looks like your husband's name is… ?
PATIENT: His name is Rafael. Rafael ABDOLLAHI. And... he is very good with papers. He can fill everything out. He always does.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Rafael Abdoallahi. Alright. We have an appointment scheduled for both of you next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. That will give you both plenty of time to discuss everything, and prepare any questions you might have. Here's the fax authorization form. Rafael can fill that out at his convenience. I'll also print out a summary of my findings for you both to take with you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. Thank you so much, Doctor Gorga. You have been very helpful. And please, tell Rafael I said hello. He worries about me when I am gone for too long.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lindra. I’ll be sure to tell Rafael hello. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, and please give my regards to Rafael.
