DOCTOR: Hi Ricky, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, my foot’s been botherin’ me. It’s pretty swollen, especially around the ankle. Been that way for, oh, let me think… about three days now, maybe four. It just kinda puffed up on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four days of ankle swelling. That's good to know. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It doesn't really hurt hurt, you know? More like… achy. And it feels warm to the touch. Not fever warm, just… warmer than my other foot. I haven’t done nothin’ to it, though. Didn’t twist it or nothin’. Just woke up one morning and it was like a balloon.
DOCTOR: Alright, achy and warm, but no injury. That’s helpful. And it came on gradually, while you were resting?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. I was sleepin’ when it started. I didn’t notice it at first, of course. But when I got outta bed, I could tell somethin’ wasn’t right. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little puffy. But it’s gotten worse each day. I tried elevatin’ it, but didn't seem to do much good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it developed while you were sleeping, and elevation hasn't helped much. Have you noticed any changes in the color of your foot or ankle?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It doesn’t look different, not really. Maybe a little redder than usual, but I got kinda dark skin, so it's hard to tell. It's not bruised or nothin’, just… not its normal color, I guess. I really gotta squint to see anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible slight change in color, but no bruising. Have you had any pain in your calf at all, maybe a cramping sensation?
PATIENT: No, no pain in my calf. Not a bit. And no cramping, either. Just the achin’ in the foot itself. It’s mostly around the ankle bone, you know? And it feels kinda… tight. Like somethin's pressin' on it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no calf pain or cramping, just ankle aching and tightness. Let's take a look. Could you please take a seat on the examination table and I’ll take a look at it?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. There you go. Be careful, it's a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ricky, I can definitely see some swelling around your ankle, and it is warmer than your other foot. There's tenderness when I press right here, along the outer part of your ankle. No obvious deformity. Capillary refill looks good—less than three seconds. I don’t feel any major lumps or bumps. Skin turgor is normal. Do you have any history of blood clots, or any recent long flights or periods of immobility?
PATIENT: Blood clots? No, never had one of those, thank goodness. And no, I haven't been on any long flights. I mostly just get around town on the bus, and I’m always movin’ around, gettin' on and off. I’m a loan interviewer, you know? Gotta visit folks. So, I’m not sittin' still for long, that’s for sure. I don’t think I’ve been real still for more than an hour in… well, a long time. It does feel a bit stiff though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of clots, recent travel, or prolonged immobility. And you’re quite active with your work, which is good. Stiffness is also noted. Let’s check your pulses. Could you point your toes up towards the ceiling, please?
PATIENT: Sure thing. Like this? It's a little hard, though. It feels tighter than usual. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine. It’s good you let me know it’s difficult. I’m checking your pulses now… Okay, your dorsalis pedis pulse is present, though a little weak. Your posterior tibial pulse is also there, but also a bit diminished. Given the swelling, warmth, tenderness, and slightly diminished pulses, it’s possible this could be a mild blood clot, though the absence of a clear injury makes that less likely. We need to rule out deeper issues. I'd like to order a D-dimer blood test to see if there's evidence of clotting. And just to be safe, we should get an ultrasound to visualize the blood flow in your leg. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A blood test and an ultrasound? Well, that sounds… serious. Is it somethin' real bad? I just figured it was a sprain or somethin’. I didn't think it was gonna be this complicated. Is it gonna cost a lot of money? 'Cause, well, I don't exactly got a lot to spare. And I don’t have insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ricky. It's good we're addressing this now. While it could be a simple sprain, the diminished pulses and other findings warrant a closer look. It's better to be safe and rule out something more serious, like a deep vein thrombosis . A DVT can be dangerous if left untreated, but it’s often very treatable if caught early. As for the cost, I know being uninsured can be a worry. The D-dimer test is relatively inexpensive—around $50-$100. The ultrasound will be more expensive, probably between $300-$600. We can discuss options for financial assistance at the clinic. We also have a social worker who can help you navigate these costs. Would you like me to connect you with them?
PATIENT: Okay… $300 to $600? That's… a lot. I don't know, Doctor. I really didn't expect this. Maybe… maybe it is just a sprain. Could it still be that? I mean, I've twisted my ankle before, and it just went away after a few days. I don't wanna spend a bunch of money if it's not necessary. I gotta pay rent, you know? What happens if I just… wait a few days and see if it gets better?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ricky, and I want to be as respectful of your financial situation as possible. It's possible it's a sprain, but the diminished pulses are the concerning part. Those don’t typically occur with simple sprains. Waiting a few days could be an option, but if it is a DVT, delaying treatment can lead to serious complications, like a pulmonary embolism—a blood clot in the lungs—which can be life-threatening. Here's what I suggest. We can start with the D-dimer test. It’s the less expensive option, and it can help us quickly determine if there’s evidence of clotting. If the D-dimer is negative, then a sprain is more likely, and we can manage it with rest, ice, compression, and elevation. If it's positive, then we definitely need the ultrasound to confirm a DVT and start treatment. Would you be comfortable with just starting with the D-dimer test?
PATIENT: Okay… just the blood test, for now. That sounds… okay. I guess. Better to know for sure, right? What do I gotta do? Do I gotta fast? And… where do I go to get it done? I don’t have a car, so it gotta be somewhere I can get to on the bus.
DOCTOR: That’s a good plan, Ricky. Yes, it's best to get some answers. You do need to fast for eight hours before the blood draw, meaning no food or sugary drinks. Water is okay. There's a lab right across the street, on Elm Street—it’s a short bus ride from here. I’ll write you a lab order, and I’ll include the address and phone number. They accept walk-ins, so you shouldn’t have to make an appointment. Once you have the results, you can either call my office to schedule a follow-up, or you can bring the results with you when you come back. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds alright. Across the street, no appointment… I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly. Hopefully, it’s just a sprain. I really don't need another thing to worry about. I'll go do that test as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ricky. I'm glad I could help. I understand your worries, and I hope for the best as well. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. Alright, well, you take care of yourself and get that test done. I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Okay, you too, Doctor. Thanks again. Bye bye.
