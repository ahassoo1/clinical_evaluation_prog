DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Schneer. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, now… it’s my ears, I think. They just… don't work so good anymore. Things are kinda muffled, you see? Not a sharp pain or anything, just… quiet. I used to hear the birds real clear, and now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Muffled hearing, not a lot of pain, just a decrease in how well you can hear. And it’s happened gradually, you said?
PATIENT: Gradually… yes, I think so. It didn't just poof disappear one day. It’s been… a while now. Hard to say how long exactly. Time gets away from ya, doesn't it? I used to work in a shoe factory, a long time ago. Lots of noise there, clatterin' and bangin'. Maybe that had somethin' to do with it? I don’t rightly recall.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Mr. Schneer. Working in a noisy environment like a shoe factory can definitely affect your hearing over time. We'll want to explore that as a possibility. Have you noticed it in one ear more than the other, or is it pretty equal?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… I don’t know that I’ve paid much attention to which ear it is. They both seem… kinda the same, I suppose. Hard to tell, really. It's just… not as clear as it used to be. I mostly notice it when folks aren’t lookin’ at me when they talk. Then I gotta ask ‘em to repeat themselves.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, gradual onset, both ears seem affected, and you notice it more when you can't see the person speaking. Do you experience any ringing in your ears – like a buzzing or a hissing sound?
PATIENT: Ringing… now that’s a thought. Sometimes… yes. Not all the time, and not loud. Sort of a… faint hum, maybe? Like an old refrigerator. But it comes and goes, and I mostly forget about it 'til you asked. It doesn’t bother me much, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, a faint humming sound that comes and goes. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me see. I get my Medicare, so I must have somethin’, right? Doc’s always askin’ about things. I think… the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once. But I don't take nothin' for it. Just try to take it easy, you know? And I think I had a touch of the flu a couple years back, but that’s about it. Never been a sickly man, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, but not currently treated, and a mild flu a couple of years ago. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm… I think I had my tonsils out when I was a little boy. That’s about it, I reckon. Never been in the hospital, not really. Just the doctor's office for check-ups and whatnot. Nothing serious, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child, no significant hospitalizations. Now, I'm going to ask about your family. Is there anyone in your family with hearing loss or any other medical conditions that run in the family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my brother, Arthur, he got real hard of hearin’ when he got old. Real bad. Had to shout to talk to him. But… other than that… I don't rightly recall. Momma died young, and I didn’t know my daddy. Didn’t pay much attention to what folks got, to be honest. Just lived day to day.
DOCTOR: Okay, a brother with significant hearing loss. That's good to know. Now, just a couple more quick questions. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter pills, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Not a one. Never been one for takin' pills, if I can help it. A little aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's about it. Don’t believe in loadin' up on chemicals, you know? Just try to eat right and get enough sleep. That’s what my momma always said.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Okay, Mr. Schneer, I’m going to do a quick examination of your ears, nose, and throat. I’ll use an instrument called an otoscope to look inside your ears. It doesn’t hurt, but let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. Never mind gettin' all poked and prodded, just tell me what ya find. I trust your judgement. Long as it don’t hurt none.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schneer. I'm looking in your ears now... I see some wax buildup in both ears, which is common. Your ear canals look clear otherwise, no signs of infection. The eardrums themselves look a little dull, which can be a sign of fluid or stiffness. I’m going to do a quick hearing test now – just a simple one to get a better idea of how well you’re hearing different sounds. It involves putting headphones on and responding when you hear a beep. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Beeps, huh? Alright, beeps it is. Sounds easy enough. Wax build-up, you say? Maybe that's part of the problem. Always gettin' stuff stuck in my ears. Go ahead, Doctor. Headphones sound just fine. I’ll listen for those beeps.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schneer, we're all finished with that test now. The results show you have mild to moderate hearing loss in both ears, especially at the higher frequencies. This means you're likely having trouble hearing softer sounds and higher-pitched voices. Given your history of working in a noisy environment, the wax build-up, and your brother’s hearing loss, it’s likely a combination of noise-induced hearing loss and age-related changes, with the wax contributing to the problem. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: Mild to moderate… high frequencies… Sounds kinda complicated, Doctor. So… it’s my age and that ol’ factory makin’ all the racket? And the wax… that's gotta be part of it too, I suppose. What does this… mean, exactly? Can ya fix it?
DOCTOR: It means your hearing has gradually decreased over time, likely from the noise at the factory combined with the natural aging process. The high frequencies are the first to go, which explains why it's harder to hear softer sounds and higher-pitched voices. We can address it, yes. The first thing I recommend is wax removal. That alone might improve your hearing significantly. We can do that in the office. After that, if you’re still having trouble, we can discuss hearing aids. They're very small devices that amplify sounds and can make a big difference in your quality of life. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Wax removal first… sounds sensible. Get the gunk out, see if that helps. I don't know about them hearin' aids… always thought them was for really old folks. Don't want nothin’ stickin' in my ear. But I’m willin' to try the wax removal. When can we get that done?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schneer. I understand your hesitation about hearing aids. We can certainly start with wax removal and see how you feel afterward. We can schedule that for later this week, perhaps Thursday afternoon?
PATIENT: Thursday afternoon sounds fine. Get that wax outta there, and then we'll see. Alright, Doctor. I reckon that’s good for now. Thank ya for explainin’ everything so clearly. Sometimes I just feel… outta the loop with all these fancy words and machines.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I'm glad I could help. I’ll have the nurse schedule the wax removal for Thursday afternoon. In the meantime, if your hearing gets significantly worse or you experience any pain, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here's a printed summary of our visit and the plan. And here’s a referral to audiology, should you decide to explore hearing aids. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: That’s mighty kind of ya, Doctor. Summany and… audiology. Alright. No, I reckon that covers it. Just gettin’ rid of that wax sounds good for now. Thank ya again. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and we’ll see you on Thursday. .
