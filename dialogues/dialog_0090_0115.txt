DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s…it’s about my skin, you see. It’s turned a rather unpleasant yellow. A friend – or was it a neighbor? – noticed it and insisted I come in. Something about my liver, I believe. Honestly, I don’t recall all the details. It's been…a while since I've been feeling quite myself.
DOCTOR: Yellow skin… yes, that could be a number of things. A friend noticed, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A very kind woman… Mrs. Henderson, I think. She’s always been observant. She mentioned something about… hepatitis? And the liver, of course. I’ve had some… tummy troubles lately, but I just assumed it was something I ate. It’s all a bit hazy, to be frank. I'd really like to get this sorted quickly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: “Tummy troubles.” Right. And how long have these “tummy troubles” been going on, Annelle?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. It feels like… several weeks, perhaps a month? It comes and goes, you see. Not constant, but enough to be… bothersome. I haven’t paid it much attention, to be honest. I’ve always been rather… resilient. I just hoped it would pass. Is this important? I have an appointment later this afternoon…
DOCTOR: Important?
PATIENT: Well, I didn't mean to imply it wasn't! It’s just… time is a little precious these days. And this yellowing of my skin is new, isn’t it? I suppose that’s what’s concerning. Is it serious, Doctor? I haven’t been feeling well overall, but I assumed it was just…old age catching up with me. I truly don't recall much about the specifics of my medical history, if that’s helpful. It’s all so long ago.
DOCTOR: “Old age” doesn’t typically present with jaundice, Annelle. We need to rule out some serious possibilities. Let’s start with a few questions. Do you have any pain in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain… hmm. Not a sharp pain, no. More of a…discomfort, perhaps? A dull ache, sometimes, particularly after I eat. It’s not constant, and I haven’t taken anything for it. Honestly, I just try to ignore it. I really don’t like to bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary. Is it related to the yellow skin, do you think? I’m afraid I'm not very good at describing these things. It all feels so…vague.
DOCTOR: “Vague” symptoms can be the most concerning, Annelle. Have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Changes in… well, I suppose… my urine seems a little darker than usual. Almost… tea-colored, perhaps? And my stool… yes, it’s been rather pale. Lighter than it should be. I hadn’t really paid much attention until you asked. I apologize for being so…unobservant. It’s just that I’ve been feeling so…tired lately. Everything seems to blend together. Is this…bad? I’m getting a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: Tea-colored urine and pale stools… That is concerning, Annelle. We need to run some tests. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function test. And we’ll need a stool sample as well.
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. Well, if you think it’s necessary. I suppose it’s best to know, even if it’s not good news. Where do I go to have these tests done? And how long will it take? I have that appointment this afternoon, you see. I really don't want to cancel it, if possible. Perhaps I should have brought someone with me. I'm not always the best at remembering instructions.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, Annelle. They will draw your blood and give you a container for the stool sample. It shouldn't take more than an hour or two. As for your appointment… frankly, I don’t know what you’ll be doing this afternoon, but you need to prioritize your health. We’ll review the results as soon as they come back. Now, let's move on. Any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t believe so. I've always been rather fortunate in that regard. No reactions to any medications, as far as I recall. I haven't taken many, to be honest. Just the occasional pain reliever for headaches. And I don’t recall ever having any food allergies. Although… now that you mention it, I did feel a little unwell after eating some shellfish a few years ago. But it could have been something else entirely. It was such a long time ago. I really wish I had someone here to help me remember things. Are you sure these tests are absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: Shellfish… Yes, that is something to note. And yes, Annelle, they are necessary. We need to rule out a variety of possibilities. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, just a little something for my… joints. They ache, you see. It's an herbal supplement, I believe. My neighbor recommended it. Mrs. Henderson, I think her name was. It doesn’t seem to do much, to be honest. I just thought I’d try it. I can't recall the name of it, though. It came in a little brown bottle. I really don’t take many things. I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible. Is that alright? And could you please speak a little slower? I’m having trouble following everything. I apologize. I’m just…a bit flustered.
DOCTOR: An herbal supplement... of course. Do you know the ingredients?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no. I just bought it at a little shop down the street. It was…yellowish-brown in color, I believe. And it smelled a little…earthy. I didn’t really look at the ingredients. I just asked Mrs. Henderson if it was good for aching joints, and she said it helped her. I’m so sorry. I realize this isn’t very helpful. I really should have paid more attention. Is it important? I'm just... a bit overwhelmed with everything, you see. And I'm terribly forgetful these days. Perhaps I should have brought someone with me.
DOCTOR: It is extremely important, Annelle. Herbal supplements can interact with medications and affect liver function. We need to know what you’re taking. I am going to need you to try and remember the name of this shop, or even the brand of the supplement. Now, let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, let me think. Hospitalized… hmm. I was a very healthy woman, you see. I rarely got sick. I believe I was hospitalized once, a very long time ago, when I was a young girl. It was for…tonsillitis, I think? A very bad sore throat. But that was many, many years ago. I don't recall much about it. It was a different time, you see. Different doctors, different methods. And I’ve been very careful to take care of myself ever since. I truly don’t recall any other hospitalizations. I have a terrible memory, you see. Is this…sufficient? I'm afraid I'm not much help. I just want to get to the bottom of this yellow skin. I really do.
DOCTOR: Tonsillitis… Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Oh, yes! I had my appendix removed, a very long time ago. It was quite a serious operation, I believe. But I recovered very quickly. It was…before my husband passed, I think. Or perhaps after? I’m not quite sure. It was a different time, you see. Different doctors, different methods. I don’t recall much about it, to be honest. It was quite painful, I believe. But I don't remember the specifics. I just want to get this sorted quickly, if you don't mind. Is this enough information? I'm truly sorry for being so vague. My memory is just…not what it used to be. I really should have brought someone with me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. My family…well, we weren’t very close. I haven't seen them in many years. I came to this country a long time ago, you see. And we didn't keep in touch. I know my mother had…heart problems, I think? And my father…well, he worked very hard. I don’t recall any specific illnesses, to be honest. We didn’t really discuss these things. It was a different culture, you see. Different customs. I’m truly sorry. I’m not much help. I wish I could provide more information. Is this…sufficient? I just want to get to the bottom of this yellow skin. I really do. It's just...all a bit of a blur. Perhaps I should just go home and rest. I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: We've established you're not much help, Annelle. Very well. Let's move on to social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, no, never. I've always considered it a very unhealthy habit. My husband didn’t smoke either. We were very careful to take care of our health. I believe it's a terrible thing, a very dangerous habit. No, I've never smoked, not even once. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though. Just one glass. Is that alright? I don't want to be a bother. I just want to get to the bottom of this yellow skin. It's just... all a bit of a blur. Perhaps I should just go home and rest. I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you drink alcohol frequently, Annelle?
PATIENT: Frequently…? Oh, no, not at all. Just occasionally, with dinner, as I said. A glass of wine, perhaps once or twice a week. I don’t drink every day, certainly not. I wouldn’t consider myself a drinker. It’s just… a little something to relax with. Is that alright? I really don’t drink very much. I'm just...a bit flustered. And I'm terribly forgetful these days. Perhaps I should just go home and rest. I don't want to be a bother. I just want to get to the bottom of this yellow skin. It's just... all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright, Annelle. Let’s finish this. Any allergies to medications, again?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. We've been over this. No, I don't believe so. I’ve never had any reactions to any medications, as far as I recall. I haven't taken many, to be honest. Just the occasional pain reliever for headaches. And I don’t recall ever having any food allergies. Although… now that you mention it, I did feel a little unwell after eating some shellfish a few years ago. But it could have been something else entirely. It was such a long time ago. Truly, I don't recall anything significant. I really wish I had someone here to help me remember things. Are you sure these tests are absolutely necessary? I just want to go home and rest. I’m starting to feel quite tired.
DOCTOR: Yes, Annelle, they are absolutely necessary. I'm ordering the tests now. I need you to go to the lab down the hall. They'll draw blood and give you a container for a stool sample. Then, we'll review the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Understand… yes, I think so. Blood tests… and a… stool sample. Down the hall. Oh dear. Well, if you think it’s necessary. I suppose it’s best to know, even if it’s not good news. Is it far? I don't think I can walk very far. And what if I can't…produce a sample? Oh dear. This is all very overwhelming. I really wish I hadn’t come. I just want to go home and rest. Are you sure there’s nothing else we can do? Perhaps a different test? I really don’t like hospitals. Or…labs. This is all very stressful. I’m starting to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: Look, Annelle, it's a short walk. And you will produce a sample. It's a simple test. I’m going to write down the instructions again. Just go to the lab. They'll take care of you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. A short walk…and…a sample. I… I suppose I should just go, then. Thank you, Doctor. I really didn't mean to be a bother. I just want to go home and rest. I truly do. I… I hope everything will be alright. I just want to go home.
