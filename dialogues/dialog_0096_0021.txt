DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Parasca… Parascondola?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Ricky Parascondola. It’s a bit of a mouthful, I know. But please, just Ricky is fine.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Ricky. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, my foot is really bothering me. It’s been swelling up, mostly my ankle, for the last few days. It’s not really painful pain, you know? More like… heavy and puffy. I noticed it after I was doing some gardening. Nothing too strenuous, just weeding mostly. But it hasn't gone down since.
DOCTOR: Gardening, you say. Hmm. And this swelling... is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's pretty constant, yeah. It gets a little worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been on it more. Like if I stand for a long time, it puffs up even more. But even when I'm resting, it's still noticeably bigger than my other foot. I haven’t really done anything to it, if that makes sense. No twisting, no bumps, nothing.
DOCTOR: No injury… right. And you said it’s been a few days?
PATIENT: Yeah, started, I think, last Saturday? So, about four days now. I was hoping it would just go away on its own, you know? But it hasn't. And it's kinda worrying me now, 'cause I do a lot of walking, just getting around. It's making it uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the color of your skin around the ankle?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… I don’t think so. It looks pretty much the same, regular skin color, I guess. Maybe a little reddish when I press on it hard, but not always. I haven’t really been staring at it that closely, to be honest. Is that a sign of something? Should I be looking for something specific?
DOCTOR: It can be a sign of something, yes. Alright. And what about any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. And definitely no numbness. I can feel everything just fine. It just feels… swollen, and kinda achy sometimes, if I push on it. It’s a weird feeling, honestly. Not sharp pain, more like a dull… pressure. Does that make sense? It's hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Dull pressure. Alright. Have you had any problems with your circulation in the past?
PATIENT: Circulation? Not that I know of. No, never been told anything about that. I get cold feet sometimes, like anyone does in the winter, but nothing more than that. I haven’t had any trouble with blood clots or anything like that. My doctor back home, he never mentioned anything about circulation problems. But… he retired a few years ago, so… I haven't seen a doctor regularly since then, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s have a look at it then. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Just let me know if you need me to move it a certain way or anything. It feels a little tender, so… be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to feel around… and check for tenderness. Tell me if anything feels particularly painful. Hmm. Yes, there is some swelling. And warmth… Can you move your foot up and down for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can move it, but… it's a little stiff. And that feels… a bit sore right there. When you press on it like that. It's not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: It’s not ideal, no. Alright. Pulse is present, but a bit weak. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats lately?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, or anything like that. I’ve been feeling pretty normal, aside from this foot. A little tired, maybe, but I'm an old man, you know? Getting old is tiring! I haven’t noticed any sweating at night either. I sleep pretty soundly, actually. It’s usually just the foot that bothers me when I try to get comfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it doesn’t seem to be anything immediately alarming, but it is concerning enough that we need to rule a few things out. It could be a sprain, even if you don’t remember injuring it. It could also be some early signs of arthritis or… less likely, a blood clot. We'll need to do some blood work. And I'm going to order an X-ray, just to be on the safe side. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything before. I take a little bit of ibuprofen sometimes, for aches and pains, but that's it. Nothing regularly. And I haven't had an X-ray in… goodness, probably twenty years? It'll be a while. Are these tests expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see. It's kinda hard to afford things these days.
DOCTOR: Well, that is… unfortunate. Yes, the tests do have a cost associated with them. I will have the front desk give you an estimate of the charges. They may have some payment plan options available. We'll do what we can. Let’s get the blood work done first. And then we will go over for the X-ray. Do you have any difficulty walking?
PATIENT: I can walk, yeah. It's not easy, exactly. It's kinda sore, especially if I walk a lot. But I haven't needed a cane or anything like that. I’ve been taking it easy, mostly staying at home. I don't want to make it worse, you know? So I mostly just hobble around the house. It feels better when I elevate it. Is there anything I can do right now to make it feel better? Like, while I'm waiting for the tests?
DOCTOR: Elevate it. Ice it, for fifteen minutes at a time, several times a day. And avoid putting any unnecessary weight on it. And limit walking as much as possible. That's about all you can do until we have the results of the tests. The lab technician will come in shortly to draw some blood. After that, I’ll have someone direct you to the radiology department. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, I understand. Elevate, ice, and don't walk on it. Got it. Fifteen minutes at a time, you said? Alright. And… where is the radiology department? Is it far? I don't think I can walk very far, you see. Maybe someone can help me get over there?
DOCTOR: It's in the building next door. I’ll have a nurse wheel you over there in a wheelchair. It's not a long distance, but I wouldn't risk you walking. Now, just sit here and relax. I’ll send the lab technician in shortly. Try not to worry. We’ll get this figured out. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you. I appreciate you looking at it. And… getting me a wheelchair, that would be a big help. I’m a bit worried about the tests, if I’m honest, but… I’m sure you’ll take good care of me. .
