DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician here at Early KAMMER. It’s August 2nd, 2025. I see you’re 56 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Yes, 56. It is… a request. From Medicare, you understand. They want a… a card. A “get well” card. Seems silly, but what can you do? They send the forms.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. Medicare does have certain wellness initiatives and reporting requirements. While a “get well” card is… unusual, it’s possible this is related to a preventative care assessment. However, to ensure we're addressing any potential underlying health concerns, and to properly document this visit for Medicare, let's discuss your overall health. Perhaps this card request is a flag for something we should review. To begin, can you tell me about any current symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Doctor, I feel… fine. Perfectly fine. I came about a card. Not about being sick. What kind of question is that? I work, I eat, I sleep. A little tired sometimes, maybe. Who isn't? But I don't need a check-up because of a piece of paper. Honestly.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Kammer. You are right to question me – it's important you feel heard. My intention isn’t to imply you are unwell, but rather to ensure we fulfill any necessary requirements related to this Medicare request and, more importantly, to use this as an opportunity to assess your general wellbeing. “A little tired sometimes” is a symptom, and it’s worth exploring. Fatigue can be caused by a multitude of factors, some of which are easily addressed, and some of which are more serious. To help me understand, could you describe this tiredness?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, it’s just… normal tiredness. After work. I’m a stationary engineer. Boilers don't run themselves, you know? It’s a physical job. Long hours. It’s not like I’m collapsing. Just… at the end of the day, I want to sit. And sleep. Is that so strange? It’s not a problem. You are making a mountain out of a molehill. I don't understand why you need to know all of this to sign a card.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question me, Mr. Kammer. I apologize if I’m making this more complex than it needs to be. My goal is to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes gathering a complete picture of your health. Understanding your work as a stationary engineer is helpful; it provides context for your level of physical activity and potential stressors. To clarify, when you say “tired,” is it primarily physical fatigue – muscle soreness and exhaustion – or more of a mental exhaustion, or both?
PATIENT: Both! Is that a good answer? Honestly, it’s… both. My body is tired and my mind. Dealing with those machines all day… it’s not exactly stimulating conversation, you know? It requires focus. Constant attention. It’s… draining. But I'm not sick. I just want the card signed so Medicare leaves me alone.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Kammer. That is very helpful. “Draining” is a good description. It sounds like your work is physically demanding and requires significant mental concentration. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? What do you want to know? I sleep. When I’m tired, I sleep. Usually around… ten o'clock. Sometimes later, if I have to finish something. I get… six, seven hours. Sometimes eight. It's enough. What is this, a sleep study? I don't need a sleep study. I just want the card. Are you even listening to me?
DOCTOR: You are right to be frustrated, Mr. Kammer, and I apologize if I’m not adequately addressing your primary concern – the Medicare card. I am listening, and I understand your desire for a quick resolution. I am asking about your sleep to get a broader picture of your health. Variable sleep patterns can sometimes contribute to fatigue and other issues. To help me determine if any further investigation is necessary, could you describe your typical bedtime routine?
PATIENT: Bedtime routine? Doctor, I take my shoes off. I brush my teeth. And I sleep. That is it. Sometimes I watch a little TV, but not every night. There is no “routine”. It’s not like I have a special pillow or drink chamomile tea. I am a simple man with a simple life. Honestly, this is ridiculous. You are asking me about my bedtime? I came for a card, not a therapy session.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kammer. I apologize again for the extensive questions. I assure you, I'm not trying to prolong this unnecessarily. Let's shift gears slightly. To ensure a complete medical assessment, could you briefly tell me about any past medical conditions you have, or have been treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Past medical… Look, I had my tonsils out when I was a kid. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. A long time ago. That’s it. Nothing serious. No heart problems, no diabetes, no… anything. I’m a healthy man. For my age, anyway. I go to work, I do my job. You are asking too many questions. Can we please get to the card?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kammer. That's helpful to know. And I apologize for the thorough questioning. I want to be certain we've covered everything. One final quick question, if you don’t mind. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I don’t take anything. I eat good food, I get enough sleep... well, enough for me. I don't need pills. I am a perfectly healthy man. Look, Doctor, are you going to sign the card or are we going to continue this interrogation? This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. I understand your frustration and I apologize for the length of this conversation. Based on what you’ve told me – your reported good health, no current medical conditions, no medications, and a history limited to tonsillectomy and a childhood arm fracture – and after a brief assessment of your overall demeanor, I do not find any immediate medical concerns that require further investigation. I am happy to sign the Medicare card for you. However, I would like to gently recommend a routine physical exam annually, or as your health changes, to ensure continued wellness. Fatigue can have many causes, and early detection is always best. Here you go. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, thank you. Just… thank you. I’m finished. And please, Doctor, no more questions.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kammer. I understand. Thank you for coming in today. Please, take care. If you do experience any changes in your health, or have any concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment. Have a good day.
