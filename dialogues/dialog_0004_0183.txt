DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Grumman is fine. Doctor… Deschane, you say? Yes. Well, I am… tired. Very tired. Not like after work tired, but… always tired. And the other doctor, he said something about my… insides not working right. My liver, he called it. It feels… wrong.
DOCTOR: “Insides not working right,” and you suspect it’s your liver. Alright. And how long have you been feeling this… persistent fatigue, Mr. Grumman?
PATIENT: Persistent… you use big words, Doctor. A long time. Maybe six months? More? It comes and goes, but mostly it’s there. It’s… hard to say exactly. I work, I eat, I sleep… but I still feel… drained. Like a battery that won’t hold a charge. You understand?
DOCTOR: A battery that won’t hold a charge… I suppose I do. Six months of fatigue… Has anything specific changed in your life over the past six months?
PATIENT: Specific…? Hmm. Not really. Work is the same. Wife is… wife. We eat the same food. Maybe… maybe I drink a little more coffee now. To keep going, you see. But that’s all. Nothing… big. Why would it be anything big?
DOCTOR: Well, fatigue can have many causes, Mr. Grumman. It's not always something "big," but it's important to investigate. You mentioned increased coffee consumption. How much coffee would you say you're drinking daily?
PATIENT: Oh. Many causes. Of course. Doctor knows everything, yes? Coffee… let me see. Usually, three cups in the morning. Sometimes four. Maybe five if it’s a hard day. It helps me focus. My wife says I drink too much. She always says things.
DOCTOR: Five cups of coffee daily… that is rather a lot, Mr. Grumman. While caffeine can provide a temporary boost, it can also disrupt sleep and exacerbate fatigue in the long run. Let’s move on. Aside from the fatigue and increased coffee intake, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. What do you mean? Like what? I get… a little heartburn sometimes. After dinner. And… my stomach feels… full, even when I haven’t eaten much. But everyone gets heartburn, yes? It’s not… serious, is it?
DOCTOR: “Everyone gets heartburn” doesn’t mean it’s not worth investigating, Mr. Grumman. Heartburn and a feeling of fullness despite limited food intake could be related. Do you experience any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nausea…? No. Not really. Sometimes I feel… queasy. But that’s only when I… push myself too hard. Like when I am trying to finish a big project at work. Vomiting? No. Never vomiting. I am a strong man, Doctor. I don’t get sick easily.
DOCTOR: Strength isn't always a deterrent to illness, Mr. Grumman. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? What are you asking? Do you mean… when I go to the… bathroom? Doctor asks very strange questions. Everything is… normal. Sometimes a little hard. Old man problems, you see.
DOCTOR: "Old man problems" can still be indicative of underlying issues, Mr. Grumman. Has there been any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood…? No! No blood. Never blood. That would be… serious. I would know if there was blood. My wife would definitely know. She notices everything. No, no blood. You are asking too many questions now. Is this liver problem going to take all day?
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, I understand your frustration, but a thorough assessment is crucial. We need to rule out various possibilities. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any instances of liver disease, gallbladder problems, or digestive disorders in your family?
PATIENT: Family history…? Oh. My father… he had a stomach problem. Always complaining. But doctors never knew what it was. And my mother… she had trouble with her… digestion. Constipation, mostly. Nothing serious. We are not a sickly family. Mostly strong farmers, you see.
DOCTOR: “Mostly strong farmers…” Alright. Now, regarding your social history, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? A little. Sometimes with dinner. A glass of wine, maybe. Or a small beer. Nothing excessive. I am not a… drinker. Not like some people. My wife doesn’t like it when I drink. She says it makes me… talkative.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. I do not like the smell. Bad for the lungs, you see. My father… he smoked a little when he was young. But he stopped. He said it made him cough too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement, and assess your overall condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Palpate…? You are going to… poke me? Yes, yes, alright. Poke away, Doctor. But be gentle. I am a delicate flower, you see. Even if I am a strong farmer.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. We'll start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me... and exhale. Good. I’m listening to your heart sounds now… everything sounds regular, although a little faint. Now, your lungs… deep breath… and exhale. Your breathing sounds clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or tenderness. How about here?
PATIENT: Here…? Ouch. A little. Not bad, but… uncomfortable. It feels… tender. Like a bruise, maybe? Not a sharp pain, but… a dull ache. Is that bad, Doctor? You are pressing too hard, maybe?
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s useful information. It seems there is some tenderness in your upper right quadrant. The rest of your abdomen feels relatively soft, no significant masses detected. Your reflexes are normal. Based on your symptoms—persistent fatigue, heartburn, feeling of fullness, and the tenderness in your upper right quadrant—I suspect there may be an issue with your liver or gallbladder. However, this is just a preliminary assessment. We'll need to run some blood tests to confirm. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a liver function panel, and a bilirubin level. I also want to order an ultrasound of your abdomen to visualize your liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. This will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Ultrasound…? So you want to look inside me? With a machine? Doctor… that sounds… scary. But if you think it’s necessary… alright. Do what you need to do. But be quick about it. And tell me what the results mean. I don’t want to be waiting around for weeks. I have work to do, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Grumman. An ultrasound is a non-invasive procedure; it doesn’t involve any radiation. It simply uses sound waves to create an image of your organs. It shouldn’t take long. As for the results, I will personally review them as soon as they are available and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail. I’ll make sure to explain everything in plain language, not medical jargon. I'll also give you a referral to a gastroenterologist – a specialist in digestive health – for a second opinion. It's always good to have another set of eyes on things. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your coffee intake significantly. Try to limit yourself to one cup a day, or switch to decaffeinated. Also, avoid alcohol and fatty foods as much as possible. These can put extra stress on your liver and gallbladder. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No. I don’t take any medications. Not unless I have a bad cold. But no allergies. I eat everything. My wife makes me try everything. She says it’s good for me. So, no allergies. But… is there anything else I need to do? Will these tests take long? I have a big project at work.
DOCTOR: The tests should be scheduled relatively quickly, Mr. Grumman. I'll have my assistant contact you to arrange them. They typically take about 30-45 minutes to complete. For now, focus on reducing the stress on your liver. Limit alcohol, fatty foods, and caffeine. Staying well-hydrated is also important. I want to emphasize that these tests are simply to rule out potential issues and get a clearer understanding of what’s causing your fatigue. It doesn’t necessarily mean there's something serious wrong. I’ll provide you with a written summary of our conversation and the test orders. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, jaundice , or persistent nausea – please contact my office immediately. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Jaundice…? Yellow skin…? No, no yellow skin. I am… normal color. Yes. No questions… for now. Just… get these tests done quickly, Doctor. And tell me what they mean. In plain language, you promised. And… thank you. I suppose. It’s… good that you are looking into this.
DOCTOR: You are welcome, Mr. Grumman. My assistant will be in touch shortly to schedule the tests. I assure you, I will explain the results in plain language. We'll get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
