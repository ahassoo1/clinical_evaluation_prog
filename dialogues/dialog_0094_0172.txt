DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. It’s lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Gegan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor... Gegan, was it? Honestly, I’m not entirely certain why I’m here. My husband, bless his heart, insisted. Something about getting “settled” now that we’ve moved. It all feels rather… unnecessary, if you ask me. I suppose a check-up is… fine. Though I haven't been particularly ill.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Candice. It's very common for people to want a baseline check-up after a move, especially to establish care with a new doctor. And it's wonderful that your husband is so attentive to your health. So, even though you haven’t been feeling ill, let’s just take a thorough look at everything to get a good sense of your overall health. We can cover a lot of ground, and if everything looks good, great! To start, could you tell me a little bit about any health concerns you have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The past… that was a long time ago. I honestly can't recall specifics. Old age, you know. It does things to one’s memory. I've always been… rather sturdy, I believe is the word. Never one for complaints. Though, there was… something with my gallbladder, perhaps? Or was it my appendix? My sister had trouble with hers, you see. It's all so very muddled. I really couldn't say with any certainty. I’m afraid I’m not much help on that front.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Candice. It’s very common for memories of past illnesses to become a bit hazy. We can certainly try to clarify things. It sounds like you may have had some abdominal surgery at some point, but we don’t need to be precise right now. Do you have access to any old medical records?
PATIENT: Medical records? Heavens, no. That was decades ago! And my husband… well, he handles all the paperwork. I’m quite certain he doesn’t have them anymore. We moved… oh, it must be six times now! All those boxes… I wouldn't dream of asking him to dig through all of that again. It's simply not necessary. I assure you, I'm quite healthy for my age. Perfectly fine, just… a little forgetful.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Candice. No worries at all. We can proceed without them. Let's talk about what's been going on recently. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Changes in appetite… hmm. Well, I do find I don't eat quite as much as I used to. Though that’s likely just… getting older, isn’t it? One doesn’t have the same gusto for food, you see. And weight… I believe I've lost a little. But it’s not something I’ve been terribly concerned with. I’m rather tall, you know. Always have been. It’s likely just a natural fluctuation. Really, I feel perfectly alright. Though my knees do ache a bit after a long walk. But that’s to be expected, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Candice. A slight decrease in appetite and some weight loss, along with knee pain – that gives me a little more to work with. You mentioned your knees ache after a long walk. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it certainly comes and goes. Not a persistent agony, thank goodness. Mostly after I've been on my feet for a while. Gardening, you see. I enjoy my garden. But getting up and down… it does put a strain on them. And sometimes, in cold weather, they feel rather stiff. But a little warm bath usually sorts it out. It’s nothing debilitating, truly. I can still manage, although I don't move quite as quickly as I used to. One slows down with age, doesn't one? It's a natural progression. I simply don't want to make a fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Candice. It's good that warm baths help. We can definitely discuss some strategies to manage the knee pain. Now, thinking beyond your knees, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness lately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Nothing like that. Perfectly steady, as a matter of fact. Never been one for palpitations or breathless spells. And dizziness? Heavens, no. I have excellent balance, you see. Always have been a graceful mover. Though, I did stumble once… but that was a rug. A terribly misplaced rug! It wasn’t my fault at all. But generally, perfectly fine. A little stiff in the mornings, perhaps. But nothing alarming. I assure you, I’m not a fragile creature. I’m quite sturdy. Really, I think I’m wasting your time.
DOCTOR: You’re not wasting my time at all, Candice. I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. It helps me get a better understanding of your overall health, even when everything seems “perfectly fine,” as you say. Let's move on to your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, vitamins, or over-the-counter supplements?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medications… Let me think. My husband handles all of that as well. I take… a little pill, I believe. White, I think. For my… pressure? Or perhaps my cholesterol? Honestly, I can't quite recall. He’s very good at reminding me, you see. And I take a multivitamin, of course. For general health. And sometimes, a little something for my arthritis, when my knees are particularly troublesome. But that’s just when needed. Really, I don’t take much. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. A warm bath, you see. That’s usually enough. I really don't pay much attention to the specifics. It all feels rather… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, that’s alright. We can try to get a more accurate list from your husband later. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I’m aware of. Never been one for sensitivities. I eat everything in moderation, you see. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. Though, I once had a slightly itchy rash… but that was probably just the soap. A terribly scented soap, it was. Really, I’m quite robust. I don't believe I have any true allergies. My sister, now she was allergic to everything. Pollen, dust, cats… a terribly sensitive creature. But me? Perfectly fine. Though I avoid shellfish. Just a personal preference, you see. It doesn't agree with me. But not an allergy, truly. Just… a dislike.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Candice. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh dear. What does that even mean? I suppose… I'm married, as I mentioned. Have been for… a very long time. And I enjoy my garden, as I’ve said. And I enjoy reading. Mostly historical novels. And I have… acquaintances. People I see at church. And I enjoy a quiet evening at home with my husband. Really, I don't have much of a "social life," as such. Never been one for large gatherings. Prefer a peaceful existence. Is that what you mean? It all seems rather… personal, doesn’t it? I’m not sure what relevance this has to my health.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Candice. It just helps me get a fuller picture of your lifestyle. And you’re right, it can feel a bit personal. No pressure to share anything you’re not comfortable with. I just ask about things like smoking, alcohol consumption, or if you've ever used recreational drugs. Have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life! My mother always said they were terribly unhealthy, and she was quite right, of course. A dreadful habit, simply dreadful. And I’ve never had much use for alcohol, either. A little glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on a special occasion. But nothing regular. Really, I prefer a nice cup of tea. A much healthier alternative, wouldn’t you agree? A dreadful habit, smoking. A truly dreadful one. I can't imagine. No, never touched a cigarette, not once.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Candice. Now, would you mind if I listened to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I suppose not. If you must. Though I assure you, everything is perfectly fine. I told you, I'm quite sturdy. But very gently, please. I don’t like being prodded. And perhaps we could hurry along? I have some gardening to do, you see. The roses need deadheading. And my husband will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. Very gently. And we won't take long. Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and let it out slowly. Good. And again… I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen now. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. It may be slightly cool… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no masses palpable. No organomegaly noted. Everything feels normal so far, Candice. Just as you said. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes quickly…
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that's a relief. As I told you, everything is perfectly fine. Reflexes? Oh dear. I don’t like the thought of that. Will it hurt? I have rather sensitive knees, you know. And I’m not terribly flexible. Please be gentle. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: It won’t hurt at all, Candice. It’s just a quick tap with this little hammer. Just relax your leg… good. And let your foot go limp. And again… Alright. And now just let me take a quick look in your ears. Both ear canals are clear. Tympanic membranes appear normal. Everything looks good, Candice. Your ears are clear, reflexes are present and normal, and your general physical exam is unremarkable. You truly are in good shape for your age. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed, I'd like to discuss some preventative care, and perhaps order some routine blood work just to get a baseline. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Routine blood work? Oh dear. Must we? It all seems rather… unnecessary, doesn't it? I haven’t been feeling unwell. And I’m not particularly fond of needles. Is it absolutely necessary? Perhaps… just preventative care? I suppose that’s… sensible. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And as long as the results are promptly available. I wouldn't want to worry unnecessarily. And I do need to get back to my roses. They won’t deadhead themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Candice. It’s not something anyone enjoys, but it’s a good way to catch things early, if there’s anything at all. A complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel would give us a good baseline, and we can check your vitamin D levels as well, since that's important for overall health. It shouldn’t take long – about ten minutes for the blood draw, and the results should be available in a few days. We can also discuss some preventative screenings, like a bone density scan to check for osteoporosis, and a flu shot in the fall. But we can prioritize, and only do what you’re comfortable with. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. Ten minutes, you say? I suppose that's… manageable. And the results in a few days? Good. I wouldn’t want to be kept waiting. The bone density scan… that sounds rather alarming. Perhaps we can postpone that for now. And I’ll think about the flu shot. I haven't had one in years. Really, let’s just stick to the blood work for now. And then I can get back to my garden. It’s getting rather late, you know. The sun is starting to go down.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. Just the blood work then. I’ll write you a lab order, and you can go to the lab at your convenience. They’re located just down the street at the medical center. Here you are. The receptionist will help you schedule an appointment. They’ll need your insurance information. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – anything at all – please don’t hesitate to call the office. And we’ll follow up with you once your results are in. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you. I suppose. It wasn't entirely unpleasant. Although all the prodding and tapping… But thank you. I believe that's all. I really must get back to my roses. They’re terribly demanding, you know. And I do hope my husband remembers to bring my gardening gloves. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Candice. Enjoy your roses. Have a good day. .
