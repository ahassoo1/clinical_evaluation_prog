DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Neppl, nice to meet you too. Well, I've been getting chills lately, and it's kind of bothering me. Not a fever, just...chills. Like when you're cold, but I'm not really cold, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Chills without a fever can certainly be unsettling. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe these chills in more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm, okay. They come and go. Sometimes it's just a shiver, other times I feel like I’m actually cold all over, even if it’s warm in the room. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few minutes, maybe ten at the most. And it’s not always the same. Sometimes it feels like it’s starting in my back, other times just my arms and legs. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Thank you for being so specific. And how long have you been experiencing these chills, Ms. Aslan?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… probably about a week, maybe a little longer. It started gradually, just a little shiver here and there, and then it got more noticeable. I figured it was just from being tired, but it hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the chills, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying them?
PATIENT: Not really… well, I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but I thought that was just from work. And maybe a tiny bit achy, but nothing major. No cough, no sore throat, no stuffy nose… just the chills and feeling a bit wiped out.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything specific seemed to trigger these chills, or make them worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I haven't really noticed a pattern, to be honest. It doesn't seem to matter if I'm inside or outside, if I’ve been active or resting… It just happens randomly. I mean, sometimes it feels worse when I'm stressed, but I'm always a little stressed, so it's hard to tell.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stress can certainly contribute to a variety of symptoms. Let’s move on to some general health questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu, even if mild?
PATIENT: No, nothing recent. I think I had a little sniffle back in… April, maybe? But it was super quick and nothing serious. I haven't really been sick in ages, to be honest. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if I have a headache, but that's it. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things and taken different medicines before without any problems. I'm pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm, let’s see. Nothing major, thankfully. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, and I broke my arm once, but that healed fine. My mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had some heart trouble when he was older, but other than that, we're a pretty healthy family. I had a pretty normal childhood, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. And have you had any surgeries besides your tonsils and broken arm?
PATIENT: No, just those two. Nothing else. I’ve always been pretty careful, I guess. I don’t take risks!
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I don't smoke, I hardly ever drink – maybe a glass of wine with dinner a few times a year – and I definitely don't do drugs. I try to live a healthy lifestyle.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be causing these chills, I would like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Finally, I’ll take a look at your throat and examine your lymph nodes. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, also normal. Blood pressure is 128 over 82, which is slightly elevated but not concerning at this time. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your throat appears normal, and your lymph nodes are not swollen. I do not note any areas of tenderness. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. However, given your symptoms, I would like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds… good, I guess? A little scary, but if it helps figure out what’s going on, then yes, definitely. I'd rather know than just keep feeling this way. What exactly will those tests show? And will I need a separate appointment to get the results?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable approach, Ms. Aslan. It’s always best to be proactive. A complete blood count, or CBC, will tell us about the different types of cells in your blood – red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can help us identify signs of infection, anemia, or other blood disorders. A comprehensive metabolic panel, or CMP, will give us information about your kidney and liver function, electrolyte balance, and blood sugar levels. The thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH, test will assess your thyroid function. Thyroid problems can sometimes cause symptoms similar to what you’re experiencing. These tests will help us rule out common causes of chills and fatigue. As for a follow-up appointment, yes, you will need a separate appointment to discuss the results. The lab typically takes a few days to process the results, and I’d like to review them with you in person to explain everything thoroughly. The receptionist will schedule that for you before you leave today. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. So it's just to check everything is working properly, basically? And a few days...that’s not too bad. Yes, please, go ahead and schedule the follow-up appointment. I'm glad you're being thorough. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Like, anything I should avoid or watch out for? Or is just… waiting it out?
DOCTOR: Precisely, Ms. Aslan. It’s a comprehensive check to ensure everything is functioning as it should. In the meantime, there isn't much you need to drastically change. I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and maintaining a healthy diet. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can help with any aches or discomfort. However, it's crucial to monitor your symptoms closely. If you develop a fever, severe headache, shortness of breath, chest pain, or any other concerning symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention. Do not hesitate to go to the emergency room if you are worried. It is always better to err on the side of caution. I will also have the nurse provide you with a written summary of today's discussion and instructions. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Dr. Neppl. You've been very helpful and I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I feel a bit better just knowing we're checking things out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Aslan. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. My priority is ensuring you receive the best possible care, and I’m confident we’ll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule your follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up.
