DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. It’s… throat. My throat hurts. Been hurting for a few days now. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this. Just… what do you need to know? Get on with it, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. I understand you’re short on time, so I’ll be as efficient as possible. When did the sore throat start, exactly?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t remember exactly. A few days. Maybe Tuesday? Or was it Wednesday? It’s all a blur, really. Does it matter? It hurts when I swallow. That's the important thing.
DOCTOR: It does matter a little, Tammie, as it helps me understand what might be going on. But we can work with “a few days.” You mentioned it hurts when you swallow. Is it painful to swallow liquids, solids, or both?
PATIENT: Both. Everything. Water, soup… doesn’t matter. It feels like… sandpaper. And it’s quite unpleasant, thank you very much. I haven’t been able to eat properly. Not that it's any of your business, really. Just fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, both liquids and solids are painful. And you’ve noticed a decrease in your appetite because of that. Have you had any other symptoms along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Like what? I just have the throat. And a headache, maybe. A little one. Probably from the stress of… everything. I don't sit around cataloging my ailments, Doctor. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. Just trying to get a complete picture. A little headache… okay. Have you noticed a fever, chills, a cough, runny nose, or any body aches?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, just the throat. And a headache. No cough. No… runny nose. I haven't been checking my temperature, if that’s what you’re going to ask. I'm a busy woman, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t felt well enough to think about whether I have chills. Just… can we get on with the examination, please? Before I lose my patience completely.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Tammie. We can move on to the examination. I just want to rule out anything serious. Let me listen to your lungs and take a look at your throat. Could you open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: Hurry it up. It’s… uncomfortable. And don’t poke.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. Your throat is definitely red and your tonsils are a little swollen. No visible pus or white spots at this time. I'm also going to listen to your lungs quickly. Lungs sound clear. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I don't take anything. I prefer natural remedies, thank you very much. And no, I don’t have allergies. I’m a perfectly healthy woman, or was until this throat decided to bother me. Just… get to the point. What am I supposed to do? Is it something serious? Do I need… pills? I really don’t like pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. Based on what you’ve told me and my examination, it sounds like you likely have a viral pharyngitis – a common sore throat caused by a virus. It's not usually serious and often resolves on its own within a week. The lack of pus on the tonsils and your clear lungs make a bacterial infection like strep throat less likely, but we can do a quick strep test if you'd like to be absolutely sure. In the meantime, I recommend supportive care: plenty of rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to manage the discomfort. Lozenges or warm salt water gargles can also provide some relief. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A… virus? So, nothing serious. Just… go away on its own. And pills? You said pills. I told you, I don't like pills. Salt water gargles… that sounds dreadful. And rest? I don’t have time for rest! I have things to do. Is there… anything else? A spray? A potion? Something that will make it go away now? And honestly, if I do need a pill, what would it be for? Don't tell me some complicated medical name, just… what does it do?
DOCTOR: Okay, Tammie. I understand your frustration. While there isn't a quick fix, we can focus on managing the symptoms. There are throat sprays containing numbing agents like benzocaine that can provide temporary relief, but the effect is short-lived. As for a pill, if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve after a few days, a strep test would be a good idea. If the test comes back positive, we’d prescribe an antibiotic – typically penicillin or amoxicillin – to fight the bacterial infection. An antibiotic stops the bacteria from growing and helps you recover faster. It’s important to finish the entire course of medication, even if you start feeling better, to prevent complications. However, given your current presentation, I don't believe antibiotics are necessary at this time. We can monitor your symptoms closely. Would you like me to write you a prescription for a throat spray, or would you prefer to try the salt water gargles and see how you feel over the next few days?
PATIENT: Salt water gargles… honestly. Fine. Give me the spray. Just… something to make it stop hurting. And don’t make me come back here if it doesn't work. I have better things to do than sit in waiting rooms. Write it down quickly, please. And make sure it doesn’t taste awful. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. Here’s a prescription for a throat spray containing benzocaine. It should provide some temporary relief from the pain. Follow the instructions on the label carefully. If your symptoms worsen after a few days – such as high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain – please contact the clinic immediately. I’ll also provide a handout with instructions on how to manage a sore throat at home, including information on salt water gargles and staying hydrated. Do you have any other questions for me today?
