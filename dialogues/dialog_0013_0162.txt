DOCTOR: Hi Lawton, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, and I’m one of the family medicine doctors here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have a lot of time, Doc. It’s my stomach, okay? It’s… bloated. Just feels full of air, mostly. It's been happening on and off, but it’s worse lately. Honestly, I just want to know what I can take to make it stop. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're short on time and want to get this figured out quickly. Bloating can be really uncomfortable. “On and off” is helpful, but can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: When? Ugh… look, I eat, sometimes it happens. Sometimes not. I don’t really pay attention to it, to be honest. It’s not like it's a life-or-death thing. It's just… annoying. Is that good enough? I really don't remember specifics, alright? My wife… she used to keep track of all that. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, don’t worry about specifics. “Sometimes after eating” is a start. Does it happen with all types of food, or do certain things seem to trigger it more?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven’t noticed. I eat pretty much whatever. I work construction, I need the fuel. It's not like I'm sitting around analyzing every bite I take. Look, is this going to take long? I got a job site to get back to. And I really don't want to start listing off everything I ate last Tuesday. It'll just be a waste of both our times.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear you. We can definitely try to keep this efficient. If you’re not noticing any clear food triggers, that’s good to know. Let’s shift gears then. Besides the bloating, are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I dunno. I feel… tired, I guess. Everyone’s tired, right? Work's hard. No, nothing else really. No pain, no… changes in, uh, bathroom habits or anything. Just the stomach being puffed up. Look, is this gonna involve poking and prodding? Because I really don't have the patience for that today.
DOCTOR: No poking and prodding yet. Just trying to get a full picture. Okay, no pain, no changes in bathroom habits, just tiredness and bloating. Have you noticed any weight loss recently, even unintentional?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, I'm probably carrying a little extra. I haven’t stepped on a scale in… well, a long time. I eat plenty, okay? I don't skip meals. Look, Doc, I’m a pile driver operator. I need to be strong. This is probably just… gas. Can we just get something for gas and be done with it? I got steel to drive.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand your frustration and wanting a quick solution. While it could be simple gas, it's important to rule out anything more serious, even if it seems unlikely. I'm going to do a quick exam of your abdomen, just to listen to your bowel sounds and feel for any tenderness. It'll only take a minute. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But make it quick. I really don't have time for this. Just… don't poke too hard, alright? And tell me what you’re listening for, if you don’t mind. I don’t like being kept in the dark. Honestly, this is a waste of my day. But alright, go ahead. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening for normal bowel sounds – gurgling, movement of gas and fluids. It helps me assess how quickly your digestive system is working. I’m also palpating – gently feeling – for any areas of tenderness or pain. Everything feels… soft, not particularly tender to the touch. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, but a little… quieter than I’d expect. I’m just going to listen one more time. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Look, is "quieter" bad? Just tell me straight. I don't need the medical explanation. Is it something serious? Because if it's something serious, I need to know now so I can call the foreman. I got a schedule to keep, Doc. This whole thing is just… frustrating. Just be honest. Is this going to need tests or something?
DOCTOR: Okay, you're right to ask directly. "Quieter" isn’t necessarily bad, but it's enough of a change that I want to investigate a little further to rule out anything concerning. Given your tiredness and the quieter bowel sounds, I’d like to order a simple blood test – a complete blood count – just to check for things like anemia or inflammation. We can also do a stool test to rule out any infection. It's standard practice when someone presents with these symptoms, especially with the change in bowel sounds. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests. Of course. Look, fine. But I expect quick results. And who pays for all this? My insurance covers it, right? I don’t want any surprises. And can you write down instructions for the stool test? I don’t want to mess that up. Honestly, this is a whole lot of hassle over a little bloating. Just… get it over with. I got things to do, Doc. Steel isn’t gonna drive itself.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Your insurance should cover it – we’ll verify that before processing anything. Here are the lab requisitions, and these instructions detail how to collect the stool sample. It's important to follow them carefully to get accurate results. The lab is just down the hall. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you try an over-the-counter simethicone – that’s Gas-X or a similar brand – for the bloating. And try to stay hydrated. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Fine. Hydrate, Gas-X, stool sample… got it. Look, I appreciate you not wasting my time too much. And… alright, thanks. Just… let me know when those results are back, okay? Don't make me call. Honestly, I got better things to worry about than lab reports. I'll just… go do the stool thing. Thanks again.
