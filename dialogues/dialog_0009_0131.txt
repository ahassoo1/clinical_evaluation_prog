DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, to be honest, it's my blood pressure. It's been a bit high lately, and I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a good idea to get it checked. High blood pressure is something we definitely want to address. When you say “lately,” about how long has your blood pressure been elevated?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… probably the last couple of months, maybe three months now? It's not something I check regularly, to be honest. Usually, it’s fine, but I’ve noticed it’s been higher when I go to get my regular check-ups at the pharmacy. That’s what made me want to come see you.
DOCTOR: Alright, three months is good to know. And it’s smart to listen to your body and get it checked out when you notice a change. Can you recall roughly what those readings were at the pharmacy, if you remember?
PATIENT: You know, I do remember now. The first time, it was around 140 over 90, maybe. And then last month, it was even a little higher – I think 145 over 95. That second reading is what really worried me. I don’t usually pay attention unless it’s way off, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, those readings are definitely worth investigating. 140/90 and above is considered elevated. Do you experience any symptoms along with the higher blood pressure readings – like headaches, dizziness, vision changes, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s the strange thing. I feel perfectly fine, most of the time. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I just figured that was from work. No headaches, no dizziness, nothing like that. It’s just…the numbers were high, and I didn’t want to ignore it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Sometimes high blood pressure doesn't have any noticeable symptoms, which is why regular checks are so important. Now, let's get a better picture of your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of – like diabetes, kidney problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I guess! I have Medicare, so they usually catch anything serious when I go in for my yearly check-ups, but those don’t always include blood pressure specifically.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve been generally healthy. And Medicare is good about those yearly checks. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been lucky that I haven't needed to be hospitalized or have any surgeries. I broke my wrist when I was a kid, but that's about it. It healed up just fine. I’m not one for hospitals if I can avoid it!
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… my mother, she had high blood pressure too, towards the end of her life. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had a heart condition, I think. Other than that, not really. My siblings are pretty healthy, as far as I know. It wasn’t something we really talked about much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know about your mother and grandfather. High blood pressure and heart conditions can sometimes run in families. And finally, regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or do any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. And definitely no drugs. I work too hard for all that! I try to eat reasonably well, mostly. It’s hard when you’re busy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's all very helpful information, Mykeisha. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, including checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and taking a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Go right ahead, Dr. Petrimoulx. I trust your judgment. I just want to get to the bottom of this and feel better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good airflow bilaterally. Ears appear normal, throat is clear without any significant redness or swelling. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Everything seems normal so far physically. Your pulse is 72 and regular. I'm going to order some blood work and a urine test just to rule out any underlying causes for your elevated blood pressure. They'll check your kidney function, electrolytes, and cholesterol levels. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work and a urine test… that makes sense. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to find out what’s going on. Will I need to fast for the blood work? And where do I go to get that done?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood work. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. You can go to the lab right across the street – the one connected to the pharmacy. They are expecting you, and I’ve already sent over the order. They should be able to draw the blood and collect the urine sample when you get there. Do you have any questions about the fasting or where to go?
PATIENT: No, that's pretty clear, thank you. Eight to twelve hours fasting, water is okay, and go to the lab across the street. I can definitely handle that. How long will it take to get the results back? And will I need to make another appointment to discuss them?
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes about 2-3 business days to process the results and send them to me. I will review them as soon as I receive them. I'll call you with the results as soon as I've had a chance to look them over, and we can discuss a plan of action then. If the results show something concerning, I may want to see you in the office sooner to discuss further testing or treatment options. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Two to three business days… I can wait that long. And I appreciate you calling me with the results. It's good to know I don't have to keep calling and checking. Thank you, Dr. Petrimoulx. Is there anything else I need to do or be aware of in the meantime? Before I go, I mean.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mykeisha. In the meantime, try to reduce your stress levels as much as possible, and limit your sodium intake. Focus on a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. And, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe headaches, chest pain, or vision changes, please don't hesitate to call the office right away. Otherwise, just focus on taking care of yourself and getting some rest. I'll be in touch soon with your results. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. Thank you again, Dr. Petrimoulx. I feel much better just knowing we’re getting this checked out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mykeisha. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any questions at all. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
