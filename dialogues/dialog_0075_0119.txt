DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It's lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Though, honestly, I don’t find much lovely about this situation. It's... well, it’s a bit embarrassing to discuss, but I’ve noticed a… discharge. Yes, a discharge. From… down there. It’s most unsettling, and I haven’t the faintest idea what it could be. It’s not something a woman of my… standing… typically experiences.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be unsettling, and you're right to get it checked out. It's good you came in. It’s quite common, actually, and there are many possible causes, most of which are easily treated. There's absolutely no need to feel embarrassed. Let's talk about it. Could you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… not pleasant, Doctor. It’s not like a normal… you know. It’s… yellowish, I suppose. And rather… copious. It’s not a little spot, if that makes any sense. And there’s a… smell. Not a good smell. I’ve been trying to keep things… clean, naturally, but it persists. It’s been going on for… oh, a week or so, I’d say. Perhaps a little longer. It’s terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish, copious, and with an odor. And it's been going on for about a week. Thank you for being so specific, Ms. Wartick. That’s very helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… Well, there’s been a bit of… discomfort. Not exactly pain, more of a… burning sensation. Especially… after. After I… relieve myself. And a little itching, sometimes. It’s most bothersome at night, keeps me from a good night’s sleep. Honestly, Doctor, it’s quite disruptive. I’ve not been feeling myself at all. I do hope it’s nothing… serious. One hears such dreadful stories these days.
DOCTOR: Burning with urination, itching, particularly at night. Alright. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no fever. Certainly not. And chills? Goodness, no. It’s August, Doctor. Far too warm for chills. As for abdominal pain… well, I had a bit of indigestion after lunch yesterday, but I attribute that to the paella. It was a little rich, perhaps. But nothing… significant. I assure you. This is… localized, shall we say? It’s not my whole system failing, if that's what you're asking.
DOCTOR: I understand. No fever, no chills, no abdominal pain, just the localized symptoms we've discussed. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Well, I recall being quite unwell as a child with something involving hives. I believe it was strawberries. Though, that was… decades ago. I haven't touched a strawberry since. As for medications… I take a little something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And occasionally, a pain reliever for my arthritis, but that's just ibuprofen. Nothing… drastic. I'm generally a very healthy woman, you understand. Or, was, until this unfortunate… situation.
DOCTOR: Alright, allergy to strawberries, Lisinopril for blood pressure, and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Good to know. And have you had any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! I had my tonsils out when I was quite young. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. And… I had a hysterectomy many years ago. Perhaps twenty years, now. It was… necessary. Beyond that… nothing significant. I’ve always been very careful with my health. I avoid doctors as much as possible, truthfully. They rarely have good news, in my experience.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy and hysterectomy. And you mentioned a family history... Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother had diabetes, I believe. Though, she wasn’t terribly careful with her diet. And my aunt… on my father’s side… had something involving her bones. Osteoporosis, perhaps? It was a very long time ago, and my father never spoke of it much. He wasn’t one for dwelling on unpleasantness. Honestly, Doctor, it’s not a particularly healthy lineage. We tend to keep to ourselves. And, frankly, avoid discussing such things. It just… invites negativity, you understand?
DOCTOR: Alright, family history of diabetes and possible osteoporosis. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: My social history? I'm not quite sure what that entails, Doctor. I live alone. I’ve never married. I keep a tidy house. I enjoy reading and… gardening. I don’t… socialize much. Is that what you’re looking for? It’s hardly relevant to my… current predicament, is it? I’m a respectable woman. I don’t… go out much. It’s a quiet life. Really, I fail to see the connection.
DOCTOR: It’s just standard procedure, Ms. Wartick. It helps me get a complete picture of your overall health. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. Never. My mother always said it was a dreadful habit, and I’ve always been very obedient. Alcohol… well, I occasionally have a small glass of sherry with dinner. Very small. It's hardly excessive. Perhaps once or twice a week. It aids digestion, you understand. And it’s a very good sherry. From Jerez, naturally. Not some… cheap imitation.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick, thank you for providing that information. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. It's important to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? I hadn’t anticipated… that. It’s just… rather personal, isn’t it? Is it absolutely necessary? I’ve always been… quite private. And I’m not entirely comfortable with… strangers examining me. Is there no other way? Perhaps some… medication? A cream, perhaps?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Wartick. You are right, it is personal, and I would never proceed without your full consent. The exam is necessary to get a clear picture of what’s going on and to ensure we are on the right track with treatment. It will be a simple pelvic exam, and I will explain every step of the process. I’ll be as gentle and respectful as possible. However, without an exam, it would be irresponsible to prescribe medication blindly. We need to determine the cause of the discharge before we can effectively treat it. If you’re still uncomfortable, we can start with a urine sample to rule out a urinary tract infection, and then discuss the exam further. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A urine sample… yes, that sounds… far more reasonable. I can manage that. It’s less… intrusive. And then we can… discuss the exam. Perhaps after I’ve had a chance to… consider it further. I’m just… a little overwhelmed, you understand. It’s all happening so quickly. And I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a very long time. Yes, let’s start with the urine sample. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wartick. The bathroom is just through that door. There’s a specimen cup in there. Just collect a small sample, and I’ll be right here when you’re finished. Please let me know if you have any trouble. I’ll be listening at the door, and we can discuss everything further once you're back.
PATIENT: Very well.
