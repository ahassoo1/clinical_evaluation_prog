DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… well, it’s a bit… complicated. My daughter, she's… thinking about having a baby. And she said I should come talk to someone first. Something about… making sure everything is okay, before… you know. I don’t really understand all the details, but she was very insistent. It's about the baby being healthy, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds like a very thoughtful precaution, Mr. Verrall. It’s excellent that your daughter is encouraging you to be proactive. It's common to want to ensure the best possible outcome for a future pregnancy. So, it sounds like you're here for a preconception check-up – to assess your overall health and identify any potential factors that could affect a baby’s health. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Pre… pre-conception? Is that what it’s called? Yes, I think so. She used that word. It sounds important. I just want to be sure I'm… fit enough, I guess. I don’t want to cause any problems for the baby, or for my daughter, of course. I’m getting a little older, you see… so I thought maybe there are things I should know about. It’s good she made me come. I don't really know where to start, though. What do you usually check for?
DOCTOR: It is very responsible of your daughter to encourage this, Mr. Verrall. And you're right to be proactive. A preconception check-up is a great idea, especially as you mentioned being aware of age-related factors. We’ll want to review your medical history, your family history, and discuss your lifestyle. We’ll also do a physical exam and likely some blood work. To start, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Let me think. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time, I think. A really long time. I used to be pretty healthy, I think. I worked a lot, traveling around for my job... Sales Engineers, that was it. Lots of walking, I remember that. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Measles, mumps… nothing serious. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy. And… oh, I had my tonsils out when I was younger. I don’t really remember being sick sick, if that makes sense. Just the normal things. I don't think I have any allergies... unless you count dust, maybe? I sneeze sometimes. Does that count? It’s all a bit hazy, I’m afraid. I really don’t remember much about going to doctors. I try not to, really.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It's not uncommon to have a somewhat hazy recollection of past medical events, especially if it's been a long time. "Sneezing with dust" doesn't typically count as a medical allergy, but we'll make a note of it. So, no major illnesses, surgeries beyond the tonsillectomy, and no known allergies. That’s a good starting point. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think again. I… I don’t think so. Not really. Maybe when I was a very little boy? For something minor, I suppose. But I don’t have a clear memory of it. I travelled a lot for work, like I said. Sometimes I felt unwell on trips, but I always managed to get through it. A bit of stomach trouble here and there, but nothing that needed a hospital. I think my daughter would remember if I'd been in the hospital, wouldn't she? She remembers everything. I’m pretty sure I’ve never been seriously ill enough for a hospital. No, I don’t think so. I don't recall any hospital stays.
DOCTOR: Alright, no hospital stays that you recall. That's helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a tricky one. My family… well, we’re Kurdish, you see. And we come from a village… a small village. It was a long time ago. Things weren't… recorded much back then. I know my father… he was a strong man, but he died young. Something with his heart, I think. But I don't remember the details. My mother lived a long life, but she had… arthritis, I think. Bad joints, she always complained about them. I have a sister, she’s still alive, but we don’t see each other much. She lives in… somewhere far away. I don’t really know about her health. And that’s about all the family I have, really. I don’t remember anyone else having any… serious illnesses. Nothing that I can recall, anyway. It’s a long time ago, and we didn't talk about these things much. A bit of a shame, I suppose. Does that help? I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Verrall. Family history can be difficult to piece together, especially with limited information. Knowing about your father’s heart condition and your mother's arthritis is a good start. We'll make note of those. Now, to get a better picture of your overall health, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, no. I don’t do any of those things. Never have. My father didn't approve, and I… well, I just never got into it. Smoking is terrible for you, and alcohol… well, I just don't like it. It makes me feel sick. And drugs… no, absolutely not. I've always been a healthy man, I think. I eat well… mostly. And I try to get enough sleep. Though it's getting harder these days. I used to walk a lot for my job, like I said. But now I don't get out as much. A bit of gardening, that's about it. I worry a little about that, actually. Not being as active as I used to be. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Verrall. Avoiding tobacco, alcohol, and drugs is very good for your health. It's understandable to be concerned about reduced activity levels, and we can certainly discuss ways to address that. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let me ask one more question about your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don’t take anything regularly. Sometimes I take a painkiller for my knees, if they’re bothering me. Just something simple, you can get it at the pharmacy. But that’s it. I used to take something for my stomach, years ago, but I stopped that a long time ago. I don’t really believe in taking too many pills, if I can help it. I prefer to… just get on with things, you know? I don't like relying on medication. I try to eat well and get enough rest, and that usually does the trick. No, I’m not taking anything regularly. Just the occasional painkiller for my knees. And… I think that’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional painkillers for your knees. Thank you, Mr. Verrall, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I'm a bit nervous about it, to be honest… it’s been so long since I’ve been to a doctor. But I want to make sure everything is okay, for my daughter’s sake. So, yes, go ahead. Where do you want me to start? I hope it won't be too unpleasant. My knees are a bit creaky, you know. And… well, I’m not as young as I used to be. But I’ll do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. We’ll take things slowly and gently. No need to worry. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. After that, I’ll take a quick look at your ears, nose, and throat. And finally, I’ll examine your knees and check your reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Heart and lungs first, you say? Alright. I suppose I should… take a deep breath when you tell me to? It's been a long time since anyone listened to my heart. I always thought it was a bit silly, to be honest. But if it helps… then go ahead. Just be gentle with my knees, please. They're a bit sensitive these days. And… is there anything I need to do? Should I take my shoes off? Or… lie down? I’m just not sure what the procedure is. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: No need to lie down just yet, Mr. Verrall. You can remain seated for the heart and lungs. You can keep your shoes on for now. Just try to relax and breathe normally. When I ask you to take a deep breath, just inhale deeply through your nose, and exhale slowly through your mouth. That’s all. Alright, let’s start with your heart. I’m just going to listen to your heartbeat. This will help me assess the rhythm and any unusual sounds. Breathe normally for me, please. Deep breath in… and out… Deep breath in… and out… Excellent. Everything sounds… regular, so far. Now, I’ll listen to your lungs. Just breathe normally, as you’ve been doing.
PATIENT: Okay, deep breaths. I used to be able to hold my breath for a very long time, when I was younger. Scuba diving, I did. Many years ago. But I haven't done that in… well, decades. It's a bit difficult now, to be honest. My chest feels a bit tight sometimes. But I'm trying to breathe normally, as you asked. I hope I'm not making too much noise. It's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I always feel a bit self-conscious when someone listens to my chest. But I'm doing my best to cooperate. Deep breath… and out… Is everything alright so far, Doctor? I hope I’m not disappointing you.
DOCTOR: You're not disappointing me at all, Mr. Verrall. Your lungs sound clear, with no wheezing or crackles. A slight decrease in breath sounds bilaterally, which is not uncommon with age. No immediate concerns there. Now, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please extend your left arm, please?
PATIENT: Left arm, you say? Yes, of course. It feels a bit cold, suddenly. I always get cold easily, these days. My wife… my late wife, she always used to say I was a cold-blooded creature. I don't think she meant it literally, of course. It was just her way of teasing me. I miss her terribly, you know. But that's a different story. I'm trying to relax, as you asked. But it's a bit difficult, to be honest. All these medical instruments… they make me a bit nervous. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a very long time. But I'm doing my best to cooperate. Just tell me if it hurts, or if you need me to do something different. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Verrall, and I’ll take things as slowly as you need. This won't hurt at all. I’m just going to inflate the cuff, and it will tighten briefly. Your blood pressure is 142/88 mmHg, and your pulse is 72 beats per minute, regular. Slightly elevated blood pressure, which we can discuss further. Now, let's take a quick look at your ears, nose, and throat. Do you have any hearing problems or recent congestion?
PATIENT: Congestion… no, not really. My hearing isn’t what it used to be, I suppose. My daughter keeps telling me to turn the television down, and I often have to ask her to repeat herself. But I don't think it’s anything serious. Just old age, I suppose. It’s the same with my nose… sometimes it gets a bit stuffy, especially in the winter. But nothing that requires medication, or anything like that. I can still smell the roses in the garden, and I can still taste my coffee in the morning. So, I think my senses are still functioning, more or less. Are you using one of those little lights to look in my ears? My grandson used to love playing with those. He thought it was a magic wand. I miss him terribly, you know. But that's a different story. Just tell me if it’s uncomfortable, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Your ears appear clear, with some cerumen present. Your throat is clear as well, with no signs of inflammation. Now, let's examine your knees. You mentioned they've been creaky. Could you please bend them for me, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… not very comfortable, I’m afraid. . They’ve been like this for years, you see. Old injury, I think. Football, when I was a boy. Stupid game, really. But I enjoyed it at the time. They ache a bit, especially in the cold weather. And sometimes they get stiff, especially in the morning. It takes a while to get them moving. I used to be able to run for miles, but now I can barely walk up the stairs without getting out of breath. I used to be so active, but now… well, now I mostly sit around and read. It's a bit depressing, to be honest. But what can I do? They just ache, Doctor. That's all. I don't think there's anything you can do about it. Just old age, I suppose. Are you poking around with something? Is it going to hurt? I'm ready when you are. But please be gentle.
DOCTOR: I’m just checking for any swelling or tenderness, Mr. Verrall. There's some mild crepitus when you bend them, which is common with osteoarthritis. Some mild tenderness to palpation on the medial joint line of both knees. No significant swelling. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience and cooperation. Now, let’s discuss the findings and what we can do next. I see you don't have a recent primary care record on file. Do you mind if I ask a few questions to gather some more information about your medical history, medications, allergies, and family history?
PATIENT: Oh, no, that’s fine. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, decades, as I’ve said. So, I wouldn’t expect there to be any records on file. Just ask me whatever you need to know, Doctor. I’ll do my best to answer truthfully. I’m a bit worried about it, to be honest. All these questions… it makes me feel like I’m being interrogated. But I understand you need to know these things, to help me. So, go ahead. Ask me anything. I’ll try not to get too flustered. Just tell me slowly, please. And if I forget something, just remind me. I'm a bit old, you see. My memory isn't what it used to be. But I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verrall. I understand. We’ll take our time, and I'll be happy to repeat any questions if needed. Let’s start with allergies. Have you ever had any allergic reactions to medications, foods, insect bites, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don't think so. I've never had any serious allergic reactions, as far as I can remember. I might get a bit of a runny nose in the springtime, but that’s just hay fever, I think. And sometimes my skin gets a bit itchy, especially after gardening. But that’s probably just the plants, or the sun. I don't get hives, or swelling, or difficulty breathing. Nothing like that. I don't think I've ever had to go to the hospital for an allergic reaction. I don't think I'm allergic to anything, really. Just dust, maybe? I sneeze a lot. But that's not a serious allergy, is it? Is it? I’m not very good with medical terms, you see. But I don't think I have any allergies. Nothing serious, anyway. My daughter is always telling me to be careful with food, but I eat whatever she puts in front of me. She worries too much, I think. But she's a good girl. Just ask her.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. Next, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t taken any regular medications for… well, decades, as I've said. Sometimes I take a painkiller for my knees, if they're bothering me. Just something simple, you can get it at the pharmacy. Paracetamol, I think it’s called. But that’s it. I used to take something for my stomach, years ago, but I stopped that a long time ago. I don't like relying on medication, if I can help it. I prefer to eat well and get enough rest. And I try to stay active, even though it’s getting harder these days. No, I’m not taking anything regularly. Just the occasional painkiller for my knees. And… I think that’s it. My daughter keeps telling me to take vitamins, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. She worries too much, I think. But she's a good girl. Just ask her. She'll tell you all about it. She’s very organized, that one. Always telling me what I should be doing. But she means well.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional Paracetamol for knee pain. And no other regular medications. Next, let’s discuss your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, asthma, or cancer?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… hmm. Let me think. No, not really. I haven’t been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions, as far as I know. I think my blood pressure might be a bit high, you said? But I haven’t had it checked in… well, decades, as I’ve said. I don’t have diabetes, as far as I know. My stomach used to bother me, years ago, but it’s been fine for a long time. I haven’t had any problems with my heart, as far as I know. And I haven’t had cancer, thank goodness. I used to be a bit worried about it, but I haven’t had any problems. No, I don’t have any chronic conditions, as far as I know. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. I worked a lot, traveling around for my job. And I ate well, mostly. And I tried to stay active. But I’m getting older now, and things are starting to ache a bit. But I don’t have any serious medical conditions, as far as I know. Is that what you want to know? I hope I’m not forgetting anything. My memory isn’t what it used to be. But I’m doing my best. Just ask me if you need me to repeat something. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known chronic conditions. Next, I'd like to ask about your past surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Not many, really. I had my tonsils out when I was a boy. A long, long time ago. That’s about it, I think. Maybe I broke my arm once, when I was a child, but I don’t remember having surgery for it. Just a cast, I think. No, I haven’t had any serious surgeries, as far as I know. Just my tonsils, a long, long time ago. It was a routine procedure, I think. They just took them out. I don’t remember it being very painful. I was just a child, after all. No, I haven’t had any other surgeries, as far as I know. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I haven’t had to go to the hospital for anything serious. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. But I’m getting older now, and things are starting to ache a bit. But I haven’t had any serious surgeries, as far as I know. Is that what you want to know? I hope I’m not forgetting anything. My memory isn’t what it used to be. But I’m doing my best. Just ask me if you need me to repeat something. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy in childhood. Next, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a tricky one. My family… well, we’re Kurdish, you see. And we come from a small village. It was a long time ago. Things weren't… recorded much back then. I know my father… he was a strong man, but he died young. Something with his heart, I think. But I don't remember the details. My mother lived a long life, but she had… arthritis, I think. Bad joints, she always complained about them. I have a sister, she’s still alive, but we don’t see each other much. She lives in… somewhere far away. I don’t really know about her health. And that’s about all the family I have, really. I don’t remember anyone else having any… serious illnesses. Nothing that I can recall, anyway. It’s a long time ago, and we didn't talk about these things much. It’s a bit of a shame, I suppose. No, I don't know of any significant medical conditions that run in my family. Just my father’s heart and my mother’s arthritis. And… that’s about it. Is that what you want to know? I hope I’m not forgetting anything. My memory isn’t what it used to be. But I’m doing my best. Just ask me if you need me to repeat something. I’m ready when you are. I'm really not sure about this, Doctor. Things were so different back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, no. I don’t do any of those things. Never have. My father didn't approve, and I… well, I just never got into it. Smoking is terrible for you, and alcohol… well, I just don't like it. It makes me feel sick. And drugs… no, absolutely not. I've always been a healthy man, I think. I eat well… mostly. And I try to get enough sleep. Though it's getting harder these days. I used to walk a lot for my job, like I said. But now I don't get out as much. A bit of gardening, that's about it. I worry a little about that, actually. Not being as active as I used to be. Does that make sense? No, I don't smoke, drink, or use drugs. Never have. I've always been a sensible man, I think. I try to take care of myself. It's important to stay healthy, you see. Especially now. But I’m getting older, and things are starting to ache a bit. But I don't smoke, drink, or use drugs. Never have. Is that what you want to know? I hope I’m not forgetting anything. My memory isn’t what it used to be. But I’m doing my best. Just ask me if you need me to repeat something. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. One final question for now, Mr. Verrall. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t taken any regular medications for… well, decades, as I've said. Sometimes I take a painkiller for my knees, if they're bothering me. Just something simple, you can get it at the pharmacy. Paracetamol, I think it’s called. But that’s it. I used to take something for my stomach, years ago, but I stopped that a long time ago. I don't like relying on medication, if I can help it. I prefer to eat well and get enough rest. And I try to stay active, even though it’s getting harder these days. No, I’m not taking anything regularly. Just the occasional painkiller for my knees. And… I think that’s it. My daughter keeps telling me to take vitamins, but I haven’t gotten around to it yet. She worries too much, I think. But she's a good girl. Just ask her. She’ll tell you all about it. She’s very organized, that one. Always telling me what I should be doing. But she means well. No vitamins, no supplements, just the occasional painkiller. Is that what you wanted to know? I hope I haven't forgotten anything. My memory isn’t what it used to be. But I’m doing my best. Just ask me if you need me to repeat something. I'm ready when you are. I think I've answered everything you've asked me.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Verrall, I think you’ve answered everything very thoroughly. Thank you for your patience and honesty. Now, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re generally in good health for your age. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which we’ll need to monitor. You have some crepitus and tenderness in your knees, likely due to osteoarthritis. Before we discuss a plan, I’d like to order some blood work to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. This will include a complete blood count, a chemistry panel to check your kidney and liver function, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… hmm. That sounds… complicated. I don't really like needles, you see. I've never been very good with medical procedures. But… if it's important, then I suppose I can do it. I want to make sure everything is okay, for my daughter’s sake. She’s the one who wanted me to come here, you see. She worries too much, but she means well. So, yes, if you think it’s important, then I can do the blood work. Where will I have to go? And how long will it take? And will it hurt a lot? I don't want to cause a fuss. I just want to get this over with, and make sure everything is okay. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Do I need to fast, or anything like that? I hope it won't be too unpleasant. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest. But I’m willing to do whatever it takes, for my daughter’s sake. Just tell me what I need to do. I'm ready when you are. But please be gentle.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Verrall. It's perfectly normal to feel nervous about needles. The blood draw itself is usually quick and relatively painless. You’ll feel a brief pinch, but it shouldn’t hurt a lot. We can have the blood work done right here in the clinic. It will take about 15-20 minutes. And yes, you do need to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. I’ll give you a requisition form with detailed instructions. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Eight to twelve hours… hmm. That means I can’t have any breakfast? Or lunch? Or dinner? That’s going to be difficult. I get very hungry, you see. But… if it’s important, then I suppose I can manage. I’ll just have to plan ahead. And a follow-up appointment in a week? That sounds… good. I’ll make sure to clear my schedule. I don’t want to miss it. I want to get this over with, and make sure everything is okay. So, yes, I can fast for eight to twelve hours, and I can schedule a follow-up appointment in a week. Just give me the requisition form, and I’ll do whatever you need me to do. Is there anything else I need to know? Anything I need to prepare? I don’t want to cause a fuss. I just want to get this over with, and make sure everything is okay. Is there a specific time I need to come in for the blood work? I hope it won't be too unpleasant. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest. But I’m willing to do whatever it takes, for my daughter’s sake. Just tell me what I need to do. I’m ready when you are. But please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, here’s the requisition form and these instructions. You can come in any time tomorrow morning for the blood draw, but it’s best to schedule it for first thing, before you have a chance to eat. Our lab opens at 8:00 AM. You can call that number to schedule an appointment. It shouldn't take long. I understand you're nervous, Mr. Verrall. I'll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle and efficient. And I'll be here to discuss the results with you next week. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I think that’s everything. I just… I hope it won’t be too painful. And I hope the results are okay. I want to make sure everything is okay, for my daughter’s sake. She’s been so worried about this. She’s the one who wanted me to come here, you see. She’s a good girl. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for your patience. And thank you for being so kind. I appreciate it very much. I think… I think that’s all. I’ll call that number to schedule the appointment. And I’ll try to fast for eight to twelve hours. And I’ll come back next week to discuss the results. Is there anything else I need to do? Anything else I need to know? I just want to make sure everything is okay. I think… I think I'm ready to go now. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verrall. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions before your appointment. We’ll do everything we can to make sure you feel comfortable and informed. And please, try not to worry too much. We’re just taking a precautionary step. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you next week. The receptionist is just outside, she can help you schedule your blood work.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’ll go and see the receptionist now. And I’ll schedule the blood work. And I’ll try not to worry too much. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: .
