DOCTOR: Right, Annelle Durig. Seventy-seven years young. Good morning. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor… Burligham, is it? Yes, well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. My skin… it’s turned rather yellow. A friend mentioned something about the liver, and… well, I thought I best come and have it looked at. It’s quite unsettling, you see. I don’t recall ever feeling… this color before.
DOCTOR: Yes, Burlingham. And unsettling is a good word for it. Yellowing of the skin… that is something we need to investigate. It could be a number of things, and your friend isn't entirely wrong to think of the liver, but let's not jump to conclusions. Now, when did you first notice this yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It’s… honestly, it’s a bit foggy. Perhaps… a few weeks now? It came on so gradually, I didn’t pay much attention at first. I thought it might be the lighting, or… well, I truly can’t say precisely. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you understand. It feels like a long time, though. Definitely before July, I believe. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: A few weeks… before July. That’s… something to work with. And it's perfectly alright that your memory isn't precise, Mrs. Durig. We’ll piece it together. Has the yellowing gotten worse over those few weeks, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Oh, it has gotten worse, I think. Yes. Definitely more noticeable now than it was. People have started… commenting. It’s not a dramatic change each day, mind you, but… well, looking in the mirror is rather alarming, to be frank. And I feel… tired. Very tired, even after a full night’s sleep. I don’t know if that’s connected, but… it’s a new feeling.
DOCTOR: Tiredness… and worsening yellowing. Right. And you say it’s just you who’s noticed, or have others commented specifically on the color of your skin?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, others have noticed. My neighbor, Mrs. Abernathy, she said I looked “peachy” the other day. Not a compliment, I assure you. And the cashier at the market, he gave me a rather concerned look. It’s… embarrassing, truly. I try not to dwell on it, but it’s hard to ignore when people stare. I suppose that’s why I came, Doctor. I wanted to know what it is, and if it’s… serious.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “peachy” isn't exactly the clinical description we’re looking for. But it confirms the observation. Okay, Mrs. Durig, I'm going to need to ask you a few more questions, then I’ll need to do a quick physical exam. Have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool?
PATIENT: Oh… changes? Let me see. I… honestly, I haven’t paid much attention to those things. I suppose not. Everything seems normal in that regard. Though, now that you mention it… perhaps my stool has been a bit… paler than usual. But I always have trouble remembering such details. It’s not something I actively observe, if you understand. I’m an old woman, Doctor, not a… a detective. Is that a helpful answer?
DOCTOR: Pale stools… alright. And you've mentioned tiredness, and yellowing of the skin. Let's go through some other things. Do you have any pain in your abdomen, Mrs. Durig?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not really. Perhaps a little discomfort sometimes after eating, but nothing… significant. Just the normal aches and pains of getting older, I suspect. It’s never sharp or sudden, just… a dull feeling. And it doesn’t last long. Mostly, I just feel… weak. And rather anxious, if I’m being honest. This whole situation is quite unsettling, you understand.
DOCTOR: Anxiety is understandable, Mrs. Durig. Right. Weakness, tiredness, no pain… Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a difficult question. I’ve been to so many doctors over the years… I had… something with my gallbladder, many years ago. They removed it, I think. And I’ve always had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, it goes up and down. And… I believe I had the flu rather badly a few years back. But beyond that… I’m afraid my memory is failing me. I truly don’t recall anything serious. Is that helpful? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, fluctuating blood pressure… alright. I’m looking at your EHR now, and it confirms the gallbladder removal in 1998. And it does show some records of hypertension, but it's not been consistently managed. Do you take any medications currently, Mrs. Durig?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. Just a little pill for my blood pressure, occasionally. When I remember, that is. My daughter brings me a bottle, but I’m not very good at keeping track. It's a small white pill, I think. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it flares up, but that's just over-the-counter. Nothing regularly, really. I don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. They make me feel… unwell.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional blood pressure medication, over-the-counter arthritis relief… and you said you don't like taking pills. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no allergies that I’m aware of. Never had any trouble with medications, as far as I remember. No food allergies either. I eat pretty much everything. Though, I don't eat much red meat anymore. It doesn't sit well with me. But that’s a preference, not an allergy. Is there anything else you need to know, Doctor? I’m starting to feel a little… overwhelmed. This is a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: It is a lot of questions, Mrs. Durig, and I apologize for that. I just need to get a full picture. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll feel your abdomen. It won't be painful, just a quick check. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. A quick check is perfectly alright. I understand you need to do your job. Though, please be gentle. My ribs are rather… delicate these days. And… if you could explain what you’re doing as you go, that would be appreciated. It helps me feel… less anxious, you see. It’s the uncertainty that bothers me most, I think.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be very gentle, and I'll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds a bit… irregular. Not alarmingly so, but it warrants further investigation. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Just tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Hmm. There’s some tenderness here, in your upper right side. And I feel a slight… enlargement. It's subtle, but it’s something I need to note. The rest of your abdomen feels relatively normal. Okay, that’s a quick check.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Irregular heart… and tenderness in my side? That doesn't sound good, does it? I always suspected something was wrong. My daughter kept telling me to come to the doctor, but I put it off. I don’t like doctors, you see. Too much poking and prodding. What does it mean, Doctor? Is it serious? You can be honest with me. I'm an old woman, I’ve lived a long life. But I still want to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Durig, it's good you came in now. The tenderness in your upper right side, combined with the yellowing of your skin and the irregular heartbeat, is concerning. It could be a number of things, but it's strongly suggestive of a problem with your liver or gallbladder. Now, I'm not going to jump to conclusions, but we need to run some tests to determine exactly what’s going on. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a liver function panel, and an ultrasound of your abdomen. The ultrasound will give us a better look at your liver and gallbladder. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Liver… gallbladder? Tests? It all sounds so… frightening. Ultrasound… is that painful? Will it involve more poking and prodding? I… I’m not sure I understand all of this, Doctor. Liver function… what does that even mean? And if it is something serious… what are my options? I'm an old woman, you see. I don’t want to go through a lot of complicated treatments. I just want to feel better. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Durig, let me explain this in simpler terms. Your liver is an important organ that helps your body digest food and remove toxins. When something is wrong with your liver, it can cause symptoms like yellowing of the skin and tiredness. The tests I’m ordering will help us figure out what’s happening with your liver. The ultrasound is not painful. It’s like a pregnancy scan. A technician will put some gel on your abdomen and move a wand over it to create pictures of your organs. It doesn't involve any needles or poking. Now, as for options, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We don’t even know what’s going on yet. Once we have the test results, we can discuss what the best course of action is. And I assure you, we'll take your age and overall health into consideration. I won't recommend anything that isn't absolutely necessary. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No needles… that’s… good. And no complicated treatments yet. Alright. That sounds… less frightening. I suppose. But… who will explain the results to me? I get very confused with medical jargon, you see. And my daughter… well, she means well, but she tends to panic easily. I need someone who can explain things clearly, and… calmly. Can you assure me you will do that, Doctor? And… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to be waiting for weeks, worrying myself sick. .
DOCTOR: Yes, I will personally explain the results to you, Mrs. Durig. I understand that medical jargon can be confusing, and I’ll make sure to use plain language. I’ll also be happy to answer any questions you have, and I'll take the time to make sure you understand everything. As for the results, it usually takes about 3 to 5 business days for the lab to process them. I’ll call your daughter directly once they are available, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Now, I'm going to write you a referral for the ultrasound, and I’ll give you the lab requisition. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
