DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… feeling full really quick when I eat. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Just a few bites and I feel like I’ve had a big meal. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: I see. Feeling full very quickly, regardless of the food, and it’s been happening for about a month. That’s helpful to know. Can you describe that feeling of fullness a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm… it's not painful, exactly. More like… uncomfortable. Like my stomach is telling me to stop, even though I haven’t had much. It’s a heavy feeling, I guess. And it kinda stays with me for a while after, even if it wasn't a big meal. I used to be able to put a good plate away, you know? Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, uncomfortable, heavy feeling, not painful, and it lingers even after a small amount of food. And you’ve noticed a change from being able to eat a larger meal previously. That's good information, thank you. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with this – perhaps nausea, vomiting, heartburn, weight loss, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Let me think… no vomiting, thankfully. Bit of heartburn sometimes, but I get that anyway, old age, you know? Weight… I haven't really been keeping track, to be honest. Maybe I've lost a little, but I figured that was just… getting older too. And my bowel habits are pretty normal, if you know what I mean. Nothing different there.
DOCTOR: I understand. Some heartburn that you already experience, and no significant changes in your bowel habits. And you haven’t noticed any unintentional weight loss beyond what might be expected with age. To get a better picture of what might be going on, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major, thankfully. Had my appendix out when I was a kid, that’s about it. High blood pressure for a bit, the doctor put me on some pills for it years ago, but I stopped taking ‘em, didn’t like how they made me feel. I’ve been okay since, haven't bothered with it. Just the usual aches and pains for an old fella, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child, and a history of high blood pressure that was previously treated with medication, but you’ve been off of it for some time. And you experience typical age-related aches and pains. And have you had any surgeries other than your appendix removed?
PATIENT: Nope, just the appendix. Never needed anything else taken out, thankfully. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. My wife always says I'm a tough old bird. She's probably right.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My mother, she had… well, she had stomach trouble for years. Not sure what exactly, doctor wouldn’t say much back then. It was a long time ago. My father, he lived to be 90, pretty healthy for his age, I think. No real illnesses to speak of. My brother… he had diabetes, but that was later in life. Does that help? It's hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. A mother with unspecified stomach trouble, a father with good health, and a brother with late-onset diabetes. And lastly, could you tell me a little bit about your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or have any significant dietary habits?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life. Too expensive, and my father always said it was a waste of good money. I used to enjoy a bit of whiskey now and then, but I haven't had a drink in… oh, maybe 10 years? Since I retired, really. As for diet… well, I try to eat healthy. Lots of fish, we’re Haida, you know? And whatever my wife cooks. She’s a good cook, but she likes her salt.
DOCTOR: Okay, never smoked, stopped drinking alcohol 10 years ago, and a diet of mostly fish with a tendency towards salt. Now, one final question regarding your medical history. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, such as foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything. My wife tried to get me to take some allergy pills once, said I was sneezing too much during spring, but they made me drowsy, so I stopped.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr, that's very helpful information. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll gently palpate your abdomen to see if there's any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable. I'm not as spry as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Just let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I'm noticing some mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, but no significant guarding or rigidity. Your abdomen is soft overall. No masses palpated. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing early satiety, which is feeling full quickly after eating. The tenderness in your upper abdomen could be contributing to that. Several things can cause this, including gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, or gallbladder issues. Given your age and the mild tenderness, I'd like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… well, I’m not crazy about tests, but if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then go ahead. I trust you. Whatever you need to figure out what’s going on. I just want to be able to eat a normal meal again. What kind of tests are we talking about? Nothing too scary, I hope.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about tests, Mr. Obarr. I’ll keep them as minimally invasive as possible. I'd like to start with a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia. I’d also like to order a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. And finally, I’d like to get a stool sample to rule out any underlying gastrointestinal issues. These are all routine tests, and they will give us a good starting point to understand what’s causing your symptoms. The stool sample will require you to collect a small sample at home and bring it in with you on your next visit. I’ll give you detailed instructions on how to do that. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: That… that doesn't sound too bad, actually. A little bit of blood, a bit of… well, you know. And a stool sample… Alright, alright, I can do that. As long as it gets me closer to feeling normal again. What about waiting for the results? How long will that take? And will I need to come back in again?
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Mr. Obarr. It shouldn’t be too disruptive. The lab results usually take about 3 to 5 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll review them thoroughly and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. During that appointment, we'll discuss the results and develop a plan of action. Depending on what the tests show, that plan might include dietary changes, medication, or further investigation. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – if you experience severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Three to five days for the results, then another appointment. And call if things get worse. Okay. You said dietary changes… are there things I should be avoiding right now? Maybe cutting back on the salt, like my wife says?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mr. Obarr. While we wait for the results, it would be prudent to avoid foods that commonly irritate the stomach, such as spicy foods, fatty foods, and caffeine. Cutting back on salt, as your wife suggests, is also a good idea. It can help reduce bloating and discomfort. Smaller, more frequent meals can also be helpful, as opposed to large meals that might exacerbate the feeling of fullness. And staying well-hydrated is always important. These are just general recommendations, and we’ll tailor a more specific dietary plan once we have the test results. I'm going to write you a requisition for the blood work and give you the instructions for the stool sample. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we wrap up for today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Thank you. I just hope we can figure out what’s going on so I can enjoy a good meal again. That's all I want.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I understand your desire to enjoy a good meal again, and I’ll do my best to help you achieve that. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
