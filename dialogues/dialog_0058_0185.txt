DOCTOR: Alright, Zelina, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s my breath. It smells bad. Really bad. I need it fixed, and I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Smells bad.” Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: What do you mean, “more”? It smells awful! Like… old garbage, probably. My ex-husband definitely complained. A lot. Honestly, it’s just… unpleasant. Is that enough detail for you? I don’t spend my days analyzing my own breath, okay? It just is bad.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Honestly? Forever. Or at least it feels like it. Probably since… the divorce, actually. Maybe a little before. It’s not new. Look, I just want a quick fix. A mouthwash or something. I don’t need a life story about bacteria.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, it’s been ongoing for at least a few months, potentially longer. Do you notice it's worse at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes. Definitely in the morning. Like, really bad. And after I eat. Especially if it’s… anything garlicky. Which, let’s be real, is most things. I work highway maintenance, I don’t have time for delicate salads, you know? It’s usually something quick and easy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you brush your teeth regularly?
PATIENT: Of course I do! What kind of question is that? I’m not completely uncivilized. I brush them… most days. Sometimes I’m just… tired. It's a long day out there, okay? Lots of sun, dirt, you name it. And honestly, sometimes it just feels pointless. It comes back anyway.
DOCTOR: And how often would you say “most days” is?
PATIENT: Look, are you accusing me of something? I brush them when I can, alright? It’s not like I want bad breath! It’s usually… five times a week, maybe? Sometimes six. Okay, fine, sometimes it’s less. Happy now? It's not a perfect life, alright? I'm a divorced highway worker, not a toothpaste commercial.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you use floss or any other type of interdental cleaner?
PATIENT: Floss? Ugh, no. That stuff is awful. It hurts. And it takes forever. I don’t have time for that, seriously. Look, I’m dealing with potholes and traffic all day, I don’t need to be fighting tiny strings in my teeth. Just… no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Nothing major. Just… normal stuff. I get headaches sometimes, from the sun. And my back hurts, obviously. Highway work isn't exactly gentle. But nothing a doctor needs to know about, alright? Nothing serious. I'm not falling apart.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or have you recently started any new ones?
PATIENT: No. I don't take anything regularly. Maybe some ibuprofen for the headaches, but that's it. And no, I haven't started anything new. I avoid doctors and pills whenever possible, alright? It’s a whole thing. Look, I just want this breath fixed and to get back to work. Can we please hurry this up? I’m losing money sitting here.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to take a quick look in your mouth, okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just… get it over with. And try not to poke around too much. I don't have a lot of patience for this.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some plaque buildup and some inflammation of the gums. I also notice your tongue has a coating on it. It appears your breath is likely caused by bacteria in your mouth. And, frankly, your oral hygiene could use some improvement.
PATIENT: See? I told you. It’s bacteria. Now can we just get a solution? Mouthwash? Some kind of spray? Anything? I don’t need a lecture about flossing, alright? I'm a grown woman, I know how to brush my teeth. Even if I don't do it enough. Just fix the problem. Quickly. .
DOCTOR: Okay. While a mouthwash can temporarily mask the odor, it won't address the underlying cause. What you really need is a professional dental cleaning and to establish a consistent oral hygiene routine. I’m going to recommend you see a dentist as soon as possible. Here’s a list of dentists in the area who are accepting new patients. And, I'm going to be blunt, you really need to floss daily, and brush twice a day. I can also recommend a specific toothpaste with fluoride and antibacterial properties, if you’d like. But simply masking the problem won’t solve it. This is likely contributing to gingivitis, and if left untreated, can lead to more serious issues.
