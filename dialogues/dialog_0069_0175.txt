DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's my back, mostly. It's been pretty painful lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, your back. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see… It's not like a sharp pain, you know? More of a dull ache, really. It’s been going on for… oh, I’d say about a month now, maybe a little longer. It gets worse if I stand for too long or if I try to lift anything.
DOCTOR: A dull ache for about a month, worse with standing and lifting. Alright. Is the pain in a specific part of your back, or is it more widespread?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my lower back, right around here. Sometimes it feels like it radiates down my leg a little, but not always.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back, sometimes radiating down the leg. And when you say "radiate," can you describe that feeling?
PATIENT: It's not like a shooting pain, Doctor. More like… a soreness that travels down my leg. Not all the way to my foot, thankfully. Just kind of in the back of my thigh, you know? It comes and goes. Sometimes it's barely noticeable. Other times… well, that’s when it really bothers me.
DOCTOR: Alright, soreness traveling down the thigh, coming and going. That gives me a better idea. Have you noticed anything that improves the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. When I lie down, it gets better. And if my wife rubs it, that helps a lot too! Not a cure, mind you, but definitely takes the edge off.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know – lying down and your wife’s help provide some relief. Have you tried any over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen or naproxen?
PATIENT: You know, I did try some ibuprofen a couple of times, but it didn’t seem to do much. Maybe I didn’t take enough? I’m not really good with those things, to be honest. I usually try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen didn't provide much relief. I understand wanting to avoid medication. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that, Doctor. I’ve been pretty lucky so far, knock on wood. I used to have high blood pressure, but the doctor put me on some medicine years ago and it’s been under control ever since.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the one for my blood pressure. I take it every morning, has been for… oh, I think about ten years now. Nothing else, no. I try to eat fairly healthy, too. Mostly. My wife does most of the cooking, thankfully!
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication. That’s helpful. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. I’ve been pretty fortunate, honestly. I’ve always been careful about avoiding accidents, and I think that’s helped. I used to be pretty active, played basketball a lot when I was younger, but I’ve slowed down a bit these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Well, my wife and I have three grown children, all living in different states now. And… hmm, let me think. My mother had some arthritis in her knees, but that’s about it, I think. No major back problems on either side of the family as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major back problems in the family. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your work and daily activities?
PATIENT: Sure. I'm an Operations Research Analyst. Basically, I work with numbers and try to find ways to make things more efficient. It’s mostly desk work, sitting at a computer all day. I do go to meetings sometimes, but mostly it’s quiet work. I've been doing it for…oh, goodness, almost thirty years now. I retired once, but got bored and went back part-time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Operations Research Analyst, mostly desk work. That makes sense. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had any reactions to anything, thankfully. We eat pretty much everything. My wife is a wonderful cook, always trying new things. So, no, no allergies to report. Shall we get to the exam? I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Great. Yes, let's go ahead with a quick physical exam. If you don’t mind, could you lie down on your stomach for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Just let me know if I need to adjust anything. It's a little firm, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a bit firm. Thank you. Okay, I'm just going to gently feel along your spine and the muscles on either side. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender or painful. Now, can you gently bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Okay. Whoa, that’s a little uncomfortable, Doctor. It’s not a sharp pain, but definitely feels tight. It's easier to bend to the left than to the right, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. It’s tighter on the right side and bending forward is uncomfortable. Now, can you lie on your back?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. There, is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Now, I'm going to gently lift your right leg, keeping it straight. Let me know if you feel any pain radiating down your leg. And then we’ll do the left leg. Okay, and now I’m going to test your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. That… that's a little uncomfortable, Doctor. Not terrible, but I definitely feel something. Mostly in my back, but a little bit down my leg like before. Oh, that's a little startling!
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Mild ache in the back and some radiating discomfort down the leg with the straight leg raise. And you felt a slight startle with the reflexes, that’s normal. Alright, that's all the physical exam for now. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may have a lumbar strain, possibly with some mild sciatic irritation. The muscle spasms and discomfort with bending and lifting are consistent with that. However, we should rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some X-rays of your lower back to rule out any fractures or other structural problems. Would you be able to get those done at the imaging center across the street?
PATIENT: X-rays, okay. That sounds sensible. Across the street, yes, that's convenient. Yes, I can definitely do that. I don’t mind at all. Will you need me to schedule it, or can I just walk over there?
DOCTOR: You can just walk over there, they take walk-ins. They'll send the results directly to our clinic. Once we have those results, we can discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend taking it easy, avoiding heavy lifting or strenuous activity, and applying ice or heat to your lower back. Would you like a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help with the spasms?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor, if it helps. I appreciate that. I'm a bit worried about feeling drowsy, though. I still need to do some things around the house, you know? Is there a mild one you'd recommend? And yes, definitely ice and heat. My wife's already got the ice packs ready. She’s very good at taking care of me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear your wife is helping! There is a milder muscle relaxant, cyclobenzaprine, that may be a good option. It can cause some drowsiness, but it’s generally well-tolerated. I'll write you a prescription for a low dose. Also, if the pain doesn’t improve after a week or worsens, please schedule a follow-up appointment. We may need to consider an MRI to get a more detailed look at your spine. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds very reasonable, Doctor. A week, alright. And yes, an MRI if needed. I trust your judgment. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease a bit. Is there anything else I should be doing or looking out for?
DOCTOR: I'm glad I could help. As for other things, pay attention to any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet. If you experience either of those, or if you have any difficulty controlling your bladder or bowels, go to the emergency room immediately. Those could be signs of a more serious problem. Other than that, just rest, ice or heat as needed, and take the muscle relaxant as prescribed. And try to stay as active as you comfortably can, within your limitations. Here’s your prescription and a handout with instructions about lumbar strain and what to watch out for. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and patience. You've been very helpful. I really appreciate it. I’ll go get those X-rays done right away. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Way. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Get those X-rays done, and we'll go from there. Have a good day as well, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will.
