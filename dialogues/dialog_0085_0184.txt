DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Afternoon to you too, Doctor. Look here, I ain’t got all day. It’s about…well, it’s about this. It’s just… not right, you know? Sagging and all. Never used to be like this. I want it fixed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing some discomfort or change in your abdominal area, and you'd like to get to the bottom of it. “Sagging” is a good way to describe it – can you tell me a bit more about what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Discomfort? No, not discomfort. It's… unsightly! A man should have a firm belly. I used to. Worked hard all my life, pile driving, you know? Strong back, strong arms...and a flat stomach. Now look at it! It jiggles. It…hangs. That’s what I mean by sagging. It’s embarrassing! And I want it gone. No need to examine me for hours, just tell me what can be done to fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you’re feeling self-conscious about a change in your abdominal appearance, and you'd like to explore options to address it. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. Before we discuss potential solutions, could you tell me a little more about when you noticed this change?
PATIENT: When? Hmph. That’s a difficult one. It didn’t happen overnight, you know? Slowly, slowly it crept up on me. After my wife… passed, I suppose. Didn't have the same appetite, not the same drive to… keep things tight, you could say. Maybe a year or so ago I started noticing my trousers feeling a bit snug. Now… well, now it’s quite obvious. I stopped measuring things, don't need reminding of the truth. Just tell me what you can do, Doctor. Not a life story, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like this change coincided with a difficult time in your life, and you're wanting to find a solution now. It's good you're addressing this. Okay. To get a better understanding of what's going on, and to help me determine the best course of action, I'd like to ask a few questions, if that's alright. We’ll keep it brief. First, have you experienced any other changes along with this – any pain, bloating, nausea, changes in your bowel habits, or weight loss?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Bloating… sometimes, after I eat. But I eat good food, so that’s not surprising. Nausea? No, never. Bowel habits… regular enough. Weight loss… maybe a few pounds, but I’m an old man, Doctor! Things shift, you know? Always been a lean build. It’s the shape that bothers me, not the number on the scale. Look, are we getting anywhere, or am I just wasting my time? I told you, it’s the sagging! Can it be fixed, yes or no?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler, I appreciate your patience. It sounds like you're primarily concerned about the change in the shape of your abdomen, and not necessarily experiencing other significant symptoms. To clarify, when you say "sagging", is it a general looseness of the skin, or more of a bulge or protrusion?
PATIENT: Both! The skin ain't what it used to be, that’s for certain. It’s lost its…snap. And there’s…stuff pushing out. It used to be flat as a board, you could bounce a coin off it! Now it jiggles and moves when I walk. It's a disgrace! And I don’t need a lecture on the aging process, Doctor. I know I'm getting old. I want to know what can be done about it. You got those… tummy tucks, or whatever they call them? Will that fix it? Quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're describing both a loss of skin elasticity and a protrusion of abdominal tissue. A tummy tuck, or abdominoplasty, is one option, but it’s a surgical procedure and involves significant recovery time. Before we discuss that further, I'd like to do a quick physical examination to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It’ll just involve listening to your abdomen, and gently feeling it to assess the tissue and any potential underlying causes. This will help me determine if surgery is the right path, or if there are other, less invasive options we should consider first. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Examine? You want to poke at my belly? Look here, Doctor, I ain’t here for a free check-up. I want a solution, not a prodding. What other options are there? Pills? Creams? Something simple? I don't want no surgery unless absolutely necessary. Surgery is for… for folks who’ve really let themselves go. And I haven’t let myself go. Just… things shifted. Tell me about the pills. Or the creams. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Trendler. I wouldn't want to suggest anything you’re not comfortable with. Unfortunately, there aren't any pills or creams that will significantly address the underlying causes of the changes you’re describing – loss of skin elasticity and the potential for fat accumulation. Some topical creams might offer minimal improvement in skin texture, but they won’t address the deeper tissue changes. Given your concerns about surgery, let’s consider some other possibilities. Have you considered any lifestyle changes, like diet or exercise?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes? Look here, I built roads for forty years! Pile driving. That’s exercise enough for any man. And I eat good food, proper food! No fancy diets. Fish, yams, rice… everything in moderation. What good would changing my diet do, Doctor? This ain't about weight! It’s about shape. About getting rid of this…this droop. Honestly, I’m starting to think you don’t understand what I’m talking about. Just tell me, straight, can a tummy tuck fix it, yes or no? And how long would I be laid up? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I’m not explaining things clearly enough. You are right, this is about the shape and firmness of your abdomen, not necessarily your weight. A tummy tuck can address the excess skin and fat, and improve the contour of your abdomen. However, it’s a significant surgery with a recovery period of several weeks. You would likely be restricted from strenuous activity for 6-8 weeks, and there is a risk of complications, as with any surgery. Before we even consider that, I do want to rule out any other potential underlying causes, just to be safe. Would you mind if I quickly review your medical history in your chart?
PATIENT: Review my history? Look, I filled out all those forms. What else is there to know? I’m a healthy man, aside from a few aches and pains. I ain’t got no fancy diseases. Just get to the point. Can it be fixed or can’t it? And how long would I be laid up? Don’t need a long lecture, just a straight answer. I haven't got all day, you know. My garden needs tending. And I got a cricket match next week.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler. I understand your need for a straightforward answer. I've briefly reviewed your chart and I see no major medical conditions that would prevent you from considering a tummy tuck. To be absolutely thorough, and since you haven't had a recent physical, I would strongly recommend a basic blood work-up to check your overall health and ensure you're a good candidate for surgery. This would involve a simple blood draw. If those results come back satisfactory, then we can discuss the specifics of a tummy tuck, including the procedure itself, the recovery time , and the potential risks and benefits. Would you be willing to consider the blood work?
PATIENT: Blood work… Honestly, Doctor. You’re making this far more complicated than it needs to be. Fine. Blood work. But if it delays things for too long, I’m walking out of here. My garden won’t tend itself. And the cricket team needs me. Just get it over with. Where do I go? And how long will it take? Quickly, please. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler. I understand your frustration. The lab is just down the hall, room 3. It should take about 15-20 minutes. They’ll need a sample of your blood. Once the results are back – usually within 24-48 hours – we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them and whether a tummy tuck is a suitable option for you. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it done. And tell the lab to be quick. I haven’t got all day, you know? I'll be waiting. Let’s hope these results don't take too long. And get me a chair for the wait, will ya? My knees ain't what they used to be. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, sir. I'll have someone bring you a chair right away. And I'll personally ensure the lab processes your results as quickly as possible. We’ll be in touch as soon as they’re available. Thank you for your patience. .
