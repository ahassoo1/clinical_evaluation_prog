DOCTOR: Right. Dawnetta Hatchard, 73. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, honestly? It's my… output. Been happening for a bit now. Dark, you know? Like… tar. And I take those pills. For the pain. The red ones. Been on 'em for years, probably. Don't see what the fuss is about, really. Just want it sorted, if you can.
DOCTOR: "Dark output," you say. And you're taking red pills for pain… for years. Right. Let's try to be a little more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? What more specific could I be? It's dark stool! Like I said. And the pills… they’re for my arthritis. Old age, mostly. What do you need to know, exactly? I haven’t got all day, you know. My husband's waiting in the car.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, "dark stool" can mean a great many things. Is it consistently dark, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Consistently! Every time. Not a pretty sight, let me tell you. Honestly, you'd think after all these years of being a mechanic, I’d be used to… things. But this is different. It’s… internal. And those pills… they’re the only thing that keeps me moving. Don’t go changing those, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, consistently dark stools and you're concerned about the arthritis medication. Let's see… you’re taking… naproxen, 500mg twice daily. And you've been on this for… a long time. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Good heavens, no! Just… dark. Like coffee grounds, almost. And I told you, I don't want to stop the naproxen! It’s the only thing that lets me tinker in the garage with Harold. He'd have a fit if I couldn't keep up with him. Honestly, doctors these days… always wanting to take things away.
DOCTOR: Right. No blood. Just dark, coffee-ground-like stool. And you're very attached to the naproxen. Okay. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? My husband keeps complaining I'm slower at weeding the garden, but that's just getting old, isn’t it? I'm not a spring chicken, you know. And I've been a bit tired, I suppose. But who isn't at my age? Honestly, is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Tiredness is… common. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just a listen to your abdomen and a quick check of your stool. It'll be quick.
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke around? Honestly. Fine. Get it over with. But I'm warning you, I bruise easily. And if you tell me to stop the naproxen, I'm walking out. Just… hurry up. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Abdomen is… soft. No tenderness. Stool is… dark, as you described. Melena, to be precise. Which indicates digested blood. This is concerning. And yes, it does relate to the naproxen. It's a common side effect. Now, I'm not saying you need to stop it immediately, but we need to investigate further. We need a CBC, a CMP, and a stool occult blood test. And I strongly recommend a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: Colonoscopy?! Absolutely not! Digested blood? What are you trying to tell me? I've been taking those pills for years and I've been perfectly fine! A colonoscopy sounds… invasive. And expensive. And I don't need poking around where the sun don't shine. No. Absolutely not. I'll just… take less of the pills. That's what I'll do. Problem solved.
DOCTOR: Taking less of the pills is… not a solution. It won't address the bleeding, and could lead to other complications. Look, I understand your reluctance, but this isn't something we can ignore. The bleeding could be serious. I strongly advise you reconsider the colonoscopy. We can discuss your concerns, find a good facility, and even arrange for sedation. But we need to find out what's causing this. Do you have any family history of colon cancer or gastrointestinal issues?
PATIENT: Gastrointestinal issues? My Uncle Bohdan had… something. Years ago. Constipation, I think. But he smoked like a chimney and drank too much plum brandy. Didn't help himself, that one. As for colon cancer… I don't recall. Honestly, family history is all gossip and exaggeration. Look, I'm not having any of this poking and prodding. I’ll just cut back on the naproxen and see if it improves. I'm a practical woman, and I'm perfectly capable of managing my own health. Are we finished here? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Alright. I've documented your refusal of the colonoscopy and your plan to reduce naproxen dosage. However, I strongly urge you to reconsider. If you experience any dizziness, weakness, or significant changes in stool color or consistency, you must seek immediate medical attention. I’m going to order the CBC and CMP, just as a baseline. I also recommend following up with me in one week to reassess. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Tests and a follow-up. Fine. Just… get me the results quickly, alright? And don't bother calling about the colonoscopy. I've made my position clear. Now, if you'll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab results will be available within a few days. Have a… good day. .
