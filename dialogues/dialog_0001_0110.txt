DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McNabb, good to meet you... I think. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Pehrson. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’m here because I feel…stuck. Like an old engine that needs a good tune-up, you know? I’m 87 years old, and I’ve lived a good life, but lately, I just haven't felt like myself. I'm hoping for a bit of a reset, a jumpstart, if you will. I want to feel…brighter, I suppose. Is that making any sense?
DOCTOR: "Brighter"... Right. Okay. “Stuck” and “not yourself” could mean a lot of things at your age. Let’s try to narrow it down. Are we talking physical…slowness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. Physical is a good place to start. It’s not that I can’t do things, you understand. I still manage my little garden, and I try to walk a bit each day. But it takes…effort. More effort than it used to. And I tire so easily. It’s not a pain, exactly, just…a wearing down. I used to have so much more energy. Do you follow me, Doctor? I hope I’m not rambling.
DOCTOR: Rambling is…common. Okay, so fatigue and increased effort with activity. And no pain?
PATIENT: No, not pain, dear. Not really. Sometimes my joints ache a little, especially when the weather changes – a bit of a familiar story for someone my age, I suspect! But it’s not a sharp pain, more of a…stiffness. It’s the effort that bothers me more than anything. Even simple things, like getting up from a chair, feel like a small undertaking these days. It's just… draining, Doctor. I feel like I spend a lot of time recovering.
DOCTOR: Right. So, age-related stiffness, fatigue... Look, Ms. McNabb, at 87, some slowing down is…to be expected. Have you had any falls recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no, thankfully no falls. I’m very careful, you see. My son worries about me, bless his heart, but I'm quite steady on my feet. I do sometimes feel a little…off-balance, like I might stumble, but I always manage to catch myself. It’s more of a worry than a problem, if that makes sense. I don’t want to end up like my sister, poor thing – she broke her hip last year. That’s why I’m here, really – to prevent things, if possible. Not just fix them.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Prevent.” Right. Any changes in your diet or appetite?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it, my appetite hasn’t been quite the same lately. I used to enjoy cooking, really enjoy it. Chamorro food, you know—lots of rice, delicious meats… but now, I don’t seem to have the same enthusiasm. I still eat, of course, but not with the same gusto. It’s not that things taste bad, I just… don’t feel hungry as much. And sometimes, I forget to eat altogether! My son has been bringing me meals, which is very kind of him, but it feels…like a chore, you know? It’s not a joy like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Loss of appetite, decreased enjoyment of food... Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my sleep hasn't been the best. I used to sleep like a log, but now… I wake up quite a bit during the night. Sometimes just because I’m thirsty, sometimes just…because I’m awake. I don’t necessarily feel tired, just…restless. I'll get up and read for a bit, and then try to go back to sleep. It’s not every night, mind you, but it happens often enough to be bothersome. And I don’t seem to sleep as deeply as I used to. I wake up feeling…not refreshed, exactly. Just…old. Is that a terrible thing to say, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, it's not terrible. It’s...realistic. Okay, restless sleep, waking up not refreshed, loss of appetite... It could be a lot of things. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please, do. I hope I'm not too much trouble. It does take a bit of effort, you see. I'm not as spry as I used to be. Just let me know if I need to hold onto something.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are a little quiet, lungs sound a bit…reduced. Joints are creaky, as expected. Blood pressure is 140/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Noted mild edema in both ankles. Alright, Ms. McNabb. Everything seems…within the range of expected for your age, but let's get some blood work done, just to rule things out. We'll check your thyroid, vitamin levels, and a complete blood count. Also, a basic metabolic panel.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Blood work, you say? Is that a lot of poking and prodding? I'm not afraid of needles, exactly, but I don’t enjoy them either. And what exactly are we “ruling out”? Is it something serious? I apologize for all the questions, but I do like to understand what's happening. It helps me feel… less anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard panel. A few vials. We're just looking for common deficiencies, things that can cause fatigue and weakness. Things like low vitamin D, thyroid issues, anemia… It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but it’s best to be thorough. Here's the order for the lab. They'll call you when they're ready. I'll have the results sent to me, and we can discuss them next week. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you. So, next week. And it’s just to… rule things out. You don't suspect anything particular, do you? I don’t mean to pry, dear, but I would like to have a little peace of mind. It’s just that, well, my sister… she wasn’t feeling well for a long time before they found… well, never mind. It’s probably nothing. But it’s good to know, isn’t it? Better to be safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. McNabb, at 87, a little fatigue is… common. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything. We're doing the blood work to be cautious, not because I suspect something specific. Honestly, it's probably just age. But we have to rule out the easy things first. Do you have any other concerns before I let you go?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. You’re right, it’s probably just…age. It’s just difficult to accept, you know? I used to be so active, so full of energy. And now…well. I suppose I just want to feel like myself again, even if “myself” isn’t quite the same as she used to be. No, I don’t think I have any other concerns at the moment. Just…thank you for listening, dear. And for being thorough. That’s all I ask. I'll go get the blood work done, and I'll see you next week.
