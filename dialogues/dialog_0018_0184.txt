DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Stilaire. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get on with it. It's this… this look of mine. I see it in the mirror, and frankly, it’s upsetting. It's… saggin'. Everything is saggin', and it’s not a good sight. I want it fixed. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. You’re concerned about some changes you’ve noticed in your appearance, specifically some sagging. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to address concerns about your health and well-being, and I assure you, we’ll do our best to figure out what's going on. To help me understand better, could you tell me when you first noticed these changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, now… that’s a hard one. Things don’t just happen overnight, you know? I suppose… maybe a year or so ago. It wasn’t sudden, like a fall or anything. Just… gradually. I used to have a bit more… shape. Now it's all… droopin'. And it’s gettin’ worse, I can tell ya that for free. Don't need no doctor to tell me that.
DOCTOR: A gradual change over the past year, with a noticeable increase in… looseness of the tissues, as you describe it. I appreciate you being so specific, Mr. Trendler. And you're right to pay attention to changes in your body. Now, has this been accompanied by any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? What kinda changes you mean? I ain't been sick, if that's what you're askin’. I still get up and do my work, pile drivin’ ain’t easy, you know. No aches or pains specifically from this… saggin’. Just… unhappy with how I look. Is that a change enough for ya? Lookin' in the mirror ain't been a pleasure lately. I eat regular, mostly. And sleep… when I can. This old body don't always cooperate.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. You’re not experiencing any pain or illness associated with these changes, but you are understandably bothered by the cosmetic aspect. That is certainly a valid concern, and it's good you brought it to my attention. To get a more complete picture, let me ask a few questions about your general health. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Now that you mention it… maybe a little. But I ain't been weighin' myself regular, like. Used to be a solid man, you know? Now... well, the clothes feel a bit looser, that's for sure. But I put that down to… age, mostly. I ain’t a young buck anymore. I haven’t been tryin' to lose weight, if that’s what you mean. Still eat a good plate of food, most days. Don’t go starvin’ myself, not me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Trendler. That’s helpful to know. Unintentional weight loss, even a little, can sometimes be a clue to underlying issues. Now, could you tell me about your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? It's alright. Not like I'm starvin' or nothin'. I eat when I'm hungry. Maybe not as much as I used to, but who does when you get to be my age? I don't turn down a good meal, that’s for sure. I like my food, always have. It's just... it don't seem to stick with me like it used to. But I eat enough, believe me. Enough to keep me goin' for a hard day's work. Don't need no fancy diets or nothin'. Plain food is good enough for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so appetite is generally good, though perhaps a slight decrease, and you haven’t noticed a significant loss of interest in food. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Hmph. Not really. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure years ago, but the doctor gave me some pills and it's been alright ever since. That was… oh, must be fifteen years ago now. Besides that, nothin'. I’ve always been a strong man, kept myself goin'. I don’t go to doctors much, never liked ‘em much, to be honest. I’ve always believed in just toughin’ things out. But this… this saggin' is somethin' else. It ain't somethin' I can just ignore.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Trendler. So, a history of high blood pressure, but currently well-controlled with medication. That’s good. And I understand your reluctance to come to the doctor, but I’m glad you did in this instance. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the pills for the blood pressure. That's it. I don't go for all them fancy vitamins and supplements. Seems like a waste of money, if you ask me. My wife used to take all sorts of things, but I never saw much good come of it. Plain food and hard work is all you need, that’s what I always say. I take the blood pressure pills regular, though. Don't mess with that. But no other potions or anything, no. Just the one thing. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the blood pressure medication. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? Well… my mother lived to be a good age, but she had trouble with her joints in her later years. Real bad arthritis. And my father… he had heart trouble, I think. Died when I was still a young man, so I don't remember much about it. But there was always talk of heart problems on his side of the family. And my brother… he had diabetes. But other than that, nothin' I can really recall. It's been a long time, you know? And we weren't much for talkin' about our ailments back then. Tough it out, that was the motto.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Trendler. That’s helpful information. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I work. Hard. Pile drivin' ain't no sittin' job, let me tell ya. Gets me up and movin', that's for sure. I don't drink much, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. And I don't smoke. Never liked it. Used to be a bit of a fisherman back in the day, but I don't get out much anymore. Too busy workin'. And after a long day of pile drivin', I mostly just like to relax. Sit in my chair and watch the TV. Simple as that. Not much excitement in my life these days. It's a workin' man's life, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a physically demanding job, minimal alcohol consumption, and no smoking. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Have you had any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, nothin' I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin'. I eat most things, and I've taken pills when I needed to. My wife used to worry about all sorts of things, but I always told her I was as tough as an old boot. Never had a problem with allergies, not a single one. I can't remember ever bein' sick enough to worry about it, to be honest. Simple man, simple life. Not much to be allergic to, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, Mr. Trendler, I would like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Alright, get on with it then. But don't take all day, I got work to do. And don’t go pokin' and proddin' too much. I ain't made of glass, you know. Just tell me what you find, and let's get this over with. I got a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I'll be as efficient as possible. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your skin and assess the areas you're concerned about. Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs detected. Your lungs are clear, with normal breath sounds. Now, let's take a look at your skin. I'm noting some decreased elasticity and mild looseness of the skin in your upper arms and abdomen. It appears there is a loss of subcutaneous fat as well. Is there any pain or tenderness in these areas when I touch them?
PATIENT: No pain. Not really. Just... feels loose, like an old bag. Like the stuff underneath is all gone. You said somethin' about fat? I ain't been starvin' myself, I tell ya. I eat a good meal when it's put in front of me. But it don't seem to stick like it used to. It just... hangs there. Like a deflated balloon. And it's gettin' worse. Feels like somethin' is missin' underneath. It just ain't right. You see what I mean? Just look at it. It's saggin', and it’s ugly. That’s all I know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. You’re experiencing a loss of skin elasticity and a decrease in subcutaneous fat, resulting in a sagging appearance. It sounds like you’ve noticed a significant change, and it’s understandably concerning. I’m also noting some mild reduction in muscle mass in your upper arms and legs. Have you noticed any difficulty with activities that require strength, such as lifting or climbing stairs?
PATIENT: Difficulty? Well, now that you mention it… I get a bit more tired after a long day of pile drivin' than I used to. It takes a bit longer to recover, if you know what I mean. And I ain't as quick as I used to be, that's for sure. But I put that down to age, mostly. I'm not a young man anymore. But I still get the job done. I can still swing the hammer, but it takes a bit more effort. And my muscles ache a bit more afterwards. But I ain't complainin'. I just push through it. A workin' man's gotta work, right? But you're right, it ain't as easy as it used to be. Everything feels a bit heavier, a bit harder. Like I'm carryin' an extra load.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Trendler. That’s helpful information. Based on the physical exam and the history you’ve provided, it appears you’re experiencing some age-related changes, including loss of subcutaneous fat and muscle mass, which is contributing to the sagging appearance. It's common for these changes to occur with age, and there are several factors that can contribute to them, including genetics, diet, activity level, and overall health. It doesn't necessarily indicate any underlying medical condition, but it’s important to rule out any potential contributing factors. Before we discuss potential options, I would like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and complete blood count. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Hmph. More pokin' and proddin'. I don't like the sound of that. But... alright. If you think it's necessary, go ahead. But don't keep me all day. I got work to do, you know. Just get it over with quickly. And tell me what you find, plain and simple. No fancy doctor talk, alright? Just the facts. I ain't got time for nothin' else. And if it ain't nothin' serious, I don't want to waste my time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I will keep it as quick and efficient as possible, and I promise to explain the results in plain language, without any unnecessary medical jargon. I'll have the lab technician draw the samples today, and the results should be back in a few days. Once I have the results, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and explore potential options. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a healthy diet rich in protein and continuing to stay physically active as much as you are able. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? Nah. Not really. Just tell me when I can come back to get the results. And make it quick. I don’t wanna be wastin’ my time runnin’ back and forth to the doctor. I got a job to do. Just call me when you got somethin’ to tell me. Plain and simple. That's all I want. Alright then. Let's get this over with. I got work to do.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Trendler. I’ll have my assistant schedule the blood draw for you now, and we will be in touch as soon as the results are available. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then.
