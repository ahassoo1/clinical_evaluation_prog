DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. Welcome. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Batara. Well, it's...it's been hard to, uh, go to the bathroom lately. Like, I feel like I have to go, but not much comes out. It's been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so. It's a bit embarrassing to talk about, honestly.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. A month, give or take. It’s not every day, but most days I have trouble. It feels like...like somethin's blockin' it, you know? Not pain, exactly, just...stuck. I have to really strain. It’s gettin' worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you do go, is it a complete emptying, or do you feel like you still need to go afterward?
PATIENT: Hmm...that's a good question. No, it's not complete. I always feel like there’s still some left in there, even after I’ve tried. It's...uncomfortable. I have to go back again pretty soon after, you know? It’s not a good feelin'. It keeps me up at night sometimes, too, havin' to get up and try again.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any changes in your stool itself?
PATIENT: Changes in…my stool? Oh. Uh…well, it’s…normal color, I think. Nothin’ real different there. Maybe a little thinner than usual, sometimes. And it’s…harder, I guess. Not like rocks, but not soft either. Just…not like it used to be. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explainin' things like this.
DOCTOR: It makes sense, Mr. Hilber. You’re doing fine. Thinner and harder… and you said it’s been going on for a month, with the feeling of incomplete emptying and increased frequency. Any blood in the stool, or around the rectum?
PATIENT: Blood? No, ma’am, not that I’ve seen. I always check, you know, just to be sure. Nothin’ like that. Just…the trouble gettin’ it all out. It’s just…worryin’ me. My wife, she always took care of these things. Now…well, it's just me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's get a better picture of things. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. I hadn’t really thought about it. I…I don’t think so. I eat about the same as always. Maybe I haven’t been as hungry lately, but I figured that was just…bein’ older, you know? I haven’t weighed myself in a while, though. To be honest, I don’t really pay much attention to that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any abdominal pain, bloating, or nausea?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain, no bloatin’. Maybe a little…uncomfortable feelin’ in my belly sometimes, but nothin’ bad. Not like a hurtin’ feelin’, just…full, maybe? And no, no sickness. I haven’t thrown up or anything like that. It’s just this trouble with the bathroom. It’s mostly that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my diet? No, not really. I eat mostly the same things I always have. Fish, a little bit of meat, some vegetables when I can get 'em. I haven’t been tryin’ any new foods or anything. I like my simple meals, you know? Keeps things easy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history…well, I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Had the usual childhood things, measles and such. I had my prostate checked a few years back, and the doctor said it was fine. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regular, but nothin’ major ever came up. My wife always handled the details, rememberin' dates and stuff. I'm sorry, I'm not much help with that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…let me think… Oh! Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was a long time ago, though. Must be fifty years or more. Other than that, no, nothin’ else. Just the appendix. That’s all I can remember.
DOCTOR: And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother, she had trouble with her stomach sometimes, but I don't know what it was. My father, he was a strong man, never sick a day in his life. My wife's mother, she had…arthritis, I think. But nobody really talked about illnesses much, you know? We just…dealt with things as they came.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Hilber, given your symptoms – the difficulty with bowel movements, the feeling of incomplete emptying, and the changes in stool consistency – and your age, we need to rule out a few things. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'll start with your abdomen, and then a digital rectal exam. It's not pleasant, but it's necessary to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A…a rectal exam? Well, I…I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I just…I don’t really like doctors pokin’ around in there, if you know what I mean. But if it will help, then yes, alright. Just…be gentle, please?
DOCTOR: Alright. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lie down on your back on the examination table. I'll need you to bend your knees and relax. I'm going to listen to your abdomen first, then I'll palpate it to check for any tenderness or masses. After that, we’ll do the rectal exam. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. I understand. Listen…and…and poke. And then…the other thing. I’ll try to relax. It’s just…a little embarrassing, you know? But I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. Just breathe normally. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Normal bowel sounds, although a bit sluggish. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Let me know immediately if you feel any pain. No significant tenderness to palpation, although it’s a bit firm overall. Now, we’ll proceed with the rectal exam. Please let me know if anything is uncomfortable. You have decreased tone. I am palpating for masses or irregularities… nothing immediately concerning. I am noting some stool present. Alright. I didn’t find anything alarming during the exam, but given your history and symptoms, I'd like to order a stool test to check for blood and infection. I also recommend a colonoscopy to rule out any polyps or other abnormalities in the colon.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Oh dear. That sounds…intense. Is that really necessary? I mean, you didn’t find anything alarming, you said. Is there…another way? I've heard those can be…unpleasant. And…and expensive.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hilber, I understand your concerns. A colonoscopy is the most thorough way to examine the colon and rule out any serious issues. While the exam itself isn’t pleasant, it’s a relatively safe procedure. And it's important to be proactive about your health, especially at your age. While my physical exam didn’t reveal anything immediately concerning, the stool test can give us further information. However, it is not as definitive. The decreased tone I found is not normal, and we need to investigate this further. We can discuss payment options with the billing department. Ignoring this could lead to more serious complications down the line, which would be far more expensive—and more difficult to treat. I recommend scheduling a colonoscopy as soon as possible. We can also discuss a referral to a gastroenterologist who specializes in these procedures if you prefer.
PATIENT: Okay. If you think it's really necessary... alright. A colonoscopy. I suppose I trust your judgement, Doctor. What do I need to do? What kind of preparation is involved? Is it going to…hurt? And how long will I be out of commission? I live alone, you see. I don't have anyone to help me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. The preparation involves a bowel cleanse the day before the procedure. You’ll need to follow a special diet—clear liquids only—and take a strong laxative to empty your colon completely. It's not pleasant, but it’s essential for a clear view during the exam. The procedure itself is typically done under sedation, so you won’t feel any pain during it. Most people describe it as being "out" for the duration. You'll need someone to drive you to and from the clinic, as you won't be able to drive yourself after the sedation. As for being out of commission, most people feel relatively normal the next day, although you might experience some bloating and mild cramping. You may also have some diarrhea initially, so it's important to stay hydrated. Given your situation—living alone—I recommend that a social worker be involved. They can help coordinate assistance for you, ensure you have transportation and a place to recover comfortably after the procedure. Would you agree to that?
PATIENT: Yes. That would be…very helpful. A social worker. Yes, please. I don't know what I'd do without someone to help. So, what happens next? Do I need to make an appointment with…the colonoscopy doctor? And when? And... is this covered by Medicare? I worry about the costs.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to put in a referral to Dr. Evelyn Chen, a gastroenterologist at the hospital. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. They will also handle the pre-authorization with Medicare, so you shouldn’t have to worry about that too much upfront. They’ll explain the coverage details and any potential out-of-pocket expenses. I will also put in a request for a social worker to contact you. They'll assist with coordination. Here's the referral slip with Dr. Chen’s contact information. She’s very good. And I’m having the social worker reach out to you by tomorrow to assist with coordinating transportation and post-procedure care. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I…I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Batara. You’ve been very…patient with me. And helpful. I still don’t like the sound of a colonoscopy, but…I trust you. And I’m glad you’re looking after me. Thank you. .
