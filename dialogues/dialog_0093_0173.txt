DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Bakan, nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been having these chills… just feeling really cold, even when it's warm. It's been going on for a few days now.
DOCTOR: I see. Chills for a few days, even when you're warm. Can you tell me a little more about those chills, Ms. Aslan?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. They don’t really have a pattern, you know? Sometimes they come on suddenly, like a shiver, and other times it’s just a general cold feeling. And they aren't always there, it's not constant. It's just… annoying, honestly. I feel tired a lot too, maybe that's connected?
DOCTOR: Yes, intermittent chills and accompanying fatigue. That is certainly helpful information. When you say tired, Ms. Aslan, could you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, I just feel… drained, you know? Like I haven’t slept even if I have. It's hard to get motivated to do things. I used to go to the gym three times a week, and now… I just want to sit on the couch. It's not like a normal tired, it’s… deeper, I guess. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Aslan. A deeper fatigue, not relieved by rest. I appreciate you explaining that so clearly. To help me get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me if you've had any other symptoms along with the chills and fatigue?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. I haven't had a fever, I don't think. No sore throat or cough. My muscles feel a little achy sometimes, but that could just be from not moving as much, right? Oh! And I've been a bit more thirsty than usual, actually. Not crazy thirsty, but noticing I'm refilling my water bottle more often.
DOCTOR: No fever, no respiratory symptoms, some muscle aches, and increased thirst. Thank you. Now, Ms. Aslan, have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Actually, yes. I haven’t been eating much. Not because I don’t want to, but I just don’t really feel hungry. Everything seems… less appealing, you know? I usually love cooking, but even that feels like a chore now. I’ve probably lost a little weight, but I haven't weighed myself recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, diminished appetite with potential weight loss. I’m taking notes here. Now, to get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, that sort of thing. And I had a really bad bout of food poisoning a couple years ago, but that’s it. My divorce was harder on me than anything medical, honestly. No serious illnesses or anything. Oh! And I do have some allergies – pollen, mostly. Nothing life-threatening. I just get sniffly and itchy.
DOCTOR: Pollen allergies, no significant past medical history aside from childhood illnesses and the food poisoning. That's helpful. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Aslan?
PATIENT: Just an antihistamine when the pollen count is high. Usually Claritin, something like that. I buy it over the counter. Nothing prescribed, if that makes a difference. And sometimes I take Vitamin D, because I don’t get much sun. But that’s it. Really.
DOCTOR: Claritin as needed for allergies, and Vitamin D. Thank you. To finish up the history portion, Ms. Aslan, would you mind if I asked a few questions about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, no problem. My mom has high blood pressure, and my dad… he had diabetes, I think? Type 2, I think it was. And my grandma on my mother's side had arthritis, really bad. That's about all I know, to be honest. We weren’t a big “medical history” family, if that makes sense. Mostly just ignoring things until they got really bad.
DOCTOR: I understand. High blood pressure in your mother, type 2 diabetes in your father, and arthritis in your maternal grandmother. Thank you for that information, Ms. Aslan. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle – your social habits, your work, things like that. It helps me get a better understanding of the overall picture.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. I'm a Health Education Specialist, so I should know all this stuff, right? It’s a little embarrassing to be honest! I work mostly from home, doing workshops and presentations online. It’s pretty sedentary, I guess. I’m divorced, so I live alone. I see my friends occasionally, but mostly it’s just me and the cat. I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Aslan, being a health professional doesn’t make one immune to health concerns! And thank you for sharing all of this. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you're comfortable with that. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your temperature, and feeling your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. I trust you, Dr. Bakan. Let’s get it over with. Hopefully, it's nothing serious!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s begin. Please have a seat and take a deep breath for me. Your heart rate is a little elevated at 92 beats per minute, but the rhythm is regular. I don’t hear any murmurs or extra sounds. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally; no wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses palpated. Your temperature is 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit. Your blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg. Your throat is clear, no redness or exudate. Based on this brief examination, I don’t detect any immediate cause for concern, but your elevated heart rate and slightly elevated blood pressure warrant further investigation. I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying infection, anemia, or thyroid issues. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable. Blood work seems sensible. I’m glad you're taking it seriously, even if it’s just precautionary. What kind of blood work are we talking about, exactly? And will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll order a Complete Blood Count to assess your overall health and rule out infection or anemia. A Comprehensive Metabolic Panel will check your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels. And a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test to evaluate your thyroid function. Regarding fasting, yes, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks – water is fine. We can schedule the blood draw for first thing tomorrow morning. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, tomorrow morning is fine. First thing is good. So, no breakfast? Not even coffee? Ugh. Okay, I can manage that. And what happens after the blood work? How long will it take to get the results, and then what? Will you call me with them, or do I need to schedule another appointment?
DOCTOR: No food or sugary drinks, unfortunately. Coffee is best avoided as well, as it can influence the results. It's a small sacrifice to get to the bottom of this, though. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. Once I have them, I will review them carefully. I will call you with the results as soon as possible, usually within a day or two of receiving them. We can then discuss the findings and create a plan of action, if necessary. If further investigation is required, we would schedule a follow-up appointment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you, Dr. Bakan. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve made me feel much better. At least we’re doing something, you know? I appreciate it. Is there anything else I need to do before tomorrow's blood work? Or should I just show up at the lab?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Aslan. It’s my pleasure. I understand wanting to be proactive. No, you don't need to do anything special. Just show up at the lab with this requisition form. It has all the necessary information. I've also included the lab's address and phone number on the form. It’s best to bring some form of identification with you as well. Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time, Ms. Aslan?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Dr. Bakan. You've been very helpful. I'll see you after the blood work. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Aslan. I’m glad I could assist you. I hope you have a restful evening, and please don’t hesitate to call if any new symptoms arise or if you have any concerns before your blood work. Have a good day to you as well.
