DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… well, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure what exactly brought me in. My husband, he was the one who made the appointment. He said something about my speech… that it’s been a bit… off. I just feel a little… hazy about it all, you know?
DOCTOR: "A bit off," you say. And how long has this "off" feeling been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a tricky one. It feels like… a few weeks, maybe? It’s hard to pinpoint, really. Time just… slips away sometimes. It hasn’t been constant, though. Some days I don’t even notice, and other days… well, my husband gets concerned.
DOCTOR: Concerned how, exactly?
PATIENT: He says I slur my words sometimes. Not all the time, but enough that he thought it was best to get it checked out. He's a worrier, you see. He just wants to be sure I'm alright. I don’t feel sick, if that makes any sense. No headaches, no dizziness… just the talking, sometimes.
DOCTOR: So, no other symptoms accompanying this slurring?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. Let me think… no, everything else feels normal. I eat okay, sleep alright… work’s been busy, as usual, but I haven’t been more tired than usual, if that makes sense. I really can’t recall anything else being different. It’s just this… speech thing.
DOCTOR: And what kind of work do you do, Ms. Swaby?
PATIENT: Oh, I’m a Construction Manager. A lot of being on site, checking things, making sure everything is running smoothly, talking to the crews… you know, all sorts of things. It’s a pretty physical job, usually. Lots of talking, actually, come to think of it. Perhaps that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: It’s possible. Now, let’s move on. Do you have any past medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Hmm… honestly, I can't really remember. Nothing major, I don’t think. I've had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose – measles, chickenpox, things like that. But as an adult… no, nothing significant comes to mind. I have Medicare, so I’ve seen doctors for check-ups, but I don’t recall ever being seriously ill. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It's… a start. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… No, I don’t think so. Not that I recall, anyway. I’ve never been in the hospital for anything serious, if that’s what you mean. I had my tonsils out when I was little, maybe? But that was a long time ago. My husband might know better, to be honest. He remembers things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a tough one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he passed away a few years ago, but he had… something with his heart, I believe. But I’m not really sure of the details. It was all a long time ago, and my family doesn’t really talk about health things much. I wish I could be more helpful. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Fair enough. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I’m aware of. I eat pretty much anything. I've never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I know. My husband says I’m pretty lucky that way. No hives, no swelling, nothing like that. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Very well. Are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Swaby?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I don’t take anything regularly. Sometimes, if I get a headache, I’ll take some over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen or something, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed, nothing ongoing. I prefer to avoid medications if I can, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick neurological exam, then. It’s standard procedure given your husband’s concern. I’m going to check your reflexes, your balance, and your cranial nerves. Can you follow a light with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can do that. Just tell me what to do, Doctor. I'll try my best. I hope I don't mess anything up.
DOCTOR: Follow my light with your eyes. Don't move your head. Okay… good. Now look over here… and over there. Both pupils constrict normally, tracking smoothly. Now, I'm going to test your peripheral vision. Tell me when you can see this finger.
PATIENT: Okay, I’m following the light. That's easy enough. And… I can see your finger now! Yes, there it is. And… over there. I think so. Is that right? It's a little blurry around the edges, but I can definitely see them.
DOCTOR: Peripheral vision seems slightly diminished, particularly on the right side. I'm going to check your facial strength now. Can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that okay? I hope it looks normal. It feels a little… stiff, maybe?
DOCTOR: There’s slight weakness on the left side of your face. Now, can you raise your eyebrows?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Like this? Is one side… lower than the other? I can’t really tell. It feels a bit… uneven, maybe. I'm trying my best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, the left side is slightly weaker. Now, I want you to stick your tongue out as far as you can.
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? It feels a little… funny. It keeps going to the left side. I can’t really control it very well. Is that what you want me to do?
DOCTOR: Alright. It seems we have some subtle, but concerning, signs of left-sided facial weakness and some diminished peripheral vision on the right. These findings warrant further investigation. I'm going to order an MRI of your brain, and I want you to see a neurologist as soon as possible. I’m going to write a referral for Dr. Ramirez. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI? And a neurologist? Is something… seriously wrong, Doctor? I just came in because my husband was concerned about my speech… I didn’t expect anything like this. It's just… I feel fine, mostly. It’s hard to explain. I just… get a little foggy sometimes. Is it possible it's nothing? A simple… something else?
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to say definitively without further testing. The symptoms you're describing, coupled with these findings, could indicate a number of possibilities. It's crucial to rule out anything serious. An MRI will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on in your brain. And a neurologist is the specialist best equipped to interpret those results and determine the appropriate course of action. I understand this is concerning, Ms. Swaby, but it's better to be thorough. I’m going to schedule a consultation with Dr. Ramirez for next week. They will contact you directly to arrange a time. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms—severe headache, weakness, difficulty speaking, or vision changes—go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. An MRI… and the neurologist… and to go to the emergency room if things get worse. Okay. I… I appreciate you being thorough. Even though it’s… frightening. Is there anything I should… do in the meantime? Anything to help…? Or avoid…? I feel so… lost, all of a sudden.
DOCTOR: For now, just try to avoid any strenuous activity. And please, if you notice any change in your symptoms—even something subtle—don't hesitate to contact me or go to the emergency room. It's always better to be safe. Here's the referral to Dr. Ramirez. They will be in touch soon. I’ll also send a copy of my findings to them. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I suppose… I just need to… wait. And try not to worry. Thank you… for everything. I’ll… I’ll see what Dr. Ramirez says. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ms. Swaby. I hope everything turns out well. .
