DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaxston. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Uh... headaches, mostly. Really bad ones. They come and go, and when they do come... well, I get kinda sweaty, and my heart races, you know? It's... not fun. Honestly, I don't remember exactly when they started, but it's been happening for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches. And you’re also experiencing sweating and a racing heart when they occur. You said it’s been happening for “a bit now” – can you try to be more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics... that's tough. I wanna say... maybe six months? Or was it eight? It feels like a long time, but time kinda... blurs, you know? It definitely wasn't just last week or anything. They weren't always this bad at first, either. Started kinda mild, then got worse over time. Does that help? I wish I was better at remembering dates, sorry.
DOCTOR: That does help, thank you. So, around six to eight months ago they started, gradually worsening over time. Okay. And can you describe the headaches themselves?
PATIENT: Right. They're... all over my head, kinda. Not like one specific spot. Feels like pressure, mostly. Like a really tight band squeezing my skull. And sometimes it feels like...throbbing? Yeah, definitely throbbing. It makes it hard to concentrate. Bright lights seem to make it worse, and noise too, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tight band or pressure sensation all over your head, sometimes throbbing, worsened by bright lights and noise. Have you noticed anything relieving the headaches, or anything that seems to trigger them besides the lights and noise?
PATIENT: Hmm... relieving... Laying down helps, I think. Just getting quiet and dark. Sometimes, if I just... do nothing, they'll calm down eventually. Triggers... not really sure. Stress, maybe? I got divorced a little while back, so… things have been a bit hectic. But it's not like they happen every time I'm stressed. I honestly can't pinpoint anything specific. It just… comes and goes. It's kinda frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stress can definitely be a factor. And it's frustrating when you can't pinpoint a clear trigger. Let's move on to some other questions to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Do you have any other symptoms that happen with the headaches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Sometimes I feel a little nauseous, but I haven’t actually thrown up. And I get really tired afterwards, like completely wiped out. It’s hard to explain. Like, a normal tired, but… worse. Everything just feels… muted. Does that make sense? I don't usually get dizzy or anything like that, though. Just kinda… drained.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea, fatigue afterward, and a general feeling of being drained. No dizziness. Have you noticed any changes in your vision with these headaches?
PATIENT: Vision… Now that you mention it… maybe? Sometimes things seem a little blurry during the headache. Not a huge change, and it goes away when the headache does, but yeah… I guess I have noticed that. It's not like I can’t see or anything, just… not as clear. Is that… normal? I haven't really paid much attention to it before.
DOCTOR: Okay, some blurry vision during the headache. That's helpful to know. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. I mean, I get the occasional cold, but nothing major. No asthma, no diabetes, no heart problems… nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed. I haven't really been to the doctor much, to be honest. I'm usually pretty healthy, or at least I think I am. It’s just… these headaches are new.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Never had any surgeries. Just the broken arm when I was a kid, and that didn’t need one, just a cast. I told you, I haven't really had much luck needing doctors! It's a bit of a change having these headaches though, makes me kinda nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing I know of. I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. No allergies to penicillin or anything like that. I've taken over-the-counter stuff for colds before without any problems. I'm pretty sure, at least. It's hard to keep track, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. I don't take anything regularly. I've taken some ibuprofen for the headaches when they get really bad, but that's it. It doesn't really help much, to be honest. It just kinda takes the edge off a little. But I don't take it often, and it's not a regular thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do any of your family members—parents, siblings, grandparents—suffer from headaches, migraines, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mom got headaches sometimes, I remember that. Not really bad ones, just… tension headaches, I think. My grandma on my dad’s side had something… maybe arthritis? I’m not really sure. Nobody really talked about health much, to be honest. It's kinda blurry. I don't recall anyone having really bad headaches like these though. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay. Finally, let's talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing like that. Never smoked a day in my life. I’ll have a beer with friends every now and then, but I don’t really drink much. Definitely don’t do any drugs. I work a pretty physical job, production work, so I gotta stay on the ball, you know? Keep things clean, stay healthy. That's about it. I'm pretty boring, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jaxston. That gives me a good starting point. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a quick neurological exam. It shouldn’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doc. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully, we can figure out what's going on with these headaches. I'm kinda tired of feeling like this, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and some cranial nerves… could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yeah, no problem. I can see it fine, just tell me if I need to adjust. Is this to check my eyes or something? I always get a little nervous when people wave things in front of my face. No offense, Doc.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all. It’s standard procedure, just checking your eye movements and visual fields. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Now, I’m going to check your strength and reflexes in your arms and legs. Could you squeeze my hands tightly?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Like this? I try to keep in shape from work, so they should be pretty strong. But I'm no weightlifter, if that’s what you’re asking. Is everything okay so far? It’s just… weird having someone poke and prod me.
DOCTOR: Okay, strength is good bilaterally. Now I’m going to check your reflexes with this little hammer. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Everything seems neurologically intact at this point. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing tension headaches, possibly with some migraine features. However, because of the blurry vision, and the fact that this has been going on for six to eight months, I want to be cautious. I'm going to order a CT scan of your head, just to rule out anything more serious. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Is that… bad? I mean, what are we looking for? I thought you said tension headaches? I didn’t know those needed scans. I'm kinda nervous now, Doc. Just tell me straight, what are you worried about? I'd rather know the worst than be kept in the dark. If you think it's important, then yeah, let’s do the scan. But please, explain what's going on.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask questions, and it's good that you want to understand. A CT scan isn’t necessarily indicative of anything bad, but it gives us a clearer picture of what's going on inside your head. While your symptoms do align with tension headaches, we also need to rule out other possibilities, such as structural issues, or, rarely, something more concerning. The blurry vision, and the prolonged duration of these headaches, warrant further investigation. It’s a precautionary measure, and it's always better to be thorough. The scan will look for things like tumors, aneurysms, or any abnormalities in the brain tissue. I don’t expect to find anything, but it gives me peace of mind, and will help us determine the best course of treatment. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That… makes a little more sense. Peace of mind is good. You're right, it's better to know. So, what happens next? Do I just go somewhere to get the scan done? Will I need someone to drive me? And how long does it take to get the results? Sorry for all the questions, Doc, I'm just a little freaked out. It's not every day you talk about scans and… everything else.
DOCTOR: No, don't apologize for the questions, that’s what I'm here for. I understand you’re freaked out. Yes, you will go to the radiology department here at the hospital for the scan. They'll schedule you, and it usually takes about 20-30 minutes. You won't need a sedative, and you can drive yourself afterwards. However, they will ask you to remove any jewelry, and let them know if you have any metal implants. The radiologist will interpret the scan, and send the results to me, usually within 24-48 hours. I'll call you as soon as I have them, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them, and come up with a treatment plan. In the meantime, you can continue taking over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed for the headaches. I also recommend staying hydrated, getting enough sleep, and managing stress. Is there anything I can prescribe in the meantime while we are waiting for the scan results?
PATIENT: Okay, good. 24-48 hours, that’s not too bad. I can manage that. Staying hydrated and getting sleep… easier said than done sometimes, but I'll try. No, I don't think I need anything prescribed right now, not until we see what the scan says. I'll just keep doing what I'm doing, and try not to stress too much about it. So, just go to radiology, they'll call me to schedule, and then you'll call me when the results are in. Is that everything? And… thank you, Doc. You've been really patient with me and all my worrying. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaxston. And yes, that's everything for now. I’ll have the receptionist schedule the CT scan for you before you leave, and she’ll give you instructions on how to prepare. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you experience any worsening symptoms—severe headache, fever, vision changes, weakness, or any neurological symptoms—before then. Otherwise, I’ll be in touch within 48 hours. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doc. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I’ll just go get scheduled with the receptionist, and hopefully everything turns out alright. Have a good day. .
