DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Neppl. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it is… the gas. Too much gas. It is very… troublesome.
DOCTOR: Troublesome gas, alright. I understand. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: Let me see… Perhaps three, maybe four weeks now? It started slowly, a little bit after a… a new bakery opened in town. Very good pastries, you understand, but… this gas followed. It is… consistent, let us say. Every day, a little bit. Not always bad, but always there.
DOCTOR: Consistent, you say. And would you describe it as painful, or more… uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, not painful, Doctor. That would be too strong. It is… a fullness. And a… rumbling. Very loud rumbling sometimes, which is embarrassing. Mostly uncomfortable, yes. Like… a balloon inside. A balloon that needs… releasing. It is difficult to explain politely.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Goodstein. I understand perfectly. Fullness and rumbling… that gives me a good starting point. Does anything seem to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm. The pastries, definitely. Especially the ones with cream. They are very rich. And… when I eat quickly, it is worse. If I eat slowly… a little better, perhaps. Drinking fizzy drinks? Absolutely worse. And… walking helps. A good, long walk seems to… move things along, you understand. It is a strange thing, this gas.
DOCTOR: Alright, so pastries, especially creamy ones, eating quickly, and fizzy drinks exacerbate the symptoms, while walking provides some relief. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits alongside this gas?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… let me see. Not really, Doctor. Everything is… regular, you might say. Not constipation, not… the other way, either. Just… normal. Except for the gas, of course. It is not with the… the stool, if you understand. It is separate. It comes and goes. It is just… a lot of gas.
DOCTOR: Alright, so regular bowel movements, gas is separate from stool. That's good information. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None of those. No pain at all, as I said. No nausea, no vomiting. And my weight… it is stable, I believe. Perhaps a little more weight, if anything, from all the pastries! But no weight loss, certainly. I eat a good appetite, you understand. A very good appetite.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t believe so. I eat many things. I have never had a reaction to anything. No allergies to medications either, as far as I know. I took some pills for my… my knee, a few years ago, but no problems. No… hives, no swelling, nothing like that. I am a fairly simple man, you understand. Not much bothers me. Except for the gas, of course!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I do not take any pills, any vitamins, anything. I try to eat a balanced diet, mostly. Well, mostly. Just… nothing prescribed or over the counter. Just… food. It is just the gas, I keep telling you. A strange thing, this gas.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. I’m going to do a quick physical examination now, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your abdomen and palpate it gently to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It will just take a few moments. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Please, do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. This gas is… bothersome, but I am sure you will find the cause.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants and are normoactive. No bruits are appreciated. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness. No guarding, rigidity, or rebound tenderness. Your abdomen is soft to palpation, but there is some mild tympany present, indicating some trapped gas. No masses are appreciated. Alright, Mr. Goodstein. Everything feels normal to palpation, aside from the mild tympany.
PATIENT: Mild tympany… is that bad, Doctor? I do not understand these… medical terms. Is it the gas, causing that? It does feel… full, as I said. Very full. But not painful, you understand. Just… full.
DOCTOR: No, mild tympany isn’t necessarily bad, Mr. Goodstein. It simply means there's some air in your intestines, which is consistent with your report of increased gas. It’s not a sign of anything serious. Based on your history and the physical exam, it appears you’re experiencing symptoms of excessive gas, likely related to your diet. The fact that it's exacerbated by pastries and fizzy drinks, and relieved by walking, points towards a dietary cause. I'm not concerned about anything serious at this time. We can try some simple dietary modifications to see if that helps. I recommend avoiding creamy pastries, fizzy drinks, and eating slowly. Perhaps keeping a food diary to track what you eat and when you experience symptoms could be helpful as well.
PATIENT: Dietary cause… yes, that makes sense. I suspected as much. The pastries are very tempting, you understand. But I can try. A food diary… yes, I can do that. So, no serious illness? Just… too much gas from the pastries? That is… good to know. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… thoroughness. And your patience. This gas is a silly thing to bother you with, I know.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Goodstein. It’s my job to listen to your concerns and help you feel better, no matter how “silly” you might think they are. Your health is important, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. If your symptoms worsen or don't improve with dietary modifications after a week or two, please come back, and we can consider further testing to rule out any other potential causes. But for now, I recommend those simple changes and see if that helps. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. You have been very helpful. Dietary changes… I can manage that. I will try the food diary as well. Thank you again for your time and… your understanding. It is a relief to know it is not something serious. Perhaps a little less pastry, then. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I'm glad I could help. And yes, perhaps a little less pastry! Take care of yourself, and please don't hesitate to come back if you have any further concerns. Have a good day.
