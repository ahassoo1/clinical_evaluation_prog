DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Stoffregen… yes, that’s me. Hmm… what brings me in? Well, it’s… the pee. I have trouble, you know. Getting it out. It’s not easy anymore. It’s been… a while now, I think. Not sure exactly how long. Old age, probably!
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty with urination. Yes, that can be quite bothersome. And you said it’s been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Yes, a while. Not sudden, not like a crash or anything. Just… slower. And sometimes it feels like… like it doesn’t all come out, you know? I have to… push. It’s a little embarrassing to talk about, but… that’s why I’m here, I guess. My husband, he says I should come, says it's not normal. He's probably right. He always is!
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to talk about this, Ms. Stoffregen. Many people experience changes in their urinary function as they age, and it’s good you came in to get it checked. It's certainly not something to be embarrassed about, and your husband is right to encourage you to seek medical attention. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe a typical time when you go to urinate?
PATIENT: Hmm… a typical time… Well, I usually go… when I need to go, of course! But it takes me a bit to get started, sometimes. I have to… wait a little. And then… it’s not a strong stream, you know? It’s more… dribbly. And like I said, it doesn’t feel like it all comes out. I have to… push a bit at the end. And then… sometimes it takes a little while to finish. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Stoffregen. You’ve described it very clearly. So, it takes you some time to start, the stream isn't strong, you feel incomplete emptying, and you sometimes need to strain. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not really. Sometimes a little… uncomfortable, maybe? But not pain. And no burning. Just… difficult. And slow. Like trying to push water through a small hose, you know? Is that a good way to explain it?
DOCTOR: That's a very good way to explain it, Ms. Stoffregen. Yes, that gives me a good sense of what you're experiencing. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color or smell… Oh dear. I don’t really look at my pee, you know? I just… go. My husband usually notices those things. He says it looks normal. I think. He hasn’t said anything about a bad smell, so I guess it smells okay? I really don’t pay attention to those things. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Stoffregen. That’s perfectly alright. Your husband’s observation is helpful. Now, have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… Hmm… no, not that I know of. My husband usually takes my temperature if I feel warm. He hasn’t said anything about a fever. And no chills. And no pain in my belly, no. Just the trouble with the pee. It’s mostly that, really. Do you think it’s something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's good that you haven't experienced fever, chills, or abdominal pain. Those would be concerning. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing some urinary retention and a weakened bladder. However, to get a clearer picture and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam and order a urine test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A test? Alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t mind. A physical exam… Will it be… uncomfortable? I’m not very good with… poking and prodding. But if it helps, then yes, go ahead. And a urine test… I can do that, right? Just… pee in a cup?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly, just pee in a cup. And the physical exam will be fairly straightforward. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I'll likely do a gentle abdominal exam. I'll also check your lower back. It shouldn’t be too uncomfortable, but please let me know immediately if anything feels painful or if you’re feeling uneasy. We can stop at any time. First, let’s start with the urine test. I’ll have a nurse bring you a cup and instructions. Once that’s done, we can proceed with the exam. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. Pee in a cup first, then the poking and prodding… Alright. Just let me know when you’re ready. I hope it’s not too much trouble. I really just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again. It’s embarrassing to have to ask my husband to help me every time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s perfectly reasonable to want your independence back, and that’s precisely what we’re aiming for. I'll have the nurse bring you a cup shortly. While we wait, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… Let me see… I take a little pill for my blood pressure, I think. A small white one. And sometimes, if my arthritis is bad, I take something for that. But I forget the name. And… My husband usually handles all that. He keeps track of everything. I really can’t remember. Sorry. He’ll know. He always knows.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Ms. Stoffregen. We can confirm everything with your husband. It’s very common for patients to have trouble remembering medication lists, especially with multiple prescriptions. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… not that I know of. I used to get a little itchy sometimes when I touched certain flowers, but it wasn’t serious. Nothing I had to take pills for. And I eat everything. My husband always says I have a cast iron stomach. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. But if I was, I’m sure he’d know. He keeps track of all those things too. He’s a very organized man.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a very attentive husband, Ms. Stoffregen. Alright, it appears we have a good starting point. Let's wait for the nurse with the cup for the urine sample, and then we can proceed with the physical exam. Do you have any questions for me before we begin?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… will it hurt? The exam, I mean. And… will you be able to fix it? I just want to be able to go to the bathroom like a normal person again. I'm a little scared, but I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel a little scared, Ms. Stoffregen. I assure you, I'll do my best to make the exam as comfortable as possible. It shouldn’t be painful, but if you feel any discomfort at all, please let me know immediately. As for fixing it… we’ll need to determine the cause of the problem first. But often, with a little investigation and the right approach, we can significantly improve your symptoms and get you back to feeling like yourself. I'm optimistic we can find a solution. I’ll explain everything as we go, and we'll work together to find the best course of action. Let’s take things one step at a time. Here comes the nurse now with the cup. We'll start with the urine sample.
PATIENT: Alright. Pee in a cup… here we go. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you being so kind. .
