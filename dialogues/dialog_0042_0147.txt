DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump… a mass, I guess you’d call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. That's good of you to come in and get it checked. “A little while now” is a bit vague – could you tell me roughly how long you've noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably… three or four months, maybe? It wasn’t very noticeable at first, just felt a little different. But it’s grown a bit since then, and now I can feel it pretty easily. It doesn’t hurt, not usually, but it’s definitely there.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months. And you said it hasn’t been painful, generally?
PATIENT: No, not really. Sometimes, if I’ve been doing a lot of… well, I’m a choreographer, so if I’ve been dancing a lot, it feels a bit tender. But it’s not a constant pain, or anything sharp. More like a dull ache, if anything, and only after being active.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, the connection to activity. And you said you're a choreographer – that's interesting. Do you feel any other changes in that area?
PATIENT: Not really, no. No changes in… bathroom habits, or anything like that. No weight loss, or feeling more tired than usual. Just the lump itself, really. It doesn’t bother me too much, but I wanted to make sure it wasn’t something serious. It’s just… unsettling, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's always best to get these things checked out for peace of mind. Now, let's talk a little bit more about your medical history. Have you had any previous surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Let me see… No surgeries, no. I had the usual childhood illnesses, chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. Nothing major, thankfully. And I’ve been pretty healthy my whole life, to be honest. My wife keeps telling me I need to relax more, but… well, I enjoy my work. I do have Medicare, if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: Medicare is good to know, thank you. And no significant past medical issues – that’s excellent. What about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had some problems with high blood pressure when she was older, and my father… he had some heart trouble. Nothing too specific, I’m afraid. We weren’t very close, and I don’t know a lot about his medical history, to be honest. I don't think anyone in my family has had anything like this… a lump, or anything like that. But I'm not certain.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a multivitamin, every now and then, if I remember. I try to eat a healthy diet, so I don’t usually feel the need for anything else. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No regular medications. Just the occasional multivitamin. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. No reactions to anything I’ve ever taken, or eaten, thankfully. I haven’t got any skin allergies either, or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, really.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll just need you to lie down on the examination table. I'm going to palpate your abdomen to get a better feel for the lump and check for any other abnormalities. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Of course. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m feeling a roughly 3 cm mass in the left lower quadrant. It's firm, non-tender to light palpation, but slightly tender with deeper pressure. It doesn't appear to be mobile. I’m not detecting any rebound tenderness or guarding. Your abdomen is soft overall, and bowel sounds are normal. Based on this initial exam, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of the mass. It could be a number of things – a lipoma, a hernia, a muscle issue, or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I think we need to order some imaging. I'm going to recommend a pelvic ultrasound. It's a non-invasive test that will give us a better look at the mass and the surrounding structures. How does that sound?
PATIENT: An ultrasound sounds… sensible. Yes, that’s a good idea. I’m happy to do whatever you recommend. I just want to know what it is, you know? Is that something we can schedule here? And will it… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: I completely understand wanting to know what it is. It's always best to have answers. Yes, we can schedule the ultrasound right here at the clinic. It’s usually done by a technician, and it shouldn't hurt at all. They'll apply some gel to your abdomen and move a probe around. It might feel a little cold, but there's no pain involved. The technician will then send the images to me, and I'll review them and discuss the results with you. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, if you notice any changes – increased pain, redness, or swelling – please let us know immediately. Let me just quickly document everything we've discussed today. Would you be able to provide me with a list of any previous doctors you have seen, or any health insurance information that isn’t Medicare?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… reassuring. No pain is good. And I will definitely let you know if anything changes. Let me think… I haven't seen a doctor regularly in… well, a long time, to be honest. Just for check-ups, I mean. I mostly stay healthy. And Medicare is pretty much all my insurance. My wife handles those things usually, she's much better organised than I am. I can ask her when I get home, but I don't think there's anything else. She may have a card for a specialist from a few years ago, but I’m not sure. Is it important?
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular doctors, and Medicare as the primary insurance. That's fine. Knowing about any previous specialist visits could be helpful, but it's not essential at this stage. Alright. I'm going to write a referral for the pelvic ultrasound. The technician will call you to schedule an appointment. They'll likely want to schedule it within the next few days. Once we have the ultrasound results, we’ll discuss the next steps. Depending on what the ultrasound shows, we might need to consider further testing, or a consultation with a specialist. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's… very thorough. No, I don’t think so. Just… what kind of things could it be? You mentioned a few earlier… lipoma, hernia… is it usually something serious? I'm trying not to worry, but… it's hard.
DOCTOR: That's a very understandable question, Amy. It's good to ask. It could be a number of things, as we discussed. Lipomas are benign fatty tumors and generally harmless, though they can sometimes be uncomfortable if they grow large. Hernias occur when an organ or tissue protrudes through a weak spot in the abdominal wall – these can range from small and manageable to larger ones requiring surgery. There are other possibilities, of course, but it's far too early to jump to any conclusions. We need the ultrasound to get a clearer picture. The vast majority of abdominal masses are not cancerous, but it's important to rule out anything serious. That's why we're doing this. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we'll take this one step at a time. We’ll have a clear plan once we have the ultrasound results. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring. Thank you. You've explained everything very clearly. No, I think that’s all for now. I'll just wait for the technician to call, and I'll let you know if anything changes. Thank you again, Doctor Vodzak. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. I'll be in touch once the results are available. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. .
