DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, yes. Doctor, right? New here, you see. Just… checking things. Medicare said I should. Not feeling bad, not really. Just… new place. Everything is… different. Long way from home, this is.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. It's good you're coming in for a check-up, even if you aren’t feeling unwell. Routine check-ups are very important. "Checking things" is a good start. Perhaps you could tell me a little more specifically what prompted the Medicare recommendation, or what "things" you're hoping we check?
PATIENT: Prompted? Hmm. Paper. There was paper. Lots of paper. Something about… being old? And new to… this state. I don’t… keep papers. My ex-wife, she kept all the papers. Always with the papers. I just… moved. Wanted quiet. That’s all. You check… everything? Like… heart? Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, we can certainly check everything. Heart is very important. It sounds like this appointment may be a required “Welcome to Medicare” visit, and a general health assessment since you’re new to the state. That’s perfectly alright. We'll go through a few things to get a baseline. Just to clarify, have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Regularly? Not… really. Back home, you just… went when something hurt. Not for… checking. My job, you see, it was always… busy. Makeup, for the theatre. Lots of travel. Not time for doctors. Now… quiet. Too quiet, maybe. So, here I am. Is that… okay? You don’t… need papers, do you?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. Many people don't have a regular doctor, and it’s never too late to start. And no, we don't need papers, but it's helpful if you can recall anything about past illnesses or surgeries. Don’t worry if you can’t remember details, we’ll do our best. Let me pull up your information in the system… ah, here we are. I see your height and weight are noted. Do you mind confirming that for me?
PATIENT: Confirming? Uh… short. Very short. People always tell me I’m short. And… not heavy. Lighter now, maybe. Since… the divorce. She liked to cook. A lot. One-sixty… is that height? And… one-twenty-eight? Sounds right, I think. Maybe a little less now. I stopped eating so much bread. She always had bread. Everything with bread!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. We have 160 centimeters for height and 128 pounds for weight. That’s good. Now, just to get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me if you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Never thought about it, really. Makeup, sometimes. But that’s… work. Makes your skin itchy, you know? Nothing… serious. Food… I eat everything. Bread, mostly. Well, not mostly now. But I don’t… break out in spots or anything. No, I don’t think I have allergies. My ex-wife, she was allergic to cats. Hated cats! Always complaining. Me? I like cats. Quiet creatures.
DOCTOR: Very good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… No. Nothing. Doctor never gave me anything, back home. Maybe… aspirin, sometimes. For headache. When the theatre was… loud. And busy. But not… regularly. Vitamins? No. Too much trouble. I eat… enough. I think. Stopped eating so much bread, though. That’s a good thing, right? Less… everything now. Less stress, less bread, less… wife. All good things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. That’s helpful to know. Now, Mr. Szmyd, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Serious conditions… Hmm. Back problems. Always with the back, from carrying the makeup boxes. Very heavy boxes. And… maybe a little trouble breathing sometimes. But only when the theatre was… smoky. All those cigarettes. And… loud music. Not now, though. Quiet. Everything is quiet now. Nothing… serious. Never went to a doctor for it. Just… rested. And… stopped smoking. Long time ago. Is that… enough? It’s all a long time ago, really. Hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, back problems and some breathing difficulties in the past, potentially related to smoke exposure. We can certainly look at those today. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no. Never had a surgery. Too much… trouble. And… I don’t like hospitals. Bad smell. And… people complaining. Always with the complaining. Hospital… no. No surgeries. Broken a finger once, maybe. But just… wrapped it. My ex-wife, she had her gallbladder out. Big surgery. Lots of complaining afterwards. Me? Just wrapped my finger. Quietly. Is that… okay? You’re not… making me go to a hospital, are you?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Szmyd, I’m not making you go to a hospital. Just trying to get a complete picture of your medical history. No surgery, that's good to know. Now, thinking about your family... are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother, she had… something with her heart. Old age, mostly. Always tired. And my father… he smoked. A lot. Like the theatre people. And… maybe a little trouble with his… mind, when he got old. Forgetful. Like me, maybe? Nothing… serious. Just… old age. And my sister, she… well, she never liked doctors. Lots of complaining. Is that… enough? Family is… complicated. Long way away, anyway. Haven't seen them in years.
DOCTOR: Alright, some family history of heart issues, smoking-related illness, and potential memory issues. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoked? Yes. Long time ago. Theatre, you see. Everyone smoked. Very stressful job. But… stopped. A long time ago. When I decided to… quiet things down. Too much coughing. And… it smelled bad. My ex-wife, she hated the smell. Always complaining. Yes, stopped smoking. A good thing, right? Very quiet now. No coughing. No smoke. No wife. All good.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s very good. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Sometimes. A little glass of wine with dinner. Used to be more, maybe. But now… not so much. Quiet life, you see. Doesn't go with a lot of drinking. Sometimes. Just a little. With dinner. Nothing… serious. My ex-wife, she liked vodka. A lot of vodka. Always with the… everything. Wine is… calmer. Yes. Calmer. Is that… okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. Just gathering information. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are there any concerns you have that you'd like to discuss today?
PATIENT: Concerns? Hmm. Just… tired, sometimes. Old age, maybe? And… forgetful. Like my father. Misplace things. Keys, mostly. And… names. People’s names. Doctor’s names. That’s… embarrassing. And… sometimes, a little trouble sleeping. Not a lot. Just… restless. And… quiet. Too quiet, maybe? It’s… different. Back home, always busy. Always with the… everything. Here… just quiet. Is that… a concern? Is quiet a concern?
DOCTOR: Those are all valid concerns, Mr. Szmyd. Tiredness, forgetfulness, sleep disturbances...and adjusting to a quieter lifestyle. We can definitely address those. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little unsettled with big changes. Now, if you're comfortable, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam… Hmm. I don't… like being touched. But… alright. If you must. Quickly, though, please. I don’t like doctors poking around. Quickly. And… gently. Be gentle, please. My ex-wife, she always complained when the doctor touched her. Very sensitive. Yes. Quickly and gently. Is that… possible?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. Quickly and gently. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure. Alright, just relax your arm for me… excellent. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning. And now, let’s listen to your heart… Breath deeply for me… Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. It’s likely benign, but we may want to investigate further with an EKG. Now, let’s listen to your lungs… Deep breaths… Lungs are clear, but there is some diminished breath sound bilaterally. This could be due to reduced lung capacity, or simply your build. Everything seems alright so far, Mr. Szmyd. Just a few things we’ll look into. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes, if you’re comfortable with that.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Hmm. Like… tapping on your knee? I saw that in a movie once. Is it… painful? I don’t like being tapped. But… alright. If you must. Quickly, though. And gently. Don’t tap too hard. I bruise easily. My ex-wife, she always complained about everything. Everything. Just… get it over with quickly. Is that… possible?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s possible, Mr. Szmyd. Just a quick tap on your knee. It shouldn't be painful. Alright… and another… Reflexes are a bit diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, I’d like to just take your temperature and check your pulse. Just routine. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Temperature and pulse… Hmm. Always with the poking and prodding. But… alright. Quickly, though. I don't like things in my mouth. Or… on my wrist. Just… get it over with quickly. Is that… possible? My ex-wife, she always complained about the cold thermometer. Everything was… a complaint. Just… quickly. And gently.
DOCTOR: Alright, pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Everything seems within normal limits, Mr. Szmyd. I’m going to step out for a moment and review your information. I’ll be right back. Alright, Mr. Szmyd, based on what we’ve discussed and the quick exam, my initial impression is that you are generally healthy for your age. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, your heart murmur is likely benign, and your diminished reflexes and breath sounds are probably age-related. However, to be thorough, I’d like to order a few tests. I recommend an EKG to assess your heart rhythm, a basic blood panel to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function, and a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… Hmm. More poking and prodding. And… blood? I don’t like needles. But… alright. If you must. But quickly, though. And gently. And… no long lines, please. I get nervous waiting. My ex-wife, she fainted at the sight of needles. Everything was… a drama. So, quickly. And gently. And… can I at least sit down during the blood test?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. We'll make sure you're as comfortable as possible. We'll schedule you for the tests at the lab just down the hall. You absolutely can sit down during the blood test. And we'll try to get you in quickly – I'll put a rush on the order to minimize your waiting time. The EKG is a quick, painless procedure – just some sensors placed on your chest. And the chest X-ray is quick too. Once we have the results back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you and develop a plan. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on a healthy diet, regular light exercise, and getting enough sleep. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Healthy diet… exercise… sleep… Hmm. Sounds… tiring. But alright. I’ll try. But… no long walks, please. And… no vegetables. My ex-wife, she always tried to make me eat vegetables. Everything was… a battle. So, quiet diet. And… quiet exercise. And… quiet sleep. And… no long lines for the tests. Is that… possible? And… how long will I have to wait for the results? Everything takes so long. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, that’s perfectly possible. No long walks, no vegetables, and no long lines. We'll prioritize a comfortable approach for you. I’m scheduling your tests for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM – they should only take about 30 minutes. The lab technician is aware of your anxiety and will do their best to make you feel comfortable. The results should be back within 3-5 business days. I’ll have my assistant call you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment. Now, do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Questions… Hmm. Just… one. Will these tests… hurt? And… will I have to wait in a long line for the results? My ex-wife… she always complained about waiting. Everything was… a drama. Just… no drama, please. And… can I have a glass of water afterwards? I get… thirsty. Waiting is… exhausting. Everything is… frustrating. And… no vegetables, right?
DOCTOR: No, the tests shouldn’t hurt, Mr. Szmyd. The blood draw might be a slight pinch, but it’s very quick. And you won't have to wait in a long line for the results – I’ve already emphasized your anxiety to my assistant, and they'll prioritize getting them to me quickly. And yes, absolutely, you can have a glass of water afterwards. I’ll make sure there’s a full glass waiting for you. And absolutely no vegetables. I've made a note: "No vegetables, prioritize quick results, provide water." Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. I think… that’s all. Just… quiet. I need quiet. And… no vegetables. Thank you… Doctor. I hope… it won't be too dramatic. Everything is… exhausting. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. We'll do our best to keep everything quiet and as drama-free as possible. I’m glad you came in today. You have a good day now. My assistant will be with you shortly to go over the lab order and schedule your appointment. And remember, absolutely no vegetables.
