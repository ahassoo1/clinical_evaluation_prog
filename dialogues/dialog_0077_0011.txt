DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, Doctor... Pirl, is it? Look, I ain't got all day. Just need somethin' signed, a clearance. For... a procedure. Cosmetic, you understand. Don’t need to go into details. Just want to know if I'm able, that’s all. Quick as you can, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. I understand you’re looking for medical clearance for a cosmetic procedure. To ensure your safety, I will need to gather some basic information, even for a clearance. It's standard procedure, I'm afraid. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Hmm. Not that I recall. I used to… work with towers, radio things. Lots of climbin'. That was a long time ago, though. Mostly just… tired, I guess. Old age. Is that a condition? Look, I ain't been to a doctor in… well, a very long time. Don’t trouble yourself with details. Just sign the paper.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Honcoop. While I understand your desire for a quick clearance, even “just tired” could be relevant. And past work involving climbing… that's something we need to consider. To be thorough – and again, this is for your safety – could you tell me a little more about what “tired” feels like?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor. I told you, I ain’t got time for this. Tired is… tired! Like you've been workin' all day, okay? Buildin' things. Climbin' things. Now I sit. And I get… tired. What more do you need to know? You makin’ this very difficult. Is this a requirement, or can we just skip it? I ain't lookin' for a diagnosis, just a signature!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. Truly, I do. However, signing a clearance form without a basic understanding of your health status would be irresponsible of me, and potentially unsafe for you. It’s not about looking for a diagnosis, it's about ensuring the procedure you’re planning won’t be complicated by any underlying issues. Let’s try this. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Look, I'm a practical man, Doctor. I wouldn't be comin’ here if somethin’ was wrong, would I? Shortness of breath… sometimes, maybe. When I exert myself. But that’s just… bein' old! Dizziness… not regularly. Maybe when I stand up too fast. See? Normal things. This is gettin' ridiculous. Are you gonna sign the paper or not? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I appreciate you being patient with me, but these “normal things” as you call them do require a bit more attention before I can provide clearance. Experiencing shortness of breath with exertion and dizziness, even occasionally, warrants a check. I'm going to quickly listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. It will only take a moment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Listen to my… No! Absolutely not. I came here for a simple signature, not a full examination! I ain’t payin’ for this. I don’t even have insurance, you know. This is a waste of my time, and frankly, it's… insulting. Just… forget it. I’ll find someone else. You keep your listenin’ devices to yourself. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, please, sit down. I understand you don’t have insurance, and I assure you, I’m not trying to cause you any inconvenience. But I cannot ethically sign a clearance form without ensuring your basic safety. I am concerned about the shortness of breath and dizziness. I can offer a limited check-up at a reduced cost, just to rule out anything serious. Or, if you prefer, I can recommend a free clinic in the area that may be able to assist you. Here is the information. Please, don't proceed with any procedure without getting a proper medical assessment. It's too important. .
