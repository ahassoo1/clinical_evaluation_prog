DOCTOR: Alright, Soila, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Soila. It’s… a good name, yes? I don’t… I don’t remember much these days, but… it feels right.
DOCTOR: Right. Look, I’ve got a pretty full schedule today, so if you could just tell me what brought you in, that’d be great. Try to be concise, alright?
PATIENT: Oh… concise. Yes, I try. My… tummy is big. Bigger than usual. And I don’t want to eat. Not much, anyway. Everything feels… heavy. It’s been a little while now, I think. Maybe a week? It’s hard to say. Everything blurs together, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so abdominal distension and decreased appetite for about a week. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nausea… is that when you feel sick to your stomach? Sometimes, yes. Not much throwing up, though. Just… not feeling good. Like a stone in my belly. And tired. Very tired. It's hard to explain. Everything just… feels slow.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… oh dear. You mean… going to the bathroom? Well, not so much lately. It’s… difficult. And when I do… it’s not like it used to be. Harder, you see? And… less. I don't want to talk about it much, if you don't mind. It's… private.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Any pain?
PATIENT: Pain… sometimes. Not sharp, you understand? More of a… ache. Low down, in my tummy. It comes and goes. It’s not terrible, but it’s… there. Like a dull weight. It's hard to say when it hurts more, everything is just… mixed up. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Look, ma'am, I'm going to need you to be a little more specific. "Mixed up" doesn't really help me figure out what's going on. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh… I’m sorry. I try. It does come and goes. Yes. Not all the time. Sometimes I feel it after I try to eat, even if I don’t eat much. And sometimes… just when I move around. It’s… hard to explain. Like a tired muscle, maybe? I don’t know. Everything feels so strange. It’s been a long time since I felt… normal. Is normal even a thing anymore?
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any fever, chills, or unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever… I don’t think so. I haven’t felt hot, if that’s what you mean. And chills… no, not really. Though I am always cold these days. But that’s just old age, I think. Weight loss… oh dear. I haven’t been weighing myself. I just… don’t feel like eating, so I suppose I’ve lost some weight. But I don’t know how much. Everything feels… fuzzy. I used to be strong, you know. A sociologist. Traveling and… studying people. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, alright?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam? Yes, alright. Whatever you think is best. But please be gentle? Everything feels… fragile these days. Like a dropped teacup. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie down on your back. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay. Abdomen is distended and mildly tender to palpation in the lower quadrants. Bowel sounds are… diminished. Not a good sign. I'm going to check for any masses. There's a vague fullness in the lower abdomen, but no distinct mass that I can feel right now. It’s hard to tell with the distension.
PATIENT: Oh… that feels… strange. A little uncomfortable. But I’m trying to be still. Diminished… what does that mean? Is that bad? Everything feels so… poked and prodded. Like a forgotten garden. And fullness… is that why my tummy is big? I just want to feel… better. What do you think is wrong, doctor? Is it serious? I don't want to die, you see. Not yet.
DOCTOR: Look, ma'am, I'm not going to speculate. But diminished bowel sounds, abdominal distension, and decreased appetite are concerning. It could be a number of things – constipation, a blockage, even something more serious. Given your age and the fact that you're uninsured, I'm going to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. That will give us a better look at what's going on. I'm also going to order some blood work – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. We need to check your electrolytes and kidney function. We'll need to get this done at the hospital, they can accept patients without insurance. Do you have someone who can take you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and blood work? Oh dear. That sounds… frightening. A blockage? Is that… dangerous? I don't like the sound of that at all. I… I don't have anyone, doctor. Not anymore. My husband… he passed a long time ago. And my daughter… she lives far away. California, you see. We don't talk much. I used to be very strong, you know. Independent. I don't want to be a bother. Can't you just… give me something for my tummy? Something to make it feel better? I don’t want to go to the hospital alone. It’s… very scary.
DOCTOR: Look, ma'am, I understand you're scared. But we need to rule out something serious. A blockage can be dangerous, yes. That’s why we need to get these tests done. Alright. I’m going to call an ambulance to transport you to the hospital. They'll be able to get you settled and get the tests done quickly. I'll make sure they know you're coming and that you're alone. And I’ll write you a prescription for a mild stool softener in the meantime, but that’s not going to address the underlying problem. The hospital social worker can help you with any support you need once you're there. I'm sorry, but this is the best course of action.
PATIENT: An ambulance… oh dear. That sounds… very serious indeed. California… yes, she’s a doctor, my daughter. Maybe she could… no, she’s busy. Very busy. I understand, you think this is best. But… I feel so helpless. Like a leaf in the wind. A stool softener… yes, that sounds nice. Something small. Thank you, doctor. For trying. I just… wish I wasn’t so alone. Please… be careful with me. Everything feels so fragile these days. I don’t want to break.
