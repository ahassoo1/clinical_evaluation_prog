DOCTOR: Hi Yamir, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. I… need check for referee. For fitness. They say I need. For work. I do… fix the brick, but for special brick. Hot brick. And I referee sometimes. So need this check.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You need a physical exam for a fitness-for-duty assessment, related to your work fixing bricks – specifically, hot bricks – and also for refereeing. Let’s get some details so I can make sure we cover everything they need. First, when you say "referee," what sport are you refereeing?
PATIENT: Uh… soccer. Little kids soccer. Not… big games. Just… local. Weekend. I like. But they want check now. For sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, local kids' soccer on the weekends. Good to know. And you're doing bricklaying – hot bricklaying, you mentioned. Is that full-time work, or is it part-time alongside the refereeing?
PATIENT: Full time. Brick is… main job. Referee is… extra money. And I like exercise. Brick work… hard. But good hard. Soccer hard different. So… need check. Everything okay?
DOCTOR: Right, bricklaying is your primary job, and refereeing is supplemental. That makes sense. Okay, so to start, let's talk about your overall health. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Yes. Generally… okay. No… big problems. Sometimes back… ache. From brick. But… usual. I take… medicine. For back. And… I sleep okay. Eat okay. Nothing… special.
DOCTOR: Okay, "generally okay" is good to hear. Back pain is common with bricklaying – we'll definitely discuss that. You mentioned taking medicine for it – what medication are you taking, and how often?
PATIENT: Uh… the white pills. Small white pills. I buy… at the store. Not doctor give. I… forget name. Sorry. Take… when back hurt bad. Maybe… three times a week? Sometimes less. Sometimes more. Depends.
DOCTOR: Okay, it's alright if you don't remember the name. We can look it up later, or you can bring the bottle with you next time. It's important for me to know everything you’re taking, even over-the-counter medications, to avoid any interactions. Let’s try to get a little more specific about your back pain. Where exactly does it hurt?
PATIENT: Lower back. Here. Mostly when… lifting brick. Heavy brick. And… when bending. Bending… to put brick. It's… not always. Sometimes okay all day. Sometimes… bad in afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain, specifically when lifting and bending – and worse in the afternoon. That's helpful. Does the pain radiate anywhere – down your legs, or into your hips, for example?
PATIENT: No. Not down legs. Just… back. Sometimes… stiff. Like… old man. But not all the time. Just… when I move. And… after work. I sleep okay though. Really. No pain sleep. Just… stiff. Sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, localized to the lower back, stiffness with movement, worse after work, but no pain at night – that’s good. Have you had any numbness or tingling in your legs, feet, or hands?
PATIENT: No. No numb. No… ting. Everything feel. Normal. I think. Maybe… hands a little tired. From brick. But… normal tired. Not… bad tired. I lift many brick. All day. It’s… work. Is this… important? Should I not lift so many brick?
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness or tingling, just some hand fatigue from work. We can definitely discuss the physical demands of your job. It is important, and we want to make sure you’re not overdoing it and potentially causing yourself injury. Before we get to that though, let's quickly go through some other things. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Never. No doctor say anything. I… go to doctor sometimes. For… check. But nothing wrong. Just… normal. I eat rice. And… vegetables. Sometimes. I think. I forget. Sorry. It’s… long time ago. Last time… maybe two years. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses, haven’t been to the doctor in about two years, and generally feel healthy. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never surgery. Never hospital. I… break arm when small boy. Fall from tree. But that… long time ago. Just… cast. And… better. No problem. No hospital. No surgery. I work hard. No time for… that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations, just a broken arm as a child. Good. Let's talk about your family. Do you have any family history of serious medical conditions – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Uh… my father… he… sick. Long time ago. Cancer. Lung. He… smoke many. I… not smoke. My mother… she… old. She okay. Maybe… high blood pressure. I think. She take… pills. I don’t… know. She live far. In China. We… not talk much. Is this… important? Should I ask her? It’s… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, your father had lung cancer, and your mother may have high blood pressure. That is good information to have, thank you for sharing. Knowing family history can help us assess your risk. It's okay if you don't have detailed information right now – we can always revisit this if you're able to get more details. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergy. I eat… everything. Sometimes… stomach hurt. But… maybe food bad. Not allergy. No pills make me… sick. No. Everything okay. I… think. I forget. Sorry. Long time ago. Maybe… something. But… nothing important. I… sure. No allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam, then we can discuss a plan. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and then I’ll take a look at your back. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Do quick. I… need work. Soon. Referee game… weekend. Need be good. Quick is good. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please sit back and relax. Okay, heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130/80 – that’s slightly elevated, but not a huge concern. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, let's take a look at your back. Please lie face down on the exam table for me.
PATIENT: Okay. Little… uncomfortable. But okay. Do quick. Thank you. My back… sometimes hurt when I bend. Very heavy brick. That is… problem. Is blood pressure… bad? Should I… rest?
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just feeling along your spine and the muscles around it. There is some tenderness when I press here, on the right side. And I do feel some muscle spasm. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but it's not alarming at this moment. It could be from the physical exertion of your job, or just a bit of stress. We’ll keep an eye on it. Resting can certainly help, and we’ll discuss some other strategies to manage your back pain, but we don’t necessarily need to completely stop working right now. Okay, can you gently bend forward for me, and let me know if you feel any pain?
PATIENT: Ouch. A little… hurt. Here. Not… very bad. But… feel it. Like… old man. And… hard to bend all the way. Not… smooth. Like… rusty. And… when I go back up… that is… worse. Ouch. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. It’s clear you have some stiffness and pain with bending, especially when you come back up. That sounds like muscle strain and potentially some inflammation. Now, I’m going to lift your leg up, straight. Please let me know if you feel any pain down your leg.
PATIENT: No. No pain leg. Just… back. When you lift leg… feel back a little. But no… shoot down leg. Like… pulling. Just… back. A little ache. Like… old ache. Not bad. Just… there. Always there. Sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No pain radiating down your leg is a positive sign. That suggests the pain isn’t coming from a pinched nerve. It sounds like it’s primarily a muscle strain. Alright, I'm going to listen to your back now. Your back sounds clear. Everything appears to be okay. Okay, Yamir, based on my examination, it seems you have a muscle strain in your lower back. It's likely caused by the physical demands of your job – lifting heavy bricks. We can discuss a plan to manage your pain, prevent further injury, and make sure you’re able to continue working safely. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes. Good. Plan is good. I need work. But… don’t want more hurt. Plan. Please. What… should I do? And… medicine okay? White pills okay? I… forget name. But… help sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Let's make a plan. First, regarding the white pills. It’s important to know exactly what you're taking, even if it seems like a small thing. It's best to avoid taking anything without knowing the ingredients or potential side effects. I’d like you to try to find the bottle if possible, or write down the name if you remember it. For now, let's focus on things we know will help. 1. Ice and Heat: Apply ice to your lower back for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day, especially after work. After a couple of days, you can switch to heat – warm compresses or a warm bath – to help relax the muscles. 2. Over-the-Counter Pain Relief: You can try taking ibuprofen or naproxen, following the instructions on the label, to help reduce pain and inflammation. 3. Gentle Stretching: Do some gentle stretches for your back and hamstrings every day. I can show you a few simple exercises. 4. Proper Lifting Technique: This is very important. Bend your knees and keep your back straight when lifting bricks. Don’t twist your body while lifting. 5. Rest: Take short breaks during work to stretch and rest your back. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Ice… heat… ibuprofen… I think I know. Stretching… yes. Lifting… hard. I… forget sometimes. Old habit. But… I try. Rest… also hard. Many brick. But… I try. Show… stretching. Please. And… ibuprofen okay with my blood pressure? A little high. Is okay? I… worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re thinking about these things. Let me show you a few simple stretches. So, for the hamstring stretch, you just sit with one leg extended and reach towards your toes, keeping your back straight. Hold for 20-30 seconds. For the back extensions, you lie on your stomach and lift your chest off the ground, keeping your hands by your sides. Hold for a few seconds. And for the torso twists, you lie on your back with your knees bent and gently twist your body from side to side. As for ibuprofen, it can slightly increase blood pressure, but for occasional use, it’s usually okay. However, since your blood pressure is a little elevated, I would recommend taking it only when needed, and monitoring it regularly. If you notice any significant increase in blood pressure, stop taking it and let me know. Also, it would be helpful to check your blood pressure at home if possible. There are affordable home blood pressure monitors available. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes. Stretching… I think I can do. Hamstring… I remember. Back… hard. But I try. Ibuprofen… only when need. Check blood pressure… okay. I buy… monitor. Maybe. But… what if… still hurt? After stretching… after ibuprofen… after rest? What if… very hurt? Should I… stop work? Worry… about job. And… money.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, and it's good you're thinking ahead. If your pain doesn't improve after a week of stretching, ibuprofen, and rest, or if it gets significantly worse, then yes, you should stop work. Continuing to work with a worsening injury could lead to more serious problems. We can also explore other options at that point. I can prescribe a stronger pain reliever or muscle relaxant if needed. We could also consider a referral to a physical therapist who can teach you more advanced exercises and techniques. And I understand your worry about your job and money. If you need to take time off work, we can discuss a work note to explain the situation to your employer. I want you to prioritize your health. Losing a job is difficult, but it's not worth risking a long-term injury. We'll work together to figure out a solution that works for you. For now, let's focus on following this plan and see how you feel in a week. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to reassess your condition and make any necessary adjustments. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes. Follow-up… good. One week. I try… everything. Stretching… ibuprofen… rest… careful lifting. And… I find white pills name. I think. Thank you, Doctor. You… understand. I worry… about work. But… health more important. I… go now. Many brick wait.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Yamir. I’m glad I could help. I'm happy to hear you're prioritizing your health. Please remember to bring the name of the white pills to your follow-up appointment. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. I'll see you in one week. Take care, and be careful with those bricks! .
