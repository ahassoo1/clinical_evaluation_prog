DOCTOR: Alright, Adyn, good morning. So, you’re nineteen years old, right?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am, that is correct. Good morning to you too. Though...it feels like just yesterday I was younger, honestly. Time flies, you know?
DOCTOR: It certainly does. Though at your age, you likely haven't experienced enough time to truly appreciate that sentiment. Now, let's focus on why you're here today. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, right, yes. Well, it’s my speech, Doctor...Burlingham, is it? It’s been…slurred, I think is the word. It’s hard to explain. It just doesn’t feel right when I talk. My husband noticed it first, actually. He said I was mumbling more than usual. I don’t really remember when it started, to be honest. Everything feels a bit…fuzzy lately.
DOCTOR: “Fuzzy,” you say. Hmm. And how long would you say this “fuzziness” has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear... that's a difficult question. I wish I could give you a straight answer. It’s not like a sudden thing, you see. More like...gradual. Perhaps a few weeks? Maybe a month? It’s hard to pinpoint. I've been busy with work, managing things at the construction site, and things just sort of...blend together. I truly don't recall a specific date.
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And this slurring... is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's... not constant, no. Some days it's barely noticeable, and other days... well, like today, I suppose. It seems to get worse when I'm tired, or stressed. Work has been particularly demanding lately, so there's been a lot of stress. Sometimes I feel like I have to really think about how I’m saying things, which is quite tiring, to be frank. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me some idea. And besides the slurred speech and this “fuzziness”, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… Let me think. Well, I’ve been feeling a bit clumsier than usual, I suppose. Dropping things more easily. And my balance hasn’t been the best. I brushed it off as just being tired, though. Long days on the construction site, you know? Lots of walking and lifting. It’s hard to tell what’s normal fatigue and what isn’t. Honestly, I haven't paid it much mind until my husband pointed out the speech. I'm not usually one to complain, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you experienced any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness... Hmm. That's a tricky one. I wouldn’t say weakness, exactly. But sometimes my legs feel heavy, especially at the end of the day. Like they’re carrying a lot of weight, you know? It's not constant, and I just assumed it was from being on my feet all day. It's difficult to tell, really. I’ve always been quite strong, so it would take a lot for me to notice true weakness, I think. Would that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I understand. You are a strong, active young woman. Let’s move on. Any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing... No, not that I’ve noticed, Doctor. I haven’t had any trouble with my food or anything like that. Although... now that you mention it, sometimes my throat feels a little…tight. But I thought it was just from the dry air at the construction site. We’ve been working on a lot of dusty projects lately. It’s probably just irritation, I imagine.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches… yes, occasionally. Nothing terribly severe, just sort of… dull aches, mostly behind my eyes. They come and go, and I usually just take some over-the-counter pain relievers. I haven't really thought much of them, to be honest. They seem to come with stress, like everything else. It’s been a stressful few weeks, as I mentioned. It’s difficult to separate what’s normal with the job and what isn’t, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your medical history. Any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me think. Nothing major, really. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, climbing a tree, but that healed up just fine. And I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, things like that. But nothing serious, nothing that required any long-term treatment or anything. As for illnesses...I don't recall any. I am generally quite healthy. My husband always says I'm as strong as an ox! I don't think I've ever been hospitalized for anything, though. Does that help?
DOCTOR: And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No, ma’am. Never had any surgeries. I’ve been very fortunate in that regard, thankfully. I try to avoid doctors as much as possible, if I’m being honest. I only come when absolutely necessary, and it seems my husband has finally convinced me this warrants a visit. I hope I'm not wasting your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history... That's a bit tricky, to be honest. My mother passed away when I was quite young, and I didn't know my father very well. I don’t really know much about their medical histories, I’m afraid. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… I think it was high blood pressure? But that’s about all I recall. It wasn't something we discussed much. I'm truly sorry, I wish I could be of more help. It’s a sensitive topic, and it’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, I don't take any regular medications. I pride myself on being a healthy person. Just the occasional over-the-counter pain reliever for headaches, as I mentioned. Nothing else. I don’t like taking pills unless absolutely necessary. I try to take care of myself with a good diet and plenty of exercise, you know? It’s hard work on the construction site, but I stay active.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any known allergies, ma'am. I’ve always been able to eat anything and everything without any problems. And I've never had a reaction to any medication before, thankfully. I consider myself quite fortunate in that regard. I truly don't believe I'm allergic to anything. I’ve always been very healthy, as I mentioned. I'm not sure what else I can tell you. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your history…or lack thereof… it sounds like you’re experiencing some stress-related symptoms. The slurred speech, the clumsiness, the headaches…they can all be attributed to fatigue and anxiety. However… given the new onset of symptoms, we should rule out anything more serious. I'd like to do a quick neurological exam, just to be on the safe side. Can you follow my finger?
PATIENT: A neurological exam? Oh. Well, if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes, of course. I trust your judgment. I just… I truly hope it’s nothing serious. Work has been quite demanding, as I've mentioned, and I’m worried about what this all means. Yes, I can follow your finger. Please, proceed. I'll do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, look straight ahead. Follow my finger… keep your eyes on it… don’t blink…
PATIENT: I'm following it, Doctor. It’s… quite mesmerizing, actually. Is everything alright? It feels a little…difficult to focus, but I’m trying my best. Is this what you expected?
DOCTOR: Difficult to focus, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s not…sharp, if that makes sense. It’s a little blurry around the edges, and it’s hard to keep my eyes locked on it. I don't normally have trouble with my vision. I have 20/20 vision, I believe. Is something wrong? I’m starting to feel a little anxious now, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I want you to close your eyes. Can you tell me what I'm saying?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please, proceed. I’m listening carefully. …I’m ready. What did you say?
DOCTOR: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
PATIENT: …The…the quick…brown…fox… jumps… over… the… lazy…dog. Is that…correct? It feels…difficult to say. Like the words are…stuck. My tongue feels heavy. I’m sorry, Doctor. I’m not sure I said that correctly. Is everything alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This may be a little uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Uncomfortable? Oh. Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then please proceed. I trust your judgment, as I said before. But…please be gentle? I don’t like surprises. I’m a bit jumpy, you see.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Oh! That…didn’t feel quite right. It felt…weak. And… slow. Is that normal, Doctor? My reflexes are usually quite good. I’m a very active person, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms, and the findings of this exam… I’m concerned. While it could still be stress, the sluggish reflexes and difficulty articulating words are…concerning. I'm going to order an MRI of your brain, and a referral to a neurologist immediately. It's best to rule out anything serious. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An MRI? A neurologist? What…what are you looking for, Doctor? Is it…is it something serious? Is there something wrong with my brain? This is…this is very frightening. I just wanted to check my speech. I didn't expect… this. Can you…can you tell me what you suspect? Please.
DOCTOR: Look, I don’t want to alarm you unnecessarily. But these symptoms could indicate a neurological issue. It's best to get it checked out. It could be something simple, a minor inflammation, but it's best to rule out anything more serious. We'll have the results of the MRI within a few days, and the neurologist will explain everything to you in detail. Don’t Google your symptoms, please. That will only make things worse. I'm going to write you a referral now. The neurologist's office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions about the referral process?
PATIENT: No… I… I don’t think so. Just… this is all happening so fast. I… I suppose I should call my husband. He…he’ll want to know. Is there anything… anything I should tell him specifically? Before he… panics? What if it is something serious? What if… what if I…
DOCTOR: Tell him I've ordered an MRI to rule out any potential neurological issues. Emphasize that it’s potential. And, frankly, the less self-diagnosis the better. He can come with you to the neurologist appointment if he wishes. I suggest he does. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see. The neurologist’s office will be in touch. Do you have any further questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time. I… I suppose I’ll just go home and wait for the call. Thank you again. .
