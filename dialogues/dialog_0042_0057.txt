DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. My name is Dr. Vodzak. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… about the cancer. I was told to come see you.
DOCTOR: I understand. That must be very unsettling to hear. Could you tell me a little more about what you were told?
PATIENT: It was… a few weeks ago now. The other doctor, he said the tests showed something. He used big words, I didn’t understand most of them. He said it was cancer, and I need… treatment. He sent me here to you. I don’t really know what kind of cancer it is, or… what happens next. It’s all very confusing.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your confusion, Chellsea. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed when you’re given news like that, and with medical terminology, it can be very difficult to follow. I'm going to look at the reports now to get a clearer picture. The records indicate you had some imaging done and a biopsy performed on July 15th. It says here the preliminary diagnosis is… Hodgkin lymphoma. Does that name ring a bell at all, or is it entirely new to you?
PATIENT: Hodgkin… lymphoma? No, I don’t think so. It doesn't sound familiar. Is that… bad? I really don’t know anything about any of this. I just know the other doctor looked very serious when he told me. Is it something I should be very worried about?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Chellsea. Any cancer diagnosis is concerning. Hodgkin lymphoma is a serious condition, but it's also one of the most treatable forms of cancer. Many people go into complete remission with treatment. It affects a part of your immune system, specifically the lymphatic system. Do you know much about what the lymphatic system does?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I… I don't think so. We didn't really go over anything like that in school. Is it… in my blood? Does it spread? I’m sorry, I’m asking a lot of questions. It’s just… I feel very lost.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all, Chellsea. It’s good you’re asking, and I'm here to answer them as best I can. The lymphatic system is a network of vessels and tissues that help your body get rid of waste and fight infection. Think of it like a drainage system for your body. Hodgkin lymphoma starts in your lymphocytes – a type of white blood cell. It can spread, yes, but we catch it relatively early in many cases, and that's what makes treatment so effective. The reports indicate the lymphoma is located in your cervical lymph nodes – that is, the lymph nodes in your neck. Have you noticed any swelling or lumps in your neck recently?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I noticed a lump on the side of my neck a few weeks ago. I thought it was just a swollen gland, maybe from a cold or something. It didn’t hurt, so I didn’t really worry about it. It's… still there. It hasn't gotten bigger, I don’t think. Does that mean… that's the cancer?
DOCTOR: It’s very likely that the lump you noticed is related to the lymphoma, yes. That's what prompted the initial testing, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The other doctor felt it and sent me for the tests. He said it felt… unusual. I didn't really press him on what that meant. I was… scared. He then told me about the cancer and sent me here. What kind of treatment will I need? Will it make me sick? I've heard… stories.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to be scared, and you’re right to ask about the potential side effects. It's good to be prepared. The standard treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma is usually chemotherapy, often combined with radiation therapy. The specific regimen we'd use depends on the stage of your lymphoma – which tells us how far it has spread. According to the reports, you’ve had a CT scan and a biopsy of the lymph node. The CT scan helps us see if the lymphoma has spread to other parts of your body, and the biopsy confirms the diagnosis and helps us determine the specific type of Hodgkin lymphoma you have. Chemotherapy does often have side effects – things like nausea, fatigue, and hair loss are common. But it’s important to remember that treatments have improved significantly over the years, and we have many ways to manage those side effects now. We would discuss all of that in detail if chemotherapy is the recommended course of action. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I haven't taken anything regularly in a long time. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes. Nothing serious. My husband… he handled all of that when he was alive. I don’t really remember what I’m allergic to, if anything. He passed away last year, and… I haven’t really kept up with things like that. I'm sorry, I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Chellsea. It's a lot to process, and it’s perfectly natural to be distracted. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult. It’s understandable that some things might have slipped your mind. We can always look up your medication history through the pharmacy records if you'd like. Okay. So, no known allergies. Good. The reports also indicate your complete blood count was normal, which is a positive sign. It suggests your bone marrow is functioning well at this time. Now, to get a clearer picture of the extent of your lymphoma, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your lymph nodes, and examine your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I just… want to know what’s going on and what we can do about it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chellsea. That’s exactly what we’ll do. I'll explain everything as we go. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Another deep breath… good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I'm feeling the lymph nodes in your neck now… Yes, I can feel a firm, slightly enlarged node on the right side. It’s not particularly tender to the touch. I’m also checking the lymph nodes under your arms and around your groin… They feel normal in size and consistency. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender, and your reflexes are normal. Everything else appears to be within normal limits. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable, aside from the enlarged lymph node in your neck, which we already knew about. This confirms the findings from the imaging and biopsy.
PATIENT: Okay. That… doesn't sound too bad, I guess. What happens now? Do we know what stage it is? And… what are my chances of getting better? I'm sorry to ask such a direct question, but it’s what I’m really wondering.
DOCTOR: Those are very important questions, Chellsea, and you have every right to ask them directly. It's good you’re being so open. The staging for Hodgkin lymphoma is based on where the lymphoma is located and how much of your body is affected. According to the CT scan report, the lymphoma is currently limited to the lymph nodes above your diaphragm. There’s no evidence of spread to other organs. Based on these findings, you’ve been diagnosed with Stage II Hodgkin lymphoma. This means the lymphoma is localized to one side of your diaphragm, and there are no systemic symptoms like fever, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss. As for your chances of getting better… the prognosis for Stage II Hodgkin lymphoma is excellent. With chemotherapy, the cure rate is around 85-90%. We'd need to discuss the specific chemotherapy regimen that's best for you, taking into account your overall health and preferences. But overall, you have a very good outlook.
PATIENT: That… that’s very reassuring. 85-90%? That’s… a lot. So, there’s a good chance I can get better? Really? What kind of chemotherapy would I need? And… how long does it take? Would I have to stay in the hospital? I’m… a little scared of needles.
DOCTOR: Yes, Chellsea, that’s right. 85-90% is a very good chance. And yes, you absolutely have a good chance of getting better. We’re going to do everything we can to get you there. The most common chemotherapy regimen for Stage II Hodgkin lymphoma is called ABVD. It involves four different chemotherapy drugs, given in cycles over several months – usually six cycles. Each cycle lasts about three weeks. Usually, chemotherapy is given on an outpatient basis – meaning you come to the clinic for treatment and then go home. You typically spend a few hours here each session while the medications are infused. As for the needles, most people don’t feel much discomfort during the infusion. We can also use numbing cream beforehand if you’re concerned. The infusions are usually given through a peripheral IV – in your arm. We can also discuss placing a port – a small device implanted under your skin – to avoid repeated needle sticks. Before we start treatment, we’ll need to do some additional tests to make sure your heart, kidneys, and liver are healthy enough to handle the medications. We’ll also discuss potential side effects and how to manage them. And of course, I’m here to answer any questions you have along the way. Does that sound manageable to you so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds better than I expected. Outpatient is good. I don’t want to stay in the hospital if I can avoid it. And a port… that might be a good idea. Avoiding needles would be nice. What kind of side effects should I expect? And… will I lose my hair? I’ve always been proud of my hair. That’s probably a silly question.
DOCTOR: It’s not a silly question at all, Chellsea. It’s a very common concern, and a valid one. It’s understandable to be worried about the impact of treatment on your appearance. The most common side effects of ABVD chemotherapy include nausea, fatigue, and a decrease in your white blood cell count, which can make you more susceptible to infection. We can prescribe medications to help manage the nausea, and we’ll monitor your blood counts closely to make sure your immune system stays strong. Some people also experience loss of appetite, mouth sores, and skin changes. Hair loss is a potential side effect of ABVD, but it’s not guaranteed. Some people experience significant hair loss, while others experience only mild thinning. The hair usually grows back after treatment is completed. We can discuss options for managing hair loss, such as wearing a wig or headscarf. There are also cooling caps available that can help reduce hair loss during chemotherapy. It’s important to remember that everyone experiences treatment differently. We’ll do everything we can to minimize the side effects and make you as comfortable as possible. We'll also provide you with resources for managing the emotional impact of treatment. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. It’s a lot to take in. But… I feel a little bit better, knowing what to expect. What’s the next step? Do I need to schedule more tests? And… when would we start treatment? I’m ready to get this over with. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Chellsea. I understand your eagerness to get started. The next step is to schedule some baseline tests to assess your overall health before we start treatment. This includes a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, an EKG to assess your heart health, and a chest X-ray to make sure your lungs are clear. I’m also going to order a PET scan to confirm the extent of your lymphoma and help guide our treatment plan. I can schedule those tests for you today. The earliest we can get you in is next week, on Tuesday and Wednesday. Once we have the results back, we can discuss them in detail and schedule your first chemotherapy session. We’re looking at starting treatment within two weeks, assuming the tests are all normal. Does that timeline work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Next week is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m ready. Let’s do it. I’m ready to get this over with and… get my life back. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. And you absolutely have my support. That’s exactly the attitude to have, and you've already taken the first, biggest step. Wonderful. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, contact you to confirm the appointments and provide you with any necessary instructions. She can also answer any questions you have between now and then. I look forward to seeing you next week. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. Take care, Chellsea. .
