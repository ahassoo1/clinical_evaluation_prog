DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Though, frankly, I was told you were the best option, so I suppose I have rather high expectations. I am here because… well, my husband insists. He says I need to have one of these… Advance Directives, or a POLST form, he called it. I must admit, I find the whole idea rather… morbid. But he’s very persistent.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel that way, Marija. It can seem a bit daunting to think about these things. Your husband is actually very thoughtful, though. Advance care planning, whether it's an Advance Directive or a POLST form, isn't about expecting the worst, it’s about making sure your wishes are known, should you ever be unable to communicate them yourself. It's about having a voice, even when you can’t speak. Before we dive into the specifics, perhaps you could tell me a little about what concerns you most about the idea?
PATIENT: Concerns? Honestly, Doctor, the whole concept feels… unnecessary. I am perfectly capable of making my own decisions, thank you very much. And I intend to remain so for a long time yet. It’s just… meddling. My husband seems to think I'll suddenly lose all capacity and he'll be left guessing what I want. He has a rather… dramatic flair, you see. It’s all a bit much. And frankly, I don’t appreciate being treated as if I am already… incapacitated. Is this something I have to do?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Marija. It sounds like this is less about your own concerns regarding future care, and more about how your husband is approaching the situation. It’s not something you have to do, absolutely not. It's entirely your decision. What your husband is suggesting is a way to document your preferences for medical treatment, should you become unable to speak for yourself. It’s often used for individuals with serious illnesses, but it can be helpful for anyone. It’s about empowering you, not limiting you. To clarify, are you generally in good health?
PATIENT: Generally, yes. I am a professor, you see. Foreign Languages and Literature. It requires a certain… mental fortitude. I do have the occasional… discomfort, a bit of back pain from standing and lecturing, but nothing a little stretching and proper posture doesn’t fix. I eat reasonably well, though I do enjoy a good pastry. And I walk – I walk quite a bit. But truly, Doctor, I am not someone who spends a lot of time in hospitals or with doctors. It feels… demeaning to even be discussing this. My husband, he worries over everything. He reads too many articles online, I suspect.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Marija. Being a professor certainly requires a lot of energy and focus. And it sounds like you take good care of yourself, which is excellent. It's understandable that discussing this feels a bit unnecessary, especially given your good health. The back pain you mentioned, is that a recent issue, or something you've dealt with for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, the back pain? It comes and goes. It’s been… years, really. Since my children were small, I suppose. Lifting, carrying, bending… all the things one does with small children. It flares up when I've been standing for a long time, or if I’ve been particularly… stressed. It’s never debilitating, never required a doctor’s visit, though. Just a bit of discomfort. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect it’s just part of getting older. And a rather demanding husband. He insists on me rearranging the furniture constantly. It's exhausting.
DOCTOR: It sounds like a combination of factors, certainly! It's good that it's not debilitating, and that you've been managing it with stretching and posture. Now, shifting back to the original topic, just to be thorough, and perhaps to ease your husband's mind – have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I have had the standard check-ups, of course, but nothing ever came of them. Perfectly healthy, Doctor. Though I will admit, my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. I require reading glasses now, and occasionally, for things further away. But that’s hardly a medical condition, is it? It's just… aging. Honestly, I’m beginning to think my husband is simply seeking something to worry about. He thrives on it. A bit of chaos, a bit of drama… it’s how he functions.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Marija. And no, needing reading glasses is perfectly normal as we get older, not a medical condition at all. It sounds like you've been quite proactive about your health, and have no major medical concerns. Let's talk a little about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or supplements on a regular basis?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I prefer to avoid them if possible. I believe in a healthy diet and plenty of rest. A bit of walking doesn't hurt either. My husband, of course, tries to get me to take vitamins for everything – vitamin D, vitamin B12, omega-3s… the list is endless. But I refuse. I simply don’t see the point. If I need something, I’ll take something. But preventative medication? Absolutely not. I'd rather… deal with things as they come.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Marija. It sounds like you have a very sensible approach to your health. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father, he had some sort of… heart ailment in his later years. Nothing terribly serious, as I recall. He lived to be quite old, actually. My grandmother on my mother’s side… she developed dementia, but that was a long time ago. Other than that… not really. We're a fairly robust family, all things considered. Though, truthfully, I don’t pay much attention to those sorts of things. Worrying about what might happen is a waste of time, don't you think? It’s much better to focus on the present. And on rearranging the furniture, according to my husband. Honestly, it's exhausting. He's obsessed.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you come from a resilient family, Marija, and you've inherited some of that resilience yourself. It’s good to know about the family history of high blood pressure and heart issues, though. Finally, just to get a complete picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I've always been rather fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, take anything, without any ill effects. Truly. It's another reason my husband worries needlessly, I suspect. He’s constantly asking me if I’m sure I’m not allergic to something. It’s rather… tiresome, to be frank. Honestly, Doctor, I’m beginning to think this entire exercise is a complete waste of my time. I’m perfectly healthy, I have no allergies, and I have no major medical concerns. What is the point of discussing Advance Directives and POLST forms? It’s absurd.
DOCTOR: You are right to question it, Marija. It does sound like you are in excellent health, and you've been very proactive in maintaining it. And truthfully, based on what you've told me, this isn't necessarily about needing to document anything specific right now. It sounds like a lot of this is stemming from your husband's anxieties, and his desire to be prepared for every eventuality. Perhaps he's trying to feel more in control, and this is his way of doing that. I understand your frustration. What I can do, if you’re willing, is simply explain what an Advance Directive and POLST form are, and the benefits they offer. It might help ease your husband’s mind, even if you ultimately decide they aren't for you. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. I suppose it can’t hurt to simply hear about them. Though I remain skeptical, naturally. And I fully intend to maintain my skepticism throughout this entire explanation. But yes, Doctor, please, enlighten me. Perhaps it will finally give me something to argue with my husband about. He’s so insistent, you see. It's exhausting. But, yes, explain these… forms. Though, I warn you, I’m not easily persuaded.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. And I wouldn't expect you to be persuaded without a thorough understanding. Let’s start with the Advance Directive. It's essentially a legal document that allows you to make your wishes known about your future medical care, should you become unable to communicate them yourself. This could be due to an accident, a sudden illness, or progressive condition. It includes things like whether you want life-sustaining treatments, such as a ventilator or feeding tube, and who you want to make decisions on your behalf. Think of it as a voice for you, when you can’t speak for yourself. Do you have any initial thoughts or questions about that part?
PATIENT: A ‘voice for me’? Honestly, Doctor, I seem perfectly capable of speaking for myself at the moment. And I fully intend to remain so for quite some time. The thought of pre-determining my medical care… it feels rather… impersonal. And frankly, a bit morbid. Who’s to say what I’ll want in the future? Circumstances change, opinions change… it’s foolish to attempt to dictate things years in advance. And a ‘ventilator’? A ‘feeding tube’? Honestly, it sounds dreadful. It’s a very… bleak outlook. Who decides these things, exactly? Is it some committee? Do they simply decide what's best for me, regardless of my actual wishes? It sounds… terrifying, actually. And a bit dehumanizing.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Marija. You are right to question it. It’s not about a committee deciding for you. The Advance Directive allows you to make those decisions now, while you are perfectly capable of doing so. And it's not a rigid document. You can change it at any time. Think of it like a will. You decide what happens to your possessions after you’re gone. This is similar, but for your medical care. You can be as specific or as general as you like. You can say you want everything done possible to keep you alive, or you can say you want comfort care only. And you designate someone – a healthcare proxy – to make decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to. This is someone you trust to understand your wishes and advocate for you. It doesn’t have to be a family member; it can be a friend, a lawyer, or anyone you choose. Does that clarification help alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: A ‘healthcare proxy’… that sounds slightly better, I suppose. At least it’s not some faceless committee making decisions. But still… it feels like dwelling on the negative. And I fully intend to remain healthy and capable for many years to come. Why spend time thinking about things that are unlikely to happen? And what about this ‘POLST form’ you mentioned earlier? Is that similar? Because honestly, I'm beginning to feel rather overwhelmed by all of this. It's a bit much, don't you think? A perfectly healthy individual shouldn't have to contemplate such morbid scenarios. Honestly, it’s exhausting. Perhaps my husband simply enjoys causing me stress. It’s certainly a possibility.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is a lot to consider, and it’s perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed. And it's very valid to feel it's dwelling on the negative, especially when you're healthy. The POLST form – Physicians Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a bit different from the Advance Directive. It’s a medical order, typically used for individuals with serious illnesses or frailty. It outlines your specific wishes regarding treatments like CPR, ventilation, and feeding tubes. The key difference is that it’s a medical order – it tells healthcare professionals what to do in specific situations. The Advance Directive is a broader statement of your wishes, while the POLST form is a set of specific instructions. However, given your excellent health, and your expressed concerns, a POLST form is likely not something you need to consider at this time. It’s primarily for individuals who are nearing the end of life, or have a limited life expectancy. Would you like me to explain the specifics of the Advance Directive in more detail?
PATIENT: Well… that's slightly reassuring, at least. I certainly don’t need a ‘POLST form,’ whatever that is. It sounds… dreadful. No, I think I've heard enough about that. And as for this… Advance Directive… I suppose I can listen, if you insist. But I remain skeptical, naturally. And I fully intend to maintain my skepticism throughout this entire explanation. But please, Doctor, keep it brief. I have a great deal to do, and frankly, I'm beginning to feel rather drained by all of this. And please, no more talk of ‘ventilators’ and ‘feeding tubes.’ It’s… upsetting. Just the basics. What specifically would I be writing on this… form? What sort of questions would I be asked? And who, exactly, is this… healthcare proxy? Can it be my husband? Though, truthfully, I'm not sure I trust him to make rational decisions under pressure. He tends to panic.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. I'll keep it brief, and we'll avoid the more upsetting details. The form itself is fairly straightforward. It's essentially a series of questions about your wishes regarding medical treatment in different scenarios. The first section asks you to designate your healthcare proxy – the person you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you are unable to. Yes, it can be your husband, but it can also be a friend, a family member, or anyone you choose. You can also designate an alternate proxy, in case your primary choice is unavailable. The next section asks about your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatments, such as CPR, mechanical ventilation, and feeding tubes. You can choose to accept all treatments, reject all treatments, or specify which treatments you want or don't want. There’s also a section for you to write down any specific wishes or concerns you may have. It's important to remember that you can change your mind at any time, and you don’t have to answer any questions you’re not comfortable with. Would you like me to go through a sample scenario with you, to illustrate how the form works?
PATIENT: A ‘sample scenario’? Honestly, Doctor, I find the entire concept rather morbid. It feels like tempting fate. But… very well. If it will finally allow me to escape this conversation, I suppose I can endure a ‘sample scenario.’ But make it brief. And avoid any graphic details. I have a perfectly good imagination, and frankly, I don't need any assistance in conjuring up unpleasant images. And please, no pressure. I refuse to be coerced into making any decisions I’m not comfortable with. Just… a brief, hypothetical situation. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. No pressure whatsoever. Let’s imagine this: you are suddenly involved in a car accident. You are unconscious and unable to communicate. The doctors determine that you have a severe brain injury and are unlikely to recover. You require a ventilator to breathe and a feeding tube to receive nutrition. In this scenario, your healthcare proxy would be asked to make decisions about whether to continue life-sustaining treatment. They would consider your wishes, as expressed in your Advance Directive, and make the best decision possible based on their knowledge of your values and beliefs. If you had specified that you wanted all treatments possible, they would likely authorize the continuation of life support. If you had specified that you wanted comfort care only, they would likely withdraw life support and focus on keeping you comfortable. Does that scenario help illustrate how the Advance Directive works?
PATIENT: A ‘severe brain injury’? Honestly, Doctor, that's a rather… dramatic scenario. And frankly, rather upsetting. I refuse to dwell on such unpleasant possibilities. It’s a bit much, don't you think? And what if I haven't specified anything? What if I simply… haven’t gotten around to filling out this form? Who makes the decisions then? Is it some committee? Some faceless bureaucrat? Honestly, the thought of strangers deciding my fate is… terrifying. It’s dehumanizing. And frankly, I’m beginning to regret agreeing to this entire exercise. It’s causing me unnecessary stress. Perhaps I should simply leave. I have a perfectly good life to get back to, and frankly, I don't need any assistance in conjuring up unpleasant hypotheticals.
DOCTOR: You are right to be concerned, Marija. That’s a very valid question. If you haven’t filled out an Advance Directive, the decisions would be made by your next of kin – typically your husband. And yes, it’s understandable to be concerned about strangers making decisions about your fate. That’s why it’s important to have a conversation with your loved ones about your wishes. And it’s important to remember that even if you haven’t filled out a formal document, your husband would be legally obligated to make decisions that he believes are in your best interest. However, without a clear understanding of your wishes, it can be difficult for him to know what you would want. That’s why an Advance Directive can be so helpful. It provides a clear and concise statement of your values and beliefs, and ensures that your wishes are respected, even if you’re unable to communicate them yourself. Would you like me to pause here and give you some time to think about it?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Perhaps… perhaps I should at least consider it. It’s just… I don’t like the thought of dwelling on such unpleasant possibilities. And I certainly don’t want to burden my husband with making difficult decisions. He tends to panic, you see. He’s… not particularly strong under pressure. And truthfully, I'm not sure what my ‘values and beliefs’ are, as you put it. I simply live my life, and I expect things to… continue as they are. It’s rather difficult to articulate, actually. But… very well. Perhaps you can simply hand me the form. And I will… look at it. But I make no promises. And I fully intend to maintain my skepticism throughout this entire process. And please, no pressure. I refuse to be coerced into making any decisions I’m not comfortable with. Just the form. That's all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. Absolutely no pressure. Take your time. And remember, you can change your mind at any time. I've also included some resources here with helpful information about Advance Directives and healthcare proxies. Feel free to review them at your leisure. And if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help in any way I can. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I think… I think that will be all. I have a great deal to consider, and frankly, I need some peace and quiet. And perhaps a strong cup of tea. Thank you for your… assistance. Though, truthfully, I’m not sure it’s made things any easier. But… thank you. Perhaps I will see you again. Or perhaps not. It depends on how this… form goes. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. Take your time, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. I understand this can be a difficult process. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best. And yes, please do feel free to schedule another appointment if you'd like to discuss this further. Have a good day as well.
PATIENT: Good day. .
