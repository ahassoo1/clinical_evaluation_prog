DOCTOR: Hi Bradlee, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's about… the surgery. The weight loss surgery. I think my wife set this up. I don’t really remember all the details, to be honest. It’s for… getting evaluated, right? Before I have it?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It is a big step, and things can be a little overwhelming. Yes, this is a pre-operative evaluation for weight loss surgery. We want to make sure you’re healthy enough for the procedure, and discuss what to expect. Let me pull up your information… Bradlee Kochubey, age 38. Okay. I see here you're uninsured. That's good to know as we talk through options. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you're considering weight loss surgery?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right, no insurance. It’s… complicated. And you’re right, it is complicated. Um… why am I considering it? Honestly? Everything’s just… hard. Getting older, it feels like my body just isn't cooperating. It's harder to move, harder to breathe, harder to… well, everything. My wife says it's affecting my health, and I guess she’s right. I just… want to feel better. I want to be able to play with my kids without getting winded. Is that making sense? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Bradlee. That’s a very good reason, and you’re not at all bad at explaining things. Wanting to feel better and be more active with your family is a perfectly valid and important goal. Okay. So, before we go further, let's get a bit more detail about your current health. Could you tell me about any medical problems you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical problems… That’s a tough one. I’ve had… high blood pressure, I think? The doctor told me a while back, but I don’t really remember taking anything for it regularly. And maybe… some early diabetes? My wife keeps telling me about it, but I’ve never really paid much attention. I’ve had… back pain for years, from work. That's about all I can think of right now. It’s kind of a blur, honestly. Is it important I remember exactly what they told me?
DOCTOR: It's okay if it's a blur – we can sort through it. It is helpful to know what's been going on, but we'll get there. Knowing about the high blood pressure and potential diabetes is important, as those can affect how we move forward with the surgery. Okay, high blood pressure and possible early diabetes. Back pain as well. Have you been officially diagnosed with diabetes, or is it something your wife has mentioned based on check-ups?
PATIENT: I think it’s just what my wife says. She takes me to the doctor, and he says something about my sugar levels being a little high, but he never actually said I have diabetes. He just wants me to watch what I eat. She’s really the one who keeps track of all that stuff, to be honest. I just… go to the appointments. I’m not very good with remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It sounds like your wife is a great advocate for your health. We'll focus on getting a clear picture of everything today. So, let's talk about any surgeries or hospital stays you've had in the past. Even something minor is good to know. Have you ever been operated on before?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… I broke my arm when I was a kid, and I think they had to set it. Was that a surgery? It was a long time ago. And… I had my wisdom teeth taken out. That felt like a surgery, but I was asleep, so I don't really remember it. Other than that… I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. I don’t really go to the hospital unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a broken arm as a child that was set, and wisdom teeth removed. That's good to know. Alright. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that your parents or siblings have been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh boy… family history. That’s a tough one. My dad… he had heart problems. He had a heart attack a few years back. And my mom… she has high blood pressure, like me. And she’s always talking about her arthritis. My brother is healthy, I think. He never really talks about his health. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to all that stuff. It's… depressing. Is it important I remember exactly what everyone has? I feel bad if I forget something.
DOCTOR: It's okay, Bradlee. It's perfectly alright if you don't remember everything. Knowing about your father's heart problems and your mother's high blood pressure and arthritis is helpful. We can make notes as we go. It’s good you mentioned this. Okay, father – heart problems, mother – high blood pressure and arthritis. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never have. And I don't drink much alcohol. Maybe a beer or two with dinner sometimes, but that's it. Definitely no drugs. Never been interested in that sort of thing. I try to stay as healthy as I can, even though it's hard. Mostly, I just like to relax at home with my family.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And it’s great you’re prioritizing family time. Okay. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, that I know of. Maybe a little bit of a runny nose sometimes during pollen season, but that's about it. Nothing serious, anyway. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. I hope not, that would be complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Alright Bradlee, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. It’ll help me get a better picture of your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just… try not to poke too much, okay? My stomach’s a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be gentle. I'll let you know what I'm doing as I go. Okay, first, let’s check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated – 148/92. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear, but you’re breathing a little shallow. And now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen… It’s a little tender, as you mentioned. I don’t feel any obvious masses or anything concerning, but it is sensitive to the touch. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems… within normal limits, but there are a few things we’ll want to investigate further. Your blood pressure and breathing are a little concerning, and the tenderness in your abdomen.
PATIENT: Okay… that doesn’t sound good, does it? What do you mean, "investigate further"? Does that mean… tests? I don’t really like tests. Are they going to be painful?
DOCTOR: It's okay to be worried, Bradlee. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s important to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Yes, I’d like to order a few tests. Mostly blood work - a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a blood sugar test to check for diabetes. We’ll also do a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. And I’d like to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm. The blood draw will be a little pinch, like getting a shot. The EKG is completely painless, just some stickers on your chest. It doesn’t take long at all. These tests will give us a better understanding of your overall health and help us determine if you're a good candidate for weight loss surgery. It will also help rule out any underlying conditions that might need to be addressed first. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah… that makes sense, I guess. A little scary, but… okay. I just… don’t like needles. And what if something is wrong? What if I’m too sick for the surgery? My wife will be so disappointed.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to be anxious, Bradlee. We'll take everything one step at a time. And it’s important to remember that even if something is found, it doesn't automatically mean you're not a candidate for surgery. It just means we might need to address it first. Many people have underlying health conditions that can be managed with medication or lifestyle changes. Our goal is to make sure you're as healthy as possible before surgery, so we can minimize the risks and maximize the benefits. We'll discuss all the results with you in detail, and develop a personalized plan that's right for you. And I'll be with you every step of the way. Okay, I’m ordering the tests now. The lab is just down the hall. They'll need a sample of your blood and will do the EKG right there. I'll have the results sent to me, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in a few days. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah… a few days is good. I need to… process all this. Okay. So… I just go down the hall and tell them you sent me? Is there anything I need to do beforehand? Like… not eat? I always forget things like that. Please tell me I don’t need to fast.
DOCTOR: Yes, you just go down the hall and tell them Dr. DeCosta sent you. And you are right to ask! Yes, you do need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood work. So, no eating or drinking after midnight tonight. Water is okay, but no food or other beverages. I’ll have the lab send you a reminder text message, just in case. And I'll write it down here as well. "Fasting blood work: no food after midnight. Water okay." Here you go. Do you have any questions at all before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Fast after midnight… got it. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… really helpful. I’m still scared, but… a little less scared now. I guess I’ll go… try not to eat anything. See you in a few days.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bradlee. That’s good to hear. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. We’re here to help. Take care, and I'll see you in a few days.
