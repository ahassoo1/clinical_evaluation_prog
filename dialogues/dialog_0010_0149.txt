DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Wynell. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Annesley, is it? Yes, well. It’s about… this whole thing, really. They keep wanting me to do things. Things I don’t need. Honestly, at my age, you’d think they’d just let a body be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when you feel like your concerns aren't being heard, or you're being asked to do things that don't feel right for you. Let's take our time and figure out exactly what's going on. When you say “they,” who are you referring to?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Doctors, mostly. And nurses. My daughter, bless her heart, she means well, but she pushes too. They all want scans and tests and… interventions. I just want to be left alone, really. Honestly, I haven't been feeling well, but it's not like they'll listen if I say it's just… a tiredness. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: I do want to listen, Wynell. It sounds like you're feeling dismissed, and that's not right. “A tiredness” can mean a lot of things, and it's important to explore it. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like being sleepy, Doctor. It’s… in my feet. They ache. They just ache. And they feel… cold. Always cold. Even in the summer. And it makes me not want to do things, you see? Not like I had a lot of plans, but… it’s just… draining. They keep suggesting things for arthritis. But it doesn’t feel like arthritis. I had my mother with arthritis, and this isn’t the same.
DOCTOR: Okay, aching and coldness in your feet, and it feels different from your mother's arthritis. That's very helpful. Do these aches and coldness come on suddenly, or have they been building up gradually?
PATIENT: Oh, gradually, definitely gradually. It wasn’t like one day, bam, cold feet. It’s been… months now, maybe even a year. It just slowly got worse. I used to be able to walk to the market, you see? Not far, but still. Now… well, now I prefer not to. It's just… easier to stay put. And it’s not just the feet, really. My legs get tired too. But the feet are the worst.
DOCTOR: So, gradually worsening aches and coldness, primarily in the feet, but also affecting your legs, making it harder to walk. About a year, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a year, give or take. It’s hard to keep track, you know? Time just… slips away. And they wanted to do a scan, I think. Of my… veins? Something about blood flow. But I don't like those machines, Doctor. They make me anxious. All that clanging and whirring… and being stuck in a tube. No, thank you. Honestly, I’d rather just leave it be.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation about the scan, Wynell. It sounds like you have a lot of anxiety about it, and that's perfectly valid. We absolutely don’t have to do anything you're not comfortable with. However, a scan of your veins – likely a vascular ultrasound – could help us understand what's going on with the blood flow in your legs and feet and rule out some potential causes for your symptoms. But we can certainly discuss alternatives. Before we get to that, let me ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any changes in the color or texture of your skin on your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Changes… Let me think. Well, my skin is a bit… dry, I suppose. Always has been, really. And maybe a little… shiny, sometimes? Especially on my ankles. But I put lotion on. Always have. I can't recall anything… dramatic. And there’s a little… discoloration, I suppose. Around my ankles. Not a rash, exactly. Just… darker. But I figured it was just age. Everything gets darker with age, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, dry skin, shininess around the ankles, and some discoloration. Thank you. Now, have you had any recent injuries to your legs or feet, even minor ones like cuts or scrapes?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not recently. I’m very careful, you see. I don’t go climbing trees anymore. No, I haven’t tripped or fallen or anything like that. I might have a few… bruises, but those are just from bumping into things. I'm not as steady on my feet as I used to be, but no actual injuries. Honestly, I think my biggest injury was stubbing my toe on the bedpost last year, and that wasn’t even serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good to know. And have you noticed any sores or blisters on your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not sores or blisters. I keep my feet very clean, you see. I used to be a podiatrist, you know. I know all about feet! I’d notice if I had sores or blisters. No, none of that. Just… tired feet. And cold. Always cold. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit… silly, talking about this. It’s just feet, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Wynell. It's very important that you’re telling me about this. You’re not just talking about “just feet,” you're describing symptoms that are concerning you, and I'm here to listen and help figure out what's going on. And the fact that you were a podiatrist is actually very helpful – you have a good understanding of foot health, which makes your observations even more valuable. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my blood pressure… it’s been a bit high, sometimes. The doctor keeps wanting me to take pills, but I don’t like taking pills. I try to manage it with diet, you see? Lots of greens. And I had a touch of… something, years ago. Not diabetes, exactly. But my sugar was a little high at one point. They said it was pre-diabetes, I think. But it went away. Mostly. Honestly, I don’t really pay much attention to all that medical jargon. It’s all just… a lot of fuss, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly elevated blood pressure and a history of pre-diabetes. Thank you. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That’s about it. And I was in the hospital once, when I had my daughter. That was… a long time ago. Nothing serious, really. Just… normal things. No major surgeries or anything like that. Honestly, I’ve been very lucky, health-wise. Until recently, of course. These feet are starting to cause me trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… she had arthritis, as I mentioned. And my father… he had heart trouble, I think. He died young, unfortunately. And my brother… he had high blood pressure, just like me. It seems to run in the family, you see? All these… troubles. Honestly, I’m not surprised I’m having a bit of trouble myself. It’s just… genetics, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Wynell?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not really. I take a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. But it doesn't really do much, so I don't bother most days. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor keeps telling me to, you know, for my bones. But that's it. Really. I don't like taking pills, as I said. They make me feel… sluggish. Honestly, I prefer natural remedies, if possible. A good cup of tea, a warm bath… that's what really helps.
DOCTOR: Okay. Before we move on to a physical exam, one last question. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had any bad reactions to anything. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose sometimes, with certain pollens, but nothing serious. No, I don’t think I have any allergies, really. Honestly, I’m pretty good, all things considered. I’ve always been a strong woman. Except for these feet, of course. They're starting to give me trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I’ll check your feet and legs, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And please be gentle with my feet, Doctor. They’re a bit sensitive. I used to take such good care of them, you know. Years of practice. It’s just… frustrating, to have them give me trouble now. Go ahead, then. But please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Wynell. I will be very gentle. Let’s start with your feet. Could you please remove your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. There. Be careful now, Doctor. They haven’t been out in public much lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm just going to feel around a bit. Does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A little bit around the ankle, there. Not terribly, but… yes. It's a bit sensitive. And… here, on the top of my foot. A little bit. It's just a dull ache, really. Nothing dramatic. Honestly, it’s probably just old age. But it’s good you’re looking, I suppose.
DOCTOR: And how about this foot?
PATIENT: Oh, pretty much the same. A little tender around the ankle, there. And… here, on top. A dull ache, you know? Nothing sharp or anything. Honestly, it's not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. It's just… frustrating, to have my feet betray me after all these years. I used to be able to walk for miles, you know. Now… well, now it’s a struggle just to get to the mailbox.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m checking your pulses now. They feel a bit…weak. And your skin does feel a little cool to the touch, even on your legs. Is this normal for you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Weak pulses… I hadn’t noticed. And cool… yes, I suppose it is. I’m always cold, you know? Even in the summer. My daughter keeps telling me to wear warmer socks. Honestly, I’ve always been a bit chilly. It’s probably just… my circulation. I don’t know. I used to have such good circulation, when I was a podiatrist! But that was a long time ago. Now… well, now they just feel… tired. And cold. Always cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, Wynell. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam – the cool temperature, weak pulses, tenderness around your ankles, swelling, discoloration, and your history of cold feet – it sounds like you may be experiencing peripheral artery disease, or PAD. It’s a condition where the arteries that supply blood to your legs and feet become narrowed, which can cause pain, fatigue, and other symptoms. It’s common, especially as we get older. But it’s treatable. We'll need some tests to confirm it, though.
PATIENT: Peripheral… artery… disease? Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. Is it… bad? Will I have to have surgery? I don’t like surgery, Doctor. Never have. I just want my feet to feel better. Is that too much to ask? Will I lose my feet?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Wynell. It can be serious if left untreated, but many people live full, active lives with PAD. It doesn’t automatically mean you’ll need surgery. We start with tests to see how severe the narrowing is. Typically, we’d do an ankle-brachial index, or ABI, which is a simple test that compares the blood pressure in your ankles to the blood pressure in your arms. If that shows narrowing, we might then do an ultrasound to get a better look at the arteries in your legs. The goal of treatment is to improve blood flow to your feet. This can often be done with lifestyle changes, like quitting smoking if you smoke, managing your blood sugar and blood pressure, and exercising regularly. Medications can also help. Surgery is usually reserved for more severe cases. We'll cross that bridge if and when we need to. The most important thing is to get a diagnosis and start treatment if necessary. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Quitting smoking? I haven't smoked in thirty years, Doctor! You must think I'm ancient! And my blood sugar… well, it's been a little high, but I manage it with diet. I don’t want to take pills. I just… I want to be able to walk again, without my feet aching all the time. An ultrasound… that machine again? All that clanging and whirring? Honestly, I don't know if I can do it. And if it's serious… what then? Will I have to stay in the hospital? I hate hospitals. It just sounds so… complicated. And scary.
DOCTOR: You are right to be concerned, Wynell. It does sound complicated, and it’s okay to be scared. And I apologize if I came across as implying you currently smoked – that was not my intention. It’s good that you manage your blood sugar with diet, and we can certainly explore other options besides medication. The ultrasound is a non-invasive test, meaning it doesn't involve needles or incisions. It uses sound waves to create an image of the arteries in your legs, and it doesn't hurt. The technician will apply a gel to your legs and move a probe over your skin. It might be a little cold, but it shouldn't be painful. If the ultrasound shows significant narrowing, we can discuss treatment options. This might include lifestyle changes, medications to improve blood flow, or, in some cases, a procedure to open up the blocked arteries. We’ll talk through all of your options and make a decision together. As for hospitalization, it’s not always necessary. Many people can be treated as outpatients, meaning they don’t have to stay in the hospital. We'll take things one step at a time. Right now, let's focus on getting the ultrasound done. Would you like me to schedule that for you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. One step at a time… yes, that sounds better. But… is there anything else I can do in the meantime? Besides… the ultrasound. Anything to help my feet feel a little better? They ache so much, you know? Even just sitting here. I used to soak them in Epsom salts. Does that help? And… is there anything I can take for the pain? Something that won't make me sluggish? Just something to get me through the day.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. While we wait for the ultrasound, there are a few things you can do to help manage the pain and improve your circulation. Soaking your feet in warm water with Epsom salts can be very helpful – it can help to reduce swelling and relax your muscles. Elevating your feet whenever possible can also help to reduce swelling. As for pain relief, over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen can be helpful, but it’s important to follow the dosage instructions carefully. Avoid ibuprofen if you have any kidney problems. We can also discuss other options, such as topical creams or ointments, that might help to relieve your pain. It’s important to avoid anything that makes you feel sluggish, so we’ll steer clear of medications with those side effects. We can also talk about gentle exercises that can help to improve your circulation. These might include ankle circles, toe raises, and calf stretches. However, it’s important to start slowly and avoid any exercises that cause pain. Would you like me to write down some of these recommendations for you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please. That would be lovely. Something to remind me, you know? My memory isn't what it used to be. And… gentle exercises? That sounds… good. As long as they don't hurt. I don’t want to make things worse. Anything to get me walking again. Just… anything.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Wynell. This lists the recommendations we discussed. Remember to start slowly with the exercises and stop if you feel any pain. And, as always, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We've scheduled the ultrasound for August 9th, at 10:00 AM. It will be here at the clinic. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. August 9th… yes, I think I can remember that. I’ll try the Epsom salts tonight. And… no, I don’t think so. That’s everything for now. Thank you again for listening, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old woman and her aching feet. I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Wynell. And please, don’t think of yourself as “just” an old woman. You're a valuable patient, and I'm glad I could help. Please take care of yourself, and remember, if anything changes or you have any concerns before your ultrasound, don’t hesitate to call. It was nice meeting you. Have a good day, and I’ll see you on August 9th.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye. And… be gentle with those machines.
