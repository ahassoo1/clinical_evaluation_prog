DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It's about my foot. This…sore. It just won't go away. It's been bothering me for weeks, maybe months now, honestly. I can't quite recall the exact date, you understand, but it’s a terribly persistent thing. It's quite painful, especially when I try to walk. And frankly, at my age, I need to be able to get around.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say…months. Right. And is it a constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not constant, dear. If it was constant, I wouldn’t be waiting this long to come in, now would I? It's worse when I stand, of course. And after I've been trying to do things around the house. It throbs, you see. And it’s quite…unpleasant. I used to be so active, always tending to my garden, but this…this really slows a person down. I don’t know what I did to deserve this.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And is there any swelling?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me see… Yes, actually. There is a bit of swelling, around the sore. Not terribly much, mind you. But it's definitely…puffy. And it's red. A rather unsightly red, if I may say so. It’s not a color one enjoys seeing on one’s own body, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right, swelling and redness. And where exactly on the foot is this soreness located?
PATIENT: Well, it’s on the bottom of my foot, of course! Right here, on this arch. It's not right on my heel, but it's not all the way up near my toes, either. Somewhere in the middle, really. It’s a rather large area, if I’m honest. I suppose it could be bigger, but it’s large enough to cause a nuisance, believe me.
DOCTOR: Have you had any injury to the foot recently?
PATIENT: Injury? Goodness, no! I haven't tripped and fallen or anything dramatic like that. I am a careful woman. I’ve been walking just as I always have, though maybe not as far lately, because of…well, this. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea where it came from. Perhaps it’s just old age catching up with me. Everything seems to ache these days, you know.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: Numbness? Tingling? Now that you mention it… perhaps a little. Not constant, you understand. It's more like… a faint pins and needles feeling, sometimes. Especially at night. It’s not terribly bothersome, but it is there. I just assumed it was my circulation. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to examine your foot. Please, lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Honestly, at my age, even getting onto this table is an ordeal. I hope you don't expect me to do any gymnastics, Doctor. I used to be quite spry, you know. But these old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness is present upon palpation of the plantar fascia. Range of motion is… acceptable, though limited. I’m noting some mild erythema and edema. It could be plantar fasciitis, though at your age, other possibilities need to be considered. Are you diabetic?
PATIENT: Diabetic? Why, no! I eat a perfectly reasonable diet, Doctor. I enjoy a nice piece of fish, plenty of vegetables… a little bit of rice now and then. I’m not one for all those sugary sweets. Although, my husband, bless his soul, he always did have a sweet tooth. But I have never been diabetic. Are you suggesting I’m… unhealthy?
DOCTOR: It was merely a routine question, Ms. Cannington. However, given your age and symptoms, we need to rule out other causes. I’d like to order an X-ray of your foot to assess for any underlying bony abnormalities. And perhaps some blood work, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Blood work? An X-ray? Oh, dear. This is all becoming rather…extensive, isn’t it? I came in for a sore foot, not a full medical investigation. Are you certain this is absolutely necessary, Doctor? I’m not a fan of needles, you see, and those machines… they always seem to give me the shivers. Is there really no other way?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I understand your apprehension, but we must proceed with due diligence. Without further investigation, I cannot definitively diagnose the cause of your pain. It is simply responsible medical practice. The blood work and X-ray will help me to rule out more serious conditions. A simple blood draw and a quick image, that’s all. I will write the orders now.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. But I expect a thorough explanation of everything, Doctor. I want to know exactly what you’re looking for, and what the results mean. And I certainly won’t be pleased if those tests reveal anything…serious. Honestly, at my age, one prefers not to dwell on such things. And please, be gentle with the needle.
DOCTOR: The lab and radiology departments are down the hall. They will explain the procedure. The results will be sent to me, and I will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, I believe that is all. I do hope this doesn't take too long, Doctor. I have a rather lovely garden that needs tending to, and I don't like leaving it unattended for too long. Honestly, the weeds can be quite persistent. I suppose I’ll go and get these tests done, then. Good day to you, Doctor. And do try to be thorough.
