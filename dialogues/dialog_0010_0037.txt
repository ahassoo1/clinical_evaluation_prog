DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… I have been having trouble breathing. It makes a whistling sound, especially when I try to do things. It is… wheezing, I think my daughter said. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Kilton. Wheezing is definitely something we want to look into. It’s good you came in to get it checked. Now, can you tell me a little more about this trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it started maybe a week ago? Not so bad at first. Just a little out of breath when I walk up the stairs. But now… now it happens even when I am sitting. It feels tight in my chest, like something is blocking the air. It is… uncomfortable. I used to be very strong, you know? Athletic trainer for many years. I do not like feeling weak.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's concerning when something impacts your ability to do the things you're used to, especially after being so active. A week ago, starting with stairs, and now even at rest... okay. And is this wheezing constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Not all the time. Sometimes I feel fine for a few hours. Then… then it starts again. It seems worse when I am in the house. My daughter says maybe it is the dust? We have old carpets. But I clean them regularly! I do not understand. It is… unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable is a good way to describe it. And the fact that it seems worse in the house is definitely something to consider. Do you notice anything specifically triggers it, besides being indoors?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I have been trying to pay attention. Sometimes it feels a little worse after I garden, but I love my garden so much! I do not want to stop that. And… sometimes when my granddaughter visits. She loves perfume, very strong perfume. But she is only here a few times a year. I do not think that is it. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, gardening and perfume are both potential irritants, good to note. It sounds like it's not consistently linked to either. Now, let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you had any cough along with the wheezing?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. A little cough. Not a bad cough, but it is there. Mostly in the mornings. It is… a dry cough. Not much mucus. It does not keep me awake at night, but it is… annoying. And sometimes my chest feels a little… heavy. Like a weight on it. Not painful, but… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry cough in the mornings and a feeling of heaviness in your chest. I'm making notes here. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no chills, no sweats. I feel… warm sometimes, but I think that is just the weather. It is very hot these days. I have been drinking lots of water. I feel… generally okay, except for the breathing. I eat well, sleep well enough. I am just… worried about this whistling sound. It does not feel right.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills or sweats – that’s good. And I understand your concern about the wheezing. Let's go over your medical history a bit. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or COPD, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have been very healthy, all my life. I used to run marathons! I had a broken arm when I was a child, and a little arthritis in my hands now, but nothing serious. No lung problems. My daughter asked if I had bronchitis once, but I do not think so. I always take care of myself. I do not smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. It is… strange that this is happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of lung conditions, and you’re very active and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications for arthritis or anything else?
PATIENT: Just a little cream for my hands, Doctor. For the arthritis. Nothing swallowed. Just rub it on at night. And sometimes I take a pain reliever if it is very bad, but not often. Mostly, I just try to keep moving. I find that helps. I do not like taking pills. They make me feel… strange.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the topical cream and occasional pain reliever. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My daughter is very careful about allergies, but I have never had a problem. She always asks when we go to restaurants, but I tell her I am fine. I have a strong stomach, I think. Never been sick from food. I do not think I have allergies. I breathe in the garden, I touch plants, I am okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do any of your close family members have asthma, COPD, or any other respiratory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had a cough sometimes, when she was old. But she smoked, Doctor. For many years. I think that was why. And my brother, he had… something with his lungs, when he was a boy. But he got better. I do not think it was asthma. It was… a long time ago. I do not remember exactly. No one else, I think. My family is… healthy people, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mother with a smoking-related cough and a brother with a childhood respiratory issue. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean, Doctor? I live alone, since my divorce. My daughter lives nearby, she visits often. I like to garden, I like to read, I like to walk in the park. I go to church on Sundays. I do not… go out much, mostly. I have a few friends, we have tea sometimes. Is that what you mean? I do not drink much, or smoke, as I said.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect, Mrs. Kilton. Thank you. It sounds like you have a quiet, healthy lifestyle. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let me just ask one final question. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No swelling. My ankles are fine. I walk a lot, so I would notice if they were swollen. I take care of my body, as I said. I do not like to feel… uncomfortable. I think I am a very observant person. I notice things. No swelling, no problems with my feet. Just the whistling sound in my chest.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No ankle swelling. Alright, Mrs. Kilton, thank you for that thorough history. Now, I'd like to listen to your lungs and heart, check your oxygen saturation, and take your blood pressure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please do what you need to do. I am ready. I just want to know what is causing this whistling sound. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get started then. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Okay. I'm hearing some wheezing in your lungs, as you described. It's more prominent on the left side. Your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is a little low, but not critically so. And your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within the normal range. No edema in your extremities. Now, I’d like to check your heart rate and rhythm as well. Heart sounds are regular. Based on what I'm hearing and your history, it sounds like you may be experiencing some bronchospasm, which is a narrowing of the airways in your lungs. This could be due to a number of things – allergies, a mild respiratory infection, or even irritation from something in the air. But to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a simple blood test to rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I trust you. A chest X-ray and a blood test… whatever you think is best. I want to know what is happening. I do not like being unsure. Is the X-ray… painful? And the blood test… is it much? I do not like needles very much.
DOCTOR: No, the X-ray is not painful at all, Mrs. Kilton. You'll just stand or sit in front of a machine for a few seconds while it takes a picture of your chest. It’s completely non-invasive. As for the blood test, it’s just a small amount of blood drawn from your arm. We’ll use a small needle, and it’s usually very quick. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and it shouldn’t be too uncomfortable. We’ll only need a few vials. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler. It will help open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. I’ll also recommend that you avoid any potential irritants, like strong perfumes and dust, as much as possible. Let me write that prescription for you now. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of before I do that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I told you, I have no allergies. I can take most things. Just the usual, I think. I have no reactions. Please write the prescription. I want to be able to breathe easier. This whistling sound is… frightening. I just want to go back to my garden.
DOCTOR: Alright, here’s the prescription for the albuterol inhaler. It’s a common medication, and it should help relieve your symptoms. The pharmacy will give you instructions on how to use it properly, but essentially you’ll inhale the medication a couple of puffs as needed when you’re feeling short of breath. I’ve also scheduled you for a chest X-ray and blood draw at the lab down the hall. They’re expecting you. Once we have the results, we can discuss them further and determine the best course of treatment. In the meantime, if you experience any severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that is all. Thank you very much. You have been very kind. I will go to the lab now. And I will try to avoid the dust and the perfume. I hope it is nothing serious. I just want to be able to breathe again. Thank you again, Doctor Annesley.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. I understand your concern, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results of your tests. Get well soon, and enjoy your garden when you’re feeling better. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. I will. I love my garden very much. Goodbye.
