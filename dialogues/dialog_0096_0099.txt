DOCTOR: Alright, Denis, good morning. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it's about a test I had done recently. An…internal one, for my stomach. The results came back…not quite right, according to the paperwork. I received a notice saying I should come in for a discussion, and frankly, I'm a bit concerned. I’m not entirely sure what it all means, but it said “abnormal.”
DOCTOR: "Abnormal," yes. People get so worked up over words, don't they?
PATIENT: They certainly do, don’t they? It’s just…I haven’t had many health issues in my life, and when something is flagged, I tend to worry a bit more. Perhaps unnecessarily. Could you explain what the test showed, in… simpler terms, if you wouldn’t mind? I’m not a medical person, and all the jargon is rather confusing.
DOCTOR: Well, the test – I assume you’re referring to the stool analysis – looks at a number of things. Primarily, we’re looking for blood, inflammation… things that shouldn't be there. Your results did show some irregularities. Not alarming, necessarily, but enough to warrant a bit of investigation. Now, it could be a number of things, Denis. Dietary issues, a minor irritation… But we need to rule out anything more serious. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Yes, I have, actually. For the past…oh, perhaps a month or so, I’ve been going to the restroom more frequently. Not terribly painful, just…more often. And the, well, the consistency hasn’t been quite right either. Sometimes it’s a bit loose, sometimes…not so much. It’s been rather unpredictable, to be honest. I thought it might be something I ate, but it hasn’t cleared up.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable, you say. And how often is “more often,” Denis?
PATIENT: Well, normally I go perhaps once a day, maybe every other day. But lately…it’s been two or even three times a day, sometimes. And occasionally, even during the night, which is… unusual for me. I don’t believe I’ve noticed any blood, though. Not that I’ve seen, anyway. I always check, after reading the notice, of course.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you experienced any abdominal pain, cramping, or bloating alongside these changes?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it…yes, a bit of cramping, occasionally. It’s not severe, more of a discomfort, really. It comes and goes. And yes, bloating too. Especially in the evenings. I thought it might be gas, to be honest. I have always been rather…prone to that, unfortunately. It doesn’t happen every day, but it's been more frequent lately, alongside the other…changes. Is this sounding serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It warrants investigation, Denis. Now, let's go through your medical history. Have you had any previous gastrointestinal issues?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I've always had a rather strong constitution, actually. I rarely get sick, and when I do, it’s usually just a mild cold. I’ve never been hospitalized for anything relating to my stomach or…intestines. As a young woman, I had a rather difficult time with morning sickness during my pregnancies, but that was many years ago. Other than that, nothing significant. I’ve always tried to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables, although I do enjoy a good chocolate now and then.
DOCTOR: And any family history of gastrointestinal issues?
PATIENT: That’s a bit difficult to say. My parents passed away many years ago, and I wasn't particularly close to my extended family. I know my mother suffered from…indigestion, occasionally, but I don’t believe it was ever properly diagnosed. My father…he was a very private man. I don’t recall him ever mentioning any health problems. I apologize, I wish I could be of more help. It’s been a long time, and I don’t have much information to share. Does that make things more difficult?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t help, Denis. Now, let’s move on. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I prefer to avoid them, if possible. I believe in letting my body heal itself, if it can. I take a multivitamin occasionally, and sometimes a pain reliever for a headache, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed, and nothing regularly. I truly try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And allergies?
PATIENT: No known allergies, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to any food or medication, as far as I am aware. I’ve never had any trouble with pollen or dust or…animals, either. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. Is that helpful? I truly don’t believe I have any underlying health conditions. This is all quite concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright, Denis. Let’s do a quick abdominal exam. Just lie back on the table there. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Feeling any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Just there, a little bit. It’s not terribly painful, more of a…discomfort. A dull ache, really. I hadn’t really noticed it before, until just now. Is that normal, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's…not ideal. Your abdomen is slightly tender to the left lower quadrant. There’s some mild guarding, but no rigidity. I don’t feel any masses. It could be diverticulitis, though we'd need further testing to confirm. Or simply some inflammation. It’s difficult to say definitively at this point.
PATIENT: Diver…diverticulitis? What is that, exactly? Is it serious? I’ve never heard of that before. And what sort of testing would be required? I must admit, I’m rather apprehensive. I haven’t been feeling well, and the thought of more tests is…unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Denis, try not to panic. Diverticulitis is essentially inflammation or infection of small pouches that can form in the lining of the intestine. It’s quite common, especially as you get older. Sometimes it's mild, sometimes it can cause more serious complications. We’ll need a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a clearer picture. That will help us determine the extent of the inflammation and rule out anything more serious. It requires an injection of contrast dye, so we'll need to check your kidney function first. We’ll also need a stool sample to rule out infection. Does that sound…manageable?
PATIENT: A CT scan…and a stool sample. Yes, I suppose that sounds…manageable. As long as it helps determine what’s going on. The dye…that sounds a little concerning. Are there any risks involved? I have rather sensitive skin, you see. And how long will it take to get the results? I must admit, the uncertainty is rather stressful. I just want to feel better, and the thought of this dragging on is…difficult.
DOCTOR: The risk of reaction to the contrast dye is minimal, Denis. A bit of warmth, perhaps a mild rash. We’ll monitor you closely. As for the results, the CT scan should be available within 24 hours, the stool sample will take a few days. I’ll write you the orders for both tests. You can schedule the CT scan at the imaging center across the street. And please, try to stay hydrated. Now, if you'll get dressed, we can discuss the next steps. Don’t worry unduly. We'll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will schedule the CT scan right away, and I'll be sure to drink plenty of fluids. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I leave? Any specific symptoms I should watch out for? I want to be prepared, just in case.
DOCTOR: Alright, Denis. If you experience a high fever, severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or any bleeding, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, just try to rest and maintain a healthy diet. Here are the orders. The imaging center will need this. Now, I'll see you in a few days to discuss the results. Try not to stress.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Burlingham. I will be sure to watch out for those symptoms, and I'll schedule the scan first thing tomorrow. I appreciate your thoroughness, and I’m grateful for your attention. I will see you soon. .
DOCTOR: Good day, Denis.
