DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Weichers, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Jeannemarie Weichers. It is nice to meet you, Doctor… Muretic, yes?
DOCTOR: Please, call me Milan. And you can call me Milan, too, if you prefer. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Milan. That is very kind. Um… well, I have been coughing up… some blood. It frightened me quite a bit. It was not a lot, but enough to worry me. It happened a few times now, over the last week or so.
DOCTOR: Coughing up blood, you say. Alright. And when you say a few times, can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It happened once on Monday, and then again on Wednesday. Then, just this morning, I saw it again. It is… not every cough, just sometimes. And it is always… bright red. Not dark, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Bright red, alright. And how much, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh… that is a difficult question. It is not… a full cup, certainly! More like… a teaspoon, maybe? Two teaspoons at most, each time. It mixes with the… mucus, I suppose you would call it. It is never just blood, always with the other stuff. I hope that is clear.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… relatively clear. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed… hmm. Not that I can think of, really. I have been keeping to my usual routine. Walking, a little gardening… I do not smoke, if that is what you are thinking. My husband… he passed away last year, and it has been quiet since then. Perhaps a little more stress, being alone, but nothing… drastic.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, no fever. I check my temperature regularly, and it has been normal. No chills, either. I have not been sweating much at night, and my weight… well, I think I might have lost a little, but I have not been weighing myself regularly. It is difficult to say for sure. I have not been eating as much since… since my husband passed, perhaps that is why. It is hard to have an appetite when you are alone.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any pain in your chest, shortness of breath, or any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No pain in my chest, no. And my breathing feels… normal, I think. Not any more difficult than usual. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but I think that is just… age, perhaps. And being sad, still. No… I don’t think there is anything else. I tried to think very carefully. It is just the blood, and the worry.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to listen to your lungs and take your blood pressure. Then we can discuss some possible causes. Do you mind if I do a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not at all. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgement, Doctor Milan. Please, go ahead. I will do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Good. If you could just sit up there for me. Deep breath in… and out. Let’s start with your lungs. Okay. And again… deeper breath. There’s some mild wheezing on the left side, but nothing particularly concerning. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within normal limits. Now, let's take a look at your throat. Open wide for me, please.
PATIENT: Certainly. Ah… is something wrong? I do not feel any pain in my throat.
DOCTOR: No obvious signs of infection or irritation. It looks… unremarkable. Given your history and the examination, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing the blood. It could be a minor irritation, a small bronchial issue, or… something else. We’ll need to do some tests to rule things out. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. Would you be able to get those done today?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… yes, I think so. I have insurance, and there is a clinic nearby, I believe. A complete blood count… is that more difficult? I am not familiar with these things. I trust you know what is best, Doctor. If you think I should have them done today, I will do my best to arrange it. I just… I would like to know what is causing this. It is frightening to cough up blood.
DOCTOR: The blood count is fairly straightforward, just a simple blood draw. It will give us a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. The X-ray will show us if there's anything visible in your lungs. Both are standard procedures. I’ll have the order sent to the lab and the radiology center electronically. They should be able to schedule you quickly. If you have any trouble, let the receptionist know, and they can assist you. In the meantime, try to avoid strenuous activity and stay well-hydrated. If the bleeding gets worse, or you develop a fever, chest pain, or shortness of breath, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Chest X-ray and blood test. Avoid activity, drink water. And go to the emergency room if it gets worse. I will remember. Thank you, Doctor Milan. You have been very… thorough. I appreciate your time. I hope it is nothing serious.
DOCTOR: We’ll get those tests done and have a better idea of what's going on. It's likely nothing serious, but it's always best to be cautious. The receptionist will schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are back. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You have answered everything I was worried about, at least for now. I will go and arrange the tests. Thank you again, Doctor Milan. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Then you’re all set. Just let us know if anything changes before your follow-up. And try not to worry too much. .
