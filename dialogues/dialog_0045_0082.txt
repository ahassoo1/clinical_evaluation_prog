DOCTOR: Alright, Odell, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um... travel. I need... shots for travel. My wife... she liked travel. Before... before everything. It's for a trip. I think. Somewhere warm.
DOCTOR: Right. “Somewhere warm.” Okay. Well, we need to be a little more specific than that if we're going to figure out what you need. Do you have a destination in mind?
PATIENT: I... not really. My friend, he said I should come here. He said... important to get things done before. Before I go. I don’t know places. Just... warm. And not too much trouble. Is that... helpful?
DOCTOR: Look, I'm not a travel agent. "Warm and not too much trouble" doesn't tell me anything medically. We need to know where you're going to determine what vaccinations or preventative medications you might need. Do you have a passport?
PATIENT: Passport? I... think so. My wife, she kept all the papers. After... after she passed, my friend, he helped with things. Maybe he has it. I don’t remember. Is it... important? Like, I need it now?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s important. Very important. You need a passport to leave the country, and knowing where that passport shows you’ve traveled previously can give me an idea of your immunity status. Do you remember roughly when you last traveled, even if you don’t recall where?
PATIENT: No. Not really. It was... with her. Before. A long time ago, I think. Maybe... a year? Two? It's all... fuzzy. She planned everything. I just... went. I don’t remember the places, or when. Just... with her.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, this is… less than ideal. Okay, let’s try this. Do you have any idea what kind of activities you plan on doing on this trip?
PATIENT: Activities? Relax, I guess. Maybe see some water. My friend said beaches. Somewhere with sun. I don't... I don’t do much. My wife, she liked swimming and... and looking at things. I just... sat. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Look, I’m trying to help you here, but you’re not giving me much to work with. "Sitting on a beach" isn't a medical indication for anything. We need to figure out what risks you're potentially exposing yourself to. Do you have any idea what country your friend is suggesting you go to?
PATIENT: He said... Thailand, maybe? Or Vietnam? Something with rice paddies. He likes those. He said it was cheap. Does that... does that help? Is that good? Is that a dangerous place?
DOCTOR: Okay, Thailand or Vietnam. That’s… something. Alright. Both those countries have risks for things like Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and depending on where you go, Japanese Encephalitis. And we absolutely need to talk about malaria. Have you ever been tested for malaria?
PATIENT: Malaria? No! No, I haven't. What... what is malaria? Is it... bad? My friend didn't say anything about... anything like that. Just sun and... and cheap food.
DOCTOR: Malaria is a serious, potentially life-threatening disease transmitted by mosquitoes. It causes fever, chills, and can lead to organ failure if left untreated. It's a real concern in certain parts of Thailand and Vietnam. And frankly, showing up without any idea of your prior vaccinations or travel history, heading to Southeast Asia… it’s irresponsible. Alright. We're going to need to do some blood work to check for existing immunity and rule out any other potential issues. And you're going to need to get a full series of vaccinations, including Hepatitis A and Typhoid. We can discuss malaria prophylaxis after the blood work results come back. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a Hepatitis A antibody test, and a Typhoid antibody test. We’ll need a urine sample as well. Nurse will be in shortly to get those. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Um... I don't think so. My wife... she always took care of that. I just took what she gave me. I don’t remember anything about… reactions. This is... a lot. Is it very expensive? I don’t have much money.
DOCTOR: Look, you came in here asking for travel vaccinations without any preparation. Of course, there are costs involved. As for the expense, your insurance should cover a significant portion. But frankly, traveling to Southeast Asia without proper medical precautions is a gamble. Alright. Nurse will get the blood and urine samples. We'll send them to the lab and I'll review the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you do not travel until we have a clearer picture of your health status and have completed the necessary vaccinations. Understand?
PATIENT: No travel? But... my friend... he already booked everything. He said it would be good for me. Can’t you just... give me something? Anything? I just want to... get away. .
DOCTOR: Look, I understand you're going through a difficult time, but I am not going to compromise your health. Giving you vaccinations without knowing your baseline immunity or potential allergies is reckless. I will not do it. The nurse will be in shortly to collect the samples. Until we have those results, I strongly advise you to contact your friend and postpone your trip. I have nothing further to discuss at this time.
