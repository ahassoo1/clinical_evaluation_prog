DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you. Just here for my yearly shots, I think. The nurse called about being due for some, and I figured I’d better get them done before the weather really turns. You know, before everything gets busy with fall projects.
DOCTOR: Alright, yearly shots, good thinking. It's always best to stay on top of these things. Just to confirm, are you referring to your flu and COVID boosters?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That’s right. Flu and… is it still COVID boosters? I forget what they call them now. Everything happened so fast, you know? But yeah, those two, if that’s what’s due. Are they the same ones as last year?
DOCTOR: It is easy to lose track. The formulations are updated yearly, Ms. Fornes, to match the strains that are circulating. So they’re not exactly the same, but the process is the same. Before we proceed, though, let's just do a quick check-in. Have you had any changes in your health since your last visit?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Everything's been pretty steady. My back's been a little achy lately, but that's just from hauling lumber, you know? Construction work. Nothing a little ibuprofen can't handle. Otherwise, I feel good. No colds, no flu… just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to hear. Construction work, that explains the back ache. We'll keep that in mind. And it’s always good to be proactive with pain management. Just out of routine, have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of that. I haven’t felt sick at all, like I said. No fever, no chills, definitely no night sweats. I sleep pretty soundly, actually, despite everything. Though now that you mention it, I have been a little more tired than usual, but I figured that was just the heat. It's been so warm, even for August.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue… that's good to know. Sometimes even subtle changes can be important. Now, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything. My husband always jokes I have a cast iron stomach. Never had trouble with penicillin or anything like that, either. I’ve had all my tetanus boosters, too, I think. My mom was really good about keeping track of that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Good record-keeping is a lifesaver. And a cast iron stomach is always a good thing to have! Now, are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen for my back, when I need it. And… oh, sometimes I take a multivitamin, but I’m really bad about remembering. It’s just sitting in the cupboard, mostly. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. I really try to get most of what I need from my food. My grandma always said real food was the best medicine.
DOCTOR: I agree with your grandma wholeheartedly. Alright, just a few more questions, then we can proceed with the shots. Do you have any family history of serious illness—heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, my dad had heart trouble when he got older. He had a bypass surgery, I think. And my aunt on my mom’s side had diabetes. She wasn’t very careful about her diet, unfortunately. Otherwise, not really. Most of my family lived long, healthy lives. Lots of strong Tlingit genes, I guess!
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Strong genes are definitely a blessing. And finally, do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. My mom smoked for a while, but it always made me sick, so she quit when I was little. I've never had any interest in it, and my husband doesn't either. We both try to stay healthy. Fresh air and hard work, that's what keeps us going.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Ms. Fornes, that gives me a good overview. Now, let's do a quick physical exam just to make sure everything is as it should be. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good, Doctor. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart rate sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 128 over 76. And your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, let's just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears look clear, and your throat is normal. No signs of infection. Everything seems to be within normal limits. Do you have any concerns about what I’ve found so far?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds good to me. I’m glad everything checks out okay. I was a little worried about my tiredness, but I guess it’s just the heat. I always worry too much, my husband says. But better safe than sorry, right? So, what about the shots now? Do I need to roll up my sleeve?
DOCTOR: You're right to be proactive, Ms. Fornes. And it's always better to be safe. As for the tiredness, we’ll keep an eye on it. If it continues or worsens, let me know. And yes, let's proceed with the shots. If you could just roll up your sleeve, please. I'll give you both the flu and COVID booster today, in separate arms to minimize discomfort. Just a little pinch, and then we’ll have you all set for the season.
PATIENT: Okay, here we go. I never really liked needles, but I know it’s important. Just let me know when you’re ready. And try to relax, I guess. It’s just a little pinch, right?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Just a little pinch. I’ll be quick. Alright, that's the flu vaccine. And now the COVID booster. All done. See?
PATIENT: Ouch! Okay, yeah, that was a little pinch. But it's over now, right? It doesn't feel too bad, actually. Maybe I worried too much again. So, what now, Doctor? Do I need to wait here for a while, or can I go? And are there any side effects I should be looking out for?
DOCTOR: Yes, you did great. Just a little soreness is common, and it should subside within a day or two. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can help if needed. You can go about your day as usual, but it's best to avoid strenuous activity for the rest of the day, just to be safe. I’ll also give you a vaccination card to document that you’ve received the shots. As for side effects, some people experience mild fever, fatigue, or muscle aches, but these are usually temporary and resolve on their own within a few days. If you develop any severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or a high fever, please seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You explained everything really clearly, Doctor. Thank you so much for taking such good care of me. And for being so patient with my worrying! I appreciate it. I think I'll head home now and take it easy. Maybe a nice cup of tea is in order. Have a good day, Doctor Smetak.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fornes. It was my pleasure. And a cup of tea sounds like a perfect idea! Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your tea.
