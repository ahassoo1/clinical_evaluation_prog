DOCTOR: Good morning, Kahrin. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, if you're ready to go over them. I’m pretty busy today, so if we could just jump right in, that’d be great.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I appreciate you being upfront about your time constraints. Let's get right to it then. I have your lab results here from August 1st. Before we dive into the numbers, just to confirm, were you experiencing any specific symptoms that prompted these tests, or was this part of a routine check-up?
PATIENT: Neither, actually. It was… a requirement for a job. A new logistics position, pretty important one. They wanted everything checked before starting, just to be safe, I guess. No symptoms or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-employment screening. That's helpful to know. Alright, let's take a look. Overall, most of your results are within the normal range. Your complete blood count looks good, your metabolic panel is generally normal… there are a couple of things I’d like to discuss, though. Your Vitamin D level is a little low, and your cholesterol is slightly elevated. Do you have any family history of high cholesterol or vitamin deficiencies that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Vitamin D… not that I know of. My grandma on my mother’s side… she had some bone issues when she got really old, but I don't know if that's related. And cholesterol... my dad's side, yeah, a couple of them needed meds for it, I think. But nothing major. What does “slightly elevated” even mean? Is it something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: That's a good question. "Slightly elevated" means your total cholesterol is 210 mg/dL. Ideally, we like to see it below 200. Your LDL, which is the "bad" cholesterol, is at 145 – we want that below 100, especially with a family history. Your HDL, the "good" cholesterol, is a little low at 35 – we prefer above 40. And your triglycerides are normal. The bone issues your grandmother had could be related to Vitamin D, as it helps with calcium absorption. Regarding your family history, it does increase your risk. It's not necessarily something to panic about right now, but it's something we need to address to prevent potential problems down the line. Do you have any questions about those numbers?
PATIENT: Okay, so it's not terrible, but it's not great either. I think I understand. So, what do I do about it? Do I need medication? Because honestly, I really don't want to start meds if I can avoid it. Is there anything I can change with my diet or exercise? What’s the Vitamin D thing about? Do I need to sit in the sun all day?
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, and completely reasonable concerns. Let’s tackle them one by one. Medication isn’t necessarily the first step. Usually, we start with lifestyle modifications – diet and exercise. For your cholesterol, focusing on a heart-healthy diet – reducing saturated and trans fats, increasing fiber intake, and incorporating more omega-3 fatty acids – can make a significant difference. Regular exercise, at least 30 minutes most days of the week, is also very beneficial. As for Vitamin D, your level is at 25 ng/mL, and we aim for above 30. While sunlight is a good source of Vitamin D, it's not always practical, and you have to be careful about sun exposure. I recommend a Vitamin D supplement, around 2000 IU daily. Before we jump to a specific supplement, do you currently take any other vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t really bother with any of that stuff. I eat okay, I guess. Mostly just trying to get through the day, you know? 2000 IU… okay. Is that a lot? I always worry about taking too much of something. And what kind of diet are we talking about specifically? Because “heart-healthy” sounds… restrictive.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Heart-healthy” can sound daunting, but it doesn’t have to be overly restrictive. It’s more about making mindful choices. Think lean proteins – fish, chicken, beans – lots of fruits and vegetables, whole grains instead of processed ones, and healthy fats like those found in avocados, nuts, and olive oil. Reducing sugary drinks, processed foods, and red meat is also helpful. 2000 IU of Vitamin D is a safe starting dose for most adults, and it’s unlikely to cause any harm. We can always adjust it based on your response. To get a better sense of your current eating habits, would you be open to briefly discussing what a typical day of meals looks like for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. A typical day… okay. Breakfast is usually just coffee. Like, just coffee. Sometimes toast if I’m feeling ambitious. Lunch is usually whatever I can grab quickly – a sandwich from the deli, maybe a salad if I planned ahead, which rarely happens. Dinner… depends. Sometimes I cook, usually something simple like pasta. Other times it’s takeout. Lots of takeout. And I definitely snack. Chips, cookies… the usual. Does that sound terrible?
DOCTOR: That's very honest, and it's not about judging, it's about getting a clear picture. It sounds like there are some areas where we can make small changes that would have a big impact. The lack of breakfast and the frequent takeout are things we can address. Given your busy schedule, let's focus on a couple of achievable goals. How about we aim for a quick, healthy breakfast – maybe yogurt with fruit and granola – three times a week?
PATIENT: Okay, I think I can manage that. Yogurt and granola… yeah, that's doable. Three times a week. But that’s it. Don't tell me to start exercising too, please. And what about the Vitamin D? Do I need a prescription for that, or can I just buy it at the store? Because if I need a prescription, that’s a whole other thing I don’t have time for.
DOCTOR: No, absolutely no pressure for exercise right now. We'll focus on the breakfast and the Vitamin D for now. As for the Vitamin D, you can absolutely buy it at the store. It's available over-the-counter. Look for Vitamin D3 , as it's the form that your body absorbs best. A dosage of 2000 IU daily should be fine. So, to recap: We’re aiming for yogurt with fruit and granola for breakfast three times a week, and you’ll start taking a 2000 IU Vitamin D3 supplement daily. We’ll recheck your Vitamin D and cholesterol levels in three months to see how you're progressing. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. Three months. I can definitely do that. Is there anything else? Because honestly, I really need to get going. I have a… a meeting. A very important meeting.
DOCTOR: That sounds good. No, that's all for today. I'll send a summary of our discussion to your email, including the recommendations for breakfast and Vitamin D supplementation. I have a feeling you’ll do great. And congratulations on the new position—that sounds exciting. If you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. I wish you all the best with your meeting. Take care.
