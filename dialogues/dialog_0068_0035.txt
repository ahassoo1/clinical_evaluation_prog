DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… well, it feels like forever, honestly. Not constantly, but they pop up at the oddest times. It's a bit of a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, alright. And how long have they been… “popping up,” as you say?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started maybe a week and a half ago? Around the 20th of July, I reckon. It wasn’t constant then either, just a few here and there. But they’ve gotten more frequent these last few days. Mostly after I eat, but not always. Sometimes just… randomly. It’s funny, isn't it? You'd think at my age, my body would know better than to start hiccuping!
DOCTOR: A week and a half… increasing frequency, particularly after eating, but not exclusively. And you said July 20th, roughly?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. July 20th… I remember because that was the day old Mr. Henderson finally got his garden tomatoes to ripen. We were talking about it at the nurses’ station, you see. He was so proud! But yes, around then, that's when I noticed them starting. Nothing serious, just… annoying. I tried holding my breath a few times, you know, like you’re supposed to, but that doesn’t seem to be doing the trick anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the hiccups, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No, not really. No pain, no trouble breathing, no… well, nothing that I’ve noticed. I’m still eating normally, still sleeping okay. Maybe a little tired, but that’s just getting old, I suppose! I haven't felt sick or anything, just… hiccuping. It's just these pesky hiccups bothering me. Is it something to worry about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, hiccups are usually harmless and go away on their own. But given the duration… and just to be thorough, let’s do a quick examination. Nothing major, just listen to your lungs, check your heart, and a quick feel of your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best. I don’t mind a bit of poking and prodding if it helps find out what’s causing these little fits. My lungs are probably full of Fijian sunshine and salt air, anyway! Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here for me. Deep breath in… and out… good. Again… deep breath… and out. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackling that I can detect. Heart rate is regular, no murmurs. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No tenderness, Doctor. Not a bit. Just… well, a bit of a tummy, if you don't mind me saying! I always did enjoy a good pie. But no, nothing hurts. It feels… normal, I suppose. Though I haven't exactly been paying close attention to my abdomen lately, if I'm honest. Is something wrong? You seem to be concentrating very hard.
DOCTOR: No, nothing alarming so far. Just routine. A little bit of fullness, as you said. Alright. Given the duration, and the fact that simple remedies haven’t worked… and just to be safe, I’m going to order a few blood tests. Just to rule out anything unusual. Things like electrolyte imbalances, kidney function, and a complete blood count. Do you have any allergies to blood draws or latex?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests… alright. Sounds sensible, Doctor. I don’t mind a bit of poking, really. And no, no allergies. Not to blood draws or latex or anything else, as far as I know. I've had blood tests before, plenty of times, working in the hospital. Though it’s been a while since I was the patient, you see. Working as a psychiatric aide, you don't often get poked and prodded yourself! It’s always looking after others.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Alright, I’ll get the lab order sent over. It’s just a routine precaution. In the meantime, I’d like you to keep a little diary of when the hiccups occur. Note what you’re doing, what you’ve eaten, and anything else that might be relevant. It may help us identify a pattern. And avoid carbonated beverages for a few days, just in case. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a diary! That’s a good idea, Doctor. I used to keep a garden journal, so I’m quite used to writing things down. I'll jot down everything – what I’m doing, what I eat, the time of day… anything that pops into my head. And no fizzy drinks… that’s no hardship at all, I rarely drink them anyway. A nice cup of herbal tea is much more my style. Yes, I can do that perfectly well. Hopefully, we'll figure out what’s causing these little hiccups soon! Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sucich. We’ll take it one step at a time. The lab results should be back in a few days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. I’ll have the nurse schedule that for you on your way out. And if the hiccups become severe – if they interfere with your breathing or eating, or if they are accompanied by other symptoms – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand perfectly, Doctor. A follow-up appointment sounds good. And I’ll remember to go to the emergency room if they get really bad. Though I'm hoping it won't come to that! I'm a fairly sturdy old woman, I don’t scare easily. But it's good to know what to do. Thank you again for your time and attention, Doctor Sham. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sucich. It was a pleasure meeting you. The nurse will be right with you to schedule that follow-up. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
