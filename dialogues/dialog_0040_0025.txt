DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Scobie, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Laury Scobie. But everyone just calls me Laury. Good to meet you, Doctor... Osga, right? I think I read your name on the door.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, Dr. Osga is fine. Look, I have quite a full schedule today, so let's get straight to it. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Sorry. Um... I want to know more about where my family comes from. Really, really far back. My daughter, she got one of those tests… DNA, it was. Said it showed all sorts of things. I want one too, to see. To know. Is that… is that something you can do here?
DOCTOR: A DNA test?
PATIENT: Yeah. She said it was easy. Just a little spit in a tube. Showed where people from long, long ago came from. I’m Marshallese, you know, but… I heard stories. About other places. Before. I just want to see if the test can tell me something. Is it… expensive? I have Medicare.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, this isn't really a medical issue. We are a family medical practice. We treat illnesses, not… genealogy. Medicare certainly won’t cover a hobby. I suggest you consult a… historian. Or one of those ancestry websites. Honestly.
PATIENT: Oh. Oh, I see. I… I didn’t know. My daughter, she said it was a health thing, kind of. To see if there’s… problems in the family, from long ago. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to bother you with… a hobby. Is there nothing you can do? Maybe just… tell me if it's even safe? For an old man like me?
DOCTOR: “Safe”?
PATIENT: Well, you know… I read on the internet sometimes things can be… surprising? And I’m not so young anymore. What if it tells me something… bad? Something that will… worry me? I don’t know. Maybe I shouldn't do it. It’s just… I’m curious. My daughter, she says it's fun. But I don’t want to get myself upset. Is it something that could… make you sick, thinking about it too much?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, honestly. You’re 85 years old. You’ve lived a long life. The internet is not a reliable source of medical information. Frankly, obsessing over the genetic predispositions of ancestors you'll never meet sounds like a recipe for anxiety. You're wasting my time, and quite frankly, your own energy. Now, is there anything actual bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. No… no, not really. Just… the curiosity. My daughter, she said it was interesting. I just… wanted to ask. Sorry to bother you, Doctor. I guess I’ll just… forget about it. It's probably silly, for an old man. Maybe it is just anxiety, like you said.
DOCTOR: .
