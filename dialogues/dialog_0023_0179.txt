DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you. Well, it is… difficult to explain. I find… the words… they do not come so easily now. It is frustrating, you understand?
DOCTOR: Frustrating, yes, I can appreciate that. Let's take our time. Perhaps you could start by telling me when you first noticed this difficulty with words?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? That is… a good question. It was not sudden, no. More… gradual. Perhaps… six months ago? Maybe a little longer? I am not certain. It started with… forgetting names, small things. Now… it is… harder to find the right words for everything. It is… worrisome.
DOCTOR: Six months, gradual onset. Okay. And can you give me an example of what you mean by "harder to find the right words"?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. For example… yesterday, I was speaking with a friend about… the garden. And I wanted to say… the red flowers… but the word… it escaped me. I knew what I meant, of course. Beautiful red… things. But the name… it was gone. I ended up saying “those colorful… bloom things”. It was… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: So, difficulty with word retrieval, specifically naming objects. And is this happening frequently now?
PATIENT: Yes, frequently. It is… almost every day now. Sometimes it is just small things, like… the name of a tool. Other times… it is words I use often. It is… unsettling. I used to be very precise with my language. It is… concerning, yes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the word-finding difficulties, have you noticed any other changes in your thinking or memory?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. I… sometimes I feel a little… confused. Not all the time. Just… moments. Like… forgetting what I was about to say mid-sentence. Or… losing track of the conversation. It is… not a major problem, not yet. But it is… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Moments of confusion, loss of train of thought. Have you experienced any difficulty with tasks that require planning or organization?
PATIENT: Planning… organization? Yes, perhaps. I used to manage all the finances, you see. Very neatly. Now… sometimes I find it difficult to keep track of everything. Bills… appointments… It is… a small thing, I think. I just make more lists now. But it is… different. I used to do it all in my head. It is old age, perhaps?
DOCTOR: We’ll determine the cause, Mr. Gyamfi. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… yes. I had… pneumonia, many years ago. Perhaps… twenty years? I recovered fully. And… I had my appendix removed when I was young. That is… all I can recall, really. I am a generally healthy man, Doctor. Or… I was.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia twenty years ago, appendectomy in youth. Any family history of neurological conditions like dementia or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That is a difficult question. My wife… she passed away some years ago. She had… some memory problems in her later years, yes. The doctor said… something about her mind, but I do not recall the exact words. It was… a long time ago, and I was… very upset. I do not know if it was… the same as this.
DOCTOR: Memory problems in wife, details unclear. Let’s talk about your current medications. Are you taking any prescription drugs, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Medications… yes. I take… a blood pressure tablet, once a day. The doctor prescribed it a few years ago. And… I take a vitamin D supplement, during the winter months. That is all, I believe. Oh, and sometimes I take a… something for my sleep, when I cannot rest. But only occasionally.
DOCTOR: What is the name of the sleep medication, Mr. Gyamfi?
PATIENT: The name… hmm. It is… a small, white pill. I… I do not recall the name, Doctor. My daughter… she helps me with my medications. She knows everything. It is… frustrating, I apologize.
DOCTOR: Unable to recall name of sleep medication. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no. Not that I am aware of. I have never had a reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I am a very simple man, Doctor. I do not take many things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gyamfi. I’m going to perform a brief neurological exam. It will involve some simple tests of your memory, balance, and reflexes. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A neurological exam… yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I am happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit here, and I’ll begin with a few cognitive tests. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date…? Hmm. Is it… August? Yes, I believe it is August. But the… number… I am… uncertain.
DOCTOR: August, but uncertain of the day. Now, can you spell the word “world” for me?
PATIENT: Spell… "world"? Hmm… W… O… R… L… D? Yes, I believe that is correct.
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words, and I'll ask you to recall them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I am ready. Please, go ahead. I will try my best.
DOCTOR: The three words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes. Apple, table, penny. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, let’s move on to some physical assessments. Please follow my finger with your eyes, but do not move your head.
PATIENT: I am following… yes. Like this? It is… a little difficult.
DOCTOR: Yes, good. Now, I'm going to test your balance. Please stand up slowly and try to balance on one leg for thirty seconds. Which leg would you prefer?
PATIENT: Balance… hmm. My… right leg, I think. It is… more stable. Please… be patient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gyamfi, please sit down. That was sufficient. Now, I’ll assess your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes… yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. I hope… I hope everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gyamfi. That concludes the examination. Based on what I’ve observed, and your reported symptoms, I am concerned about possible early signs of cognitive impairment. I would like to order some blood work and an MRI of the brain to further evaluate this. We also need to get a more detailed history from someone who knows you well. Would you be able to bring a family member or close friend to a follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Cognitive impairment…? MRI…? That sounds… serious, Doctor. A friend… yes. My daughter, perhaps. She… she worries about me. But… what does this mean? What have you found?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gyamfi, I want to be clear: this does not necessarily mean a definitive diagnosis. However, your difficulty with memory recall, changes in language, moments of confusion, and the asymmetry I observed in your reflexes raise concerns. The MRI will help us rule out other potential causes, such as stroke or tumor, and assess for any structural changes in your brain. The blood work will check for vitamin deficiencies and other medical conditions that can sometimes mimic cognitive impairment. Bringing your daughter to a follow-up appointment will be helpful, as she can provide a more complete history and help us understand how your cognitive function has changed over time. We will discuss the results of these tests in detail at your next appointment and determine the best course of action. I am referring you to a neurologist, Dr. Evelyn Reed, for a specialist evaluation. Her contact information is… Do you have any immediate questions before I provide you with this referral and the necessary lab orders?
PATIENT: Neurologist… so many tests… It is… overwhelming, Doctor. My daughter… yes, I will bring her. She will… she will know what to do. But… what if…? What if it is something serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gyamfi, I understand your anxiety. It’s natural to be concerned when faced with uncertainty. However, I strongly advise against jumping to conclusions. We are simply gathering information at this stage. A diagnosis requires thorough investigation, and that’s precisely what we’re doing. Focus on taking care of yourself, and let Dr. Reed conduct a comprehensive evaluation. I’ve also included a brochure with resources for cognitive health. We will discuss all possible scenarios at your follow-up appointment. For now, concentrate on keeping your routine and ensuring your daughter is available to assist with your medical care. Do you have any questions about scheduling these appointments or the necessary preparations?
PATIENT: Routine… yes. I… I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. No… no further questions. Just… please… do everything you can. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Gyamfi. I'll see you and your daughter at your follow-up appointment. Please contact the office if you have any difficulties scheduling.
