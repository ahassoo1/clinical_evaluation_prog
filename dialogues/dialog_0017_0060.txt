DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I am Dr. Blim. So, tell me, what brings a young man like yourself in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning, Doctor. Honestly? It's probably nothing, but my mother… she had a lot of health problems. And my grandmother too, on that side of the family. Lots of… things. I just want to make sure I’m not headed down the same path, you know? Preventative stuff. It’s better to be safe than sorry, I guess.
DOCTOR: Preventative care is… admirable, I suppose. Though often unnecessary in someone your age. Still. “Lots of things” isn’t a very helpful description, Mr. Theriot. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: It’s… a long list. Heart problems mostly, with my mother. And then my grandmother had… something with her memory, I think? They never really talked about it much. And… arthritis, bad arthritis. Both of them. It was just… a lot of suffering, honestly. I don't even know what kinds of tests they had. I just remember a lot of doctor’s appointments and… pain. It's probably nothing, like I said. But I don’t want to end up like that.
DOCTOR: “Something with her memory,” you say. Was this diagnosed as dementia, Alzheimer’s, or some other cognitive impairment?
PATIENT: Honestly, I have no idea. Like I said, they didn't really talk about it. It was more… she just started forgetting things. Important things. Eventually, she needed someone with her pretty much all the time. It was… uncomfortable. My aunt handled most of it. I was still in school, mostly. So I just… didn’t ask. It wasn’t a conversation anyone wanted to have. Is that… a bad thing? Should I have pushed it? I don’t know. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: It would have been ideal if a formal diagnosis had been established. But we can only work with the information available. Let's move on. Do you experience any memory problems yourself?
PATIENT: No. Of course not. I have a very good memory. I'm an engineer, Doctor. We have to remember things. Formulas, designs, codes… it’s not like I'm forgetting things. It's just… I worry about the potential. You know? Like, is it genetic? Am I just… predisposed to it? It's probably irrational, but it keeps me up at night.
DOCTOR: Predisposition does not equate to inevitability, Mr. Theriot. While family history is a factor, lifestyle choices and other variables play a significant role. Now, let’s get a better understanding of your current health status. Do you have any current medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I’m very healthy. I eat reasonably well, I exercise… I wouldn’t be coming to you if I was falling apart, would I? I’m here for preventative measures, remember? Not to be treated for something I don’t have. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like you think I’m being ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I am simply attempting to gather a complete medical history, Mr. Theriot. A responsible physician must rule out existing conditions before attributing concerns to hypothetical future possibilities. Do you take any medications at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't believe in loading up on pills for every little thing. I get a yearly physical through my insurance, but they just run the standard bloodwork. Cholesterol, blood sugar… everything’s always fine. Perfectly normal. I told you, I'm healthy. It’s this family history that’s causing the anxiety, not a pre-existing condition. Is it so hard to understand?
DOCTOR: Very well. Allergies?
PATIENT: No. None that I'm aware of. I’ve never had any serious reactions to anything. A little bit of seasonal sniffles, maybe, but nothing a tissue can’t handle. Really, Doctor, are we going to go through every possible ailment? I thought we were discussing my mother and grandmother.
DOCTOR: We are establishing a baseline, Mr. Theriot. Now, let’s discuss your social habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. Absolutely not. I’m an engineer, remember? We have brains to protect. Do you think I would jeopardize my career—and my health—with something as… barbaric as smoking? Honestly, I’m starting to question the value of this appointment.
DOCTOR: Alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. A beer with friends, sometimes. Nothing excessive. I’m not an alcoholic, if that's what you're implying. I’m a functioning adult. It’s called socializing, Doctor. Have you heard of it? I'm perfectly capable of moderation. Really, this feels… invasive. And frankly, a little patronizing.
DOCTOR: Very well. One final question. I’m going to perform a brief physical examination, starting with your neurological functions. I need you to follow my instructions carefully. Do you consent?
PATIENT: I… suppose. But if it involves poking and prodding, I’m not promising I’ll be cooperative. I’m here about my family history, not to be treated like a child. Just… get it over with quickly, please. And explain what you're doing before you do it. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit forward. I will begin with a simple assessment of your cranial nerves. Look straight ahead. Now, follow my finger. Do not move your head.
PATIENT: Is this necessary? It's making me feel a little dizzy, honestly. I'm perfectly capable of seeing fine, I assure you. I design complex systems for a living. This seems… excessive.
DOCTOR: It's a standard procedure, Mr. Theriot. Now, close your eyes. Can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes! Of course, I can feel that! It’s… cold. And a little uncomfortable. What are you even looking for? Are you checking for… something? This is ridiculous. Honestly, I think I’ve wasted my time coming here. It’s just causing me anxiety.
DOCTOR: I am assessing your sensory perception. Now, please squeeze my hands. As firmly as you can. Do not anticipate. I will indicate when to stop.
PATIENT: There. Happy? It’s perfectly normal grip strength. I do work with my hands, you know. Designing and building prototypes. This is all very… pointless. I’m starting to feel quite stressed out, actually. And I came here to reduce my anxiety, remember?
DOCTOR: Very well. I have gathered sufficient information for a preliminary assessment. Based on your account, and the limited neurological examination, I do not find any immediate cause for concern. However, given your family history, I recommend a baseline MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities. It's a precautionary measure, Mr. Theriot. Preventative, as you wished. Do you concur?
PATIENT: An MRI… Honestly, that seems a bit extreme. It's expensive, isn't it? And… isn’t there radiation involved? I thought we were just talking about peace of mind. Now you’re suggesting a potentially invasive and costly procedure. I… I need to think about it. Can I at least get a referral? And some information about the costs involved? I don’t want to commit to something without knowing all the facts.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will provide you with a referral to a reputable radiology center and some informational pamphlets regarding MRI procedures and associated costs. However, I must emphasize that delaying this assessment may not be in your best interest, given your family history. I will also provide a list of resources for managing anxiety, should you find that beneficial. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. Though, honestly, I’m not sure this appointment was as helpful as I’d hoped. It’s just… increased my anxiety, really. I’ll… think about the MRI. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Theriot. Have a… pleasant day. .
