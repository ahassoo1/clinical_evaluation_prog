DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this breathing. It’s… troublesome when I try to lie flat. It feels like I can’t quite get enough air. It started a few weeks ago, I believe. August 1st, to be precise.
DOCTOR: August 1st…right. And it's specifically when lying flat?
PATIENT: Yes. If I sit up, or even prop myself up with a couple of pillows, it’s much better. But when I try to sleep… or even just rest lying down… it’s difficult. I used to sleep just fine, you know. A good eight hours. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And you said a few weeks ago it began?
PATIENT: Yes. The first night I really noticed it was July 28th. I remember because my granddaughter, Lila, was visiting, and I couldn’t sleep, so I made her hot chocolate at 2 am. She was a good sport about it. It wasn’t bad bad then, just… noticeable. It’s gotten worse since.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the difficulty breathing when lying down, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think. My ankles have been a little swollen lately. Not terribly, but enough to notice. And I’ve been feeling… a bit more tired than usual, even with a full night’s sleep – when I can get one, of course. I don’t know if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Swollen ankles and increased fatigue. Anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I can recall. I've been eating regularly, same as always. No chest pain, no coughing, nothing like that. Just the breathing and the swelling. And the tiredness. It’s really the breathing that worries me. It’s… unsettling. I’ve never had trouble breathing before.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's go over some medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I had my gallbladder removed twenty years ago. And I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it's not too bad. Just a little stiffness in the mornings. Otherwise, I've been quite healthy, really. I don't take any regular medications, aside from a vitamin D supplement the doctor recommended last winter.
DOCTOR: And no allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to be able to eat anything, but I’ve become a bit more careful in my old age. Mostly just try to avoid too much sugar now. It doesn’t agree with me. But no allergies to medications, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And family history?
PATIENT: My mother lived to be ninety-two, a very strong woman. She had a bit of high blood pressure towards the end, but otherwise, she was healthy. My father… he passed away when I was young, from a heart condition, I believe. And my brother had some trouble with his cholesterol, but that’s about it. Nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your legs for swelling, and take your blood pressure. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Very well. I suppose that’s a good idea. I’d like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind. It’s just… I have a pottery class this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get started. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. A little crackling in the bases of both lungs. Not alarming, but worth noting. And yes, some mild edema in both ankles and lower legs. Blood pressure is 140/90. A bit elevated.
PATIENT: Well, that doesn’t sound very good, does it? The crackling… and the blood pressure. Is that serious, Doctor? I just want to know what’s going on, and if it’s something I need to worry about. I’d really appreciate a straightforward answer, if you please.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily immediately alarming, Ms. Vanderwiele, but it does suggest a few possibilities. The crackling in your lungs, along with the shortness of breath when lying flat and the swelling in your ankles, could indicate some fluid buildup, potentially related to your heart. The elevated blood pressure doesn’t help. Now, this could be a number of things, including, but not limited to, congestive heart failure. We'll need to run some tests to confirm. I'm going to order a chest X-ray, an EKG, and some blood work, including a BNP to check for heart strain.
PATIENT: Congestive… heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. My brother, he had something like that. Is that what you think it is? I just want to be clear. And how long will these tests take? I really don’t want to miss my pottery class. It’s a new technique I’m trying.
DOCTOR: Ms. Vanderwiele, I said it could be. We haven't confirmed anything yet. Jumping to conclusions won’t help. The tests will take a few hours to process. I’ll have the results sent to me, and we can discuss them this afternoon. As for your pottery class… frankly, your hobby is not my primary concern right now. We need to rule out any serious underlying condition. I’ll write the orders for the lab and X-ray now. The nurse will come in and take your blood and direct you to radiology.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results. I suppose I can reschedule the class. It’s just… I was looking forward to it. Thank you. I’ll wait for the nurse.
