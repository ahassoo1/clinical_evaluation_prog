DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s this foot. It’s been a bother, a real bother. Been having this sore on it for…oh, quite some time now. Longer than it should, if you ask me. And I’ve tried things, you know? Things my mother used to do. But nothing seems to work.
DOCTOR: Right. A sore on your foot. And you’ve been attempting…home remedies, I gather?
PATIENT: Home remedies? Honestly, Doctor, it’s not like I’ve been rubbing dirt on it. My mother was a very sensible woman, knew a thing or two about healing. Poultices, mostly. And keeping it clean, of course. But this isn’t just any sore, you know. It’s…deep. And it doesn't seem to be getting better. I’m a diabetic, if that matters. Though I keep it under control, mostly.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see your history of diabetes here. That does matter, significantly. It can affect healing. And “mostly” under control isn’t terribly reassuring. When were you last checked – your A1C, I mean?
PATIENT: Oh, don't you start with me about "mostly." I do what I can. And the A1C… let me see. It was… last November, I think. With Doctor Sharma. Before he retired. A perfectly good doctor, he was. Though a bit young, if you ask me. And it was… a good number. I remember because I was quite pleased with myself. I've been watching my sugar, I assure you. Though these mangoes have been particularly tempting this year.
DOCTOR: November is quite a while ago, Louine. We really need a more recent reading. But let's focus on the foot for now. Can you describe the sore to me?
PATIENT: Well, it's on the bottom of my foot, right here. It’s not a neat little thing, mind you. It’s… crater-like. And it weeps. Quite a bit, actually. I have to keep it bandaged, otherwise it makes a mess of everything. And it aches, a dull, throbbing ache. It’s particularly bad when I stand for too long. I used to be able to walk for miles, you know. Miles! Now… it’s a struggle to get to the market.
DOCTOR: Right. “Crater-like” and weeping. And affecting your ability to walk. I'm going to need to take a look at it properly. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I suppose so. It's not a pretty sight, you know. My feet aren't what they used to be. All these years, standing and walking... it takes its toll. Be gentle, now. I bruise easily. There. Take a good look. It’s gotten worse, hasn’t it?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, it's a fairly deep ulcer. There's some surrounding redness and… I detect a bit of odor. The tissue looks…compromised. It's not surprising it’s not healing with diabetes in the picture, but we need to rule out infection. I'm concerned about potential osteomyelitis - an infection of the bone. Do you have a fever?
PATIENT: Osteo… what now? Honestly, Doctor, you're using words I don’t understand. And no, I do not have a fever. I took my temperature this morning. Perfectly normal. I always take my temperature when I'm not feeling quite right. My mother taught me that. You're making it sound dreadful. Is it serious? Because if it’s serious, I need to know. Don't beat around the bush. I'm 89 years old, Doctor. I've seen things. I can handle the truth.
DOCTOR: It could be serious, Louine. Osteomyelitis is a bone infection, and it can be very difficult to treat, especially with underlying diabetes. That's why we need to get some tests done. We need to determine the extent of the infection, if any, and identify the specific bacteria involved. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count and inflammatory markers. And I want an X-ray of your foot. Possibly a bone scan, depending on the results of the X-ray. I’m also going to need a sample from the wound itself for culture. That will tell us exactly what we're dealing with.
PATIENT: Tests, tests, tests. Always more tests. Honestly, Doctor, it's a wonder I still have any blood left. Alright, alright. Do what you have to do. But I don't want any poking and prodding if I can help it. And no sticking needles in me unless it's absolutely necessary. What about the pain? It's been quite bad, you know. Can’t you give me something for the pain? Something strong? Because this throbbing is driving me mad.
DOCTOR: We can certainly address the pain, Louine. I’ll prescribe a mild opioid pain reliever to start, something to take as needed. However, we need to be cautious with long-term opioid use, especially given your age. The blood work and X-ray are the priority right now. We need to understand the source of the problem before we can effectively manage the symptoms. I'll have the nurse draw the blood, and then we’ll send you over to radiology for the X-ray. And I’ll need a wound culture done in the clinic before you leave. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Wound culture… blood work… X-rays… Honestly, it's all rather overwhelming. And I do not like the sound of a "wound culture." Sounds unpleasant. Yes, yes, I understand. Do what you have to do. Just... be quick about it, please. And make sure whoever does the blood work has steady hands. I've had some bad experiences in the past. And I expect a thorough explanation of the results, Doctor. No medical jargon. I want to understand what's going on with my foot, in plain English. Now, when can I expect those results?
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes 24 to 48 hours for the blood work results. The wound culture may take a bit longer, closer to 72 hours, as it needs time to grow. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you once we have everything back. We’ll review the results together, in plain English as you requested. In the meantime, keep the wound clean and dry, and try to minimize weight-bearing on that foot. And take the pain medication as directed. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions? Well… Yes, actually. Can I still eat my mangoes? I know you said something about sugar, but they're so delicious. And I’ve been enjoying them so much. A little bit won't hurt, will it? And what about walking? I need to get to the market, you know. I can't just stay cooped up inside all day. Is a little bit of walking alright? A very little bit?
DOCTOR: Louine, with respect, the mangoes are…suboptimal. A small amount might be permissible, but it really depends on your blood sugar levels. We need those lab results before I can give you a definitive answer. Regarding walking… absolutely minimize it until we know the extent of the infection. You risk further damage and potential complications. I understand you need to get to the market, but your foot’s health is the priority. Perhaps a family member or friend could assist you until we have more information?
PATIENT: Family? Don't get me started on family, Doctor. They’re all… busy. Too busy to bother with an old woman and her foot. Alright, alright. No mangoes. And very little walking. I get the message. You're a very thorough doctor, I'll give you that. Though a bit…strict. Very well. I suppose I can manage. Just get those tests done quickly, please. And let me know if it's something dreadful. Because if it's something dreadful, I want to be prepared. Now, where is this nurse you spoke of? Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be right with you. She’s just finishing up with another patient. She’ll explain the procedure and draw the necessary blood samples. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask. .
