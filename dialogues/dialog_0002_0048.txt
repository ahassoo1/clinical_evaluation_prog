DOCTOR: Hi Colt, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s good to meet you too, I suppose. My wife, she insisted I come. Says I’ve been…forgetful. Not that I think so, but she worries. Mostly just little things, getting turned around, not remembering what I had for lunch. That sort of thing. She calls them “episodes of confusion”, sounds rather dramatic, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It's good of your wife to be so attentive, and it’s very common for family members to notice changes before we do ourselves. "Dramatic" or not, it’s always best to check things out. Little things can sometimes add up to something we want to address. So, these "episodes of confusion"—can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, let me think. They don't happen all the time. Maybe…a couple times a week? It's usually in the afternoon, I think. I'll be doing something – fixing a tile, or watching the news – and suddenly I just…lose my train of thought. Like a blank spot. Then it comes back, usually pretty quickly, but it’s unsettling. I wouldn’t call it scary, but it’s…frustrating. And I absolutely know what day it is, don’t get me wrong. It’s August 2nd, 2025, as you can see. I keep a calendar.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of times a week, mostly in the afternoons. Losing your train of thought—and it sounds like you're aware of what's happening and it resolves quickly. And you know the date, which is good. Just to get a clearer picture, can you recall if anything specific seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger? No, not that I’ve noticed. It's not like I get confused when I'm tired, or if I’m stressed. I've been setting tile for forty years, you know. I'm used to hard work. And my wife keeps the house very tidy, so it’s not like I’m overwhelmed by clutter or anything. Honestly, I think she just likes to worry. She always has. It’s probably just getting old, to be honest. People forget things, don’t they?
DOCTOR: It certainly can be a part of getting older, you’re right. But it’s still important to rule out other potential causes. Just to be thorough, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, my wife is always on me about my blood pressure, says it runs a little high. The doctor told me to watch the salt, you know? But I take my pills, every morning. Other than that, no. I’ve always been a strong, healthy man. Never been much for doctors, to be honest. Prefer to just get on with things. I eat alright, mostly. My wife does most of the cooking now. She likes to make these… complicated things. Not really my taste, but it's better than nothing. I don’t have any heart problems, or diabetes, or anything like that. Never smoked, barely drink.
DOCTOR: Okay, so managed hypertension with medication, otherwise generally healthy. No history of smoking or alcohol use. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh, years ago, when I was maybe thirty, I broke my arm falling off a ladder. Setting tile on a roof, foolish thing to do in the rain, I suppose. Had a cast on for a few months. Other than that…no. I’ve been remarkably lucky, really. Never needed a hospital, never wanted to. I healed up fine, good as new. It’s a strong arm, still. I use it every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm years ago, fully recovered. That’s helpful. And just to get a complete picture, are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… well, sometimes I take something for my arthritis in my hands. Just when it flares up. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. Over the counter stuff. And occasionally, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take a little something. A sleeping pill, but not very often. Maybe once or twice a month. My wife keeps them in the bathroom cabinet. I don’t really keep track. It’s not a regular thing. Mostly, just the blood pressure pills, every morning with my coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and an occasional sleeping pill. Blood pressure medication daily. Good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have had memory problems, dementia, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Well, my mother… she got a little confused towards the end. Very old, though, ninety-something. She wasn't really with it the last few years. My wife says that’s just what happens when people get old. My father was perfectly sharp all his life, could remember everything. My brother is fine, as far as I know. We don’t see him much anymore. He lives in Phnom Penh. Doesn’t really talk about these things. It wasn't a topic of conversation in my family, to be honest. People just…got old. That was it.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother had some confusion late in life, but otherwise no strong family history of memory problems. Finally, before we do a quick exam, I want to ask about your social habits. Do you drink alcohol, use tobacco products, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! I told you, I barely drink. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe, on a special occasion. And I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit. Recreational drugs? What do you take me for? I’m a tile setter! A hardworking, honest man. I spend my days setting tile, not… whatever it is people do with those things. My wife would have my hide if I even thought about such a thing. No, no drugs. Absolutely not.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Colt. It’s good to have a clear picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. It won’t take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I have tiles to set, you know. But don’t take too long. I've got a job to finish by the end of the week. And please, be gentle. My wife will be furious if I pull a muscle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Not alarmingly so, but consistent with what your wife has mentioned. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your reflexes are normal, and your coordination seems good. I'm going to check your memory a little bit now, just a few simple questions. Can you tell me today's date again?
PATIENT: August 2nd, 2025. As I said, I keep a calendar. It's right on the kitchen wall. Really, Doctor, are you questioning my memory? I may have a little trouble finding my train of thought sometimes, but I know the date.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that came across that way, Colt. I’m not questioning your memory; I just need to complete a standard assessment. It’s a routine part of the exam. Now, can you recall three unrelated words that I will say?
PATIENT: Go ahead. But if they're complicated words, I’m telling you now, I may have trouble. I set tile, I don’t play Scrabble.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: apple, table, and penny. Try to remember those, and I’ll ask you to recall them in a few moments.
PATIENT: Alright. Apple, table, penny. Got it. It’s like a little game, isn’t it? Still, wasting my time when I should be working.
DOCTOR: Now, I'm going to ask you to count backwards from 100 by sevens. It can be a little tricky, don’t worry if you stumble.
PATIENT: One hundred… ninety-three… eighty-six… seventy-nine… sixty-two… fifty-five… forty-eight… forty-one… Now wait a minute… thirty-four… twenty-seven… twenty… oh, dear. This is ridiculous. I can set a perfectly level tile, but I can’t count backwards by seven? What kind of test is this? I think I need a glass of water. This is making my head spin.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Colt. Don't worry about it. It is a little challenging. And you’re right, you probably need a glass of water. Here you go. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, you're experiencing some memory lapses and some difficulty with certain cognitive tasks. The forgetting, coupled with the trouble counting backwards, raises some concerns. It could be due to a number of things, from stress and mild cognitive impairment to early signs of dementia. However, it's too early to tell for sure. I recommend we do some further testing to get a clearer picture. I'd like to order a blood test to rule out any underlying medical conditions like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. And I also think it would be beneficial for you to undergo a more comprehensive cognitive assessment with a neurologist. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Now hold on a minute. You're making a lot out of nothing. I just get a little… forgetful sometimes. It's old age, I tell you. I don’t need to see a specialist, and I certainly don’t need blood tests. My wife will be thrilled. She's always convinced I'm on my last legs. Honestly, Doctor, I think I'm fine. Just a bit tired. Maybe I'll take a nap. But a neurologist… no. Absolutely not. I'm not wasting my time, or my money, on that.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Colt. You're right to be concerned about wasting your time and money. And I certainly don't want to push you into anything you're not comfortable with. However, given your symptoms, and the fact that they are causing you some concern, I strongly recommend at least considering the cognitive assessment. It’s not about assuming the worst, it’s about gathering more information so we can accurately identify the cause of your memory lapses and ensure you receive the appropriate care. The assessment is a non-invasive test that can provide valuable insights. I can provide you with a referral to a highly respected neurologist in the area. You don’t have to make an appointment right away. You can simply consult with the neurologist, discuss your concerns, and then decide whether or not to proceed with any further testing. In the meantime, I recommend you focus on getting adequate rest, maintaining a healthy diet, and staying mentally active. Perhaps try doing some puzzles or engaging in activities you enjoy. Would you be willing to at least take the referral so you have the option to consult with the neurologist if you feel your symptoms worsen?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Just to get my wife off my back. But I’m telling you, it’s probably nothing. A waste of time and money, but… alright. Give me the referral. But no promises, you hear? No promises I’ll actually go. And I don't want any complicated tests, understand? Just a quick look, and then tell me I’m fine. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: Of course, Colt. We'll take things one step at a time. The neurologist will discuss all available options with you and you can make an informed decision. Here’s the referral information. The neurologist is Dr. Anya Sharma, and her number is 555-123-4567. I'll also send the results of your blood pressure check to your primary care physician, and recommend that you schedule a follow up visit with him to discuss your overall health. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just…thank you. I suppose. I need to go set some tile. That’s what I do. That’s what keeps me sane. And please, don't worry about me. I’m a strong man. I’ll be fine. .
DOCTOR: Alright Colt. You take care. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call. .
