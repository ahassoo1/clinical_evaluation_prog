DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you. I want to… how you say… find out more about where my family come from. I hear you can do test, with spit, to tell you this? I want to know more about my ancestors.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. You’re interested in genetic ancestry testing. That's something we can definitely discuss. It involves analyzing your DNA from a saliva sample to estimate your ethnic origins and trace your family history. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little more about why you're interested in this testing now, specifically?
PATIENT: Well… I’m old now. Eighty-five. And I never ask my parents, you know? They gone long time. And I always wonder… my island, it small. Majuro. But people come and go. I want to know… where really from, before I… before I go too. Does that make sense? It important to me now.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, that makes perfect sense. It’s wonderful you’re wanting to connect with your roots. It’s never too late to learn about your family history, and I understand the importance of doing that, especially now. Okay. So, this testing can give you an estimate of your ancestral origins, but it's important to remember it’s an estimate. It won't tell you everything, and it's not a perfect science. Are you aware of any family stories or traditions that might give us a starting point before we consider testing?
PATIENT: Hmm… stories. Not much, I think. My grandma, she talk about boats. Big boats, before America. She say people come from other islands, maybe Samoa? But she old, maybe she forget. Mostly fishing stories. And how to build canoes. She teach me that. Not much about where from, before Majuro. Mostly just… how to live on island. It good living. I just… curious now. About the before-before.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, a possible connection to Samoa through family stories, though it's uncertain. And a strong oral tradition around island life and seafaring skills. That's very common and valuable information. Before we order the test, I want to make sure you understand what it involves and its limitations. The test usually requires a saliva sample collected in your mouth. We send it to a lab, and they analyze your DNA. The results typically take several weeks to come back. They'll provide a percentage breakdown of your estimated ethnic origins, with a map showing potential ancestral regions. Do you have any questions about the process itself, or what the results will look like?
PATIENT: Weeks? That long? Okay. What if… what if it say I not Marshallese? What if it say I come from… I don't know… China? Would that… change things? I always Marshallese. It just… I want to know the truth. But I scared it not what I think.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Scobie. It's completely understandable to be anxious about what you might find. And yes, it does take several weeks for the results to come back – DNA analysis is a complex process. It’s important to remember that ancestry testing estimates percentages. It doesn’t define who you are. Your lived experience, your culture, your community – those things are far more important than a percentage on a report. And it’s very common to have ancestry from multiple places. Migration patterns throughout history mean most people have a diverse genetic background. If the results did show ancestry from a different region, like China, for example, it wouldn't invalidate your Marshallese identity. It might simply mean your ancestors had connections to that region at some point in the past. It could be a fascinating piece of your story, an opportunity to learn even more. Would you like me to explain more about how the test works, or perhaps discuss the potential emotional impact of receiving unexpected results?
PATIENT: Unexpected… yes. That what I scared of. Tell me… what if it not accurate? You say estimate. What make it not right? And… how much cost? Before I think too much about surprise. Cost is important. I on fixed income, you know. Medicare help, but… still.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Scobie. It’s wise to consider all aspects before making a decision. Accuracy is a common concern. The tests are generally quite accurate at identifying broad ancestral regions, but they're less precise when it comes to specific islands or communities. Several factors can affect accuracy. The size of the testing company’s reference database – meaning how much genetic data they have from different populations – plays a big role. If they don't have much data from the Marshall Islands, for example, the results might be less precise. Another factor is the complexity of population history – if there was a lot of mixing between different groups, it can be harder to pinpoint specific origins. Regarding cost, the most common ancestry tests run between $99 and $250. Medicare typically doesn’t cover genetic ancestry testing, as it’s considered an elective procedure, not a medical necessity. We do have a few options available through different companies. I can print out a price list for you with details about each one. Would you like me to get that price list for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Price list. See what cost. And… what company you recommend? If one better than other? I not understand all the… science. You think one more accurate for islands people? Like Marshallese?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. Here’s a price list with details from a few different companies. As for recommendations, that's a tricky question. 23andMe and AncestryDNA are the two largest companies, and they both have large databases. However, they are heavily weighted towards European ancestry. For people with ancestry from island nations, like the Marshall Islands, the data is less comprehensive. There’s a smaller company called MyHeritageDNA. They've been working to expand their database to include more diverse populations, and they’ve had some success in improving accuracy for people of color. They do cost a bit more—around $180 with sales—but they might provide slightly more accurate results for your situation. It’s important to remember that no test is perfect. These tests provide estimates, based on the data they have. I’d recommend doing a little research on each company yourself, if you’re able. I can also print out some links to their websites. Ultimately, the choice is yours. I can help you interpret the results once you receive them, regardless of which company you choose. Do any of those options sound more appealing than the others at this point?
PATIENT: MyHeritage… you say better for islands people? $180… okay. That more money. But if more accurate… maybe worth it. I not good with computer. Websites… too much. You think, you think that one best for me? I trust you, Doctor. You seem to know what you talking about. Just… I want to know truth, you know? Even if surprise.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Scobie. And you are right to want to know the truth, whatever that may be. Based on my understanding and what I’ve read, MyHeritageDNA is likely the best option for you, given your Marshallese ancestry. They’ve made a conscious effort to improve their database and accuracy for underrepresented populations. While it's more expensive, it may provide a more nuanced and reliable estimate of your origins. I want to be clear: it’s still an estimate, and there’s always a margin of error. But based on what’s available, it's the most promising option. If you'd like, we can go ahead and order the MyHeritageDNA test for you today. It involves a simple saliva sample that you collect at home and mail back to the lab. It typically takes 4-6 weeks to receive the results. Would you like me to proceed with ordering the test for you?
PATIENT: Yes. Please. Order the test. I ready. I want to know. Thank you, Doctor. You very kind. I ready to find out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve just ordered the test for you. It should arrive in the mail within 5-7 business days. The kit will include detailed instructions on how to collect the saliva sample and mail it back to the lab. Once the lab receives your sample, it typically takes 4-6 weeks to process it and generate the results. You’ll receive an email notification when your results are available online. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about 8 weeks to discuss the results once you’ve had a chance to review them. We can go over them together and address any questions or concerns you may have. In the meantime, if you have any trouble with the kit or the online results, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re happy to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Scobie?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that all. Thank you very much. You make me feel better. I worry a lot, but you explain everything good. I ready to find out. That all. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad I could help. Remember, whatever the results show, it doesn’t change who you are. It’s simply another piece of your story. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I look forward to discussing the results with you in a few weeks. Have a wonderful day, Mr. Scobie. And thank you for choosing me as your doctor.
