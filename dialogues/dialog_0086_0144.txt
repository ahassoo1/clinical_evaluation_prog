DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Dr. Murtic, is it? Well, honestly? Curiosity, mostly. My neighbor, Agnes, she keeps raving about how thorough you are, and she said I should just… get checked out. You know, make sure everything’s still ticking. I don't really feel sick, if that makes sense. Just… old.
DOCTOR: "Curiosity," right. Well, preventative care is… acceptable, I suppose. Though generally, people come in with a complaint. "Just old" isn’t a diagnosis, Ms. Calvery. Let’s try to be a little more specific. Are you experiencing any changes in your energy levels?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Well, I get tired easier, I suppose. Always have been a bit of a napper, but it feels like I need more naps now. And not just after lunch! Though, to be fair, lunch is very important. I used to be able to garden all day, but now… a little weeding and I’m ready for a rest. Is that what you mean? Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I might be forgetting things. It's just… getting older, I guess.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, then. And you attribute it to… the natural aging process. Right. Okay. And is this fatigue accompanied by anything else?
PATIENT: Accompanied by… let me think. Oh! My hands ache sometimes, especially in the mornings. And my knees… don’t even get me started on my knees. They creak like an old ship, honestly. Though, again, that might just be… old age. I’ve always been a bit creaky. Is that important? I don’t know why you need to know so much.
DOCTOR: Everything is potentially important, Ms. Calvery. It’s my job to discern what is important. So, aching hands and creaky knees. When did this start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… That’s a tricky one. It wasn't all at once, you see. The hands, maybe… a few years ago? Not terribly bothersome then, just a little stiffness. The knees… always, really. But worse lately, I think. Maybe since the winter? It gets cold in this old house, you know. Makes everything ache. I really can’t pinpoint a specific time, dear. It's just… a gradual decline. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: "Gradual decline" isn't particularly helpful, Ms. Calvery. But alright. And beyond fatigue and joint discomfort, any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Well, now that you mention it, I do get a bit short of breath sometimes. Not doing anything strenuous, just… walking up the stairs. Or even just talking for too long. Could be the heat, though. It's been terribly humid lately. And I've always been a bit of a winded person, honestly. I just don’t have the stamina I used to. It’s just… getting old. Are you writing all this down? You seem to be writing a lot.
DOCTOR: Of course I'm writing it down, Ms. Calvery. It’s called a medical history. Alright, shortness of breath with exertion. And you attribute that to…heat and a general lack of stamina?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. Heat and…well, a life well-lived, I suppose. I've had a good run, but I’m not as spry as I once was. Really, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't… you know… falling apart. Agnes said you were very thorough, and I didn't want to ignore anything. Though honestly, all this questioning feels a bit… unnecessary. Is there a test you can just do to see if I’m okay?
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, medicine isn't magic. A simple test won't tell me everything. But very well. I suppose we can proceed with a physical exam. Please step onto the scale, and we’ll begin.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A physical exam. I suppose that's reasonable. Though I do hope it's not too…invasive. I’m not a fan of doctors poking and prodding, you know. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. And try to be gentle, dear. These old bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: 187 pounds. A bit above your ideal weight, Ms. Calvery. Now, if you’ll please step over here. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your blouse.
PATIENT: Oh. Remove my… blouse? Goodness. Is that absolutely necessary? I mean, I’m sure you can listen to my heart just fine through the fabric, can’t you? I’m not terribly comfortable with that, dear. It feels a bit… excessive. And cold! This office is rather chilly, you know. Honestly, Agnes didn’t say anything about having to…undress.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, it is standard procedure to auscultate the lungs directly. Clothing obstructs the accurate assessment of breath sounds. It’s for your own benefit. If you are unwilling to cooperate with a basic physical exam, I’m afraid I cannot provide you with a proper assessment. Perhaps you should have discussed this with your neighbor beforehand. Now, are you willing to proceed, or shall we conclude the consultation here?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Fine, fine. You win. But I expect a very thorough explanation of everything afterward. And don’t you go poking around too much. Honestly, doctors these days… always so…clinical. It’s just not decent. You’ll need to open the window, it’s getting rather warm in here. And be gentle, dear, please. These old bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, take a deep breath for me. Another deep breath… and exhale. Decreased breath sounds bilaterally, with mild wheezing in the lower lobes. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Please lie flat.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Is that bad? Decreased breath sounds…that doesn’t sound good. You’re very quiet, dear. What does it mean? And what are "lower lobes"? Honestly, I wish you would just tell me what’s going on instead of writing everything down in that little book. It’s very unsettling, you know? Just tell me, plainly, if I’m falling apart. And try not to poke too much, dear. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is regular, but there's a slight murmur. It's likely benign, but we'll need to investigate further. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Just relax, and I'll tap on your knees. Right leg… and left leg. Diminished reflexes bilaterally. We'll also need to check your blood pressure and pulse. Please keep your arm still.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A murmur? Diminished reflexes? Honestly, it sounds like I’m falling apart piece by piece! I knew I shouldn’t have come. Agnes was right, I’m sure of it. Everything’s wrong with me. And now you’re going to poke and prod me even more? Honestly, it’s just awful. Are you sure it’s not just old age? Maybe I should just go home and have a nap. That would be much better than all this…this torture. And what is "bilaterally?" Honestly, you use such complicated words. It’s very upsetting. Just tell me, plainly, am I going to die?
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, please calm down. You are not dying. These findings…indicate some age-related changes, but they require further investigation. The diminished reflexes and decreased breath sounds suggest some mild neurological and pulmonary decline, respectively. The heart murmur is something we need to monitor. “Bilaterally” simply means on both sides. I'm going to order a chest X-ray, an EKG, and some blood work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It's standard procedure. We'll rule out any serious underlying conditions. And honestly, Ms. Calvery, your weight is contributing to these symptoms. We need to discuss lifestyle modifications as well. I’m referring you to a pulmonologist and a cardiologist for their expert opinions. They can provide a more comprehensive assessment.
PATIENT: Oh. A pulmonologist… a cardiologist… More doctors. It never ends, does it? Honestly, I’m starting to feel like a science experiment. And my weight… I know, I know. I just… enjoy my food, dear. It’s one of the few pleasures I have left. And honestly, all this talk of tests and specialists is just overwhelming. Can’t you just give me something to make me feel better? A pill, maybe? Something to calm my nerves? I just want to go home and have a nap. And maybe a nice cup of tea. Is that too much to ask? Honestly, I wish Agnes hadn’t recommended this. It’s just awful.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, I am a physician, not a miracle worker. I cannot simply prescribe a pill to alleviate your anxieties. We need to address the underlying medical issues. And frankly, your refusal to cooperate with a proper assessment is hindering my ability to provide you with adequate care. I can prescribe a mild anti-anxiety medication, but it will not solve the problem. And it’s crucial that you follow through with the referrals I’m providing. I understand you are overwhelmed, but dismissing these symptoms or refusing treatment is not a viable option. I will write you a prescription for lorazepam, 0.5mg, to be taken as needed for anxiety. But it’s a temporary solution, Ms. Calvery. We need to focus on addressing the underlying issues. Now, do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Lorazepam… that’s… a strong pill, isn’t it? Will it make me sleepy? I have a bridge game on Thursday… Honestly, I just want to feel normal again. I just want to be able to garden and play bridge and enjoy my life without worrying about pulmonologists and cardiologists and…murmurs. Is there…is there anything else you can do? Anything at all? I just…I just want to go home. And maybe have a nice cup of tea. Honestly, I wish Agnes hadn’t recommended this. It's just awful. And…and what if they find something serious? What if…what if I’m dying?
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, let's try to remain rational. It is entirely possible that nothing serious will be found. These tests are precautionary. The lorazepam will help manage your anxiety, but it’s not a cure-all. The goal is to identify any potential issues and address them proactively. I understand your fear, but allowing it to paralyze you will only exacerbate the situation. I am referring you to highly reputable specialists, and they will provide you with expert care and guidance. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results of the tests and develop a comprehensive treatment plan. In the meantime, please try to rest, eat healthy, and avoid unnecessary stress. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please contact my office immediately. Now, do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh… I… I don’t know. I’m just so overwhelmed. Two weeks…that’s a long time to worry. And the specialists…what if they don’t like me? What if they think I’m just an old woman complaining about nothing? Honestly, I just want to forget all of this ever happened. I wish I hadn’t come. I just wanted to make sure everything was okay…and now I’m more worried than ever. Just…promise me you’ll take care of me. Promise me you’ll make sure everything’s going to be alright. Even if it’s just a little bit. And…and can I at least get a cup of tea before I leave? I think I need a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, I can assure you I will do everything in my power to provide you with the best possible care. I will review the results of the tests with you personally and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. And I will make sure you receive the support and guidance you need throughout this process. As for the specialists, I have recommended highly reputable doctors who are known for their compassionate care. I am confident they will treat you with respect and understanding. And yes, of course, you can have a cup of tea before you leave. The nurse will bring one for you immediately. Now, please try to remain positive. Worrying will only exacerbate the situation. Focus on taking care of yourself, and we will address this together. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to attend to. Please let the nurse know if you need anything further.
PATIENT: .
