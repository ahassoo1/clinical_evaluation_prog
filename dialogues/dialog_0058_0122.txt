DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a difficult thing to explain, truthfully. I am Venus Alvara. Fifty-three years of age. I have been… noticing some issues with my memory, lately. It is… concerning. And my blood pressure has been… not good. I want to get this sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Memory issues and blood pressure, alright. Well, "not good" is vague, Ms. Alvara. Do you have any numbers for me?
PATIENT: Numbers? I… do not keep a log, Doctor. My husband… he always took care of that. Since his passing… it has been difficult to manage. I think the last time I checked, at the pharmacy, it was… high. Very high. Above one hundred and forty, I believe. Perhaps even higher. I do not recall precisely. It is… frustrating, this forgetting.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Above 140 is definitely something we need to address. And you said memory issues started around the time of your husband’s passing?
PATIENT: Yes. It was… about six months ago. He… passed in January. It was… sudden. And shortly after that, I began to… misplace things. Forget appointments. Small things, at first. But now… it is becoming more frequent. I worry, Doctor. I truly do. It is not like me to be so… scattered. And I do not want to… become a burden.
DOCTOR: Well, grief can do a number on a person, Ms. Alvara. Memory lapses are not uncommon after a significant loss. But we need to rule out anything else. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the memory issues?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No… nothing physical. No headaches. No dizziness. Just… the forgetting. And a… a feeling of being overwhelmed, sometimes. I lose my train of thought easily. And I find myself repeating questions, even after someone has answered them. It is… embarrassing, truthfully. And it is frightening. I do not want this to… worsen.
DOCTOR: Overwhelmed and repeating questions... alright. Have you been sleeping well?
PATIENT: Sleeping… not consistently, Doctor. Some nights, I sleep soundly. Others… I wake several times. I find myself thinking… replaying things. Worrying. It is difficult to… quiet my mind. And when I do finally fall asleep, I do not always feel rested. It is… a cycle, I suppose. A very unpleasant cycle. Is this… important?
DOCTOR: It's all information, Ms. Alvara. Let's do a quick physical exam, and then we can talk about some initial tests. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Diabetes… no, never. My husband… he had some issues with cholesterol, I believe. But I… I have always been quite healthy. I try to eat well, and I walk every day, when the weather permits. Though lately… even that has been difficult to maintain, with everything. The forgetting… it makes it hard to remember to take care of myself, properly. I worry I am making this more difficult than it needs to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get your blood pressure and heart rate checked. Then I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, and do a quick neurological assessment - just some basic memory and balance tests. It's standard procedure. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I confess, relaxing is… not easy, these days. But I will try. I am ready when you are. And… thank you. For taking the time to listen. It is… reassuring, in a way. Even if I cannot remember what you say, I am grateful for your attention.
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood pressure is 162 over 98. Heart rate is 78 and regular. That is elevated. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me... and another one...
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I do not believe there is anything unusual. My lungs… have always been strong. Though I do feel a bit… lightheaded, perhaps. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily concerning, but we’ll need to investigate further. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions to check your memory and cognitive function. Just answer to the best of your ability. First, what is today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… let me see. It is… August. August… the second, I believe. Yes, the second of August. 2025. Is that correct, Doctor? I apologize if I am slow. It is… frustrating, this forgetting.
DOCTOR: Correct. Alright. Can you tell me the names of three objects I'm going to name?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I believe I can. Please, proceed. I will try my very best. Though I do not make any promises. My memory is… unreliable, at best, these days. This is… rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Pen, table, chair. Now, I want you to repeat those back to me.
PATIENT: Um… pen… and… a chair. And… Oh dear. I seem to have forgotten the third item. A table, perhaps? No… I apologize, Doctor. I cannot recall. It is… terribly embarrassing. I know I heard them, just moments ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll move on. Can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where… we are? This is… a doctor’s office, of course. Dr. Todorovich’s office. In… the city, I believe. A modern building. Is that sufficient, Doctor? I do not recall the precise address. It is… frustrating, this feeling of being… disconnected.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ms. Alvara, based on what you’ve told me, and the brief assessment I’ve performed, I’m concerned about possible cognitive impairment. We need to rule out other causes, but it’s important to address this promptly. I'm going to order some blood work – a complete metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. We should also consider a brain MRI to rule out any structural issues. I'm also going to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A brain MRI? A neurologist? Oh dear… that sounds… frightening. But… yes. If that is what is necessary, then yes. Please, do whatever you think is best, Doctor. I… I just want to understand what is happening. And… I want to be able to… function, again. I do not want to… become a burden. Is this… serious, Doctor? Please, be honest with me. Even if the truth is… difficult to hear.
DOCTOR: It's too early to say definitively, Ms. Alvara. The symptoms you're experiencing could be caused by a variety of factors. The tests will help us determine the underlying cause. It could be something benign, like a vitamin deficiency or medication side effect. But it's also important to rule out more serious possibilities, such as early-stage dementia. I will schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning, and I’ll have my nurse contact you to set up an appointment with the neurologist. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding driving and complex tasks. I am also going to prescribe you a low dose of donepezil, which may help with cognitive function. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergic… no, I do not believe so. Though my husband… he took many medications. I do not recall the specifics. Donepezil… is that… a strong medication, Doctor? Will it have… side effects? And… avoiding driving? That… that will be very difficult. I rely on my car. But… if that is what is necessary, then I will comply. This is all… very overwhelming. Please, tell me… what is the likelihood… of it being something… serious? I need to… prepare myself. Even if the truth is… difficult to hear. I understand you may not know for certain, but… any estimate would be… helpful.
DOCTOR: The likelihood is impossible to say without the test results, Ms. Alvara. I don’t want to cause unnecessary alarm, but given your age and symptoms, it's prudent to investigate thoroughly. Donepezil is generally well-tolerated, but common side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. We'll monitor you closely. I understand this is overwhelming, and I want you to know I'll be here to support you through this process. My nurse will explain the medication instructions and schedule a follow-up appointment for when the test results are available. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, I understand your concerns, but dwelling on worst-case scenarios isn’t helpful at this stage. Dementia is a progressive condition, but the rate of progression varies greatly from person to person. There are medications and therapies that can help manage symptoms and slow the decline, but there is currently no cure. It's important to focus on getting an accurate diagnosis and developing a plan. I have scheduled your tests and referral. Please follow up with the neurologist as soon as possible. My nurse will contact you with the details. I don’t want to speculate further until we have more information. .
