DOCTOR: Hi, Mirriam. Good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups, you see. They just won’t stop! Started a couple of days ago, and they’re… persistent, to say the least. It’s a bit embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. Not painful, thankfully, just… constant. It’s making it hard to sleep, and I nearly choked on my tea this morning! Now that was a fright. I haven’t had hiccups this bad since… oh, goodness, probably when I was a little girl playing in the sugarcane fields back home in Fiji. Though those were probably from running around too much, not… well, I don't know what’s causing them now.
DOCTOR: Okay. A couple of days, constant, no pain… and it's interfering with sleep and eating. Right. Now, can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. They come and go, but mostly come. Like a little jump in my chest, then… hic! There you go. See? They aren't regular, not like hic!… hic!… one after another. Sometimes there’s a long break, and I think they’ve gone, then bam, they start up again. And it doesn’t seem to matter what I’m doing – sitting, walking, even just thinking! I haven't changed anything in my diet, or anything like that. I'm a pretty simple woman, Doctor. I like my tea and my garden, and that’s about it.
DOCTOR: So, unpredictable timing… no clear triggers… and no changes to your usual routine. Do you notice anything that makes them worse, even if you can’t pinpoint a cause?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, bending over does seem to set them off. Trying to weed the flowerbeds this afternoon was a mistake. Lots of bending, lots of hic!… and a very frustrated gardener. And… oh dear, this is silly… but if I get too excited talking, they sometimes start up again. Not always, but… yeah. It's like a little ripple effect, I suppose. I’m not usually one to get flustered, but… well, talking about it seems to do it! hic! See? Proof!
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Mirriam. That’s good information. Bending and excitement seem to be triggers. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was a bit of a bother, but that was decades back and I’ve been fine ever since. And my knees aren’t what they used to be, you know, getting old. A little arthritis, but nothing serious. I take a bit of glucosamine for that, helps a little. Oh, and I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s well-managed with medication now. I see Dr. Sharma for that regularly. He’s a good man. I don’t really have any other… major problems, thankfully. I’ve been lucky, all things considered. hic! Though these hiccups are trying my luck, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, arthritis, and well-controlled hypertension. I see Dr. Sharma is your primary care physician. That’s good to know. And you mentioned glucosamine – how much do you take, and how often?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it’s two tablets a day, with my breakfast. They’re the kind you get over the counter, not anything special. I’ve been taking them for… oh, maybe five years now? They don't cure it, mind you, but they take the edge off, you know? Especially in the mornings. And I always take them with food, Dr. Sharma warned me about taking anything on an empty stomach. He’s very thorough, that man. hic!… Sorry. It seems to be a habit now, interrupting.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mirriam. It’s good you’re mindful of your medication. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the glucosamine and whatever Dr. Sharma prescribes for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. Besides the blood pressure pills – Dr. Sharma has me on lisinopril, I believe – and the glucosamine… Oh! I take a little vitamin D in the winter. Dr. Sharma said my levels were a bit low when he did my blood work last year. Just a regular dose, you get it at the chemist. I think it’s 1000 IU. And… that’s it, I promise! I'm not one for taking a lot of pills. I prefer a cup of tea and a bit of sunshine, if you don’t mind. hic! It’s a lovely day for sunshine, isn’t it? Although I can't enjoy it much with these pesky hiccups.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril, glucosamine, and vitamin D. That’s a good overview. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Have you ever had any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, allergies. Let me think... No, not that I know of! Never had a problem with any medications, thankfully. I eat just about anything, though I’m not a fan of oysters, but that’s a taste thing, not an allergy! And no reactions to anything else, not bees, not plants, nothing. I’ve always considered myself a pretty sturdy woman, you know? Even with these hiccups, I haven't felt unwell otherwise. No rash, no itching, no trouble breathing… just hic!… these persistent little jumps. I suppose everyone has their cross to bear.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No known allergies. Alright, Mirriam, if you don't mind, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and just have a quick look in your throat and ears. It will only take a few moments. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I'm happy to cooperate. Just let me know if it’s going to be cold, my skin gets a bit sensitive these days. And please, don’t be alarmed if I hic! mid-examination. It just happens, you know? It’s become a rather… involuntary habit.
DOCTOR: I won’t be alarmed at all. And I’ll be gentle. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Here we go. Not as nimble as I used to be, mind you. But I manage. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. And, well, prepare for the occasional hic! It's only fair to warn you.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are normal. No irregularities. Lungs are clear bilaterally. I’m not hearing any wheezing or crackles. Now, let me just take a quick look at your throat. Say “ah” for me, please.
PATIENT: Ah… Is that alright? It’s a bit dry, I suppose, from all the talking… and the hiccups. hic! See? They don’t even wait for a proper sentence. It's quite rude, really. But it’s not a sore throat, mind you. Just a bit… parched. It's been a warm day.
DOCTOR: Throat looks a little dry, but otherwise normal. Ears are clear as well. Now, I'm just going to feel your neck, just checking for any swelling. It might be a little sensitive, let me know if it’s uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, go ahead. It’s alright, I’m not ticklish. Though my arthritis sometimes makes it a bit stiff, you know. It's nothing major, just a bit of creakiness. hic! Oh, bother. It seems to have a mind of its own. Is that normal, Doctor? To have hiccups during a medical examination? It feels… rather unprofessional, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal, Mirriam. And it doesn't bother me at all. It’s actually helpful to know what triggers them. And it doesn't make the examination unprofessional, not one bit. So, based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, there’s no obvious sign of anything serious. It sounds like you’re experiencing benign, persistent hiccups.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… reassuring, Doctor. Benign, you say? That sounds… good. So, not something to worry about too much then? It’s just… annoying, really. And it’s interfering with my gardening! That’s the real tragedy of it all, you know. A woman and her garden. It's a sacred bond. And these hiccups are disrupting the harmony. Do you think they’ll just… go away on their own? Or is there anything I can do to help them along? Perhaps a special tea? Or a magical potion?
DOCTOR: Most hiccups do resolve on their own within a few hours to a few days. There are a few things we can try to encourage them along. Some people find relief with simple remedies like holding their breath for a short period, drinking water quickly, or sucking on a lemon. We could also consider a medication called baclofen, which is sometimes used for persistent hiccups, but that’s usually reserved for cases that don’t respond to other measures. Before we consider medication, let’s try a few simpler things. Have you tried any of those remedies already?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes, I’ve tried a few things. Holding my breath – nearly passed out, that didn’t work! Drinking water quickly just resulted in a wet cough and more hiccups. And I don’t particularly like lemons, too sour for my taste. Dr. Sharma once suggested a spoonful of sugar, but that just made me feel sticky and didn't do a thing for the hiccups. I’ve exhausted all my grandmother’s remedies, I think. She was a very wise woman, but even she didn't have a cure for persistent hiccups. It seems these little jumps are determined to stay. Do you think it could be… stress? Though I haven't been particularly stressed lately. Just a quiet life, you know. Tea and gardening. What else could it be?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. It’s good you’ve already tried those common remedies. Stress can be a factor, but it doesn’t sound like that’s the primary cause in your case. Given your age and the fact that these hiccups have been persistent, I think it’s prudent to rule out a few other possibilities, just to be safe. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but it’s always better to be thorough. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a blood test to check your electrolytes and kidney function. These will help us exclude any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your hiccups. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A chest X-ray and a blood test… Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, of course. I trust your judgment. Though I must admit, I’m not terribly fond of needles. And X-rays… I always worry about those things. But if it will put my mind at ease, then yes, let’s do it. I suppose a few pokes and a little radiation are a small price to pay for peace of mind. Will it take long? And will I need to fast for the blood test? I do enjoy my morning tea, you know. Perhaps I should skip it tomorrow. Just for the sake of science. And hopefully, a cure for these pesky hiccups.
DOCTOR: You’re very brave, Mirriam. And you’re right to ask questions. The blood test will require about eight hours of fasting, so you’d need to skip your morning tea tomorrow. We’ll draw a small amount of blood, and it should only take a few minutes. The chest X-ray is quick and painless; you’ll just stand in front of the machine for a few seconds. It does involve a small amount of radiation, but it’s a very low dose and the benefits outweigh the risks in this case. I’ll write you a referral for the X-ray and a lab slip for the blood test. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, continue to try those simple remedies, and don’t hesitate to call if your hiccups worsen or if you develop any other symptoms. Do you have any questions for me before I finish?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that sounds… manageable. Eight hours of fasting, I can do that. Though I might be a bit grumpy in the afternoon. And the X-ray… well, I’ll just close my eyes and think of my garden. That usually helps. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience. It’s reassuring to know that you’re taking this seriously. And I suppose it’s better to rule out anything serious, just in case. Thank you for everything, Doctor Polczynski. And perhaps… if you ever need a bit of gardening advice, feel free to call. I’m rather good with roses, you know.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. And I might just take you up on that gardening advice! I’ve always admired a beautiful rose garden. Now, let me just get you checked out, and we can get these tests scheduled. I’ll have the nurse come in to take your blood pressure one last time. And don’t worry about the hiccups. We’ll figure it out. Have a good day, and try to relax. We’ll talk soon.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too. And thank you again for your kindness and patience. It’s reassuring to know that there are still doctors who take the time to listen. I'll try to relax. Though with these hiccups… it's easier said than done! Perhaps a cup of chamomile tea will help. .
DOCTOR: That’s a good idea. Chamomile tea is always a good choice. .
