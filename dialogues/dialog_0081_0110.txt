DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paulino. It’s very nice to meet you. Well, to put it plainly, I feel…stuck. Like an old engine that needs a bit of a tune-up, you know? I’m eighty-seven years young, and I’ve lived a good life, but lately, I just haven’t been feeling myself. I suppose I’m looking for a bit of a reset, a jumpstart to get my energy back. Is that…reasonable?
DOCTOR: A “reset,” you say. While I appreciate colorful descriptions, Ms. McNabb, we need to be a bit more precise than that if we’re going to figure out what’s going on. “Not feeling yourself” could mean a great many things at your age. Let’s start with the basics. Can you describe specifically what you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You are quite right, aren’t you? My apologies. It’s just…hard to explain. Well, I tire easily. Much more easily than I used to. Even a little bit of gardening leaves me breathless. And my joints…they ache. Not constantly, but enough to be bothersome. And…I wouldn’t say my memory is bad, but things don’t come to me as quickly. I forget names sometimes, and where I put my glasses…frequently! Though, I suppose that’s just old age catching up with me. Is that helpful? I do apologize for being vague.
DOCTOR: Right. Fatigue, joint pain, and some cognitive…slowing. It's helpful, Ms. McNabb, but still quite broad. Let’s try to narrow things down. When did you first start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s a good question. Let me think… it wasn’t sudden, you see. It was…gradual. Perhaps six months ago? No, maybe a little longer. Around Thanksgiving, I believe. I remember thinking I was just tired from all the cooking and family visiting. But it hasn’t really gotten better since then. It’s just…persisted. And perhaps gotten a little worse…slowly, of course. I do try to stay active, you know. I don’t want to just sit around all day! But even my usual walks are becoming more difficult.
DOCTOR: So, approximately eight months of progressive fatigue, joint pain, and cognitive difficulties. Are the joint pains localized to specific areas, or are they more generalized?
PATIENT: Oh, they’re mostly in my knees and hips, Doctor. Those seem to be the worst offenders. And my hands, sometimes, especially in the mornings. They feel stiff and achy. Not swelling, though. Just…uncomfortable. And it seems worse on damp days, if that makes any sense. My daughter always says I’m a bit of a weather vane, predicting rain with my joints! But she’s teasing, of course. Though, she does have a point…it does seem to be worse when it’s cloudy or raining.
DOCTOR: Alright. Knees, hips, and hands, worse with damp weather. Have you noticed any redness or warmth in those joints?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no redness or warmth. They just…ache. They don’t look different, if that makes sense. It’s more of an internal feeling. And it’s not constant pain, you understand. Some days are better than others. But the fatigue…that’s pretty much constant. Even after a good night’s sleep, I wake up feeling tired. And that’s what worries me the most, to be honest. I’ve always been a morning person!
DOCTOR: Ms. McNabb, fatigue at your age is…not uncommon. However, we must rule out other possibilities. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… well, years ago, I had high blood pressure, but that’s been well-controlled with medication for a long time now. My regular doctor, Dr. Reyes, he monitors it very closely. And I had a bout of pneumonia about ten years ago, but I recovered fully. Other than that… nothing major, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose! I’ve always been quite healthy, all things considered. Though, I suppose everyone has something, don’t they?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, controlled with medication. Pneumonia ten years ago. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Now you mention it. I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. Must have been…oh, goodness, almost thirty years ago now. And I had a knee replacement on my right knee about five years ago. Dr. Silva did a wonderful job, though it took a while to recover. But it’s been quite good since then, no problems at all. Though, that’s the right knee, and the aches I’m feeling now are mostly in the left knee, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: Right knee replacement five years ago, aches in the left knee. And family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a bit complicated. My mother lived to be ninety-two, but she had arthritis something awful. Both her hands and her knees were badly affected. My father…he passed away relatively young, from a heart attack. And my sister… she had diabetes, but she lived a long life with it, managed quite well. I don’t believe anyone else in my family had any major health issues, not that I recall, anyway. It’s been a while since I thought about it. My daughter is very good about keeping track of those things, though. Perhaps she knows more than I do.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of arthritis in your mother, diabetes in your sister, father with a heart attack. Now, let's talk about medications. What are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, there’s lisinopril for my blood pressure, as we discussed. And I take a baby aspirin every day, Dr. Paulino recommended it years ago to help prevent heart problems. And sometimes, when my joints are really bothering me, I take ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter, nothing prescribed. And that’s it, really. Just the basics, I suppose. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it!
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, baby aspirin, and ibuprofen as needed. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication, thankfully. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard! Though, I do get a bit drowsy sometimes when I take antihistamines, so I try to avoid those if I can. But that’s not really an allergy, is it? Just a side effect, I suppose. I haven’t taken anything for allergies in a long time, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, Ms. McNabb, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Though, please excuse my slowness! Old bones aren’t as nimble as they used to be. Is this alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine. Let’s start with your gait. Just walk a few steps for me, please. Alright. And now, let’s check your range of motion in your knees. Could you bend each knee as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a bit uncomfortable. It’s not a sharp pain, just a stiffness. Oh dear. That’s about as far as I can go comfortably, Doctor. It feels a bit tight. Like something is… stuck. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Right. Limited range of motion in both knees, particularly the left. Some discomfort with flexion. I’m noting mild crepitus with knee movement. Any tenderness to palpation here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a little bit there, Doctor. Not a sharp pain, but definitely some sensitivity. The right knee is… better, though. Not much discomfort there at all. As you might expect, considering the replacement. It’s mostly the left knee that’s bothering me. It feels… deep inside the joint, if that makes any sense. Not on the surface, but deeper in.
DOCTOR: Some mild swelling in the metacarpophalangeal joints. I'm noting a slight warmth to the left hand. Ms. McNabb, based on this brief examination, it appears you have some degree of osteoarthritis in both your knees and hands, with more pronounced involvement on the left side. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work to check for inflammatory markers and rule out rheumatoid arthritis. I’m also going to order X-rays of both knees to assess the extent of the joint damage.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Arthritis, you say? My mother had that something awful. Well, I suppose that explains a lot. Still, it’s not entirely surprising. But rheumatoid arthritis… that sounds rather serious. Is that…common? And what sort of blood work will you be doing? And X-rays… will those be painful? I do hope not. I try to avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: Rheumatoid arthritis is less common than osteoarthritis, Ms. McNabb. The blood work will be routine – a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein to assess for inflammation. The X-rays are not painful; they simply involve a brief exposure to radiation. The risk is minimal. I’m also going to order a Vitamin D level, as deficiency can exacerbate joint pain. Once we have the results, we can discuss treatment options. We can start with conservative measures – physical therapy, over-the-counter pain relievers, and weight management. If those aren't sufficient, we can consider steroid injections or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. However, let’s not jump to conclusions yet. We need the results of the tests first. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we'll schedule you for the X-rays tomorrow. In the meantime, try to rest your joints and avoid activities that aggravate your pain. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a lot of information. Vitamin D… I suppose I haven’t been getting much sun lately. And physical therapy… that sounds rather tiring, but I suppose it might be helpful. Steroid injections… those sound rather serious as well. I do hope we don’t have to go that far. I think… I think I understand, Doctor. But perhaps… perhaps my daughter could come with me to the next appointment? Just to help me remember everything, and to ask questions I might forget. She’s very good with these things. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so thoroughly. Yes, I believe that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. McNabb. Having your daughter present is acceptable. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. Try to follow my recommendations in the meantime.
