DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… my sight, you see. It’s not what it used to be. Frankly, I suspected this was coming, given the family history, but one never wants to admit these things. It’s just…dimming, I suppose. Not a sudden thing, thankfully. More of a gradual…fading. I haven’t bothered with insurance, truthfully, so I hoped to catch it early before it became…a real problem.
DOCTOR: A gradual fading, you say. And you mentioned a family history?
PATIENT: Yes, indeed. My grandmother, on my mother’s side – full Cherokee, she was – lost most of her vision in her later years. They said it was…glaucoma, I believe. A terrible affliction. My mother had some trouble with it as well, though not as severe. She was quite insistent on my getting regular check-ups, but…well, life got in the way, you understand. A divorce will do that to a man. Distractions, mostly. I suppose I should have been more diligent.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a family history of glaucoma is present, on your mother's side. And you've noticed a gradual dimming of your vision. Can you tell me a bit more about how it’s dimming?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not as though things are blurry, precisely. It’s more…like looking through a thin veil. Everything seems less…vibrant. Colors aren't as distinct, and it's getting harder to make out details at a distance. Reading, for example – I used to be able to read a road sign a mile off, practically. Now, I need to be quite close, and even then, it's a strain. And in low light…forget about it. It’s all rather unsettling, to be frank. I’m a practical man, Doctor. I like to see things clearly.
DOCTOR: Right. So, not blurry, but a loss of vibrancy and difficulty with details, especially in low light. And it’s affecting your distance vision. Have you noticed any pain, redness, or halos around lights?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no pain. Not a bit. And my eyes don’t feel different, if that makes sense. No redness, no itching, nothing like that. And halos…no, I haven't noticed any halos around lights. Though, I suppose I haven't been looking for them, either. I tend to avoid driving at night these days, so… it's possible I wouldn’t have noticed. I do find myself squinting more, though. Constantly, really. It's become a rather unconscious habit. A rather annoying habit, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Never have been much for taking pills, if I can avoid it. As for other conditions… well, my blood pressure’s been a little elevated lately, the nurse mentioned it at a routine check-up last year. Nothing a little less stress wouldn’t fix, I suspect. And I had a bout of… diverticulitis, a few years back, but that was resolved. Aside from that… reasonably healthy, all things considered. I’ve always been a man who took care of himself. Or, tried to, at least. It’s difficult these days, with everything.
DOCTOR: Elevated blood pressure, and a history of diverticulitis. Good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick examination of your eyes. We’ll check your visual acuity, peripheral vision, and I’ll take a look at the back of your eyes to assess the optic nerve. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Though I must confess, I’ve never been fond of having things near my eyes. But if it’s necessary… I suppose I can endure it. Please, do be gentle. And… explain what you’re doing as you go along, if you wouldn't mind. I like to understand these things. Keeps a man from feeling…helpless.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will explain everything as I go along, and I will be as gentle as possible. First, we'll check your distance vision. I’m going to have you read the letters on this chart – the smallest letters you can see on each line. Just cover your left eye with this patch, please. Take your time, and tell me what you see.
PATIENT: Very well. Let's get this over with, then. Okay… um… E… F… P… T… Alright, that line… C… B… Q… Oh dear. This is…not as clear as it used to be. Let me move a bit closer. Now… V… W… X… That's the best I can do, Doctor. Honestly, these letters are rather small. It’s almost… discouraging.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, let's check your right eye. Please remove the patch and cover your right eye with this one. We’ll do the same thing – read the smallest letters you can see.
PATIENT: Here we go again. Doctor… this is… considerably worse. I can barely make out the large letters, let alone the smaller ones. I think… I think I can see an E at the top. And… perhaps a blurry F? That’s it, honestly. It’s… quite alarming, to be frank. I’m starting to feel rather foolish, relying on these old eyes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Thank you for your patience. Your visual acuity is significantly reduced in both eyes, more so in your left eye. Now, I’m going to use a small instrument to check your peripheral vision. I’ll ask you to look straight ahead and tell me when you see a light appear in your side vision. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Peripheral vision, you say? Hmm. Sounds… somewhat intrusive, but I suppose it’s necessary. Yes, alright. Look straight ahead… and watch for a light. Just… please be quick about it. I dislike having things near my eyes, as I mentioned. And try not to startle me. I’m ready, Doctor. Begin when you’re ready. Though I must confess, I’ve always considered my peripheral vision to be rather excellent. A hunter needs a good range of sight, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta, focus on this point. Tell me when you see a light appear. …Do you see anything now?
PATIENT: …I think… yes. Just there. Very faint. Almost a shadow, really. I had to concentrate rather hard to notice it. It's…not very distinct. And… there, just a bit more to the right. Again, very faint. I'm not sure if I'm actually seeing it, or simply anticipating it. It's difficult to tell, honestly. It’s rather unsettling, this test. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, I’m going to use a special instrument to look at the back of your eyes – your retina and optic nerve. I’ll need to get quite close, and it will involve a bright light. It won’t hurt, but it may be a little uncomfortable. It's important for assessing the health of the nerve that sends signals from your eye to your brain. Are you ready for me to take a look?
PATIENT: The back of my eyes, you say? Bright light? Doctor, frankly, this sounds… decidedly unpleasant. But… I suppose I haven’t come this far to balk at the last hurdle. Though, I must insist – be gentle. And explain what you’re seeing, if you don't mind. I want to understand what’s going on. I’ve always been a man who prefers to know the truth, however unpleasant it may be. Very well. Proceed… but be quick about it. And gentle. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. I’ve examined your retinas and optic nerves. What I’m seeing… is concerning. There’s some pallor of the optic discs, which suggests some chronic damage. Your peripheral vision is quite restricted, and your retinas show some areas of atrophy. Based on what I’ve seen, and your family history, my strongest suspicion is that you have glaucoma. It appears to be quite advanced.
PATIENT: Glaucoma. As my grandmother feared. Advanced, you say? Well. That… explains a great deal. The fading, the dimming, the difficulty in low light… the constant squinting. It was always progressing, wasn’t it? Despite my best efforts to ignore it. And… what does that mean, exactly? Is there anything to be done? Or am I simply… losing my sight? Tell me the truth, Doctor. I’ve always appreciated a man who wasn’t afraid to deliver the difficult news. Spare me the pleasantries. What are my options? Or, more accurately, what options do I have?
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, the glaucoma is advanced, which means some vision loss is unfortunately irreversible. However, that doesn’t mean all is lost. The goal now is to prevent further vision loss. The primary treatment for glaucoma is medication – eye drops that lower the pressure inside your eye. We can try different types of drops to see which one works best for you. Unfortunately, given the extent of the damage, medication alone may not be enough. If the drops aren’t sufficient, we may need to consider laser therapy or even surgery to lower the eye pressure. These procedures have risks and benefits that we would discuss in detail. I’m going to order some further testing - a visual field test to map out the extent of your peripheral vision loss, and a pachymetry to measure the thickness of your cornea. This will give us a better baseline and help us determine the best course of treatment. I also want to refer you to an ophthalmologist – a specialist in eye diseases – for a second opinion and further evaluation. Given the advanced stage, it’s important to have a specialist involved in your care. I understand this is a lot to take in. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Further testing… a specialist… medication… surgery… It’s… a rather daunting list, Doctor. And all to… slow down the inevitable, it seems. Eye drops… I suppose that’s… manageable. Though I’ve never been much for taking pills or drops. Surgery… now that is something I’d hoped to avoid. What are the… risks, exactly? And what’s the success rate? Be honest with me, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life, but I’d prefer to face whatever’s coming with a clear understanding of my options. And… is there any chance this could be… reversed, even with treatment? A small chance, perhaps? I understand it's unlikely, but I need to ask. A hunter needs his sight, you see. It’s… a part of who I am.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your concerns. Let’s address your questions one by one. Regarding surgery, there are several types we could consider – trabeculectomy, which creates a new drainage pathway for fluid in your eye, and minimally invasive glaucoma surgery, or MIGS, which are less invasive procedures with faster recovery times. The risks of trabeculectomy include infection, bleeding, and the formation of scar tissue. MIGS procedures generally have fewer risks, but they may not be as effective. The success rate of both procedures depends on several factors, including the type of glaucoma you have and your overall health. I can provide you with more detailed information about the risks and benefits of each procedure once we have a better understanding of your specific case. As for the possibility of reversal… unfortunately, once vision is lost due to glaucoma, it is extremely difficult to regain it. There are some emerging therapies being investigated, but they are still in the experimental stages and are not widely available. The primary goal of treatment is to prevent further vision loss, not to reverse existing damage. I know this is not the news you wanted to hear. But I want you to know that we will do everything we can to manage your glaucoma and preserve as much of your vision as possible. I’m going to write you a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly respected ophthalmologist in the city. She specializes in glaucoma and has extensive experience with advanced cases. I will also schedule you for the visual field test and pachymetry. And I’ll write a prescription for a bottle of timolol eye drops to start. It’s important to start treatment as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Timolol… another thing to remember. Another routine to add to the list. Dr. Reed… I suppose a second opinion is… prudent. Though I’ve always been wary of specialists. Too quick to recommend expensive procedures, if you ask me. I… I don't suppose there's anything I can do? Any lifestyle changes that might… slow things down? Anything beyond the drops and the tests? I've always been a man who believed in taking control of his own fate. Anything at all? Even something small. I suppose… it’s just difficult to accept. Losing one’s sight… it feels like losing a part of oneself.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your feelings. It is difficult to accept a diagnosis like this. And I commend you for wanting to take control of your own fate. While there’s no cure for glaucoma, there are a few lifestyle changes that may help slow its progression. It's important to maintain a healthy diet rich in antioxidants – fruits, vegetables, leafy greens. Regular exercise can also help lower eye pressure. Avoiding smoking is crucial, as it can worsen glaucoma. And it’s important to protect your eyes from injury. Wear protective eyewear when participating in activities that could pose a risk. Stress management is also important, as high stress levels can elevate eye pressure. Consider practicing relaxation techniques like yoga or meditation. I know these changes may seem small, but they can make a difference. And I want you to know that I’m here to support you every step of the way. I’ll provide you with educational materials about glaucoma and connect you with resources that can help you manage your condition. I’m going to write you a referral to Dr. Reed, and I’ll schedule you for the visual field test and pachymetry. We’ll discuss the results of these tests at your next appointment and determine the best course of treatment. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Antioxidants… exercise… no smoking… It all sounds… reasonable, I suppose. A man can certainly try. Educational materials… I suppose that wouldn't hurt. Though I’ve always been a man who preferred to learn by doing, not reading. No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all for now. I suppose I’ll wait for the tests and the referral. Thank you… for your honesty, if nothing else. It’s… appreciated. I’ll… see you at the next appointment. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. You take care of yourself. I’ll see you at your next appointment. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. .
