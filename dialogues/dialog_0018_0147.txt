DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a… a lump, I guess you’d call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Raghunathan. It’s always wise to have something like that evaluated. When you say "a little while," could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably about three or four months, I’d say. At first, it was very small, almost unnoticeable. But it seems to have grown a bit over the past month or so. It doesn’t really hurt, exactly, but it’s… uncomfortable sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months, and gradually increasing in size with some discomfort. That’s helpful. Could you describe the discomfort for me?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It's not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. And it's not constant. It seems to bother me more when I’m, say, standing for a long time, or after I’ve been doing something active. Like, if I’m gardening, or… I do a bit of choreography, so when I’m rehearsing. Nothing debilitating, but… noticeable.
DOCTOR: A dull ache related to standing and activity – that provides more clarity. And you mentioned choreography; is that a recent undertaking, or have you been involved in that for some time?
PATIENT: Oh, I've been a choreographer for quite a while now, Doctor. About ten years, I’d say. It's my profession. The rehearsals themselves haven’t been more strenuous recently, if that makes sense. Same level of activity as always. It’s just… the discomfort seems to coincide sometimes. I don't know if that's relevant.
DOCTOR: That’s certainly good information to have, Mr. Raghunathan, and could be relevant. Now, let's talk a bit more about the lump itself. Can you tell me where exactly in your lower abdomen you're noticing it?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s… lower and slightly to the left, I think. Not right in the middle. If you were to draw a line down the center of my stomach, it’s a little bit off to the left side. About… maybe two or three inches above my belly button? It’s hard to be precise, to be honest. I'm not very good at describing things like this.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Raghunathan; you're doing fine. Two to three inches above the belly button, slightly to the left. And what about size?
PATIENT: Oh, that's tricky too. When I first noticed it, it was… maybe the size of a grape, or a small marble. Now, it feels… larger. Perhaps the size of a plum now? It’s not huge, but definitely noticeable when I touch it. I haven't really measured it, if that makes sense. I just try not to poke at it too much.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. So, progressing from grape-sized to plum-sized over the past few months. Has there been any change in the skin over the lump?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I don’t think so. The skin feels… normal, I guess. Not red, or itchy, or anything like that. It doesn’t feel particularly hard or soft, either. Just… feels like skin, over a lump. I haven’t noticed any discharge or anything like that either, thankfully. Is that something I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no changes in the skin or any discharge. It’s always best to be thorough. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. No chronic conditions, no surgeries… just the regular check-ups with my family doctor. My wife handles most of the medical stuff, to be honest. She’s very organized. I'm on Medicare now, since I’m a bit older, but haven’t had to use it much yet.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had… she had some stomach problems when she was older, but I don’t know the details. She’s passed away now, so I can’t really ask. My father was healthy as a horse, if you’ll pardon the expression. No history of anything like this on either side, that I’m aware of. It’s probably nothing, but I thought it was best to get it checked, just in case. I try to be proactive about these things.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise, Mr. Raghunathan. Knowing your family history is helpful, even if it’s limited. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no allergies. I can eat anything, take most medications without issue. My wife always double-checks, though. She's very careful. She’s a nurse, so she knows all that stuff. I sometimes joke that she’s my personal medical encyclopedia.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're in very capable hands. Excellent. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take anything regularly. Maybe a pain reliever if I have a headache, but that’s it. I try to stay healthy with diet and exercise, so I don’t really need anything else. I have some vitamins in the cupboard, but I rarely use them. My wife buys them, just in case. She's always thinking ahead.
DOCTOR: Thank you for providing all that information, Mr. Raghunathan. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen, and gently palpate the area where you’ve noticed the lump. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I just want to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please lie down on the examination table, that would be great. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just try to relax and breathe normally. Normal bowel sounds throughout. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or uncomfortable. Okay. I do feel a small, firm mass in your lower abdomen, slightly to the left of the midline, as you described. It’s approximately two centimeters in diameter, and it doesn’t appear to be causing significant tenderness upon palpation. There's no rebound tenderness, and it’s not guarding. The skin over the area is smooth and unremarkable. Based on my initial examination, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of the lump. It could be a number of things, including a hernia, a lipoma, or an enlarged lymph node. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order some blood work and an abdominal ultrasound. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Blood work and an ultrasound… absolutely. Whatever you think is best to get to the bottom of things. I’m happy to do whatever is necessary. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me and explain everything so clearly. It’s a bit worrying, naturally, but I trust your expertise. When can I expect to get the results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. I understand your concern, and we’ll get this investigated thoroughly. The blood work will help us rule out any infection or inflammation, and the ultrasound will give us a detailed image of the lump and the surrounding tissues. Generally, the blood work results come back within 24 to 48 hours. The ultrasound results typically take a little longer, usually 2 to 3 business days, as the radiologist needs time to review the images and prepare a report. My office will contact you as soon as the results are available. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for next week, just to discuss the results and formulate a plan. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Next week works fine. And thank you again for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much more reassured knowing we’re taking a systematic approach to this. Please, let me know if there’s anything I should be doing in the meantime – any lifestyle changes or anything like that. I really appreciate your care.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. I'm glad I could ease some of your concerns. At this point, there's no need to make any significant lifestyle changes. Continue with your normal routine, and avoid any strenuous activity that causes you discomfort. If you experience any sudden pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or significant changes in bowel habits, please contact my office immediately. I’ll have my assistant schedule the follow-up appointment for you before you leave. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and kind. I really appreciate your patience and attention to detail. Thank you again for everything. I’ll wait to hear from your office regarding the appointment. Have a good day, Doctor Stilaire.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and have a good day as well.
