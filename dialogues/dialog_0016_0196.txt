DOCTOR: Hi Janie, welcome to the clinic. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… hi. Um, well, it's this tiredness. Just… always tired. It's been going on… a long time, I guess. I don't really… keep track of things so well anymore. It just feels like I have no energy for anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, “always tired” – that's a good place to start. And it’s okay that you don’t keep precise track of time; we’ll figure it out together. When you say “a long time,” would you say weeks, months, or even longer than that?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… longer than months, definitely. Maybe… a year? More? It all blurs together, you know? My husband… he passed a couple years ago and things haven't been the same since. I just feel… drained.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been incredibly difficult, and it's completely understandable that things haven’t been the same since. Grief can absolutely manifest as exhaustion, and it sounds like you've been carrying a lot. So, this tiredness… has it been constant for the past year, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… pretty constant, yeah. Some days are worse than others, of course. But it's always there. Like a weight. And… I just don't have the pep to do things. Even getting out of bed is hard some mornings. I used to love gardening… now I just look at it.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant tiredness, worse on some days, and it's affecting things you used to enjoy like gardening. That gives me a clearer picture. Are there any other symptoms that come along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I get… achy sometimes. My joints, mostly. And… I forget things. A lot. Like I said before, dates and stuff. But even… what I was just talking about. It's frustrating. Oh, and I feel… cold. Even when it’s warm.
DOCTOR: Okay, so achiness in your joints, increased forgetfulness, and feeling cold even when you shouldn't be. That’s helpful. When you say achy, is it all over, or in specific joints?
PATIENT: Mostly my knees and… my hands. And sometimes my lower back. It's not… sharp pain, just a dull ache. It’s worse when it’s damp out, I think. And the cold… it's like my bones are cold, you know? Not just my skin.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand what you mean. That “bone cold” feeling is good to know. And the achiness being worse with damp weather is also a detail we can use. Now, let's talk a little bit about other things. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… it’s not great. I don't really feel hungry, so I don’t eat much. And I've lost weight, I think. My clothes are a bit looser. I haven't weighed myself in… a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss. And you mentioned forgetfulness… has it been getting worse over time, or has it been fairly consistent?
PATIENT: It… feels worse lately. It's always been a bit of a problem, but now… it's like I’m constantly misplacing things, forgetting names… even simple things. It’s embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I can imagine that would be frustrating and embarrassing. It's good you're telling me about all of this. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. The doctor… before he retired… he said I had something with my thyroid. Hypo… something? I took a pill for it for a while, but I don't really remember much about it. I think it's been under control for years. And I have… high blood pressure, yes. I take medicine for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful. Hypothyroidism – that's a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone. And high blood pressure, which you're currently being treated for. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… no, not at all. It’s a little white pill. I take it every morning. I… I get the refills automatically, so I don’t really have to think about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can look it up in your records. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. I haven’t had any problems with anything. I don’t eat shellfish, but that’s just… a preference, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’m going to ask about any surgeries you’ve had in the past. Have you had any operations?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. And… I had a hysterectomy. That was… a long time ago, too. Before my husband passed.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a hysterectomy. And finally, do you have a family history of any medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear… my mother had… something with her heart. She died young. And my father… he had diabetes. I don’t know much beyond that, to be honest. My family wasn’t really one for talking about health problems.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart disease in your mother and diabetes in your father. Thank you for sharing all of that, Janie. That’s a lot of information and it’s very helpful. Let me just take a look at your records here to confirm some of this information and see what else we have… Okay, I see here you’ve been on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism for about 8 years. And you are currently taking lisinopril for high blood pressure. Your last thyroid test was about 6 months ago and it was within normal limits. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and feel your thyroid gland. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s fine. I guess. Just… hurry, please? I have some things I need to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick as I can. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your reflexes are a little slow, but not significantly so. Your thyroid gland feels slightly enlarged, but there are no noticeable nodules. I'm going to check your blood pressure now. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 148/92. It’s not dangerously high, but it’s higher than we'd like to see. Given your symptoms – the constant tiredness, achiness, forgetfulness, feeling cold, weight loss, and the slightly enlarged thyroid – I think it’s important to run some further tests. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel to get a more detailed look at what’s going on. I'd also like to check your vitamin D level, as low vitamin D can cause similar symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine. The tests… will that take long? I really need to get home.
DOCTOR: The lab should only take about 15-20 minutes. While you’re waiting, I can go over some of the things we’ve discussed and answer any questions you might have. We've ruled out some immediate concerns, but the tests will help us to understand what could be causing your symptoms, and ensure we aren't missing anything. It could be that your thyroid medication needs adjusting, or it could be something else entirely. We will get to the bottom of this. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… no, I don't think so. Just… get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the lab technician come in and draw your blood. They’ll just need a small sample. Once the results are back – usually within a couple of days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Sarah, could you please come in and draw blood for Janie Licano?
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janie. Please let me know if you need anything at all while you wait. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: .
