DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I am Dr. Eaddy. I see here you are a new patient. Perhaps you could begin by telling me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Yes, new patient. Everything is… a bit fuzzy these days, if I'm honest. But it’s my water. Keeps bothering me. Been happening on and off, you see. A lot of discomfort. I just want it fixed, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Fuzzy,” you say. Right. Well, discomfort with your water… that’s rather vague, Ms. Wease. Could you elaborate on what you mean by “discomfort”?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Elaborate… yes. It… burns, mostly. When I go to the bathroom. And… the urge. I have to go quite often. More often than I used to, certainly. It’s… unpleasant. Is that better? I don't really know what else to say. It just hurts.
DOCTOR: Burning with urination, increased frequency… yes, that’s marginally more helpful, Ms. Wease, though still imprecise. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… I… I don’t recall. Honestly, Doctor, things aren’t as clear as they once were. I try to keep everything clean, you understand. But… I haven’t looked, if that makes sense. I just… avoid thinking about it too much. It’s better that way.
DOCTOR: Avoiding it is rarely the optimal approach, Ms. Wease. However. We’ll proceed. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… Oh, goodness. Let me think. I felt a bit warm last week, maybe? But it was quite hot, wasn't it? I assumed it was just the weather. And my back… sometimes aches. I'm 66, Doctor! Everything aches. It's hard to say what's normal anymore.
DOCTOR: Right. Aches and a possible temperature. I suppose we should rule out anything serious. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh dear. Doctor, are you asking me about… that? I really… I don’t usually discuss such things. It's… personal. Everything is just a bit… off, lately. Is this relevant to my water problem? I just want this burning to stop.
DOCTOR: It’s all connected, Ms. Wease, whether you want it to be or not. But very well. No changes, then?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. Everything seems… the same in that department. Just… normal old age troubles. Honestly, I just want to know if it’s something serious, or if it’s just something I need to… manage. And quickly, if possible. I have a trip planned.
DOCTOR: A trip planned, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! To Florida. With my daughter, thankfully. She does all the driving, bless her heart. But I don't want to be… unwell, on holiday. It’s… important to me. It's been a long time coming. We were supposed to go last year, but… well, never mind. Point is, I need to know if I can go.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a quick examination, Ms. Wease. It’s rather difficult to ascertain much without a physical assessment. If you'll just lie down on the examination table, please. We'll start with an abdominal exam, then a quick check of your back. It won’t be pleasant, but it's necessary.
PATIENT: Oh. An examination. Right. Well, I suppose so. Necessary, you say? I really dislike doctors, you know. Always poking and prodding. But… Florida. Yes. Alright, Doctor. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat, Ms. Wease. And relax, if you can. Hmm. Tenderness in the lower quadrants. No palpable masses, thankfully. Now, let's check your back. Some muscle guarding, as expected. Nothing acutely concerning, but significant discomfort with palpation. No costovertebral angle tenderness. Right. Well, that's… something.
PATIENT: Something? That’s not very reassuring. Discomfort is an understatement, Doctor! What does it mean? Is it my kidneys? Is it something serious? Please, just tell me plainly. I don’t understand all the… the poking and the notes.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wease, "something" means we need to investigate further. It could be a kidney issue, or a simple urinary tract infection. Or something else entirely. I'm not going to offer definitive pronouncements based on limited information. Let's see… you’re uninsured, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, unfortunately. Divorced, and… well, things weren’t amicable. Insurance was the last thing on my mind. Does that mean… expensive tests? I’m on a fixed income, Doctor. I really can’t afford a lot of… procedures. I just want to feel better before my trip. Is there anything… simple? A pill, perhaps?
DOCTOR: A pill won’t address the underlying cause, Ms. Wease. However. Given your… financial constraints, we can start with a urinalysis to rule out a simple infection. It's relatively inexpensive. If that's negative, we'll need to discuss further options, potentially including imaging. But I must stress, delaying appropriate investigation could lead to more serious complications. It’s a risk you’ll need to consider. I’ll have the nurse draw a urine sample. And please, try to remain calm.
PATIENT: Imaging… more tests… Just a simple infection, please. That's all I'm hoping for. A simple pill and I can be on my way. Florida… I really need to go to Florida. Tell the nurse I'll… I'll try to remain calm. Just… hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse attend to you immediately. But I'll need you to provide a comprehensive list of any medications you are currently taking. And, if you recall, any relevant past medical history. It’s essential for accurate diagnosis, Ms. Wease, even for a "simple" infection. Let’s see… allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… oh dear. Let me think. I used to be allergic to bee stings, but that was years ago. And… I think I had a reaction to penicillin once, but it was so long ago, I can barely remember. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn't what it used to be. I'm not on any regular medication, no. Just… the occasional pain reliever for my back. And… is that all? I’m afraid I’m not very helpful. I just want to know if I can take my trip.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted, though it's difficult to ascertain the severity without more detail. Bee stings… irrelevant at this point. Right. The nurse will be in shortly to collect the urine sample. Please inform her if you experience any burning or discomfort during urination. And try to relax. It won’t expedite the process, but it may improve your comfort. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I… I will try to relax. And I'll tell the nurse about the burning. Please… please let it be something simple.
