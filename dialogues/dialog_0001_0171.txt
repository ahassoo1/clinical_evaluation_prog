DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. The doctor lady... she sent me here. Something 'bout my nails? They just… look funny. I don't really do nails. Never have. Not a big fan, you see. They just... changed. I think. It was a while ago, maybe?
DOCTOR: Right, right. Nails. Look, I got a waiting room full of actual problems, so if you can be specific, that’d be great. Changed how?
PATIENT: Specific… ugh. Okay, okay. They're… stripey? Like, lines. Not pretty lines, mind you. And one of 'em… feels kinda thick. Not broken, I don’t think. Just… different. I don’t know! That’s why they sent me! It's not like I went and got a fancy manicure or somethin’. I told ya, I don't do nails. It's probably nothin'.
DOCTOR: Stripey, you say. And thicker on one… Okay. Let’s take a look. Please extend your hands, palms up. Don't worry, I’m a doctor, I’ve seen it all. Though honestly, some people and their… concerns. Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. Longitudinal melanonychia… possibly. And some pitting. Not terribly concerning, but we need to rule things out.
PATIENT: Long… what-now-chia? Look, I don’t understand those big words. Is that… bad? You said "rule things out." Like, am I sick? I just want to know if I need some cream or somethin’. This is kinda stressin’ me out, honestly. I had a perfectly good afternoon planned.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Thut, you’re perfectly healthy, probably. But these changes could indicate something. It’s… pigmentation in the nail bed. It happens. The pitting…could be from a lot of things. Now, I'm not saying it's cancer, alright?
PATIENT: Cancer?! Oh, good heavens. See, this is why I hate doctors. Always jumpin' to cancer! I just wanted to know if it was somethin' I needed to put polish on, or… I don't know, file them down or somethin'! You’re makin’ me nervous for nothin’, I bet. My mother always said doctors just like to scare people. Is it gonna fall off? Will I lose a nail?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, calm down. It is extremely unlikely to be cancer. I said we need to rule it out, which means…get some tests. It is very rarely malignant. The pitting...it's just texture changes, likely. We'll get a fungal culture, just to be safe, and a biopsy on that one nail, the thicker one. Standard procedure. It's not a big deal, honestly. But you need to let me do the tests to be certain. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tests? Biopsy? Oh, for goodness sake. That sounds awful. What does a biopsy even mean? Are you gonna cut it off? I really don’t like this. Is this covered by Medicare? My mother always warned me about doctors and all their fancy procedures... and the bills. I don’t want a big bill. And I really don't want my nail cut off.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Thut. A biopsy is a tiny sample of the nail. We send it to a lab. It is not removing the entire nail, alright?
PATIENT: Tiny sample... like a little scrape? Okay, that’s… better than cuttin' it off, I guess. But it'll hurt, won’t it? And how long does all this take? I had plans, you know? I was supposed to visit my cousin Bernice. She just got a new cat. And what if the lab finds somethin’… bad? Are you gonna have to… do surgery? I really don't do well with surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright, look. The scraping is… minimally uncomfortable. A quick pinch. It'll take a few weeks to get the results. And if, and I stress if, there’s anything concerning, we'll discuss options. Probably just a topical treatment. Honestly, you're getting worked up over nothing. Now, let’s just get the sample and get this over with. I have other patients waiting. Nurse will be in to prep you. Some people… Honestly.
