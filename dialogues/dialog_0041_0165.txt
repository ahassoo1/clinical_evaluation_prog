DOCTOR: Hi Clide, good to meet you. I'm Derell Polczynski, one of the doctors here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Just call me Clide, please. What brings me in… it’s this fever. Keeps comin’ back, you know? It’s been a real bother. Not fun at all, especially with the heat we’ve been havin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide, good to meet you too. A recurring fever, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Not constant, thankfully. It’ll go away for a day or two, maybe three, then bam, it’s back. Happens maybe once a week now for the last month or so. It’s not super high, not like 103 or anything, more like… 100, 101. But it knocks me down a bit, makes me tired, achy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly 100 to 101, coming and going for about a month now, with some tiredness and aches along with it. Do you happen to know if anything seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed a pattern, to be honest. I’ve been tryin’ to think about it. Doesn’t seem to be related to what I eat, or where I go. I’m retired now, so I mostly just stay around the house, garden a little. Maybe stress? My wife, bless her heart, keeps me busy. But it’s the good kind of busy, you know? Really, I’m stumped. I wish I did know. It's just… happens.
DOCTOR: Right, it just… happens. Okay. And besides the fever, tiredness and aches, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I've been a little… thirsty, I guess. More so than usual. And maybe a little bit of a cough now and then, but nothing major. Just a tickle in my throat sometimes. No chills, no sweats, no rash, nothin’ like that. Just the fever, the tiredness, the aches, and the thirst. Oh, and I haven't been hungry like I normally am. Food just… doesn't seem appealing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no chills, no sweats, no rash. Thirst, decreased appetite, and a mild cough along with the fever, tiredness and aches. Have you had any changes in your bathroom habits recently?
PATIENT: Bathroom habits… now you’re askin’! Let's see... everything's pretty regular, if you know what I mean. No trouble there. Maybe a little looser stool a couple of times, but I figured it was somethin’ I ate. Nothing I’d really worry about. Definitely nothin’ consistent. It's been normal mostly, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly normal bowel movements. Have you been traveling anywhere recently, or been around anyone who's been sick?
PATIENT: No travel, Doctor. Haven’t left the state in years! And as for sick people… my grandson had a little cold last month when he came to visit, but that was it. Nothing serious. He was over it quick. I mostly keep to myself and my wife, like I said. We don’t really go out much. So, no, not around anyone sick lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a good picture, can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on some pills and it’s been under control for years now. Other than that… not much. I broke my wrist when I was a kid fallin’ off a bike, but that healed up fine. No surgeries, no major illnesses. I’m pretty lucky, actually. And I don't smoke, haven't for 50 years, and only have a glass of wine with dinner now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so managed hypertension, no surgeries, no major illnesses. You don't smoke and only drink a glass of wine with dinner. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to any medicine. My wife always double-checks, she’s very careful that way. Nothing with food either, I can eat just about anything. I've always been pretty good that way. No hives, no swelling, nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just the pills for the blood pressure, like I said. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes I take Tylenol for aches, but that’s only when I’m feelin’ the fever comin’ on. Otherwise, no. That's it. Nothing else. My wife keeps track of everything, so I’m pretty sure that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril for hypertension and Tylenol as needed. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your temperature, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I'm ready when you are. Just try not to poke too much, ha! Old man bones here don't bounce back like they used to.
DOCTOR: I'll be gentle, Clide. Okay, your temperature is 100.7. A little elevated. Now let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly rapid. Lung sounds are clear, no wheezes or crackles. Abdomen is soft, not tender, no masses. A little bit of decreased bowel sounds, but not significantly concerning. Blood pressure is 140/85, pulse is 88.
PATIENT: Okay, good to know. Sounds… alright, I guess. Is that good or bad? I always get nervous when you start listenin’ and pokin’, ha! What do you think is goin’ on, Doctor? My wife is gonna want to know as soon as I get home. She worries somethin’ fierce.
DOCTOR: It sounds okay, Clide, but the elevated temperature and slightly rapid pulse are somethin’ we need to investigate. The decreased bowel sounds are also a little unusual. Given your symptoms – the recurring fever, tiredness, aches, decreased appetite, and thirst – and the findings from the exam, there are a few possibilities. It could be a viral infection, but because it's recurring and not resolving completely, we need to rule out other things. Because you're not insured, I want to be careful not to order a lot of expensive tests right off the bat. However, I think a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel would be a good starting point to see if there’s any sign of infection or electrolyte imbalance. We can also do a urinalysis to check for a urinary tract infection. Would you be able to get those tests done at a local lab?
PATIENT: Tests… yeah, I guess so. I’d have to ask my wife about the money, though. She handles all that. She’s gonna want to know why we need ‘em, too. A complete what-now and a basic what-now? Sounds complicated. And a… urine-whatsis? Look, Doctor, I'm a simple man. Can you just tell me if it's serious or not? Is this somethin' I should be real worried about? I just wanna know what I'm dealin’ with. And is there anything I can do right now to make it better? Like, somethin' I can eat, or drink, or somethin'? I don’t want to just sit here waitin’ for tests. My wife is gonna have me takin’ all kinds of herbal remedies before you know it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Clide. You're right to want answers, and you're right to want to do something now. The complete blood count checks for signs of infection, like a high white blood cell count. The basic metabolic panel checks your kidney function and electrolyte levels, which can be affected by fever and dehydration. And the urinalysis just checks for infection in your urine. Right now, I don’t think this is an emergency, but it is somethin’ we need to investigate to rule out anything serious. It's unlikely to be a life-threatening situation at this moment, but persistent fevers can sometimes point to more significant problems. For now, the best thing you can do is rest, drink plenty of fluids – water is best – and continue taking Tylenol as needed for the fever and aches. Try to eat something light, even if you don't have much appetite. Soup or crackers might be good choices. We’ll get those tests done, and once we have the results, we can have a much better idea of what’s going on and how to best treat it. Would you like me to write down the names of the tests so you can discuss them with your wife?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Write ‘em down. That’d be a big help. She’s gonna grill me if I can’t explain why we’re spendin’ money on all this… stuff. Rest and drink water… that I can do. Tylenol too. Just… it’s just botherin’ me, you know? Keepin’ me down. And I hate feelin’ tired all the time. Okay. So, CBC… BMP… urine-something. Got it. If it’s somethin’ serious, Doctor… just tell me straight. I’m an old man, I’ve seen things. I don't need sugar-coatin’. My wife… she can handle it too. We face things together. Just let me know.
DOCTOR: Here you go. CBC, BMP, and Urinalysis. I appreciate your honesty, Clide. You’re right, it’s important to be straightforward. I promise to keep you both informed every step of the way. At this point, without the test results, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing your symptoms. But, to give you a little more clarity, potential causes could range from a prolonged viral infection to a bacterial infection, or even something like a urinary tract infection causing a low-grade fever. It's unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening, but we need the tests to rule out more serious possibilities like pneumonia or a kidney problem. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. If the tests are normal, we may just need to monitor your symptoms and provide supportive care. If they show an infection, we'll need to consider antibiotics or other treatments. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves or what to expect?
PATIENT: No, I think I got it. CBC, BMP, pee in a cup… got it. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you explainin’ it all so clearly. And bein’ honest. That means a lot. I guess… I guess I just gotta go home and wait for the results. And try not to worry too much. Easier said than done, though, with my wife around! Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. And hopefully, it's just somethin’ simple. I just wanna feel like myself again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clide. I’m glad I could help. Try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And I hope it is something simple. Take care, Clide. And give your wife my best.
