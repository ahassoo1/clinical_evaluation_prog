DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kilton. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is nice to meet you as well. I… I have been having trouble breathing. A whistling sound, when I breathe. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, trouble breathing with a whistling sound, I understand. That is something we should definitely look into. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? Let me think… It began maybe… two weeks ago? It was not so bad at first. Just when I walked quickly. But now… it happens even when I am sitting. It is… tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay, two weeks ago, starting with exertion and now happening at rest. And you said it’s tiring – can you describe that fatigue?
PATIENT: Yes, tiring. It is… like I have no energy. Even simple things, like walking to the kitchen, make me very breathless and then… weak. I need to sit down. It is not a muscle tiredness, you understand? It is… in my chest, almost.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand – fatigue with the breathlessness, and feeling it in your chest. That’s helpful. Have you noticed anything else along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. Sometimes… at night, I wake up. Not because of pain, but because I feel like I cannot get enough air. I have to sit up in bed. And… my chest feels tight then, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath waking you up at night and chest tightness. That’s important information. Do you have any cough associated with this?
PATIENT: A cough? Not a bad one, no. Sometimes, a little tickle in my throat. But not a proper cough, like when you are sick with a cold. Just a small one, if I try to clear my throat.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant cough, just a bit of throat clearing. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or COPD, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I have been healthy, mostly. I was a very active trainer, you know? Running, jumping… always moving. I have not spent much time in hospitals.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And how about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I do not think so. I like flowers, and I am outside a lot. Sometimes I sneeze, like anyone, but nothing… terrible. I have never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let's talk about your medical history a bit more broadly. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything else, or had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… many years ago, I broke my arm when I was young. A silly accident! But no hospital stays for anything serious. And no surgeries, no. Mostly just… bumps and bruises from training. I was always very careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, broken arm as a child, nothing else significant. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my mother, she had problems with her heart when she was older. She was very tired all the time. And my brother, he had… a bad cough for many years. But I do not know what it was. He did not like to talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mother with heart problems and a brother with a chronic cough. That’s helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a little about what your typical day looks like?
PATIENT: Well, now I do not train so much. I am retired. I like to garden, mostly. And I walk my dog, a little chihuahua named Pepita. She is very small, but very energetic! I also like to cook, and visit my friends. A quiet life, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, gardening, walking Pepita, visiting friends – a fairly active lifestyle, even in retirement. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never smoked. I do not like the smell of it. And it is bad for your health, you know. I always told my athletes that. Very important.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little something for my knees sometimes, when they ache. But it is just a cream, you rub it on. Nothing I take every day. Nothing for my breathing, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a topical cream for your knees. Alright, Ms. Kilton, thank you for all that information. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs and check your heart. Then I'll check your oxygen levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Please do. I trust your judgment. I hope you can find out what is wrong with my breathing.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Now, I’m listening to both sides of your chest. I hear some… wheezing. That’s consistent with some narrowing of the airways. And your heart sounds… regular, but a little bit fast. Now, let’s check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen is currently 92%, which is a little bit low.
PATIENT: Low? That does not sound good, Doctor. What does that mean? Is it serious? I do not understand… narrowing of the airways… is that what is making me so tired?
DOCTOR: No, don’t worry, 92% isn’t critically low, but it's lower than we’d like to see, especially with your shortness of breath. "Narrowing of the airways" means the passages that let air into your lungs are a bit constricted, making it harder to breathe. That definitely could contribute to your fatigue. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m hearing, it could be a few things. The most likely possibilities are asthma, even though you haven't been diagnosed before, or COPD, especially given your brother’s cough. It could also be something else entirely. To get a better idea, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a spirometry test – that’s a breathing test where you blow into a machine. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray and a breathing test… yes, that sounds… sensible. If it helps you find out what is wrong, then yes, please. I trust you, Doctor. A little worried, of course, but I want to know what is happening. Asthma… I always thought that was for children.
DOCTOR: You’re right to want to know, and you’re right, asthma is common in children, but adults can develop it too, or have it diagnosed later in life. And it can present differently in adults. Okay, I'll have the nurse come in and get an order for the X-ray and spirometry. It will likely be a bit of a wait for the X-ray, depending on how busy the radiology department is. The spirometry test we can do right here in the office. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler. It should help open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. Just in case, and to give you some relief while we wait for the test results. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A… a bronchodilator? Will that make me feel better quickly? I am a little nervous about taking something new, but… if it will help me breathe, then yes, please. A little nervous, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. What does it look like? And how do I use it?
DOCTOR: It’s a small, handheld device – this one is blue. You shake it well, then take one or two puffs as needed when you feel short of breath. The nurse will demonstrate the correct technique before you leave, and we'll have you practice here. It delivers medication directly to your lungs to open up those airways. It shouldn't make you feel anything drastic, but you might feel a slight improvement in your breathing shortly after using it. It’s important to note that this is just to manage your symptoms in the short term, while we figure out the underlying cause. After the tests, we can discuss a long-term plan. Do you have any allergies to any medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies to medications. I have never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. The nurse will show me how to use it? That is good. I am a little forgetful sometimes, so I will need her to be patient with me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The nurse is excellent, and very patient. She's used to helping people learn new techniques. She'll make sure you feel comfortable with it before you leave. Okay, I'm going to go ahead and put in the orders for the X-ray and spirometry now, and I'll have the nurse come in to review the inhaler with you. We should have the X-ray results within a few hours, and the spirometry results should be available fairly quickly after you have the test. Do you have any questions for me right now, before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that is all for now, Doctor. You have explained everything very clearly. I am a little worried, but I feel… reassured. Thank you. And please tell the nurse I might need a little extra help with the inhaler. I do try to be a good patient, but… sometimes my memory is not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little anxious, and I completely understand about the memory. I’ll be sure to let the nurse know. She’ll take good care of you. I’m glad I could reassure you. Please don’t hesitate to ask any questions that come to mind, even after you leave. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I'll have the nurse in shortly.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I will wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kilton. That's what I'm here for. Just take a deep breath and try to relax. The nurse will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: .
