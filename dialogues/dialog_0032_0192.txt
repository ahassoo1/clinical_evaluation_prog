DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I am Dr. Pipkorn. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, right. I'm here for... the thing for the army. The exam. Gotta get that done. Don't have time for messing around, you know? August 2nd, it is. Important date.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you have a scheduled Department of Defense physical examination. Quite right, August 2nd is noted. To ensure we complete everything efficiently, let’s start with a thorough history. Could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? What's to tell? I work with engines. All day. Keeps me busy. Not much time for… being sick. I eat, I sleep, I work. That’s it. No fancy problems, I promise you. Been doing it for... a long time now. Thirty years, at least. And my wife makes sure I get fed. Does that answer your question? It should.
DOCTOR: While that is… concise, Mr. Hartness, a bit more detail would be helpful for a comprehensive evaluation. When you say you haven't had "fancy problems," have you experienced any illnesses, injuries, or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had anything cut open. Illnesses... hmm. Had the flu, I guess, a couple times. Back when the kids were small, you pick up everything. A few colds. Nothing serious. Broke my wrist once, fixing a motorcycle engine, but that healed up fine. Didn't even need a cast, just a wrap. Strong bones, I got. That was... oh, maybe twenty years ago. It’s all just… time, you know?
DOCTOR: Very well. And has anyone in your family—parents, siblings, children—had any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Family? My dad... he smoked too much. Got something in his lungs. That was a long time ago. Mom was… fine. Always busy. Didn't really talk about health, to be honest. My sister, she's got bad knees. Runs a lot. That seems to be the problem. Kids are healthy, thankfully. No fancy problems there either. Look, I'm not a doctor. I fix things. Not talk about families and lungs. Is this important? Because I got things to do.
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Mr. Hartness, to gather a comprehensive medical history. It helps us ensure you meet the requirements for service. Now, regarding your current medications – are you taking any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements on a regular basis?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Not a one. I don't do pills. Waste of money, mostly. And vitamins? Please. I eat good food. My wife wouldn't let me take vitamins anyway. She says real food is all you need. And she’s usually right. So, no. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Just… work and food. Are we done yet? This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors – such as pollen or animals?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I grew up on a farm, remember? Exposed to everything. Dust, hay, animals... built up a resistance. I can handle anything. Pollen doesn’t bother me. Animals are fine. Bees sting, but that's just part of life. No. No allergies. Honestly, I’m a pretty tough Swede. You don’t get much tougher than that. It’s in the blood. So, next question? This is important, right? Getting me into the army?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. To proceed with the physical examination, I need to ask about any current symptoms you might be experiencing – anything at all, even if you think it’s minor. Are you experiencing any pain, fatigue, changes in your appetite or weight, difficulty breathing, digestive issues, or any other unusual sensations?
PATIENT: Sensations? Look, I work with engines all day. My hands are always dirty. My back aches sometimes, yeah, but that’s just from bending over. And I’m usually tired at the end of the day. What do you expect? I’m fifty-one years old! I don’t eat fancy food, I don’t sit around all day, and I work hard. Appetite is fine. Weight is...steady. Nothing unusual. Look, if something was wrong, wouldn't I know? I'm not an idiot. Can we just get this over with, please? This is a waste of both our times.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with the physical examination. Please step onto the scale for me. I will need to check your height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we can move on to a neurological assessment and a brief musculoskeletal evaluation. Afterwards, we can discuss the results and determine if any further testing is necessary. Please remove your shoes and stand straight.
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Get it over with. Just... be quick about it. I don’t like standing around. This better be accurate, too. My wife will have my hide if I tell her I gained weight.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, Mr. Hartness, but we can revisit that later. Now, if you’ll please turn around… I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Deep breaths. Easy for you to say. I've been breathing all my life. Just get on with it. Is something wrong? You’re making me nervous. Are you gonna tell me I can’t join the army? My wife is counting on this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything sounds okay, but I’d like to do a few more tests just to be thorough. Can you take a seat on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? More poking and prodding? Look, I told you, I'm a perfectly healthy Swede. This is ridiculous. I’ve built engines for thirty years. That’s a good test of a man’s strength. What more do you need?
DOCTOR: These are standard assessments, Mr. Hartness. I'm checking your reflexes, coordination, and strength. Please relax your legs. I’m going to tap just below your knee…
PATIENT: Ow! Hey! What was that for? That hurt! You didn't warn me! Look, I'm not a baby. I don't need to be treated like this. Can we just skip this part? This is a waste of time. And my knee feels funny now. Seriously.
DOCTOR: It’s necessary to assess your neurological function, Mr. Hartness. I am simply performing a routine examination. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Happy? Strong as an ox, I tell you. Always have been. Now, can we please be done with this? I need to get home. My wife is making dinner. She doesn't like it when I'm late. And she makes a mean stew if I keep her waiting. It’s a whole thing.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’d like to auscultate your abdomen next, Mr. Hartness. Please lie back and relax. I will need to listen to the sounds in your stomach.
PATIENT: Look, I just ate a sandwich. What are you expecting to hear? It’ll be rumbling, obviously. This is all just… silly. Are we close to being finished yet? I’m starting to feel like a… a science experiment. And I don’t like it one bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Thank you for your patience. Based on my initial examination, I’d like to order a few additional tests, including a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. These will help me rule out any underlying issues and determine your overall fitness for service. I’ll also need a urine sample.
PATIENT: .
