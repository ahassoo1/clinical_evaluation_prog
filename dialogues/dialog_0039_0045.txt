DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… well, I keep getting really red. My face, mostly. It just… flushes. It happens sometimes, not all the time. It’s a little embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It can definitely be embarrassing when things like that happen. Just flushing, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. Just red. No… nothing else. Not itchy, not painful, just… warm and red. It comes and goes. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes… I don’t know. That’s why I came. To find out why it happens.
DOCTOR: Alright. It's good you're getting it checked out. Let’s try to narrow things down a bit. You mentioned it happens sometimes after you eat… can you tell me what you typically eat when this occurs?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It’s not always after eating, but… when it is, it’s usually something spicy. Indian food, mostly. But not always! Sometimes it happens with… I had some pasta a few weeks ago and it happened then too. Not a very spicy pasta. So, I don’t think it’s just the spice.
DOCTOR: Okay, so not exclusively with spicy food, that's helpful. And you said it doesn’t happen every time you eat, even those foods?
PATIENT: No, not every time. Sometimes I eat a very spicy curry and nothing happens. Other times, a little bit of something… and I turn red like a tomato. It’s very strange. I’ve been trying to pay attention, but it’s hard to figure out what makes it happen.
DOCTOR: Right, that does sound a little unpredictable. Let’s see… Besides happening after eating, do you notice it happening at any other times?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… sometimes when I talk to people. New people, mostly. Or if I have to… speak in front of others. I get nervous, I think. And then my face gets red. Not always, but… often. It’s like… being shy, maybe? But I don’t feel shy, exactly. Just… warm. And red.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like it might be connected to stress or anxiety as well as food. Do you feel any other symptoms when your face flushes, like a racing heart, sweating, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the… heat. And the red. Sometimes my face feels a little… tight. But no racing heart, no sweating. Just warm and red and… a little uncomfortable. It goes away pretty quick, usually. Five, ten minutes. But it’s… worrying. It makes me wonder if something is wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Withycombe. It’s good you're paying attention to it. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I was a little sick with the flu last winter, but that’s it. I don’t take any pills, not regularly. The doctor checked my blood pressure a few years ago, it was… fine, I think. He didn’t say anything was wrong. I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I’ve been pretty healthy, mostly. Except for this flushing, of course. It’s new. Started maybe six months ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, and otherwise pretty healthy. That’s good to know. And no family history of anything similar – like, do your parents or siblings get flushed easily?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My parents are both… gone now. And I don’t see my brother very often. We don't really talk about… health things. I don't remember them having this problem, but… I wasn’t paying much attention to those things when I was younger. Sorry. I don't have a good answer for you.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Withycombe. It's understandable that you don't have that information. Let's move on. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, none of those things. Never liked alcohol. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I definitely don’t use any… those things. I’m a counselor, Doctor. I help people with those problems. It wouldn't be a good look.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense! Very good. Now, can you tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Well, I like to cook. Indian food, mostly. Lots of vegetables, rice, lentils. I try to eat healthy. I don't eat a lot of… fast food. Maybe once a month. I like spicy food, as we said, but I also eat… pasta, sometimes. Salad. I drink a lot of water. I’m trying to be good. But I do like sweets, sometimes. A little bit of chocolate, maybe. Nothing too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, sounds like a generally healthy diet, with a little room for treats, as it should be! Now, just to get a better idea, about how much water do you drink in a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, a lot! I have a big bottle… about two liters, maybe. I refill it a few times. I try to drink it throughout the day. I used to drink more coffee, but I stopped. Water is much better, I think. It helps with… everything. Keeps me feeling good. And maybe it helps with the flushing, I don't know. But I drink a lot of it. Really. Two liters, easy. Maybe more on a hot day.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful, Mr. Withycombe. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I don't mind. I just want to find out what’s causing this flushing. Please, go ahead. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just sit back and relax… First, let's check your blood pressure. Okay. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not drastically so. Heart and lungs sound clear. And… yes, I see some mild redness on your cheeks and nose. No visible rash or anything concerning. Skin feels normal to the touch. Everything seems within normal limits, physically. Given your description and what I’m seeing, it sounds like you may be experiencing something called rosacea. It’s a common skin condition that causes facial flushing, redness, and sometimes small, visible blood vessels. Stress and certain foods can be triggers, which aligns with what you’ve told me.
PATIENT: Rosacea? I've never heard of that. Is it… serious? Does it need… pills? Will it go away? I mostly just want to stop turning red. It’s embarrassing, you know? I don't want people staring at me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Withycombe. Rosacea isn’t generally considered a serious condition, but it can be uncomfortable and bothersome. It doesn’t typically require pills, thankfully. It's more about managing the symptoms. There are several things we can try. Avoiding triggers like spicy foods and stressful situations is a good starting point. There are also topical creams and gels that can help reduce redness and inflammation. In some cases, we might consider a low-dose antibiotic, but we'll start with the simpler options first. It’s often manageable with lifestyle changes and medication. It doesn’t usually go away completely, but we can definitely get it under control. I'm going to recommend a gentle skincare routine, and we can discuss some avoidance strategies. We can also look at some stress-reduction techniques if that seems helpful. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Less stress... that’s a good idea, maybe. I do worry a lot. And a cream… okay, that’s better than pills. What kind of cream? Is it expensive? I… I don't have insurance, Doctor. I'm a little worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Withycombe. That's very reasonable. There are several options, and we can definitely find something affordable. A common one is metronidazole cream, which is usually quite inexpensive, even without insurance. We can also explore some over-the-counter options that might provide some relief. I'll write you a prescription for metronidazole, and I'll also give you a list of some gentle skincare products to look for. We can start with that, and if it's not effective enough, we can discuss other options. There are also some resources available that offer financial assistance for medications. I can provide you with some information about those as well. Here you go. The prescription is for a generic metronidazole cream. Apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice a day after washing your face with a gentle cleanser. And here’s a list of some skincare products that are fragrance-free and non-irritating. I also want to recommend avoiding harsh soaps, rubbing your face too vigorously, and prolonged sun exposure. Sunscreen is essential, even on cloudy days. I'll also give you a handout about rosacea with more information. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that makes sense. Avoid spicy food, avoid rubbing my face, use the cream, sunscreen… It’s a lot to remember, but I can try. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I was really worried, and now I feel… a little better. One more question. How long will it take to see if the cream is working? And… if it doesn’t work, what then? Is there anything else I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: That's a great question, Mr. Withycombe. It usually takes about 4-8 weeks to see a noticeable improvement with metronidazole cream. It's important to be consistent with the application, even if you don't see results right away. If it doesn't work, we can explore other topical medications, like azelaic acid or ivermectin. In some cases, we might consider a low-dose antibiotic, but we'll try the simpler options first. As for other things to be worried about, rosacea itself isn’t usually a serious condition, but it can sometimes be associated with other conditions, like dry eyes or skin infections. If you notice any signs of infection, like redness, swelling, or pus, please let me know right away. Also, if your eyes are particularly dry or irritated, we can refer you to an ophthalmologist. But generally, with proper management, rosacea is very treatable. I want you to follow up with me in 8 weeks so we can assess your progress. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. And remember, stress management is key! Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I’m glad I could help. Remember to take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day.
