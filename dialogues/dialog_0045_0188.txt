DOCTOR: Alright, Criston. So, you’re here today… tell me what brought you in. Don’t leave anything out, even if it seems small. I need the full picture to help you properly, you know?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. Okay. My pee… it is orange color. It started maybe three days ago. Not all the time, but most times when I go. I drink water, like usual, maybe two liter a day. I don’t know why it is orange. It scare me a little.
DOCTOR: Orange urine, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… the color of… orange juice, but not so bright. More… dull. I am sorry, I not good with colors. Is that… bad? Should I be worry?
DOCTOR: Well, it could be a number of things. It's not always something serious, but we need to figure it out. You said it started three days ago. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Nothing like that. Just… the color. And I feel normal, like always. I work hard, you know? Engineering… lots of walking, checking things. No fever, no… how you say… shaking? I feel good, just worry about the pee. My wife, she say go to doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no burning, no fever, no shaking. Just the color change and you're feeling otherwise fine. That's good. Engineering, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. I work with… the pipes, and the machines. Big buildings. Lots of walking. Sometimes very hot. We drink lots of water to stay cool. Maybe it is from that? The sun, the work… I don’t know. Is the sun make your pee orange?
DOCTOR: The sun itself doesn’t directly make your pee orange, no. But dehydration can concentrate your urine, which could change the color. You mentioned drinking a lot of water… two liters, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor, two liter. Sometimes more if it is very hot. But I drink it all day. Not all at once, you know? Little bits. My wife, she tell me I need to drink more, even. She is always right about things like that. Is it possible… from the things I eat? I eat normal food, Moroccan food sometimes.
DOCTOR: Certain foods can affect urine color, but it’s usually not this dramatic. Moroccan food… I doubt that's the cause, honestly. Let’s do a quick check. I'm going to need a urine sample. Just a small one, into this cup. Then we’ll run a simple test to see what’s going on. Don't overthink it.
PATIENT: Okay, doctor. Urine sample. Yes, I can do that. Where is the… room? And how much? Little bit, you say? Is okay if I go now?
DOCTOR: Down the hall, first door on the left. There's a little room in there, perfectly private. Just enough to fill this cup, about two ounces. And yes, go ahead now. I'll be right here when you're finished. Don’t worry about it. It’s routine.
PATIENT: Okay, doctor. Thank you. Two ounce… I think I understand.
DOCTOR: Two liters of water… healthy lifestyle… what is going on with this man?
PATIENT: Here you go, doctor. I try to get enough. I hope it is okay. I not very good at these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to make sure everything sounds normal. And I’ll check your abdomen as well. Just a standard examination. Take a deep breath for me…
PATIENT: Okay, doctor. Heart and lungs… yes. Is everything okay so far? I feel… a little nervous. Is normal?
DOCTOR: Everything seems normal so far, structurally. Heart rate is good, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. But we’ll see what the urine test shows. You mentioned your wife is concerned. Is she usually right about these things?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor, she is always right. Always. She knows me very well. If I feel a little tired, she knows before I tell her. She is… very observant. She say I work too hard, and worry too much. Maybe that is it? Worry make my pee orange?
DOCTOR: While stress can affect the body in various ways, it's unlikely to cause orange urine. Let’s wait for the lab results. It will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. The results should be back in about fifteen minutes. In the meantime, are you taking any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Vitamins…? Hmm. My wife, she give me… a multivitamin sometimes. For the energy. And… Oh! There is also a… a herbal tea. For the… kidneys. She say it is good for the kidneys. I drink it maybe two times a week. Is that… important? Could that be it? She gets it from Morocco, from her sister.
DOCTOR: A herbal tea… for the kidneys?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. She say it cleans the kidneys. It is… a dark color, the tea. And it smells… strong. Like plants, you know? She say it is very good for my health, but maybe… maybe it is making my pee orange? She is always trying to help me, my wife. Is that possible, doctor? Should I stop drinking the tea?
DOCTOR: Herbal supplements… especially those from unregulated sources… can absolutely affect urine color and potentially cause other issues. We really need to be careful with those. Yes, Criston, I strongly advise you to stop drinking the tea immediately. Until we know what’s in it, it’s best to be safe. We'll run some additional tests to check your kidney function, just to be sure everything is alright. And please, next time, before trying any new supplements, talk to me first. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor, I understand. No more tea. I will tell my wife. I am sorry, I did not think it was important. She just want to help me. I will ask you first next time, I promise. Is the… tests, are they bad? Will they hurt? I worry about the needles.
DOCTOR: The tests are routine, Criston. A simple blood draw and a urine analysis. The blood draw… yes, there’s a small needle involved, but it’s quick, and most people don’t even feel it. It's to check your kidney and liver function, just to make sure everything is working properly. And the urine analysis will give us more information about the composition of your urine. We're just being thorough, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, doctor. Thorough. Yes. I understand. Blood draw… quick needle. Is okay. Let's do the tests. I want to know what is wrong with my pee. And I will tell my wife to… to stop giving me tea. She will be happy you told me. She worry about my health too, you know? Thank you, doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect another urine sample. It will take about fifteen minutes, and then we’ll review the results. Just try to relax. We're getting to the bottom of this. Herbal tea… honestly. People and their self-treatment…
PATIENT: Okay, doctor. Relax. I will try. Thank you again, doctor. I appreciate your help.
