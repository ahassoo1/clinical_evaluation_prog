DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. I’m Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure. Well, to be frank, it’s the cigarettes. I’ve been smoking… a long time, you understand, and I think it’s finally time I tried to do something about it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that you’re taking this step, Mr. Knoch. And thank you for being frank with me; that helps a lot. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me how many cigarettes you typically smoke in a day, and for how long have you been smoking?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. For most of my adult life, really. Started when I was seventeen, back in Lithuania, and… well, it’s been sixty years, give or take. As for how many… it varies. Maybe a pack and a half a day? Sometimes more if I'm… troubled. It’s hard to say precisely, I don’t keep track anymore. I just know it’s too many.
DOCTOR: Sixty years is a long time, Mr. Knoch. And a pack and a half a day… that gives me a good starting point. Have you tried to quit before?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Many times. Patches, gum… even those… what are they called… hypnotists? Didn’t work, not for long, anyway. Usually lasted a day or two, maybe three if I was lucky. Then the cravings… they just come back too strong. It’s like a… a need, you understand? Not just a habit. A real need. I’d try anything at this point, I suppose. Though I don't hold much hope, truthfully.
DOCTOR: I understand that can be incredibly frustrating, Mr. Knoch. And you’re right to mention it's more than just a habit; nicotine is a very addictive substance. It's good you’ve tried things in the past, that gives us some information. Before we discuss options, could you tell me if you’ve experienced any symptoms related to your smoking, such as shortness of breath, a chronic cough, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… yes. Shortness of breath, definitely. Especially when I walk uphill. And a cough, always a cough. Thought it was just… old age, you know? But it’s worse in the mornings, a deep, rattling cough. Chest pain… not sharp, more of a… tightness, sometimes. It comes and goes. I haven’t bothered the doctor about it, to be honest. Figured it was the cigarettes. Perhaps I should have.
DOCTOR: You absolutely should have, and I’m glad you’re telling me now. We need to assess that further. I’m going to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen saturation. Then, I think a chest X-ray would be a good idea to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I suppose I have been putting it off long enough. An X-ray, yes. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just… want to know what damage has been done, I suppose. And if there's anything still can be done. Is that alright to ask?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Knoch. That’s exactly what we’re here for. It’s perfectly alright to ask. Let's start with listening to your lungs. If you could just sit back and take some deep breaths for me when I ask, that would be great. Alright, take a deep breath in… and out… good. Again… and out… Okay, one more time… deep breath in… and out. I’m hearing some wheezing and diminished breath sounds, particularly in the lower lobes. That's consistent with what you've described. Now, let’s check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen saturation is 92%. That’s a little on the lower side. Now, I’m going to get the order for that chest X-ray. It will give us a much better look at your lungs and heart.
PATIENT: 92%, you say? That doesn’t sound… good, does it? I suppose not. Very well. An X-ray then. I… I appreciate you being frank with me, Doctor. It’s… unsettling to hear all this, but I suppose it's better to know the truth. Do I need to schedule this myself, or will your office handle it? I'm not very good with these… modern conveniences.
DOCTOR: You’re right, 92% is a bit lower than we’d like to see, and it does warrant further investigation. And you’re very welcome, Mr. Knoch. It's my job to be upfront with you. Don't worry about scheduling anything yourself. My nurse, Sarah, will take care of that for you before you leave. She’ll give you the details on where to go for the X-ray, and when. It should be relatively quick. While we wait for the results, let’s talk about your smoking history in a little more detail. Have you ever considered any medication specifically designed to help with smoking cessation, like bupropion or varenicline?
PATIENT: Medication… No, I haven't. Not that I recall, anyway. The doctor back home just offered patches and gum, and when those didn’t work… well, he didn’t have much else to say. Bupropion… varenicline… what are those, exactly? Do they have… side effects? I’m not one for taking a lot of pills, if you understand. I prefer to keep things… natural, if possible. Though, clearly, that hasn’t worked out so well.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Knoch. It’s good to be cautious about medication. Bupropion and varenicline are both prescription drugs that can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. They work by affecting chemicals in the brain. Like all medications, they do have potential side effects. Bupropion can sometimes cause insomnia or dry mouth, and varenicline can cause nausea or unusual dreams. However, these side effects are usually mild and manageable. We would discuss these in detail, and carefully weigh the risks and benefits before starting either medication. There are also non-pharmacological options we can explore, such as nicotine replacement therapy—like the patches and gum you mentioned—and behavioral counseling. But given your history of smoking for so long, and the symptoms you’re experiencing, I think medication might be worth considering. Before we go further, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, as far as I know. I haven’t taken much in the way of medicine over the years. Mostly just… aspirin for headaches, when needed. The behavioral counseling… that sounds… difficult. I’m not one for talking about my feelings, if you understand. I’ve always been a… private person. But the medication… if it could actually help, then perhaps I’d be willing to try it. What’s the first step, then? Do I need to have any blood tests, or anything like that? I’m getting a little anxious now, to be honest. All this talk of chemicals and side effects… it’s a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Knoch. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed when discussing medications. And it’s good that you’re a private person; that's perfectly alright. We don't have to delve into anything you’re not comfortable with. Before starting any medication, we would need to do a basic health screening, including a blood test to check your kidney and liver function. That’s just to make sure the medication is safe for you. It's a standard precaution. Sarah will arrange that as well. In the meantime, let’s focus on getting those chest X-ray results back. Once we have those, we’ll have a clearer picture of your lung health and can make a more informed decision about the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds sensible. Blood tests and the X-ray. One step at a time, I suppose. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It puts my mind at ease a little, knowing what to expect. Is there anything I should be doing now, while we wait for the results? Should I… try to cut back on the cigarettes? Or would that just be… pointless? I don’t want to do anything that might interfere with the tests, or make things worse.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Mr. Knoch. While we wait for the results, I would advise against trying to drastically cut back or quit smoking completely. Suddenly changing your smoking habits could affect the X-ray interpretation and make it harder to get an accurate reading. We want a baseline, if you understand. Continue smoking as you normally would until we have the results and discuss your options. We can then develop a plan tailored to your specific needs. In the meantime, try to focus on staying hydrated and getting enough rest. That will help support your overall health. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions before Sarah gets back with you. Is there anything else I can address for you at this moment, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s all. You’ve answered all my questions, and explained everything very clearly. I’ll just… wait for Sarah, then. Thank you, Doctor Soodeen. I appreciate your time and your patience. It’s… nice to finally be doing something about this, even if it’s a little frightening.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knoch. It takes courage to address these things, and I commend you for taking this step. I'm here to support you every step of the way. I'll let Sarah know to come in and get you scheduled. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Knoch.
