DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Pleasure’s all yours, I’m sure. It’s… well, it’s a bit silly, really. I just need a card. A “Get Well” card, or maybe one that says “Hang in there.” Something nice. You know, from the doctor. People get so much more encouraged when it’s official like that. My daughter says I worry too much, but it’s good to have something to show people, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: I see. While I appreciate your… unique request, Ms. Micucci, I am a physician. My role is to provide medical care, not to furnish greeting cards. Perhaps a local stationery shop would be a more suitable resource for your needs. However, as you are here in the office, I must ask: is there an underlying medical concern that prompted you to seek a doctor's validation for this request?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, when you put it like that… It’s just… my arthritis is acting up something fierce, you see? And my cousin, she’s been saying I don’t take care of myself. So I thought, if you wrote a card saying I should rest and take it easy… it’d shut her right up. And it'd prove I am listening to doctor’s orders! It's common sense, really. She doesn’t understand these old bones. A card from you carries weight. Not just any card, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand you’re seeking reassurance, Ms. Micucci, and perhaps a means to address a familial disagreement. However, utilizing official medical documentation – even in the form of a simple card – for non-medical purposes is… inappropriate. Let’s focus on the arthritis you mentioned. Can you tell me more about when this flare-up began, and what symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. You’re very… particular, aren’t you? Fine, the arthritis. It started maybe a month ago, right after that awful humidity we had. My hands, mostly. They ache something terrible, especially in the mornings. And my knees, they creak like an old gate. It makes getting up and down stairs…well, it’s a production. It’s not like I’m crippled, mind you, but it’s annoying. Very annoying. My daughter keeps telling me to do exercises, but honestly, at my age…? It feels like it'd just make it worse.
DOCTOR: I see. And has this pain been consistent over the past month, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. Some days are better than others. But when it is bad… whew. It's a deep ache, right in the joints. And it makes everything harder. Even just holding a cup of tea is a struggle. Though, I do manage. I always manage. I'm a strong woman. But it’s…well, it’s wearing me down a bit. Honestly, it's just a bother, that’s all. A real bother. I don’t want to be a burden to my daughter. That’s why I don’t complain too much. Though she would have you know I complain plenty.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any swelling or redness in the affected joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Not much redness, no. Sometimes my knuckles look a little… puffy, maybe? But I thought that was just because of the weather. We’ve had a lot of rain, you see, and it always makes my hands feel… full. And it's hard to tell, really. My skin isn't what it used to be. It's gotten rather loose, you know? It’s not like a big, obvious swelling. Just… a bit softer than usual. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not good at describing these things. It just aches. That’s the main thing. A deep, awful ache.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried any treatments for the pain yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, my daughter got me some of those… creams. The ones you rub on. They smell nice, lavender or something, but they don't do much, honestly. And I take a little bit of that ibuprofen, when it gets really bad. But I don't like taking pills, you see? Makes me feel a bit… fuzzy. And my cousin keeps saying I should try those turmeric supplements, but I don’t trust all those natural things. Seems a bit…witchy, if you ask me. Mostly, I just try to ignore it and get on with things. It's what I've always done.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, it's important that we address this pain systematically. Ignoring it won't make it go away, and self-treating without a proper diagnosis can be… less than ideal. Let's perform a brief physical examination of your hands and knees, just to assess the range of motion and identify any specific areas of tenderness or inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I suppose. A quick look, you say? Not one of those… invasive things, I hope? I don't like being poked and prodded. And please be gentle. These old bones aren’t as strong as they used to be. Just a quick look, then? And then… maybe we can talk about that card again? A little encouragement never hurt anyone. It’s good for the soul, you know. A doctor's encouragement, especially.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Micucci. A quick examination. Please extend your arms, palms up. I’m noting some slight crepitus in the metacarpophalangeal joints… that's the small joints in your hands. And there is mild tenderness upon palpation of the distal interphalangeal joints…those are the joints closest to your fingernails. No significant swelling at this time, though. Now, let’s examine your knees. Please bend and straighten your legs as comfortably as possible. There is mild tenderness along the medial aspect of both knees, and some discomfort with full extension. Range of motion is otherwise within normal limits. Based on this brief examination, your symptoms are consistent with osteoarthritis. It’s a degenerative joint condition that becomes more common with age.
PATIENT: Oh. Osteo-what-sis? Is that… serious? My cousin always said I had bad bones. Well, not bad bones, exactly. But she said I didn’t take enough calcium. Calcium and those turmeric things. So, it’s not… my imagination? It's a real thing, then? And it won’t just… go away? And what does that mean, exactly? Does that mean I’ll be… crippled? And still… is there any chance we could discuss a card? Just a simple “Take it easy” or “Rest up”? It would really put my mind at ease, you know. And my cousin's. Honestly, Doctor, a little bit of official encouragement goes a long way.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, osteoarthritis is a common condition, and while it can cause discomfort and limit mobility, it is rarely debilitating. It's not a sudden illness, but a gradual wearing down of the cartilage in your joints. It's not your imagination. As for a cure… unfortunately, there is no single cure for osteoarthritis. However, we can manage the symptoms with a combination of strategies. Physical therapy can strengthen the muscles around your joints, providing support and reducing pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen, can help with inflammation. In some cases, we may consider injections to lubricate the joints. We will also need to discuss lifestyle modifications, such as weight management and low-impact exercise. Regarding the card… I understand your desire for reassurance, but I maintain that it is inappropriate to utilize official medical documentation for non-medical purposes. My professional responsibility is to provide you with accurate medical care, not to function as a source of… emotional support. However, I can provide you with a written summary of our discussion today, outlining your diagnosis and treatment plan. That might serve as some validation for your concerns. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. So, no card. Alright. I understand. Sort of. You’re very… firm, aren't you? But a written summary… hmm. That’s… something, I suppose. It’s not quite the same as a nice, official “Get Well” card, but it’s better than nothing. Will it say… things like, “Take it easy”? Or "Rest up"? And that I need to listen to the doctor? My cousin will only listen if it’s in writing, you see. She thinks I exaggerate everything. A lot. And… will it say I’m not making things up? That my hands really do ache? It would be awfully helpful, you know. To have something official to show her. Something from you. Even if it’s not on a card. Just a little something. Please?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I can include a statement outlining your reported symptoms – the aching hands and knees, the discomfort with movement – and my recommendation for conservative management, including physical therapy and pain relief. I can also state that these symptoms are consistent with osteoarthritis and warrant a change in lifestyle to improve your quality of life. However, I will not include phrases like "Take it easy" or "Rest up" – those are not medical directives. And I will not directly address your cousin’s perception of your symptoms. My responsibility is to document your medical condition accurately, not to mediate familial disputes. I can, however, emphasize the importance of adhering to the treatment plan to improve your overall health and well-being. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. That’s… something. It’s not quite a card, but it’s… detailed. And official. Emphasizing the treatment plan… yes, that’s good. My cousin respects… details. She likes things to be very thorough. So, it will say all that? The aching hands, the knees, the treatment plan? And that it's… real? And official? Please tell me it will be official. With a stamp or something? That would be very convincing. And how long will it take? My cousin is coming over for tea tomorrow afternoon. It would be awfully helpful if I had it before then. Just to… present the evidence, you see. It's very important. For my health. And my peace of mind. And… my cousin’s. Honestly, Doctor, a little bit of official documentation goes a long way.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I can generate a summary of our discussion, including your reported symptoms and my treatment recommendations. It will be printed on official clinic letterhead and include my signature and the clinic’s stamp. It will not, however, contain language stating your symptoms are definitively proven or designed to convince your cousin. I can have it printed within the hour. My receptionist will call you when it is ready for pick-up. I must emphasize, however, that the purpose of this document is to provide you with a medical record of our consultation, not to serve as ammunition in a family disagreement. Now, are there any other medical concerns I can address today, or shall we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. The letterhead and stamp… that’s good. That’s very good. It sounds official. I suppose that will have to do. No, I don't think so. That's all. Just the letter. The letter with the stamp and the letterhead. And maybe… maybe if you could just speak very clearly when you're explaining everything? Just so I can repeat it verbatim to my cousin? That would be awfully helpful. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… thorough. Even if you wouldn't give me a card. And please… if you see my cousin around, could you just confirm everything? That would be awfully kind. Honestly, Doctor, a little bit of validation goes a long way. Alright. I suppose I'll go and wait for the call. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Micucci. My receptionist will notify you when the summary is ready. I will, however, refrain from engaging in any discussions with your cousin regarding your medical condition. Maintaining patient confidentiality is paramount. Please, take care of yourself. And remember to adhere to the treatment plan. .
