DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Gegan, nice to meet you too. Um, well, I've just been getting these chills. It's a bit strange, honestly. Not a fever or anything, just… cold. It started a couple of days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills without a fever – that is a little unusual, but we’ll figure it out. Can you tell me a bit more about these chills?
PATIENT: Sure. They come and go, mostly. Not constant. Like, I'll be perfectly fine, then suddenly feel really cold, even if it’s warm in here. It's not like shivering cold, more… a deep cold, you know? And they don't seem to be connected to anything specific. I've been trying to think if I was exposed to a draft or something, but nothing comes to mind.
DOCTOR: I understand. A deep cold that comes and goes… alright. And you said it started a couple of days ago. Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as these chills?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Not really, no. I’ve been a little tired, maybe? But honestly, I'm usually pretty tired. Work's been busy. I haven't really had a cough, or a sore throat, or anything like that. No aches or pains. Just... the chills and the regular tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills and tiredness, without other typical illness symptoms. Now, have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I'm eating normally, I think. And my weight... well, it's always sort of the same, you know? I haven't noticed any big changes. I try to eat healthy, but I definitely have my moments with sweets!
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Alright, Jailenne, and just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. Nothing major, really. I had chickenpox when I was a kid, and I broke my arm once, but that's about it. No serious illnesses or anything. I don't have any allergies that I know of. I had a divorce a few years back, which was… stressful, but that's not a medical thing, right?
DOCTOR: No, that’s certainly not a medical condition, although stress can impact your health. It’s good to know about though. And you said no allergies?
PATIENT: Right, no allergies. No reactions to any medications I’ve taken, as far as I know. I don’t take any regular medication at all, actually. Just the occasional pain reliever if I have a headache. I have private insurance, so I usually go to the doctor when I need to. It's just…these chills are weirding me out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known allergies, no regular medications. Good to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any significant medical conditions – things like autoimmune diseases, thyroid problems, or frequent infections?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. My mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had some heart issues when he was older, but nothing too serious. My grandmother on my mom's side had diabetes. And I think… my aunt had something with her thyroid, but I'm really not sure what exactly. It was a long time ago, and we don't talk about medical stuff much in my family, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand; many families aren't comfortable discussing medical details. That gives me something to consider. And finally, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I work as a Health Education Specialist, so I'm always talking about healthy living! I try to eat well, though like I said, I have a sweet tooth. I don’t smoke, and I hardly ever drink alcohol. I don't get a lot of exercise, to be honest, I mostly walk. Work keeps me pretty busy. I live in the city, so I walk a lot to work, but I don’t really do much other exercise. I try to get enough sleep when I can, but it's not always easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a busy lifestyle with a focus on healthy habits but could use a bit more dedicated exercise. That’s helpful information. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine. Go ahead. I just hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to check your temperature. Normal temperature. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound good. I'm going to palpate your lymph nodes now. Your lymph nodes don't feel enlarged. Finally, I’ll do a quick neurological exam. Your reflexes and sensation are normal. Everything seems normal so far, Jailenne. But since you're experiencing these chills, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. If it helps figure out what’s going on, absolutely. Blood work is fine. Hopefully it's nothing too concerning.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to order a Complete Blood Count with differential, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel , a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test, and a Vitamin D level. These will give us a good baseline and help rule out things like infection, electrolyte imbalances, thyroid issues, and vitamin deficiencies. The lab is just down the hall. Once you've had the blood drawn, you can come back and we can discuss the results when they're available. It usually takes a couple of days. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, severe fatigue, or any other concerning symptoms – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic or go to the emergency room. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. A couple of days is alright. I’ll head to the lab now. And thank you, Dr. Gegan, for taking the time to listen and run the tests. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. It's my pleasure. I'm glad you came in. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your results are back. We'll figure this out together. You can find me through the patient portal, or call the clinic’s main line. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Dr. Gegan. I will. Bye!
