DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I’m Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi Doc. I'm here for a sports team tryout. Need a check-up to make sure I'm good to go, you know? Gotta get cleared by a doctor first. It’s for… uh… basketball. Don’t need to bother with a long story, just need to pass the physical.
DOCTOR: Okay, basketball. Good. That’s helpful to know. Thirty years in medicine, and I’ve seen my share of hopeful athletes. Just so I have everything accurate, you’re Lamark Kingan, age 62?
PATIENT: Yep, that's me. Sixty-two. Feels a little old for basketball, I know, but I try to stay in shape. Just wanna see if I still got it, really. Can we just get this over with? I got things to do, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. We'll be as efficient as possible. Before we start the physical, let’s just go over a few things, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Quick is good. Fire away.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, have you been experiencing any pain anywhere in your body – chest pain, shortness of breath, joint pain, anything like that?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Little aches and pains, you know, like any old guy. Nothing I can’t walk off. No chest pain or trouble breathing, thankfully. I'm pretty sure it's just old age catching up.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major. Had a bad flu a few years back, but that’s it. No surgeries, no… heart stuff, nothing like that. I don't really go to the doctor much, to be honest. Hopefully, this physical won’t change that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat whatever, take whatever, pretty normal.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin sometimes. Nothing regular. I try to eat healthy, so I don’t need much. Seriously, is this gonna take long? I really need to get going soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, then. We’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your joints. Then we'll talk about whether you're cleared for the tryout. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… fast enough. Let’s get it done. Blood pressure first, right? Just tell me when to breathe in and out.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Okay, just relax your arm, please. We'll start with your blood pressure. Take a deep breath... and let it out. Okay, one more time. Deep breath... and relax. 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take nice, deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Okay, deep breaths. <takes several deep breaths, a little louder than necessary> Is that good? Anything wrong? I can feel my heart pounding a little, probably just from being nervous, you know? It’s been a while since I had someone listen to it.
DOCTOR: Lungs sound clear. Heart sounds… a little irregular, but not drastically so. I’m hearing a slight murmur. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: A murmur? What does that mean? Is that bad? I just want to know if I can play basketball, not… whatever that means. Look, I’m not a doctor, you gotta tell me straight, Doc. Is this gonna stop me from trying out?
DOCTOR: A murmur isn't necessarily bad, Mr. Kingan, but it does mean we need to investigate it a little further. It's just a sound your heart makes, and it can have many different causes. Sometimes it's nothing to worry about, sometimes it indicates a valve problem. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Now, I’m not going to definitively clear you for the tryout today. I want to be cautious. I'd recommend an EKG and an echocardiogram to get a better look at your heart. It’s a quick, non-invasive test. Would you be willing to get those done?
PATIENT: Ugh. Tests? Seriously? Look, I came here for a quick check-up, not a whole medical workup. Is this necessary? I mean, I feel fine! And I don't have insurance, Doc. That's gonna cost a fortune, right? I guess… what do the tests show? If they say I’m good, can I play?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Kingan. I wouldn't recommend these tests if I didn't think they were important. The EKG will look at the electrical activity of your heart, and the echocardiogram uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart's structure. These tests will help me determine if the murmur is something serious or not. Without them, I can't responsibly clear you for a physically demanding activity like basketball. It’s a matter of safety. As for the cost, I can look into some options for low-cost or free cardiac testing in the area. There might be some programs available for uninsured patients. I can also provide you with a referral to a cardiologist who might be able to work with you on the cost. For now, I strongly advise against participating in the tryout until we have these results. It’s better to be safe than sorry. What do you say?
PATIENT: Ugh… fine. Fine! Tests, whatever. But you gotta promise me you'll look into those costs, okay? And get me those referrals fast. I don’t wanna spend a month figuring this stuff out. And can you at least write a note saying I'm waiting for results? Maybe the team will let me practice lightly while I get this done. Please? This whole thing is a pain. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. I'm writing a note right now stating you are undergoing cardiac evaluation and are awaiting results. I will also put in a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a cardiologist at City General – she’s very good and often works with uninsured patients. I will also look into local programs for financial assistance and get that information to you before you leave. Here’s the note. And here’s the referral information. I understand your frustration. We're doing this to ensure your safety, and I'll do everything I can to get this process moving as quickly as possible. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
