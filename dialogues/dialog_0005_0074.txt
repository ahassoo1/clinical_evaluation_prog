DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… the pressure. My blood pressure’s been high, the nurse told me. Been feelin’ a bit worn out too, but mostly just the pressure. I want to get it fixed quick if we can, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Alright. “A bit worn out” is… vague. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well… it’s just… harder to get things done. Used to be able to bake all day, no problem. Now I gotta sit down every little bit. And I forget things easier, I reckon. Not bad forgettin’, but… more than usual. Mostly just tired, though. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, fatigue and some memory issues… and the nurse flagged elevated blood pressure. Have you been checking your blood pressure at home at all?
PATIENT: No, sir. No, I haven't. Never have. Nurse just took it when I got here. I mostly just…feel it in my head, sometimes. Like a thumpin’. That’s why I came.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been happening suddenly, or has it been a gradual thing?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. Hard to say exactly when it started, but it weren't overnight, no. Maybe… a couple months now? It’s been gettin’ worse little by little, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions before – diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, sir. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old. My husband, God rest his soul, had some trouble with his heart later in life, but I never had nothin’ serious. Just…tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never needed any. Always been lucky that way, 'til now, I reckon. Just want this pressure fixed, if you can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Steines. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my arthritis in my hands. It’s… ibuprofen, I think. The regular kind you get at the store. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take one of those nighttime sleep aids. Not every night, just when I’m really restless.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergy to nothin’, thank the Lord. I eat everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk about family history. Did either of your parents have high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or diabetes?
PATIENT: My mama… she had a bit of trouble with her pressure when she got old, I think. And my daddy, he had a stroke… a long time ago. That’s about all I remember. We weren’t close, not really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social? What do you mean by that, Doctor? I bake. And… I used to garden, but my back ain’t what it used to be. I mostly stay home now.
DOCTOR: I mean… do you smoke?
PATIENT: Land sakes, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked a bit, but I always told him to do it outside.
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little wine with dinner sometimes. Not every night, and not much. A glass, maybe. It helps me relax.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure again, just to get a baseline. Then we'll talk about next steps. If you could just sit up here for me?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just gettin' old, I reckon. Hurry it up if you can, though. I got a pie crust waitin' on me.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are… regular, but a little bit fast. Lungs are clear. Now let’s check your pulse. Pulse is elevated. And I'll just measure your blood pressure again. 160 over 95. Still elevated. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Overall, it seems like your blood pressure is the main concern right now.
PATIENT: Well, that don't sound good, does it? What does it mean? Is it bad? Can you fix it? I got folks comin' over next week, and I need to be able to bake.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Steines, 160 over 95 is elevated. It means your heart is working harder than it should to pump blood through your body. Left untreated, it can lead to serious problems – stroke, heart attack, kidney failure. Now, I can try to manage it. We'll need to start with lifestyle changes – diet, exercise, reducing stress. And likely, medication. But you need to be compliant. No skipping pills, and you have to follow my instructions. It’s not a quick fix, and it requires effort on your part. I'm going to order some blood work to check your kidney function and rule out any other underlying causes. We’ll also need an EKG to check your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Lord have mercy. Pills… I don't like pills. And exercise? My back… you said kidney problems too? This sounds like a whole heap of trouble. Can’t I just… cut back on salt? I make good bread, you know. Maybe less salt in the bread?
DOCTOR: Cutting back on salt is a start, Ms. Steines. But it’s rarely enough on its own, especially with blood pressure this high. And yes, I mentioned kidney problems because high blood pressure can cause kidney problems, and we need to make sure your kidneys are functioning properly before starting any medication. Look, I understand you don’t like pills, but this isn’t about what you like. It’s about your health. We need to address this, and that will likely involve medication. I'm going to write you a prescription for a low-dose diuretic to help your body get rid of excess fluid. We’ll start with that, monitor your blood pressure, and adjust the dosage as needed. The lab work and EKG will give us a clearer picture of what we’re dealing with. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Di-u-ret-ic… diuretic. Makes you pee more? That don't sound pleasant at all. And you said adjust the dosage? That sounds…complicated. I just want to bake my pies, Doctor. Can't I just try the salt thing for a while? And maybe lay off the wine? Please?
DOCTOR: Ms. Steines, you are avoiding the real issue. Yes, the diuretic will make you urinate more. That’s how it lowers your blood pressure. And yes, “adjusting the dosage” means I may need to increase or decrease the amount of medication you’re taking to find the right balance. Look, I am not going to let you dismiss this. Your blood pressure is dangerously high. Ignoring it will lead to serious consequences, and frankly, it's irresponsible. We'll try the salt reduction and reduced wine intake in addition to the medication, not instead of it. I’m writing you a prescription for Hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 milligrams, once daily. Take it in the morning. Get the lab work and EKG scheduled immediately. And call my office if you experience any dizziness, weakness, or changes in your urine output. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Hydro-chlor-o… …This is a whole lot to remember, Doctor. And I don't drive anymore, so I gotta get my daughter to take me to the lab and everything. She's busy, though. And what if I do feel dizzy? What then? And… what about my pies? Can I still bake them?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can still bake your pies, Ms. Steines. But you need to be mindful of your salt intake. And if you feel dizzy, stop what you're doing and call my office immediately. As for getting to the lab, that's your responsibility. I can’t arrange transportation for you. And frankly, the lab work is crucial. We need to know what we’re dealing with before we can proceed. Look, I’ve explained everything as clearly as I can. I’m ordering the blood work and EKG. You need to take the medication, reduce your salt intake, and call my office if you experience any side effects. I’m sending the lab orders electronically to St. Luke's Hospital. Do you understand?
PATIENT: St. Luke's... Alright. I reckon I understand. It’s just… a whole lot. I’ll try. I’ll really try. But I’m an old woman, Doctor, and old women don’t take to change very well. And… my pies are important to me. Please don't let me have to stop makin' pies.
DOCTOR: Ms. Steines, I never said you had to stop making pies. I said you need to be mindful of your salt intake. Look, I understand that your pies are important to you. And I want you to be able to continue enjoying them. But you also need to take care of your health. And right now, your health is at risk. I’m going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to check your blood pressure and review the lab results. In the meantime, please follow my instructions. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, sir. I reckon that’s all. Just… two weeks, huh? Seems a long time to be waitin’ to see if I’m gonna be alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time. I'll try my best.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just remember what I said. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Steines.
PATIENT: .
