DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Nice to meet you too. I want to... how you say... find out more 'bout where my family come from. I hear you can do tests for that now, with spit or somethin’? I’m Laury, by the way. Most people just call me Laury.
DOCTOR: It is nice to meet you too, Laury. Yes, that's right! We can do ancestry testing now, it’s become quite popular. It is usually done with a saliva sample – very straightforward. It can give you a good idea of your ethnic origins, which I understand is what you’re interested in. Before we go ahead with that, though, I’d like to ask a few questions, just to get a better understanding of your medical history and make sure the testing is appropriate. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Ask away. I don’t get sick much, mostly just old-man stuff, you know? But I don’t mind answerin’ questions. What kinda questions?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Laury. "Old-man stuff" is perfectly alright! We'll cover a few things. First, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any long-term conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of, Doc. I had a bad cough once when I was a boy, but that went away. And my back gets sore sometimes from makin’ the boats… but that’s just bein’ old. I ain’t been to the doctor much in my life, to be honest. We didn’t have much doctorin’ where I grew up. Mostly just good food and rest. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Laury. “Good food and rest” is excellent medicine! And it's good to know you haven't had any major medical issues diagnosed. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been in the hospital for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never been in the hospital, either. Not even when I was little. I fell outta a tree once, broke my arm, but my mama just wrapped it up real good with leaves and sticks. It healed okay! Maybe not as good as a doctor coulda done, but I still got all my fingers.
DOCTOR: That's remarkable, Laury! It sounds like you had a very resourceful mother. Alright, good to know about the lack of surgeries and hospital stays. Now, let's talk about your family. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No, my mama and papa, they both gone now. Been gone a long time. Mama, she went when I was still a young man. Papa, he lasted a bit longer, but he’s gone now too. I’m the only one left from my close family. It’s kinda lonely sometimes, but I got my work. I make boats. Little wooden boats.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your loss, Laury. It sounds like they were good people, and it’s understandable that you miss them. And making boats sounds like a wonderful way to keep busy and honour their memory. Now, do you know anything about your parents’ or grandparents’ medical history?
PATIENT: That's a hard one, Doc. We didn’t talk much 'bout that kinda stuff. My mama, she just always said to eat good and work hard. And my papa... he didn't say much of anything. We lived on a small island, remember? Not many doctors or talkin' 'bout sickness. I think my grandpa maybe had trouble with his legs when he got old, but I’m not sure. It was a long time ago and nobody wrote things down. Mostly just stories. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, Laury, that’s not bad at all. Stories are valuable too! It's not uncommon for families, especially those with a history like yours, to not have a lot of written medical information. Now, just to cover all bases, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, I don’t think so. Never had a problem with anything. I eat most anything. Fish, coconut, breadfruit… whatever I can get my hands on. I ain't picky. And I haven't taken much medicine in my life, so I wouldn't know if I was allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Laury. Alright, and are you currently taking any medications at all - even over-the-counter things like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothin' at all. I just let my aches and pains be. Sometimes they bother me, sometimes they don't. I figure I'm old, that's just how it is. I don't like takin' pills if I can help it. They never felt right, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Laury. Many people feel that way. Okay, so no current medications. Now, before we move on to the ancestry testing itself, let me just quickly take your height and weight, and check your blood pressure and pulse. It's just a routine check to make sure everything looks okay before we proceed. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That's okay. Do what you need to do, Doc. I’m happy to help. I haven’t had my height checked in a long time. Probably shrunk a bit, gettin’ old and all.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could stand here for me, please. Okay, your height is 155 centimeters, and your weight is 56 kilograms. Blood pressure is 130 over 80 – that’s a little elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. Pulse is 72, which is good and steady. Everything looks pretty good overall, Laury. Just something to keep an eye on. Now, about this ancestry test… do you have any specific regions or groups you’re hoping to find connections to?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. 155, you say? I used to be taller, I think. Maybe. And the numbers… I don’t know much 'bout numbers, Doc. As for where my family come from… mostly just the Marshall Islands, where I was born. But my mama, she always said we had some people come from… Samoa, maybe? And before that, even further away… she told stories 'bout islands with big volcanoes. That's all I know, really. I’m hopin’ you can find somethin’ more. I just wanna know where I really come from, you know? Understand a little bit more 'bout my people.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Laury. That’s a wonderful reason to do this test. Samoa and islands with volcanoes… that gives us a good starting point. The test will analyze your DNA and compare it to a large database of genetic markers from around the world. It can give us a percentage breakdown of your likely ethnic origins, and even identify connections to specific populations. It usually takes about two weeks to get the results back. Would you like me to explain the process of taking the sample?
PATIENT: Two weeks… that sounds good. Not too long. Yes, please tell me 'bout the sample. Is it painful? I don’t like needles, Doc. Never been good with needles.
DOCTOR: No needles at all, Laury! That’s the good part. It’s a simple saliva sample – you just spit into a small tube. There’s a little bit of liquid in the tube to help with the collection, but it’s nothing to worry about. We’ll give you very clear instructions, and there’s someone here who can help you if you need it. It’s really quite easy. Once we have the sample, we send it off to the lab, and they do all the analysis. Then we’ll schedule another appointment to go over the results with you in detail. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Spittin’… that I can do. Much better than needles. Yes, that sounds good, Doc. Schedule another appointment, yes. I’m lookin’ forward to hearin’ what you find. Maybe I'll learn somethin’ 'bout my ancestors. That would be nice. So... do I do the spittin' now?
DOCTOR: Yes, let's do the spitting now, Laury. Here’s the kit. There are detailed instructions inside, but I’ll walk you through it. The main thing is to avoid eating or drinking anything for about 30 minutes beforehand – even chewing gum. And just try to fill the tube to the line indicated. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No eat… okay, I haven't had nothin' for a while, so that’s alright. No questions, I think. Just spittin’, right? Not too hard, I hope?
DOCTOR: Exactly, just spitting. And it's not hard at all. It might take a few minutes to get enough saliva, but just relax, and it will happen. And if you have any trouble at all, please don’t hesitate to call me over. Take your time, Laury. I’ll be right here if you need anything.
PATIENT: Okay... thank you, Doc. This is… kinda funny, you know? Spittin' to find out 'bout my ancestors. But I think I'm gettin' enough… It’s a bit watery, but I think it’s okay.
DOCTOR: Wonderful! That's perfectly fine, Laury. A little watery is no problem at all. You're doing great. Once you get to the fill line, just screw the cap on tight, and we’ll get it sent off to the lab. .
