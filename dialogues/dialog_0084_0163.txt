DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I'm Dr. Voytek. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you. Well, it’s rather… complicated, I suppose. I’ve been attempting a new diet, shall we say, and I thought it prudent to have a professional opinion before I continue. It’s one of these… extreme things one reads about, and while I feel quite alright at the moment, I’m not entirely convinced it’s… sensible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A new diet and you want to make sure it's safe before continuing. That's very wise of you. Can you tell me more about this diet?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s called the… well, the “Lunar Cycle Diet.” Rather peculiar, isn’t it? The premise is one eats only what was historically consumed during a specific phase of the moon. Apparently, our ancestors were far healthier, and their diets were perfectly aligned with… cosmic energies. I’ve been following the waning crescent phase for the last two weeks, which, as far as I can gather, involved a lot of root vegetables and… boiled fish. And no salt, naturally. It’s all very specific.
DOCTOR: That is quite specific. And…unconventional. Okay, so root vegetables and boiled fish, no salt, for the last two weeks. Have you noticed any changes in how you’re feeling since you started?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a fair question. Initially, there was a certain… lightness, I suppose. A feeling of… purification. But now, I find myself rather fatigued in the afternoons. And my hands… they’ve been a bit shaky, particularly when attempting detailed work – rather inconvenient, as you can imagine, given my profession. The boiled fish… well, it lacks a certain joie de vivre, wouldn’t you agree? It's also proving rather difficult to ascertain precisely what our ancestors ate during a specific lunar phase in, say, 14th-century Wessex. There’s a great deal of conjecture involved.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and shakiness… that’s good information. And you're right to question the historical accuracy – that is difficult to verify! Let’s talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any existing health conditions – anything you’ve been diagnosed with or are currently being treated for?
PATIENT: No, not as such. I’ve always been remarkably… robust, if I may say so. A touch of arthritis in my right hand, which is to be expected given the nature of my work – years of manipulating miniature models and painstakingly animating stop-motion sequences. But nothing requiring regular medication or treatment. I had a bout of influenza some years ago, but recovered fully. And my eyesight, though fading slightly, is still sufficient for my purposes – aided, of course, by these. I do have rather low blood pressure, as I recall from a check-up some decade ago, but it’s never been cause for concern.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No major medical history, some arthritis, low blood pressure noted in the past. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been rather… averse to the idea, if I’m honest. A bit of a needle phobia, perhaps. And fortunately, I’ve managed to avoid any serious injuries throughout my life. A few minor scrapes and bruises, naturally – the occasional mishap whilst working on a set – but nothing requiring surgical intervention. My mother always said I had a knack for avoiding trouble, though I suspect that was simply good fortune.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I pride myself on avoiding pharmaceuticals whenever possible. A bit of chamomile tea for relaxation, perhaps, and a daily multivitamin, but that's the extent of it. I believe in a natural approach to health, you see. Good food, regular exercise – within reason, of course, given my age – and a healthy dose of fresh air. I find that a brisk walk in the countryside does wonders for one’s well-being.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. And you mentioned low blood pressure in the past. Do you know what your typical blood pressure reading was?
PATIENT: Ah, that's a good question. I recall the doctor mentioning it was… on the lower end of the scale, but I’m afraid I don’t have the precise figures. It was some years ago now, and my memory, while generally excellent, isn’t infallible. I believe he said something about 120 over 80, perhaps? But I must confess, I never paid much attention to the specifics. I simply trusted his judgment. And he assured me it wasn’t cause for concern, provided I remained reasonably active and avoided excessive exertion.
DOCTOR: Okay, roughly 120/80. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your heart, lungs, and reflexes. Also, I'll check your hands, given the shakiness you mentioned. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Quite alright. I’m accustomed to being… prodded and poked, in a manner of speaking. Years of model-making require a delicate touch, and one becomes rather aware of one’s own physicality. Proceed as you wish. I trust your expertise implicitly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Vantine. Your heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is not uncommon at your age. And I do notice some slight tremor in your hands, particularly when you extend them. Your skin feels a bit dry as well. Blood pressure is 110/70 today. Pulse is 68. Temperature is normal. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it, my appetite has been… somewhat diminished since commencing this diet. The root vegetables, while perfectly palatable, lack a certain… richness, shall we say? And my bowel habits have become rather… irregular. Constipation, primarily. I've been consuming a great deal of water, as advised in one of the Lunar Cycle Diet pamphlets, but it hasn’t been entirely effective. It's a rather… unglamorous topic, I realize, but I believe it's relevant. The lack of… variety, perhaps? It's all rather bland, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, diminished appetite and constipation. That’s helpful information. Given your age, low blood pressure, and the symptoms you’re experiencing – fatigue, shakiness, constipation, diminished appetite – I’m concerned this diet is not providing you with sufficient nutrients and may be contributing to your symptoms. The lack of salt could also be a factor, as it can affect blood pressure and nerve function. Do you have any allergies to any foods or medications?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I’ve always been remarkably fortunate in that regard. I can consume almost anything without ill effect. A touch of indigestion if I overindulge in rich foods, perhaps, but nothing serious. No known allergies to medications either. I recall my mother always saying I had a cast-iron stomach. Perhaps that’s why I felt so confident in attempting this… unconventional diet in the first place.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. Given everything we’ve discussed, I strongly recommend stopping this Lunar Cycle Diet. It sounds like it’s doing more harm than good. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your electrolyte levels, kidney function, and vitamin levels. That will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. I confess, I was beginning to suspect as much. This… cosmic alignment, while intriguing, seems to be rather detrimental to my well-being. Blood tests it is, then. I trust your judgment implicitly. And I shall refrain from consuming any further root vegetables until we have the results. Perhaps a nice piece of salmon, instead?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Salmon sounds like a much better option. I'm going to write an order for a Complete Blood Count, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, and a Vitamin D level. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take care of you. Once we have the results, we can discuss a more balanced dietary approach. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and eat foods that you enjoy and that are easy to digest. Is there anyone who helps you with meals or transportation?
PATIENT: Yes, fortunately. My former wife, Eleanor, is remarkably… efficient. She still assists me with various errands, including grocery shopping and transportation. We maintain a cordial relationship, despite the… dissolution of our marriage. She’s quite concerned about my well-being, and I’m certain she’ll be delighted to hear I’m abandoning this… dietary experiment. She’ll be most insistent on ensuring I consume a proper Sunday roast, I suspect.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Having support is very helpful. Okay, I’ll have the lab draw the blood tests. I'll also send a note to Eleanor's contact information, letting her know the results when they come back. It will take a few days for the results to return. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – increased fatigue, dizziness, or severe constipation – please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything admirably. You’ve put my mind at ease considerably. I’m most grateful for your expertise and… level-headed approach. I shall refrain from further lunar-inspired diets, and focus on enjoying a proper Sunday roast, as Eleanor insists. Thank you again for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Here’s the lab order. Have a good day, Mr. Vantine, and enjoy that roast!
PATIENT: A pleasure to meet you, Doctor. And I assure you, I shall. .
