DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um… well, to be honest, I mostly just remember someone said I needed to come in for… a check-up? Something about making sure I'm alright. It’s a bit fuzzy, you see. It has to do with… well, I think it was about what I've been taking, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Medicare sent something, I believe.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. Medicare often recommends routine check-ups, especially as we get older, and it’s common to forget the specifics. It sounds like this might be a medication review and general wellness visit. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… Let me think. I take something for my… joints, I think? They ache sometimes. And… oh! A little white pill for my blood pressure, I believe the pharmacist said. But honestly, Doctor, I get them all mixed up. My daughter usually handles refilling them, so I don't pay too much attention. I really don't know the names, I’m afraid. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: That’s not bad at all, Ms. Hughston. It's very common for patients to have difficulty keeping track of their medications, especially if they take multiple ones. Don't worry, we can figure it out. Do you happen to have a list of your medications with you, perhaps in a bag or a pill bottle?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… Oh! Here we go. A whole bunch of them. My daughter does keep me supplied, doesn’t she? I just… don’t know what each one is for, exactly. They all look the same to me! Maybe you can tell me?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let's take a look together. Okay, this one is Lisinopril 20mg, taken once daily. That’s for your blood pressure, as you mentioned. And this is Naproxen 500mg, taken twice daily as needed for pain… that would be for your joints. Do those names sound familiar at all?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… Naproxen… They… sort of ring a bell. It’s like… I’ve heard those words before, probably when the pharmacist was talking really fast. But I don’t really remember being told what they were for. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I just take them when I feel… not good. Is that a bad way to do things?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily a bad way, Ms. Hughston, but it’s not ideal. Taking medications without a clear understanding of their purpose and proper dosage can sometimes lead to unintended consequences. It’s good that we’re discussing this. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… That's a long one, I think. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago… maybe twenty years? And I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. Other than that… I’ve mostly just had the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I used to be very active, but it’s harder now. I don’t really remember many details, to be honest. It’s all a bit… blurry. Is there something specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. We don’t need to go into exhaustive detail. Just knowing about the gallbladder removal and the broken wrist is helpful. Did you have any complications from either of those procedures?
PATIENT: Complications… hmm. The gallbladder, I don’t think so. It was a bit painful afterwards, but the doctor said that was normal. The wrist… Oh, it took a long time to heal. I had a lot of pain, and I needed physical therapy for months. It still aches sometimes, especially when it's cold. I don’t think there were any major complications, but it was a nuisance, that’s for sure. I just remember being very glad when it finally stopped hurting so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s… a tricky one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had something with his heart, but I don’t remember exactly what. They both lived to be quite old, though, so it couldn’t have been too serious. I have a sister, but we haven’t spoken in years, so I don’t know anything about her health. I’m not very good at remembering those sorts of things, I’m afraid. Does it matter much?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know, Ms. Hughston. Knowing about a family history of high blood pressure is relevant given your own diagnosis. We’ll take that into consideration. It’s alright that you don’t have all the details. Now, are you currently experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Well, I get tired easily, that’s for sure. And my joints ache, like I said. I’ve been a bit… forgetful lately, too. More so than usual, perhaps. But that’s probably just old age creeping up on me. Oh! And sometimes I feel a little dizzy, especially when I stand up quickly. But it doesn’t last long. Nothing too serious, I don’t think. Just the usual aches and pains.
DOCTOR: The dizziness… when you stand up quickly, does it happen every time, or is it intermittent?
PATIENT: Intermittent… hmm. It doesn't happen every time, no. It's more likely to happen if I've been sitting for a long time. Or if I get up too fast. It only lasts a few seconds, then it goes away. It’s not really bothersome, but I thought I should mention it. Sometimes I worry it’s something serious, but I don’t want to bother the doctor with silly things.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you mentioned it, Ms. Hughston. It’s never “silly” to report symptoms, even if they seem minor. Dizziness upon standing can sometimes indicate low blood pressure, which is something we should investigate, especially given your diagnosis of hypertension and the medications you’re taking. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… alright, that’s fine. I suppose that’s a good idea. I haven’t had a proper check-up in ages. Just… please be gentle, Doctor. My joints aren’t what they used to be. And I get a little nervous around doctors, if I’m honest. But I trust you, of course.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hughston. I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll take things slowly and at your pace. I understand your nervousness, and I’ll do my best to make you comfortable. First, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 142/88 mmHg, and your pulse is 76 beats per minute, regular. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I check her feet for swelling. </stage> There is slight swelling in your ankles, bilaterally. Do you notice that swelling yourself?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. You know, I have noticed my shoes feeling a little tighter lately. I just thought it was because my feet were… bigger. Or maybe it’s the heat. It’s been awfully warm, hasn’t it? I don’t usually pay much attention to my feet, to be honest. So, yes, I suppose I have noticed some swelling, but I didn’t think much of it. It doesn't really hurt, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. The ankle swelling, along with the dizziness and occasional forgetfulness, warrants further investigation. Given your history of hypertension and the medications you are taking, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and thyroid levels. We should also do an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and an EKG? That sounds… complicated. Is something seriously wrong, Doctor? I just wanted a simple check-up, not a whole bunch of tests. But… if you think it’s necessary, I suppose I trust your judgment. I just… I get nervous about these things. Will it hurt? And how long will it take?
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Ms. Hughston. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical tests. I assure you, we’re not jumping to any conclusions. These tests are simply a precaution to get a more complete picture of your overall health and rule out any potential underlying causes for your symptoms. The blood tests involve a simple prick of the finger or a small draw from your arm. It’s usually quick and causes minimal discomfort. The EKG is a painless procedure where we attach small stickers to your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It takes only a few minutes. We’ll get the results back within a few days, and then we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I want to review your medications and ensure they are appropriate for your current condition. Can you bring in a list of all your medications, including the dosages, or bring the bottles themselves when you come back for the test results?
PATIENT: Alright… that sounds… manageable. Blood tests and an EKG, I can do that. As long as it doesn't hurt too much. And yes, I can definitely bring in the bottles when I come back. My daughter keeps them all organized, so that shouldn't be a problem. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I still feel a little nervous, but I trust you to take good care of me. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hughston. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. For now, there’s nothing else you need to do. I’ll have my nurse schedule your blood tests and EKG before you leave. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please don't hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Here’s a copy of the instructions for the blood tests. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very kind and patient with me, Doctor. Thank you again. I suppose I’ll see you in a few days.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hughston. It was a pleasure meeting you. We’ll take good care of you. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
