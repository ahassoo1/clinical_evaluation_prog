DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s… lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Yes. The paper said... education visit? I don't really... remember why I'm here. My husband, he made the appointment. Something about... learning stuff? I work with metal, so... I don't have time for much else.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, sometimes these appointments are initiated by family members. That’s perfectly alright. It's common. Perhaps your husband was concerned about something he noticed?
PATIENT: Concerned? He worries too much. Always telling me to be careful with the machines. Says I don't listen. I do listen! It's just... loud in the factory, you know? Hard to hear everything. And the metal... it gets everywhere. Makes a mess. Is that what he meant?
DOCTOR: It’s good that he cares for you, Ms. Fontanazza. The noise and metal... yes, those could certainly be factors. We want to ensure your health is protected. Perhaps we can discuss any potential risks associated with your work, and how to mitigate them?
PATIENT: Mitigate? What does that mean? I just... cut and bend metal. It's not complicated. He always uses big words. Makes me feel... small. Is this about my ears? They ring sometimes, after a long day. But everyone's ears ring, right? Especially people who work with loud things.
DOCTOR: "Mitigate" simply means to lessen or reduce the impact of something, Ms. Fontanazza. And you are right – ringing in the ears, or tinnitus, is common with loud noise exposure. However, it's important to assess it to ensure there's no underlying damage. Perhaps we can start with a brief review of your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? I... I don't get sick often. A little tired sometimes, but that's just from working. And my back aches. Lifting heavy things, you know? It’s normal. I don’t have time to go to the doctor for aches and pains. Waste of time, if you ask me. Is this going to take long? I have to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Ms. Fontanazza. We’ll be as efficient as possible. Just a few questions, if you don’t mind, to get a better understanding of your situation. The fatigue and back pain are important to note. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the fatigue?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I just... feel sleepy. Especially after work. And sometimes... dizzy. But that could be from not eating enough. My husband packs me lunches, but I don't always finish them. He makes healthy things... too much salad, not enough meat. Is that a symptom? Honestly, I don't know what a symptom is.
DOCTOR: A symptom is simply something you feel that isn't normal for you, Ms. Fontanazza. The dizziness is important, and you’re right to mention it. Not eating enough can definitely contribute to feeling unwell. Do you experience the dizziness when you stand up quickly?
PATIENT: Stand up quickly...? I... I don’t think so. I mean, I stand up all day at work. Never really paid attention. It's just... everything feels a little wobbly sometimes. Like the floor is moving. Maybe it's just my glasses. They're old, you know. I should get new ones. But no time. Always working. Is this about my eyes? Or my ears? I get confused.
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned the glasses. We can certainly address that. And the feeling of wobbliness is important to note. Let's try to rule out a few possibilities. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed…? Like… sick? No, not really. I had the flu once, a long time ago. But everyone gets the flu, right? My husband always tells me to take vitamins. Says I need to be stronger. He worries too much. I don't think I've been... officially told I have anything. Just aches and pains. And tiredness. Is that a condition? Stop.
