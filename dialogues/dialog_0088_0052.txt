DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good mornin’ to ye, Doctor. Well, it’s this queasy feelin’ I’ve been havin’ most mornin’s now. It’s not a proper sickness, more like… a turnin’ in my stomach, ye ken? And I’ve got a bit o’ heart trouble, so I thought I best get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, a queasy feeling most mornings, and you also have some heart trouble. I understand. Let’s start with this stomach issue. Could you describe the feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Aye, right enough. It’s… not like food poisonin’ or anything. It just comes on when I wake up, usually before I even get out o’ bed. It’s a wee bit like seasickness, that rollin’ feelin’, but not as bad. It doesn’t last long, maybe half an hour, but it’s enough to put me off my breakfast. And sometimes, if I stand up too quick, I feel a bit faint wi’ it. It’s been happenin’ for… oh, a month or so, I’d say. Maybe a bit longer. I keep thinkin’ it’ll go away on its own, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it comes on in the morning, before you get out of bed, feels like a rolling sensation, lasts about half an hour, and sometimes makes you feel faint when you stand up quickly. It's been going on for about a month. And you said you have some heart trouble – could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s it exactly. As for the heart… well, it’s nothin’ dramatic. The doctor told me it’s a bit weak, somethin’ about it not pumpin’ as strong as it should. I take a couple o’ pills for it every day, keeps it under control most o’ the time. Been like this for… oh, five, maybe six years now? I can’t rightly remember the name o’ the condition, and I’ve never been great at rememberin’ pill names. It's never bothered me too much, but I thought maybe the queasiness was connected, ye ken? Better safe than sorry, I always say.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a weak heart for about five or six years, managed with medication, and you're concerned the nausea might be related. Do you remember what the doctor told you the heart condition was called, even a rough idea?
PATIENT: Hmm... now ye're askin’ somethin’. It was somethin’ about the heart muscle… not fillin’ right. Oh, blast it, it’s on the tip o’ me tongue! It weren’t congestive heart failure, I know that much. Doctor McTavish, he was the one who told me, but that was a good few years ago now. He said somethin’ about it gettin’ stiffer, not stretchy enough. Does that sound right? It might be a completely different thing, I’m terrible with this sort o’ stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, something about the heart muscle getting stiffer, not stretching enough. That helps. It could be related to diastolic heart failure, but we shouldn't jump to conclusions. Let’s talk about your medications for a moment. Could you tell me the names of the pills you take for your heart?
PATIENT: Right, let me see… There's a white one, that’s… Lisinopril, I think? And a yellow one, that’s… Metoprolol. Aye, those are the two. I take one o’ each every mornin’. And sometimes, if my legs are swollen, the doctor tells me to take a wee blue one, a water pill, but I haven’t needed that one in a while. I just hope I'm rememberin’ all this right. It's a habit now, but I don't always pay attention to the names.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and Metoprolol daily, and a water pill as needed for swelling. That's good to know. Do you experience any other symptoms with this morning queasiness?
PATIENT: Well... not really. No dizziness, no pain, no nothin’ like that. Just that wee bit o’ faintness when I stand up, and the feelin’ o’ turnin’ in my stomach. Sometimes, I feel a bit tired after it passes, but that could just be me gettin’ old, ye ken? And maybe I'm just a bit more aware o’ how I feel these days, now that I've got the heart trouble. It makes ye think about things. But overall, no, nothin’ else really. Just that queasiness and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Alright. No dizziness, no pain, just queasiness, occasional faintness upon standing, and some tiredness afterwards. Now, let's move on to some general questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’. I used to get stung by bees when I was a lad, but that was a long time ago, and it didn't bother me too much. Just a bit o’ swellin’, that’s all. No allergies to food either. I eat just about anythin’ put in front o’ me. I enjoy a good haggis now and then, if that counts for anythin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I'm retired now, used to be a librarian, spend a fair bit o’ time readin’ and such. I don't do much strenuous exercise, to be honest. A bit o’ walkin’ now and then, mostly around the village. I used to enjoy a wee dram o’ whisky in the evenin’s, but I’ve cut back on that lately, thought it best. I live alone, so I do most o’ me own cookin’. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables, but I have a bit o’ a sweet tooth, I’ll admit. Chocolate biscuits are me downfall.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired librarian, mostly sedentary lifestyle with some walking, used to enjoy a drink but cut back, lives alone, and enjoys chocolate biscuits. And finally, do you have any family history of heart problems, stomach issues, or anything else significant?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s a good question. Me father… he had a bad heart, passed away when he was in his sixties. It was a sudden thing, a heart attack, they said. Me mother, she had a bit o’ indigestion, always complainin’ o’ heartburn, but nothin’ serious. And me sister, she’s got high blood pressure, takes pills for it. Aside from that, nothin’ I can rightly recall. We weren't a family that talked much about ailments, ye ken? Just got on with things. But heart trouble, aye, that runs in the family a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay. History of heart trouble in your father and high blood pressure in your sister. Alright, Mr. Benic, thank you for that thorough information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and do a brief abdominal exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm not too fussed about all that. I've been poked and prodded enough times over the years. Just let me know if ye find anythin’ amiss.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm listening to your heart now. I hear a regular rhythm, but there is a slight murmur. It's not overly concerning at this point, but we'll keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let’s check your blood pressure… 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Pulse is 72 and regular. And now I'll just gently press on your abdomen… no tenderness or masses felt. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No pain at all, Doctor. Not a bit o’ it. Just a bit o’ pressure, that's all. Aye, 140 over 85… that’s a bit high, isn’t it? I used to be lower than that. But then again, I haven’t been feelin’ myself lately. But ye said there weren't anythin' to worry about, so I'm trustin' yer judgement. What do ye reckon it is, then? This mornin' queasiness? Is it somethin’ to do wi’ the heart?
DOCTOR: Okay. No pain with the abdominal exam. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, but we can address that. Now, regarding your nausea... given your history of heart trouble, the murmur I heard, and the occasional faintness, it could be related to your heart function. However, nausea can have many causes. It could also be something as simple as indigestion, or even a side effect of one of your medications. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. Specifically, I want a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an EKG to check your heart rhythm more closely. We should also check your thyroid function, as thyroid problems can also cause nausea. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s a fair bit o’ tests. A complete blood count, a basic what-now, and an EKG… And the thyroid, ye say? I’ve never had any trouble wi’ me thyroid, so far as I know. But if it helps ye figure things out, I’m happy enough to do them. Will these tests tell ye if it's definitely the heart, then? And how long will it take to get the results? I'm not lookin’ for anythin’ drastic, just want to know what's causin’ this queasiness and get it sorted. I don't want it holdin' me back from enjoyin' me retirement.
DOCTOR: Okay. A complete blood count checks for things like anemia, a basic metabolic panel checks your kidney function and electrolytes, and the EKG looks at the electrical activity of your heart. The thyroid test will rule out any thyroid issues. These tests will help us determine if your heart is contributing to your nausea, but they won't necessarily give us a definitive answer. Sometimes, further investigations are needed. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. I'll have my nurse call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated, eating small, frequent meals, and avoiding anything that seems to trigger your nausea. If the nausea gets significantly worse, or if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Aye, that makes sense. Small meals, stay hydrated, and avoid triggers. I can manage that. And if it gets worse, head to the emergency room. Got it. No, I don't think I have any other questions at the moment, Doctor. Ye've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate ye takin' the time to listen to me. I'll wait for the nurse to call with the results, and hopefully, we can get to the bottom o’ this soon. Thank ye again. I best be gettin’ home now, then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. You're very welcome. I'll make a note of everything we discussed. My nurse, Sarah, will be in touch with you soon. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
