DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… good to meet you too, I think. My wife, she said I needed to come about… paperwork. Something about time off? I’m a little fuzzy on the details, to be honest. It’s for my job, with the… religious stuff, you know? Directors and all. She handles most of that.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you have some requests for medical leave documentation for your position with the religious organization. We can certainly address that. It sounds like your wife is very helpful in managing these things. To be sure I can complete the necessary paperwork accurately, could you tell me a little more about why you are requesting leave?
PATIENT: Oh, right, the leave. See, that’s… it’s been a bit rough lately. Not anything specific, really. Just… tired. A lot. And achy. Like an old boat after a storm, you know? I’ve been having trouble focusing, too. Makes the directing… difficult. My wife said I should get it checked out, and get the paperwork so I don’t lose my place. I don’t really feel sick, sick, but… not right. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Limtiaco, that makes perfect sense. "Not right" is a very common way to describe feeling unwell, and it's good you are addressing this now. It's wise to investigate when you're experiencing persistent fatigue and aches, even if you don’t feel acutely ill. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, let’s go through a bit of a detailed history. First, could you tell me when these symptoms – the tiredness and aches – began?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did they start? That’s a tough one. It feels like… gradually, over the last few months, maybe? Hard to pinpoint, really. It wasn’t a sudden thing. Just slowly getting… worse. I’d say… probably around March? Maybe April? But honestly, Doctor, time slips my mind these days. I keep meaning to write things down, but… well, you know how it is. It just… fades.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. It's very common for symptoms to develop gradually, and it’s completely normal to have trouble recalling precise dates. Around March or April is helpful. Now, can you describe the tiredness for me?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like I can barely keep my eyes open all day. It's more… a weight. Like everything takes a lot more effort. Even just getting out of bed, or walking across the room. And it doesn’t really get better with rest, not really. I can sleep a full night, but wake up feeling… drained. Like I haven't slept at all. It's… frustrating. Makes it hard to do my job, hard to enjoy things. I used to love working in the garden, but now… it feels like too much.
DOCTOR: That sounds quite debilitating, Mr. Limtiaco. Feeling drained even after a full night’s sleep is definitely concerning. And the loss of enjoyment in activities you previously loved is important to note. Now, let’s talk about the aches. Where are you experiencing these aches, and what is the pain like?
PATIENT: Oh, the aches… they’re… everywhere, really. Mostly in my back and shoulders, I think. And my knees… they creak something awful. It’s not sharp pain, not like a sudden injury. It’s more of a dull, constant ache. Like I’ve been doing hard labor for days, even when I haven’t. It’s worse in the mornings, and after I’ve been sitting for a while. Then, if I try to move around, it… loosens up a little. But it never really goes away completely. Like an old house settling, you know? Always groaning.
DOCTOR: “Like an old house settling” – that’s a very descriptive way to put it, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like you are experiencing widespread musculoskeletal discomfort, which is often associated with fatigue. Do you notice anything that makes these aches better or worse, besides sitting and movement?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The heat helps a little. A warm bath, or sitting in the sun. That eases it for a bit. But not for long. And… stress definitely makes it worse. When there’s a lot going on with the religious work, with meetings and planning… the aches get much more pronounced. And the tiredness, too. It’s like everything just… weighs heavier. My wife tries to keep things calm, but… well, you know. It’s not always possible. Does that make sense, Doctor? I’m rambling, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Limtiaco. You are providing very helpful information, and it’s good to hear how stress impacts your symptoms. It sounds like a warm bath and sunlight offer some temporary relief, and stress exacerbates the aches and fatigue. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… oh dear. That’s another thing that slips my mind easily. Let me see… I had pneumonia, years ago, when I was still living in Tahiti. Must have been… forty years ago? That was bad. But I recovered fully, I think. And… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. Other than that… not much. I’ve always been a pretty healthy person, to be honest. I’ve never been one for doctors, really. My wife, she’s the one who keeps track of all that. She'd know better than I would. Is there something specific you're looking for, Doctor? Maybe I can ask her when I get home.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Pneumonia and appendectomy are good to know. It's helpful you've been generally healthy in the past. And it's wonderful you have a supportive wife who helps with your medical care. We can certainly ask her for further details if needed. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Just a little something for my knees, sometimes. Ibuprofen, when they’re really acting up. But not every day, just when I need it. And… sometimes a little something for sleep, when I’m really having trouble. Melatonin, I think it’s called? Just a small dose, to help me drift off. My wife gets it for me. Other than that… no, nothing regular. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. I believe in natural remedies, you know? A good rest, a warm bath… that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ibuprofen as needed for knee pain, and melatonin occasionally for sleep. That’s helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, living in different places. No problems. My wife always checks when she gives me something new, though. She’s very careful. I think she worries about me. Bless her heart. No, no allergies that I’m aware of. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No known allergies is good to know. Now, before we proceed to a physical examination, could you tell me a little about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear, that’s another tricky one. My parents… they both lived to a good old age, I think. My mother had something with her heart, I vaguely remember, but I don't recall the details. My father was strong and healthy his whole life. I have several siblings, scattered all over the islands, but I haven't seen most of them in years. We don't really keep in touch, and I don't know much about their health. It’s… hard to say, honestly. I don't have much information to share, Doctor. Sorry. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It's very common for family medical history to be incomplete, especially if you haven't been in close contact with relatives. Knowing that your parents lived to a good age is helpful. Now, let's move on to a physical examination, if you don’t mind. I'd like to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then listen to your heart and lungs, and assess your joints and muscles. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just… be gentle with my knees, alright? They’re a bit creaky, as you know. And please, don't rush. I get a little… flustered when things happen too quickly. But otherwise… go ahead. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Limtiaco. We will take our time, and I will be as gentle as possible with your knees. Your blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds are normal, although a slightly increased rate. Lungs are clear to auscultation. There is some tenderness to palpation over both knees, with mild swelling. Range of motion is slightly limited, and there is crepitus with movement. There is tenderness to palpation over your shoulder muscles and along your spine. Range of motion is within normal limits, although there is some discomfort with certain movements. Muscle strength is 5/5 in all extremities, and reflexes are normal. Okay, Mr. Limtiaco, that concludes the physical examination. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, you're experiencing fatigue, widespread musculoskeletal discomfort, and limited range of motion in your knees and shoulders. Your vital signs show slightly elevated blood pressure, but overall, your exam is relatively normal. I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood tests… alright. Whatever you think is best. If it helps figure out what's going on, then I'm all for it. I’m just… tired of feeling like an old boat after a storm, you know? If we can get to the bottom of it… that would be wonderful. So yes, please, go ahead with the tests. And thank you, Doctor. For listening, and for taking your time. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. I understand your frustration, and we will do our best to get to the bottom of this. The lab will need a small blood sample. We can draw it here in the clinic. Once the results are back, which typically takes a few days, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding strenuous activity. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, can help manage any discomfort you are experiencing. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Just… rest, stay hydrated, ibuprofen… and wait for the results. That sounds manageable. Thank you again for your time and kindness. I really appreciate it. And if I do think of anything, can I call the office?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Limtiaco. You are very welcome. Please do not hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to help. We've completed the paperwork you needed for your religious work as well. Here's a copy for your records, and we've also sent it electronically to your employer. I wish you well, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
