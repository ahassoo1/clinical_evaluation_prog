DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Hughston. I am Dr. Yackey. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um… well, it’s about a test, I think? Someone said I needed to come in for one. It's… something about making sure I’m alright, I guess. Honestly, things are a bit fuzzy. Medicare sent something, and then a nice lady called… something about drugs? I don’t really… keep up with all that paperwork.
DOCTOR: Right. Yes. Well, Medicare does send a… considerable amount of information. And follow-up calls are quite common. Do you recall what the test was for, or perhaps what the nice lady on the phone said it screened for?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, not really. It wasn’t anything specific, I don't think. Just… a check-up. For… you know. To be safe. I remember something about… making sure I wasn’t taking anything I shouldn’t be. But I don’t… I haven’t really taken anything in ages. Except maybe a little chamomile tea to help me sleep. Is that what they mean? I get so confused with all these things.
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea is unlikely to be the concern, Ms. Hughston. It sounds like you may be referring to a toxicology screen, possibly related to a medication review. Do you have a list of all medications you currently take – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A… toxicology screen? That sounds… serious. Um… a list? No, I don’t think so. I just… take what the doctor tells me to. Mostly for my arthritis, you know? And sometimes a little something for my nerves. But I don't write it down. My memory isn't what it used to be. I think… there's a bottle of something in the kitchen, but I couldn't tell you what it is. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's… suboptimal, Ms. Hughston. We require a precise medication list for safety. Let's try to recall. For your arthritis, what is the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're asking! It's… a little white pill. No, maybe a little yellow one... I get them at the pharmacy, you know, the one down on Elm Street. The pharmacist is a nice young man, he always helps me. I… I really don't remember the name. It starts with a… maybe an "M"? Or a "P"? It's awful, I know. I just tell them what the doctor said, and they give it to me. They’ve never said anything was wrong.
DOCTOR: I'm accessing your electronic health record now. Perhaps we can find a record of your prescriptions there. Ah. Here we are. It appears you’ve been prescribed Meloxicam 15mg for osteoarthritis, and… Pregabalin 75mg twice daily for neuropathic pain. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes! Yes, that's it! Meloxicam… and… Pregabalin. See? I told you I had something for my nerves! It’s good you found that. I worry about forgetting things. So, those are the ones? Is that what they wanted to know about? I haven’t taken anything else, I promise. Just those two pills. And the chamomile tea, of course.
DOCTOR: Very well. The reason for this visit, Ms. Hughston, is a standard medication reconciliation to ensure there are no harmful interactions, and to confirm appropriate dosing. Given your history of neuropathic pain, and the medications you are currently taking, we will perform a brief neurological assessment. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Oh, a neurological… assessment? Is that something to worry about? I just want to be sure I’m alright. Okay, yes, I can follow your finger. Is that… okay? Am I doing it right? I get a bit dizzy sometimes, you know. But I'm trying my best.
DOCTOR: Your eye movements appear slightly diminished on the left side, and there’s a mild tremor present. This warrants further investigation. I’m also noting some slight weakness in your grip strength when I asked you to squeeze my hand earlier. We'll need to rule out any potential neurological complications. I'm ordering an MRI of the brain and a referral to a neurologist.
PATIENT: Oh dear. An MRI? And a… neurologist? Is something seriously wrong, Doctor? I just wanted a little test, and now… now you’re talking about brains and… and specialists! I feel a bit faint. Is it… is it something bad? I haven't been feeling that bad, just a bit forgetful, and my arthritis, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, I understand your anxiety. An MRI is a preventative measure to thoroughly evaluate your condition. These findings could be benign, but we must rule out any serious pathology. The neurologist will provide a more comprehensive assessment. It is… prudent to be thorough. I'm also ordering blood work to assess your overall health. The lab results, MRI, and neurologist's assessment will inform our next steps. Do you have any questions about the procedures?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. Blood work… and the brain thing… I guess if you think it's best. I just wish it wasn't so complicated. What… what will the brain thing feel like? Will it hurt? And how long will it take? I don't do well in small spaces, you know. And will the neurologist… will they do more tests? I'm getting a little scared, Doctor. I just want to go home and have a cup of chamomile tea.
DOCTOR: The MRI is non-invasive, Ms. Hughston. You will lie on a table inside a large machine that uses magnetic fields to create detailed images of your brain. It can be somewhat noisy, and you will need to remain very still. The procedure typically takes approximately 30-45 minutes. As for further tests, the neurologist will determine that based on their assessment and the MRI results. I will provide you with a referral and the necessary paperwork. The staff at the radiology center will explain the procedure in detail and address any concerns you may have. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Um… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I used to be allergic to bee stings as a child, but that was ages ago. And sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I use certain soaps, but it's not a serious allergy. Just a little rash. Oh! And I get a bit carsick sometimes, if I sit in the back seat for too long. Does that count? But other than that, no, I don’t think I have any allergies. I just… get a little nervous easily. Is that an allergy?
DOCTOR: Very well. No known allergies documented. I am providing you with the referral for the neurologist, along with information regarding the MRI center. Please schedule both appointments as soon as possible. I will also send a copy of your medical record to the neurologist's office. Do you have any questions regarding the medication reconciliation, or would you like me to reiterate the dosage of Meloxicam and Pregabalin?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a lot of information. Um… no, I think I understand. The yellow pill and the white pill. Twice a day for the white one, and… I guess whenever I need it for the other one? But you said something about making sure the pills weren’t… interacting? Is that bad? Should I stop taking them until I see the specialist? I don't want anything to go wrong. Maybe I should just have that chamomile tea.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Hughston, do not discontinue your medications without consulting with the neurologist. The potential interactions are currently theoretical, and require further evaluation. I have scheduled a follow-up appointment for two weeks to discuss the results of your tests and the neurologist’s recommendations. Here is the paperwork. Please contact my office if you experience any adverse effects or have any concerns. Have a pleasant day. .
