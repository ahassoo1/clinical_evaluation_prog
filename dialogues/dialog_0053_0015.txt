DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's… my sinuses, I think. They been botherin' me. Not good. I don't remember exactly when it started, just… a long time now. Feels stuffy, mostly.
DOCTOR: “A long time now,” is…helpful. Right. Let’s try to narrow that down a little, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, um… maybe three months? Four? It's hard to say, Doctor. Things… they all kinda blend together. I work a lot, you see. Out on the rigs. Very dusty. Maybe that's it? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Dusty rigs, yes. That could certainly contribute. And besides the stuffiness, are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes a headache. Not bad, just… there. And my face feels… full? Like pressure, on both sides. And… I get tired easy, I think. But I always tired from work, so maybe that's nothin'. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Headache, facial pressure… fatigue, understandably with your work. Alright. Any fever, chills, cough, or sore throat?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I know of. No chills. Cough… sometimes, but just a little one. Like… clearin' my throat, you know? Not a bad cough. And no sore throat. I don’t think so, anyway. It’s just… this stuffiness. Very bothersome.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any change in your sense of smell or taste?
PATIENT: Smell? Oh… maybe. Things don't smell as strong, I guess. I didn't really… notice before. I don’t cook much. My husband does all the cooking. So… maybe? It's hard to say, Doctor. I am not sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick examination, then we can discuss some possibilities. Can you open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you need. I am not afraid. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Some mild redness in the back of your throat, nothing terribly concerning. Your tonsils don’t appear enlarged. Now, I’m going to gently press on your sinuses to check for tenderness. Just let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a little… sensitive there, Doctor. On this side. Not terrible, just… feels full. And… here, on my cheekbone, too. A little bit. Everything else feels okay, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And I’m going to listen to your lungs, just to be thorough. Take a deep breath in for me… and exhale. Again… deep breath in… and exhale. Lungs sound clear. No wheezing or crackling that I can hear.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Is everything… okay? Is it somethin' bad? I get worried easy. I don't want to have to stop workin'. We need the money, you see.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Boham, based on what you’ve told me and the quick examination, it sounds most likely like you're dealing with a chronic sinus infection – sinusitis. It’s not uncommon, especially with your line of work and the dust exposure. It doesn't sound like anything immediately life-threatening. But chronic infections can be bothersome, and we should try to get it under control. Now, a proper diagnosis would require some imaging—a CT scan of your sinuses. And honestly, given your lack of insurance, that might be difficult to arrange. But we can discuss some initial treatment options to see if we can get some relief.
PATIENT: Oh… a scan? No, Doctor, I can't afford a scan. I don’t have insurance, like I said. So… what can I do? Just… try to live with it? That's not good. I need to work. Is there… medicine? Anything to help the stuffiness?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, without the scan, we’re operating with incomplete information. But for symptomatic relief, we can try a saline nasal rinse—twice a day. That can help clear out some of the congestion. And an over-the-counter decongestant—pseudoephedrine, if you're able to get it—can help with the stuffiness. However, don't use it for more than a few days, as it can cause rebound congestion. And frankly, given your history, I'm a little concerned about the possibility of underlying structural issues contributing to this. A referral to an ENT specialist would be ideal, but again, without insurance… it's difficult. We can try these initial steps, and if things don’t improve in a couple of weeks, you really need to consider seeking more comprehensive care. It's possible something more serious is going on. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Saline… rinse? I think I heard of that. And the… decongestant. Okay. A few days, you said. Not long. And the specialist… I see. No, no money for that. I will try the rinse and the medicine. A few days. And if it doesn’t get better… I will… think about it. I need to work. Thank you, Doctor. Is that all?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Boham. That's all for today. I'm writing down the instructions for the saline rinse. If the symptoms worsen – high fever, severe facial pain, vision changes – you need to go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Fever… pain… I understand. Emergency room. Thank you very much. Have a good day, Doctor Pitmon.
DOCTOR: You as well, Ms. Boham. Try to get some rest, if you can. .
