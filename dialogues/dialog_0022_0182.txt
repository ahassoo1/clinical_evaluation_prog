DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, let's get this over with. It’s about this… procedure. My daughter insisted I get a check-up before I go through with it. Says the surgeon needs it. Honestly, I don't see why. I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re here for a pre-operative evaluation, at your daughter’s suggestion. That’s very thoughtful of her. Even if you’re feeling well, it’s standard practice to ensure you're in the best possible health before any procedure. Could you tell me a little bit about the procedure itself?
PATIENT: It’s… a face lift. Though I don’t see what’s wrong with my face. It’s just… sagging a bit, that’s all. My daughter says I look “tired.” Women. They notice these things. It's not like I'm climbing mountains anymore, you know. Just want to get it done and be finished with it. A simple tightening, that’s all. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. A facelift. And you're right, it's good to make sure everything is optimal before proceeding. And it sounds like you're generally feeling well, which is great. To get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, goodness. Where do I begin? I’ve lived 81 years, you know. I’ve had… things. A bit of arthritis, mostly. Knees ache a bit in the cold. Had a bout of pneumonia years ago, but recovered just fine. Nothing serious. I don’t go to doctors unless absolutely necessary. Waste of time, mostly. Are you writing all this down? It’s probably nothing you need to know.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am writing everything down, Mr. Orwin. It's all helpful information. Arthritis in your knees, and a history of pneumonia – that’s good to know. And you’re right, 81 years is a long time! It's not unusual to have a few things along the way. Just to clarify, is the arthritis limited to your knees, or do you experience it in other joints as well?
PATIENT: Mostly the knees. Sometimes my hands are a bit stiff in the mornings, but I just work through it. I used to be a terrazzo worker, you know. Hard work. Lots of bending and kneeling. That’s probably why my knees are bad. Not much you can do about it now, though. It’s not like I’m doing any terrazzo work these days. Besides, most young people don't even know what terrazzo is anymore. It's all cheap tile. Disgraceful.
DOCTOR: Terrazzo work sounds physically demanding, indeed. That certainly could contribute to the arthritis in your knees. And you're right, it's a bit of a lost art. Now, thinking about other aspects of your health, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was… a long time ago. And I had a cataract removed from my right eye a few years back. Other than that… no, I can’t recall anything major. A few stitches here and there, but nothing that required a hospital stay. I try to avoid hospitals if I can help it. They’re full of germs, you know. And the food is terrible. Honestly, just a waste of good time.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and cataract surgery. Good to know. And I understand your feelings about hospitals – many people feel the same way. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure. A small white pill. My doctor gave it to me a few years back. Can’t remember the name of it. Doesn’t bother me none. And allergies… hmm. I think I had a reaction to penicillin once, when I was a boy. Made me break out in a rash. Haven’t taken it since. Other than that… no, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Well, except for those newfangled vegetable substitutes. Disgusting.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication and a penicillin allergy. We'll make sure to note that in your chart. Now, thinking about your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my mother lived to be 92, but she wasn’t exactly healthy at the end. Lots of aches and pains. My father died young, heart attack. And my brother… he had some kind of cancer, years ago. Lung cancer, I think. Smoked like a chimney, that one. Other than that… not really. A lot of just… general old age stuff. My family wasn’t one for going to doctors, either. We just toughed things out. It’s probably why we all lived so long. Though, I suppose it didn’t make things easy. Are we almost done? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. History of heart issues and cancer in the family. We appreciate you sharing that. And yes, we're getting close. Just a few more questions. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! I haven't touched a drop of alcohol in 40 years. My wife… well, she didn’t approve. And smoking? Never. Disgusting habit. Always smelled awful. And recreational drugs… what do you take me for? I'm a sensible Norwegian man. I drink coffee, that’s it. Black coffee, strong coffee. Keeps me going. Now, can we please wrap this up? I really must be going. My lunch is getting cold.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. No alcohol, no smoking, no recreational drugs – excellent. Just coffee. That’s good to know. Finally, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Get it over with. But don’t take too long. And be gentle, alright? My back isn’t what it used to be. Honestly, I don’t see why this is necessary. I feel perfectly fine. But fine, go ahead. Just… hurry it up, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relaxing and breathing normally for me. Heart sounds are regular, but I do note a slight murmur. It's not alarming, but something to keep in mind. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 142/88. A bit elevated, but not unexpected. We can monitor that. Ears are clear. Throat looks normal. Pulse is 72 and regular. Alright, Mr. Orwin. Everything seems stable. Your heart murmur isn't new, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is a little high, but not drastically so. Given your age and history, that is relatively common. We'll want to keep an eye on it. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: A murmur? What does that mean? Is something wrong with my heart? And high blood pressure… is that serious? Honestly, this is all very unsettling. I just wanted to get a face lift, not discover I’m falling apart! And you say all this is “common”? Common for whom? Old people? I feel perfectly alright!
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, it’s understandable to be concerned when you hear something new about your health. Let me explain. A heart murmur is simply an extra sound your heart makes when it beats. Many murmurs are completely harmless, especially those that have been present for a long time. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. It’s just something we note and monitor. As for the blood pressure, a reading of 142/88 is mildly elevated. It’s not immediately dangerous, but it does mean we should pay attention to it and take steps to manage it if it remains high consistently. Things like diet and exercise can often help. I understand you came in for a facelift, and I don't want to cause unnecessary worry. But it's important to have a complete picture of your health before proceeding with any procedure, even a cosmetic one. It’s all about minimizing risks and ensuring your safety. Given your blood pressure and the murmur, I’d like to recommend a follow-up with your primary care physician for a more thorough evaluation, including an EKG. And it might be prudent to get a clearance from a cardiologist before proceeding with the facelift. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? An EKG? Good heavens. This is getting ridiculous. My daughter is going to be thrilled. “See, I told you you needed more tests,” she’ll say. Honestly, I should have just ignored her advice and gotten this over with weeks ago. Fine. Yes, alright. Do whatever you think is necessary. But I want this done as quickly as possible. And I’m not paying for any unnecessary tests. My insurance is already stretched thin as it is. Can we please get this over with? I have a lunch appointment to get to, you know. And I’m not sure I have the energy for any more poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I understand your frustration, and I assure you, I’ll keep things as efficient as possible. I’ll write a referral to a cardiologist and order the EKG. I will also send your primary care physician a summary of our findings today. I’ll also provide you with a printed summary of the recommendations, and the contact information for a highly recommended cardiologist in the area. In the meantime, it's always good to maintain a healthy lifestyle: a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress reduction can make a big difference. Do you have any questions before I finalize this referral?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Just… get it done. I need this referral. And I need to get to lunch. Honestly, this has been a complete waste of my time. Thank you. I suppose. But don't expect me to be singing your praises anytime soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I understand. Here is the referral and the summary of our findings. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or need assistance scheduling appointments. I hope you enjoy your lunch. And please do take care of yourself.
