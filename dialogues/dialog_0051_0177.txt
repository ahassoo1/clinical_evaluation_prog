DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, doctor. Hmm... what brings me in? Well, it's... something down there. A little leak, you know? Not good. It’s been... a while now, I guess. I don't really keep track of these things. It's just... icky.
DOCTOR: Okay, "something down there," a little leak that’s been going on for a while. “Icky,” you said. Thank you for sharing that with me. To help me understand better, could you describe the leak a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? Oh, dear. Well, it's... wet. And sometimes there’s a smell. Not a good smell, you understand. Like... old fish, maybe? I don’t know. I haven’t smelled old fish in a long time, to be honest. It’s just... not clean. And it stains my underwear. That's the worst part.
DOCTOR: Okay, wetness, sometimes with an odor you describe as similar to old fish, and staining your underwear. That sounds quite bothersome, Ms. Genard. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradually worsening over time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Gradual, I think. It didn’t just pop up one day, you know? It was... slow. Like a leaky faucet, getting a little worse and a little worse. I don't pay much attention to things like that until it gets really bad. My daughter keeps telling me to go to the doctor, but I always put it off. Until now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re here now. It is easy to put these things off. And it sounds like it’s been going on for a bit. Has anything made it worse – any specific activities, or times of day?
PATIENT: Hmm... worse? Not that I've noticed. It's just always there, sort of. Maybe when it's hot? I live in a warm place, you know. It's always hot. And I wear loose clothes. Maybe that makes it worse? I don't know. Honestly, I don't think much about what I wear. Comfort is important. And loose clothes are comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn't seem to be linked to specific activities, and possibly a bit more noticeable in the heat. And you prioritize comfort with loose clothing. Thank you. Now, have you experienced any pain, burning, or itching in the area, along with the wetness and odor?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little uncomfortable sometimes, when it's wet, of course. But no pain. Burning... no, I don’t think so. Itching… maybe a little? But I get itchy all over sometimes. Old age, you know? Skin gets dry. I put lotion on. But no, not much itching down there specifically. Mostly just... icky.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant pain or burning, just a little discomfort and occasional mild itching, along with the wetness and odor. You mentioned putting lotion on for dry skin. That's good. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or urinary problems?
PATIENT: Oh, medical conditions... Let me think. Old age is a condition, isn’t it? No, not really. The doctor always tells me my blood pressure is a little high, but that’s all. And I had a bad fall last year and broke my wrist. But that's it. No diabetes or anything like that. I try to eat healthy. Mostly. And drink plenty of water. Although, I do love a good pastry sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Genard. High blood pressure is common, and it's good you're staying active and trying to eat well. And a broken wrist last year... that sounds unpleasant. Have you ever had any surgeries or procedures?
PATIENT: Surgeries... oh, dear. Let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And I had a baby, so… a delivery. That’s a surgery, isn't it? Other than that… no, not really. Nothing much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, for the most part. A few aches and pains, you know. But nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a delivery. And otherwise, you’ve been quite healthy. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or vitamins?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... I take a little pill for my blood pressure. Just one every morning. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis when my hands hurt. But that's just when they really bother me. And I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I was low on it. Other than that… no, not really. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. They make me feel strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure, as-needed arthritis medication, and a vitamin D supplement. That’s good to know. And you prefer to avoid medications when possible. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky. I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but that’s just a little sniffle. Not a real allergy. I eat all sorts of things. Spicy food, sweet food… I don’t really have any trouble. My daughter is very allergic to shellfish, but I’m not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Now, Ms. Genard, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history, if that's alright. Has anyone in your family had any significant medical conditions, like cancer, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… let me think. My mother had heart trouble when she got old. And my brother had cancer, a long time ago. He’s gone now, poor thing. My father was healthy as a horse, though. And my daughter is perfectly healthy, thankfully. Just a little stressed out, always worrying about everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had heart trouble and your brother had cancer. And your father was healthy and your daughter is generally well. Thank you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that even mean? Oh… you mean, like, my life? Well, I live alone. Always have, really. Never married. Didn’t want the trouble, you know? I used to work as an artist. Painted pictures. Still do sometimes, when I feel up to it. Mostly landscapes. I like being outdoors. And I like to spend time with my daughter and grandkids. They’re a handful, but I love them dearly.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Ms. Genard. A life filled with art and family is a good life. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! I never touched a cigarette in my life. Too dangerous, you know? And I don’t drink alcohol either. Makes me feel strange. And drugs? Absolutely not! I'm a respectable woman. I just like a good cup of tea in the afternoon, that's all. And maybe a little pastry with it.
DOCTOR: A sensible choice, Ms. Genard. Tea and pastries sound delightful. Thank you for sharing all of this information with me. Now, with your permission, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam? Well… I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. I'm not crazy about being poked and prodded, you know? But if it will help figure out what's wrong, then go ahead. Just be gentle, okay? And don't take too long.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. It will just be a quick exam. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll take a look at your abdomen. And finally, I’ll need to do a pelvic exam to check the source of the wetness and odor you’ve been experiencing. I will explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A pelvic exam? Now you’re talking about… down there? I don't know… That sounds… uncomfortable. And private. I haven't… well, it’s been a long time since anyone looked down there. Are you sure you need to? Can't you just give me some cream or something?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Genard. It's perfectly reasonable to feel that way. A pelvic exam is the most accurate way to determine the cause of the wetness and odor. It allows me to visually inspect the area and rule out any infections or other issues. However, we don’t have to proceed if you are absolutely not comfortable. We can start with a urine sample to look for infection. That will give us some information. But without the exam, it will be difficult to determine the exact cause and provide the most appropriate treatment. Would you like to start with the urine sample, and we can discuss the exam further after we have the results?
PATIENT: A urine sample? That sounds… less invasive. Yes, let's do that. I can do a urine sample. Where do I go? And what do I do with it? It’s been a while since I’ve had to… you know. I hope it's not too difficult. I don't want to make a mess.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. It’s perfectly alright. I'll give you this cup and a clean container. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. I've left some instructions on the counter. It's important to try and collect a mid-stream sample—that is, start urinating into the toilet, and then collect the sample mid-stream into the cup. This helps to avoid any contamination. Don’t worry about making a mess; we have everything you need to clean up if anything happens. Take your time, and let me know when you're finished. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: Okay. A mid-stream… right. I think I remember something about that. I hope I can do this. It’s been a while since I've had to think about this. Thank you, doctor. I’ll go try.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. Genard. I'll be right here if you need anything.
