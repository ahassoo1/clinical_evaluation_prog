DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I haven't got all day, so let's get on with it. It's this…shaking. Hands mostly. Annoying, really. Been happening for a bit now, I suppose. Don't remember exactly when it started, but it's getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’d like to get right to it. The shaking in your hands… when you say “a bit now,” can you give me a rough idea – weeks, months, longer?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly? Months, maybe? Years even. It comes and goes, you see. Sometimes it's barely noticeable, other times…well, like this. It's just…it's not dignified. I used to have steady hands. Important in my line of work, you know. Producing and directing. Can’t be shaky when you’re giving orders.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anything specific brought it on or made it worse recently?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm. Not that I recall. It just…happens. Stress, maybe? Though I haven't been particularly stressed lately. I'm retired, for heaven's sake! Though, my daughter keeps wanting me to move in with her…that's a bit of a bother. But I doubt that would cause a tremor. Honestly, Doctor, I don't pay attention to those sorts of things. Just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been happening for months, possibly years, seems to come and go, and isn’t consistently linked to anything specific. You mentioned it's worse at times, but you haven't noticed a clear pattern. And you're retired, with some…family dynamics. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I'll check your reflexes, coordination, and look at your hands a bit more closely. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Look, I’ve had doctors poke and prod at me for years. Always something. As long as it doesn't take long. I have a luncheon to get to. A very important luncheon. Get on with it, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I’ll be as quick as possible. Okay, your reflexes seem normal. Coordination is a little…slow, but not dramatically so. And yes, the tremor is most noticeable in your hands when you’re trying to do something. I also notice a slight stiffness in your fingers. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to rule out anything else. Heart and lungs sound clear.
PATIENT: Clear, huh? Good. See? Nothing major. I told you. Probably just old age. My wife…she had all sorts of ailments. Always at the doctor's. What are you going to do about it, anyway? Just going to tell me I’m getting old? Because I already know that.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. It could be related to aging, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Given the tremor, stiffness, and the fact it’s been ongoing, I’d like to order a few blood tests. Just to check for things like thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies that can sometimes cause tremors. Also, I think a neurological assessment would be helpful, just to get a specialist's opinion. They can do some more detailed tests to see if this is something like essential tremor or something else. Would you be open to those things?
PATIENT: Tests…a specialist… Honestly, Doctor, all this sounds like a waste of time and money. I’m not one for poking and prodding and filling out forms and waiting around. I’ve lived a long life, I've had my share of aches and pains. A little shake isn't going to kill me. But if you insist, I suppose. Just get it over with quickly. I don’t want to spend the rest of my days in doctor's offices.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I understand. We’ll keep it as streamlined as possible. I’ll order the blood tests – it’s a standard panel and shouldn’t take long. And I’ll get a referral sent to Dr. Chen, a neurologist nearby. He's very good and efficient. In the meantime, if the tremor starts to interfere with your daily activities significantly, or if you notice any other symptoms like weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, please call the office immediately. I'll have the lab order and referral ready for you before you leave. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Just…make it quick, alright? I have a luncheon. And tell Dr. Chen not to waste my time. Is that all? I think I’ve answered enough questions for one day. Honestly, the things they make you do these days....
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for today, Mr. Baide. I’ll have the paperwork ready for you now. Here's the lab order, and this is the referral to Dr. Chen. His office will call you to schedule an appointment. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and enjoy your luncheon.
