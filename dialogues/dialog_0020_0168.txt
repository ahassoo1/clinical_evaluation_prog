DOCTOR: Good morning, Esthela. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure. Honestly, it's rather… delicate. I’m starting to date someone, and well, one must be thorough, don’t you think? Preventative measures, as it were. It's just… important to be certain, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That's very responsible of you. So, you're looking for a general check-up, specifically related to sexual health before starting a new relationship?
PATIENT: Well, “general” feels… imprecise. I suppose you could say that, but it’s more than just the typical things, you know? It's about making sure he’s… suitable. One doesn’t want to get involved with someone who has… questionable habits. I trust my instincts, of course, but a professional opinion is always welcome. Do you understand what I mean? It’s about peace of mind, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’re concerned about potential risks associated with a new partner and want to ensure both your health and safety. To help me understand better, could you tell me what specific concerns you have?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Well, I want to know everything, frankly. Everything he might have that could be… passed on. Not that I suspect anything, mind you. He’s a very presentable man, quite successful, actually. But one reads things, doesn’t one? And it's better to be safe than sorry. Are there tests for… everything? And could we also check my levels? Just to be certain I’m not carrying anything I’m unaware of. A complete picture, Doctor. That's what I require.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can absolutely do a comprehensive STI screening for both of you. That includes tests for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, and herpes. We can also test for other infections if we have a specific concern. And yes, it’s wise to check your own levels as well – a baseline is always good. Are you currently experiencing any symptoms – anything at all, even minor – that made you decide to come in today?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, absolutely not. I maintain a very… disciplined lifestyle. Everything is quite regular, you see. No itching, no unusual discharge, nothing of the sort. It's purely preventative. I simply believe in being proactive. Though… now that you mention it, I have been feeling slightly more… fatigued lately. But I attribute that to the summer heat, mostly. It’s been terribly oppressive. Still, perhaps it's worth noting. Is that… significant?
DOCTOR: Fatigue can certainly be a symptom of many things, so it's good you mentioned it. We'll keep that in mind. It’s often non-specific, but it's always worth investigating. Let’s proceed with the STI screening for both you and your partner. We’ll also do a general blood work panel to check your overall health – things like your complete blood count, thyroid function, and vitamin levels. Would you prefer to schedule a separate appointment for the blood draw, or can we do that quickly now?
PATIENT: Oh, quickly now would be much preferred, Doctor. I have a luncheon planned for one o’clock. It’s rather important, and I wouldn’t want to be delayed. Do you have a phlebotomist available? And will it take long? I do dislike needles, you understand. A quick, efficient procedure is essential. Is there anything I should do to prepare? Or any aftercare instructions I should be aware of?
DOCTOR: Yes, we do have a phlebotomist available now. It shouldn’t take long at all – perhaps 15-20 minutes for the blood draw and a brief wait while we prepare the samples. I’ll ask the phlebotomist to be as quick and gentle as possible. As for preparation, just ensure you've had something to eat and drink beforehand. Aftercare is simple – just apply a small bandage to the site and avoid strenuous activity for a few hours. We’ll provide the bandages. Do you have any known allergies to latex or alcohol wipes?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None whatsoever. I maintain a very… clean system, as I mentioned. Latex or alcohol are quite acceptable. Although, perhaps a slightly larger bandage would be preferable. I tend to bruise easily, you see. A small one simply won't do. And, if you wouldn’t mind, could you ensure the phlebotomist uses a new needle? I have a… delicate constitution. It’s a simple request, I assure you. One can never be too careful.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We always use new needles for every patient, so that’s not a problem at all. And I'll make a note for the phlebotomist to use a larger bandage. Just to confirm, you're comfortable proceeding with a full STI panel for both you and your partner, plus the general blood work panel?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is precisely correct. The full panels, for both of us. Thoroughness is paramount, as we’ve established. I appreciate your attention to detail. And I trust your professional judgment implicitly. Shall we proceed, then? I have a rather busy afternoon, and I wouldn't want to keep you detained unnecessarily. Although, truthfully, I’m quite relieved to be finally addressing this matter. It’s a weight off my shoulders, really.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s get started then. I’ll have the phlebotomist come in momentarily. She’ll explain the process and answer any questions you may have. Just relax, and it will be over before you know it. If you’d like, I can step out while the blood is being drawn if you prefer. After that, we can discuss the results once they come back, usually within a few days.
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, please don't trouble yourself to step out. I'm perfectly capable. I simply… prefer efficiency, as we've discussed. Having you present assures me everything will be handled with the utmost professionalism. And truthfully, a bit of polite conversation might be… distracting. Yes, that's it. Distracting. Just ensure the phlebotomist is… gentle. That is all. Let us proceed, then. I trust you’ve thoroughly vetted your staff? One never knows these days, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. All of our staff are highly trained and experienced. I trust them implicitly. I’ll just quickly review your chart one more time… Alright, I’ll let the phlebotomist know you’re ready. She should be right in. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything quite adequately. I have complete faith in your expertise. Though… one minor question. Will the results be… confidential? I trust the clinic’s discretion implicitly, of course, but one can never be too careful, can one? It's simply a matter of… propriety. And if there are any… concerning results, how will they be communicated? Will I receive a phone call? Or a letter? A secure email, perhaps? Details, Doctor. It's all about the details.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Your privacy is of utmost importance to us, and all of your results will be kept strictly confidential, in accordance with HIPAA regulations. We will never share your information without your explicit consent. As for communication, we will contact you by phone to discuss any concerning results. We will not send results via unsecured channels like email. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in person, if you prefer. Is that satisfactory?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly satisfactory. A phone call, followed by a potential follow-up appointment. Discreet and efficient. Just ensure the call is made to my mobile number – it’s the most secure. And please, speak clearly. I have rather sensitive hearing. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’m ready for the phlebotomist. The sooner this is completed, the better. I have a luncheon to attend, you see, and punctuality is paramount. I trust she’s… punctual as well?
DOCTOR: Yes, she is. I’ll let her know to be especially gentle and speak clearly. I'll also double-check that she has your mobile number. She should be in within the next minute. Just relax, and she'll take excellent care of you. I’ll be right here if you need anything.
PATIENT: Excellent. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your attentiveness. Now, let us proceed. The sooner this is completed, the sooner I can relax. And frankly, I’m beginning to feel slightly… faint. Perhaps a glass of water would be advisable before the phlebotomist arrives? It's just… a precaution, you understand. One never knows how one will react to needles, do one?
DOCTOR: Certainly. That’s a very good idea. Please, have a glass of water. It’s best to be well-hydrated. Here you are. Take your time. The phlebotomist will be right here. We want you to feel as comfortable as possible. Is there anything else I can get for you?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is most kind of you. This is… refreshing. Although, truthfully, I’m still feeling slightly… apprehensive. It’s not the needles themselves, you understand. It’s the… implications. One always worries about what one might discover, doesn’t one? The unknown, you see. It’s unsettling. Still, one must be proactive. And frankly, I’m relieved to finally be addressing this matter. Although, truthfully, I wish my luncheon weren’t scheduled for precisely one o’clock. It’s rather important, you see. And punctuality is paramount. Do you think the phlebotomist will be quick? A swift procedure is essential.
DOCTOR: Yes, she is very experienced and efficient. I'll let her know you have a luncheon appointment at one o’clock, and she will do everything possible to be quick and gentle. I will also be right here throughout the procedure to ensure everything goes smoothly. Try to focus on your breathing – that can help with the anxiety. She should be in any moment now. Is there anyone you’d like to call, just in case you want a little support?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. I do not require support. I am perfectly capable of handling this myself. Honestly, suggesting support is rather… condescending. I assure you, I am a very resilient individual. I simply… prefer efficiency, as we’ve established. And punctuality. It's rather important. Still, I appreciate your… concern. Though truthfully, I find it somewhat… unnecessary. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’m ready for the phlebotomist. The sooner this is completed, the sooner I can relax and focus on more important matters. Honestly, this entire process is rather… unsettling. One always worries, doesn’t one?
DOCTOR: Very well. I understand. She should be here any moment. I will remain here with you throughout the process, and if you need anything at all – even just a moment to pause – please don’t hesitate to let me know. We want to ensure you have a comfortable experience. I believe I hear her now.
PATIENT: Finally. I trust she’s… thoroughly vetted? One can never be too careful, can one? Honestly, this entire process is… unsettling. The implications, you see. One always worries, doesn’t one? And punctuality is paramount. Let us proceed, then. The sooner this is completed, the sooner I can relax and focus on more important matters.
DOCTOR: “Good morning! My name is Sarah. Dr. Beinborn, is it alright if I proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: Good morning. I trust you are… experienced? And efficient? I have a rather important luncheon appointment at precisely one o’clock, and punctuality is paramount. And frankly, I am feeling slightly… apprehensive. One always worries, doesn’t one? Honestly, this entire process is… unsettling. Please, proceed with the utmost care. And efficiency. And punctuality.
DOCTOR: “Sarah is one of our most experienced phlebotomists. She’s excellent with anxious patients. She understands you have a luncheon appointment and will be as quick and gentle as possible. Just relax, and she'll take good care of you. Sarah, please explain the procedure briefly and let Esthela know she can stop at any time if she feels uncomfortable." “Certainly. We just need to draw a small amount of blood for the tests Dr. Beinborn ordered. I'll start by cleaning the area on your arm with an alcohol swab, then I’ll insert the needle. You may feel a brief sting, but it shouldn't be painful. It usually takes just a few minutes. And, like Dr. Beinborn said, you can absolutely stop me at any time if you need to.” "Is that alright?
PATIENT: A brief sting, you say? Honestly, I do not tolerate needles well. And frankly, the thought of someone… inserting something into my arm is rather… unsettling. Is there absolutely no alternative? Perhaps a different method? Or a topical anesthetic? Honestly, I am feeling increasingly apprehensive. And please, proceed with the utmost care. And efficiency. And punctuality. Is the needle… new? One can never be too careful, can one? Honestly, this entire process is… unsettling. Very well. Proceed. But with the utmost care. And efficiency. And punctuality.
DOCTOR: “Esthela, I understand your anxiety. Sarah uses brand new, sterile needles for every patient. And she's very gentle. We can also apply a topical anesthetic if you’d like, though it will add a few minutes to the process. If you feel any discomfort, just let Sarah know immediately, and she’ll stop. We want you to feel as comfortable as possible. If you prefer, we can reschedule this for another day when you feel more relaxed.” "Of course. We can definitely apply some numbing cream before the draw if you’d like. It takes about five minutes to take effect, but it will help minimize any discomfort. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Numbing cream… five minutes? Honestly, I do not have five minutes to spare! I have a luncheon appointment at precisely one o’clock, and punctuality is paramount! However… … if it will truly minimize discomfort… … very well. Apply the numbing cream. But be quick about it! And please, be gentle! Honestly, this entire process is… unsettling. Punctuality, punctuality, punctuality… But be quick about it! I do not have all day!
DOCTOR: “Absolutely. I understand your concern about time. I’ll apply this as quickly and gently as possible. It might feel a little cool at first. Just relax, and try to take a few deep breaths. It only needs about five minutes to take effect.” “Just let me know if you feel any discomfort.” "While we wait, is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I require nothing. Honestly, the sensation is rather… unsettling. Five minutes… it feels like an eternity. Punctuality, punctuality, punctuality… And please, be quick about it! I do not have all day! This is… unsettling. Honestly, I do not tolerate this well. Punctuality, punctuality, punctuality… Is it almost ready? It feels like an eternity… Honestly, this entire process is… unsettling. Punctuality…
DOCTOR: “Just a few more seconds… it should be taking effect now. I'll gently wipe it off and check for sensitivity. It’s important to ensure it’s numbed enough before we proceed. I want to make sure you're comfortable." “Just a moment… Okay, I'm going to gently touch your arm here. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort.” “How does that feel?
PATIENT: A little… numb. But still… sensitive. Honestly, it's still… unsettling. And please, be careful! I do not tolerate this well. Punctuality, punctuality, punctuality… It’s… a little… prickly. And still… sensitive. Honestly, it's not enough! I still… feel it! It’s… unsettling. Punctuality, punctuality, punctuality… I still… feel it! It’s not enough! I need more! It’s… unsettling! Punctuality, punctuality, punctuality… I still… feel it! It's not enough! I need more! Punctuality, punctuality, punctuality… Honestly, this entire process is… unsettling! I still… feel it! Punctuality, punctuality, punctuality… Honestly, this entire process is… unsettling!
DOCTOR: “Esthela, it sounds like the numbing cream hasn't quite taken effect yet. It can sometimes take a little longer for some people. We can apply another layer, but that will add a few more minutes to the process. If you’re feeling too anxious, we can reschedule this for another day when you feel more relaxed. Your comfort is our priority.” “It’s perfectly alright, Esthela. We can definitely apply another layer of numbing cream. It’s just a precaution to ensure you’re comfortable. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Another layer? Honestly, I do not have time for another layer! I have a luncheon appointment at precisely one o’clock, and punctuality is paramount! However… …if it truly minimizes discomfort… …very well. Apply another layer. But be quick about it! Honestly, I do not tolerate this well. Punctuality, punctuality, punctuality… But be quick about it! I do not have all day! Honestly, this entire process is… unsettling. Punctuality… Honestly, this entire process is… unsettling!
DOCTOR: “Absolutely. I understand your concern about time. I’ll apply this as quickly and gently as possible. It might feel a little cool at first. Just relax, and try to take a few deep breaths. It only needs about five minutes to take effect.” “Just let me know if you feel any discomfort.” “While we wait, I can offer you a cool compress for your forehead. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: A cool compress? Honestly, I do not have time for a cool compress! I have a luncheon appointment at precisely one o’clock, and punctuality is paramount! However… … if it truly minimizes discomfort… … very well. A cool compress. But be quick about it! Honestly, I do not tolerate this well. Punctuality, punctuality, punctuality… But be quick about it! I do not have all day! Honestly, this entire process is… unsettling. Punctuality… Honestly, this entire process is… unsettling! I need more!
