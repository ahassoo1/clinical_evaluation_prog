DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kilton, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Well, I have been… how you say… whistling when I breathe. Like a small tea kettle. It started a few days ago, and it worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Whistling when you breathe… hmm. Okay. And how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… maybe four or five days now? It is not all the time, you understand. Mostly when I walk quickly, or if I try to lift something heavy. Not always, but enough that I notice. It makes me feel… tired, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's brought on by exertion, like walking or lifting. And you're feeling some fatigue with it. Is it a high-pitched whistle, or more of a… raspy sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that is a good question. It is… high, I think. Like a little bird, maybe? Not a cough, no. Definitely not a cough. More like… air moving fast through a small space. I hope that makes sense. It is difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mrs. Kilton. A high-pitched whistle with exertion… alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No fever, no bad cough. I have been a little bit… breathless, maybe? Not all the time, just when I walk up the stairs. And sometimes my chest feels… tight. Not painful, just… squeezed. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some breathlessness with stairs and a feeling of chest tightness. Have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. I have always been very… strong, you see. I was an athletic trainer for many years. Very active. This is new. Very new. I do not like it. It makes me feel old.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's concerning when something new comes up, especially when you've been active. Let's do a quick listen to your lungs and heart, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Please, go ahead. My lungs… they have seen many years of work, you know. Perhaps they are just tired now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kilton. If you could just sit up here for me, please. I'm going to listen to your breathing on your front and back. Try to breathe normally. Now, take a deep breath in… and out… again… deep breath in… and out… Okay. And one more time...deep breath in... and out. I am hearing some wheezing on both sides, especially when you exhale. It's not terribly loud, but it's definitely present. Also, your heart sounds a little…distant. Your blood pressure is 135/80, and your pulse is 80.
PATIENT: Wheezing… that is what I am doing, then? I knew it was something. My heart… distant? That sounds… not good. Is that bad, Doctor? What does that mean, “distant”? I am a little worried now. I have never had a distant heart before.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Kilton, let's not jump to conclusions. "Distant" just means it's a little harder to hear clearly, which can sometimes indicate a bit of fluid around the heart or lungs, or just that you’re a bit more built up in the chest. The wheezing suggests some narrowing of your airways, which could be a number of things – asthma, bronchitis, or even something related to allergies. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest x-ray. That will help us see what's going on in your lungs and around your heart. Would you be able to go to the imaging center today?
PATIENT: An x-ray… yes, I can do that. I do not mind. If that is what you think is best. The imaging center… is that far? I do not drive anymore, you see. My son, Tenzin, he usually takes me to appointments. He is at work now, but he can take me later. Will they tell me right away what they see? Or will I have to come back again? I hope it is not something very serious, Doctor. I just want to feel better again.
DOCTOR: The imaging center is about fifteen minutes away, and Tenzin should be able to manage that. They usually have the results available within a few hours, and I can review them this afternoon and call you with the findings. It's unlikely to be anything extremely serious, but it’s always best to be thorough. While we're waiting for the x-ray, I’m going to prescribe you a bronchodilator inhaler. It helps open up the airways and should relieve some of the wheezing and breathlessness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A bronchodilator… that sounds complicated. But if it will help me breathe easier, yes, please. My airways… they are narrowing, you say? Is that from being old? I have always taken very good care of my body. I used to tell my students, “Your body is a temple!” But even temples can fall apart, I suppose. Will the inhaler have… side effects? I do not want to feel dizzy or anything. I need to be steady on my feet. I still cook for my family, you see.
DOCTOR: It's not from being old, Mrs. Kilton, it can happen for many reasons – allergies, a mild infection, or even just a sensitivity. The inhaler is very safe. The most common side effect is a slightly racing heart, but it's usually mild and temporary. We'll start with a low dose, and if you feel dizzy or your heart races too much, you should stop using it and call me. It’s important to use it exactly as prescribed. Here's the prescription for the inhaler. The pharmacy is just down the street, and they can explain how to use it properly. And we'll get the results from the x-ray this afternoon, and then we'll decide on the next step. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. A plan. I like a plan. A low dose, and stop if I feel strange. I can do that. And the x-ray this afternoon. Thank you, Doctor Gorga. You have been very patient with me. I do worry so much. My son says I am too much of a worrier. I will go to the pharmacy now, and then tell Tenzin about the x-ray. I think… I think that is all. For now. Thank you again. I hope you have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. Try not to worry too much. We're just being cautious. And if anything changes, or you feel worse, don't hesitate to call. I hope you have a good day as well. Please let the nurse know if you need help getting out of here.
