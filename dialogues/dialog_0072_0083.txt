DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I'm Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s like this… I just… I thought maybe you could write me a little card. You know, a “Get Well” card. Or something… encouraging. My ex-wife, she always liked a nice card. Makes a fella feel better, you understand? It’s not… anything serious, just a little pick-me-up.
DOCTOR: A…card, sir?
PATIENT: Yes, a card. Like, you write something nice on it. You know, “Hope you feel better soon” or… something like that. Is that… unusual? I mean, I got Medicare, so I figured… a little card wouldn’t be too much to ask. It's a small thing, really.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, while I appreciate you seeking reassurance, my role as a physician is to address your medical concerns. Providing a “get well” card is…not within the scope of a medical consultation. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms that are troubling you?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really… That's why I thought a card would be enough! I just… feel a little down, you know? Life's been hard. Divorced, all alone… A nice word from a doctor, someone respectable, would mean something. I don't need medicine, I need… a boost. It’s a perfectly reasonable request, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, “feeling down” can be indicative of underlying medical conditions, such as depression or anxiety. These are things we can and should address medically. Have you experienced any changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… I sleep okay. Sometimes. And I eat… enough. Not much of an appetite, really, but who does these days? Energy… no, not much energy. But that’s just getting older, isn't it? Look, Doctor, I don’t think I got depression or… anxiety. I just need a little something to make me feel better. A card! Is that so hard to understand? You write people prescriptions all the time, what's one little card?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, a prescription is based on a diagnosis derived from a thorough medical evaluation. I am obligated to assess your health concerns responsibly. We need to determine if there is a medical reason for how you are feeling. Have you ever been diagnosed with a mental health condition?
PATIENT: Mental health? No! Never. I'm a strong man. Worked hard my whole life, running boilers and all. This is just… a rough patch. A card wouldn't hurt anyone, would it? I'm not asking for a free check-up, just a little… kindness. You doctors… always gotta make everything so complicated. I just wanted a simple thing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand you’re feeling disheartened, but I am ethically bound to practice medicine, not provide emotional support outside of a clinical context. Let's try this differently. Besides feeling "down," have you noticed any physical symptoms – headaches, stomach issues, any unexplained weight loss, or perhaps difficulty concentrating?
PATIENT: Headaches? Sometimes. A little bit. But everyone gets headaches, right? Stomach… yeah, a little indigestion. Bad coffee, probably. Weight… I haven’t really been weighing myself. And concentrating… well, things aren't as sharp as they used to be. But that's my age, I tell you! Look, Doctor, I’m a stationary engineer! I run boilers, I don’t need a physical! I just want a card.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, it’s because you are a stationary engineer – a profession requiring focus and physical stamina – that I need to understand if any underlying medical conditions are contributing to your symptoms, or lack thereof. Difficulty concentrating can be a sign of several things. To proceed, I need a more complete history. Have you experienced any dizziness, vision changes, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Vision... maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I got old eyes, you know? And shortness of breath… not really. Just get tired easy, that’s all. I’m 56 years old, Doctor! Things wear out! This is getting ridiculous. I came here for a card, not a… an interrogation!
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration. However, dismissing potential health concerns based solely on age is not responsible medical practice. Blurred vision and fatigue, even if you attribute them to aging, could indicate underlying issues. To properly assess your condition, I need to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No! Never. My wife… she had a little bit of that, but not me. High blood pressure… the doctor said something once, years ago, but I don’t remember. Cholesterol… I don’t know! Look, I’m a simple man, Doctor! I fix boilers! I don't keep track of all this fancy medical stuff! I just want a card to cheer me up.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I am concerned about your blood pressure, given your history. Untreated hypertension can lead to serious complications. I am going to need to take your blood pressure and perform a brief physical exam to assess your overall health. Then we can discuss further steps. After that, perhaps we can discuss resources for emotional support, but I cannot fulfill your request for a “get well” card. Do you consent to the examination?
PATIENT: Examination? Now you want to poke and prod me? All this for a card? Fine, do what you gotta do. But don't expect me to be happy about it. Just… get it over with. And don't think for a minute I'm gonna start taking all these… fancy pills. I just wanted a little kindness.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. I'm going to start by checking your vital signs. Please remove your shoes and socks. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take your blood pressure and check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Fine. But don't go poking around too much, alright? I'm a delicate man, despite what it looks like. And if this takes too long, I'm leaving. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Please try to breathe normally. Take a deep breath… and exhale… again… Deep breath… Deep breath in… and out… Heart sounds are slightly diminished, but regular. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, let's check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: You're awfully cold, Doctor. And you're pressing too hard. This isn't very pleasant, you know. Just get it over with. I haven’t felt this uncomfortable since my ex-wife’s birthday…
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 150/92. That is elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, let’s briefly assess your reflexes. Left knee… Right knee… Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Alright, Mr. Kammer. That's all for the physical exam. Now, I need to ask about your medication list. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, including vitamins and supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No! I told you, I don't take anything! Just a little coffee in the morning, that’s it. I’m a healthy man, despite what those numbers say. You doctors… always trying to sell something.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I am not attempting to “sell” you anything. Your elevated blood pressure necessitates further investigation. While you may feel healthy, it’s important to address this issue to prevent potential complications. Given your blood pressure reading and your reluctance to provide further medical history, I recommend a referral to a cardiologist for a comprehensive evaluation. They can perform an EKG and other tests to determine the cause of your hypertension and recommend appropriate treatment. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A… cardiologist? Now you want to send me to another doctor? This is ridiculous! I just wanted a card! A simple, little card! I’m telling you, I’m fine. It’s the stress! My ex-wife, always causing trouble… That's why my blood pressure is up. I don’t need fancy tests or pills or anything. Just leave me alone. No, I don’t want to see a cardiologist. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration, but I cannot in good conscience dismiss your elevated blood pressure without further investigation. Ignoring this issue could lead to serious health consequences, such as heart attack or stroke. I strongly advise you to reconsider the referral to a cardiologist. If you absolutely refuse, I recommend at least scheduling a follow-up appointment with me in one month to recheck your blood pressure. However, I must document your refusal of the referral in your medical record. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. One month. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And I still want a card. Just a little one. Is that so much to ask? You can write “Get Well Soon” or something. I’m a patient, aren’t I? You’re supposed to care. One month. And a card.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kammer. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one month to recheck your blood pressure. I will also document your refusal of the cardiology referral. As for the card… while it’s not standard practice, I will make a note in your chart acknowledging your request for a positive affirmation. I cannot promise a physical card, but I will ensure your chart contains documentation of our conversation and your expressed desire for encouragement. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Well… that's something, I suppose. A note in the chart is better than nothing. Just… make sure it's a nice note. Something encouraging. And tell them to write my name right. It’s Early. Not Earle. No, that’s all. Just the note. And the appointment. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kammer. I have documented your request for a positive affirmation and noted the correct spelling of your name. Your follow-up appointment is scheduled for September 2nd at 10:00 AM. You will receive a reminder call. Thank you for your time.
