DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Todoro… Todoro… It’s about… a surgery. I believe I have an appointment for clearance before… well, before I have something done. It’s a bit… foggy, truthfully. My husband usually handles these things.
DOCTOR: Right. A pre-operative clearance. Honestly, it really helps if patients know the details of why they're here. It's... inefficient. But we can work with it. So, what kind of surgery are you scheduled for?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. I am sorry. It’s just… everything feels a little distant since… well, you know. It’s… cosmetic. Something to do with… my stomach. A lift, I think? Or maybe a tuck? He mentioned something about tightening things. It was a long time ago when we discussed it, and… I just don’t recall the specifics. He chose the doctor, and arranged everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. "Cosmetic surgery… abdominal lift/tuck… arranged by husband." Look, I’m not here to judge choices, but for pre-op clearance, I need to know a bit more than that. Do you have any medical conditions – anything at all?
PATIENT: Medical conditions…? Not that I know of, Doctor. I mean, I’ve always been fairly healthy. I work outside, you see, landscaping… keeps me moving. My husband always took care of the doctor visits and the… paperwork. He was very thorough. I… I don’t believe I’ve been diagnosed with anything serious. Perhaps a bit of… back pain sometimes, from the work, but nothing I’ve ever had a doctor look at. Is that important?
DOCTOR: "Fairly healthy" isn't a diagnosis, Mackenzi. And landscaping is… physical labor. Back pain is important. How long have you been experiencing it?
PATIENT: Oh, you're right, of course. I apologize. The back pain… it comes and goes, really. It’s worse after a long day of work, lifting things, bending… I suppose it’s been… a few years, on and off. Not constant, never debilitating, just… an ache. I usually just rest and it gets better. I really haven’t thought much of it. I’m sorry. Is it something I should have mentioned before?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mackenzi, it is something you should have mentioned. We're establishing your baseline health here. It’s… frustrating when patients downplay things. Alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. My husband always handled the check-ups, and he would have told me if something was wrong. I've never taken any medication regularly, besides… occasionally something for a headache. He used to say my blood pressure was always good when he checked it at home. I’m truly sorry I’m not more helpful. It’s just… a lot of it is a blur.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's try this differently. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. I eat a little bit of everything… Colombian food can have a lot of different ingredients, you know? He never mentioned any sensitivities either. It’s just… I’ve always been pretty robust. I'm starting to feel awful for not knowing more, Doctor. I promise I'm not trying to be difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. This would be my first, actually. That’s why I’m here, isn’t it? For the check-up before… everything. He always said I was too stubborn to let anyone operate on me unless it was absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. We're going to need to do a basic physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your abdomen. Just so we have a starting point. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. Whatever you need. I do feel a bit silly being here without knowing more details, but I trust you to figure things out.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Try to breathe deeply and evenly. Your blood pressure is 138/85. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds are… normal. Now, let’s take a look at your abdomen. I’m going to gently palpate your stomach. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender or painful. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, nothing there. A little bit of… pressure, but not pain. Just… firmness. It always feels a bit… tight. I suppose that’s from the work.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There's some… resistance here. And a bit of tenderness on deep palpation. This isn't necessarily unusual, given your physical occupation, but we need to investigate further. Anything here?
PATIENT: No, nothing on that side. It feels a bit… better on the left, actually. Just… normal tightness, like with the rest of the work. It’s hard to explain. It’s like… everything is always a little bit sore. It’s just… the way it feels after a long day, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the tenderness I detected, I'm going to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We also need to rule out any underlying inflammation, so I’ll add a CRP test. I also want to get an EKG done, just to assess your heart health. And, based on your history and the physical exam findings, I recommend a consultation with a general surgeon before proceeding with the cosmetic procedure. They can evaluate your abdominal wall and determine if there are any underlying issues that need to be addressed.
PATIENT: Oh. That… sounds like a lot. Are you saying something is wrong? I just wanted a little lift, you know? A consultation with a general surgeon… that doesn’t sound good. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Mackenzi, I'm not saying something is wrong. I’m saying we need more information before proceeding with any elective surgery. It’s… responsible medicine. The blood work and EKG will give us a baseline assessment of your overall health. The general surgeon can assess the condition of your abdominal wall and determine if there are any anatomical factors that could complicate the procedure. Elective surgery isn't without risks, and it’s my responsibility to ensure you're a suitable candidate. It’s not about “something being wrong”; it’s about mitigating potential complications. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now. The EKG can be done in the office before you leave. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No… not right now. Just… when will I get the results? And… will this mean I can’t have the surgery at all? I just… I don’t know what to think. It’s all so much more complicated than I expected.
DOCTOR: The blood work results usually take 24-48 hours. We’ll review them as soon as they’re available. The EKG results will be immediate. Whether or not you can proceed with the surgery depends on the findings. If there are underlying anatomical issues or if your blood work reveals any concerning abnormalities, we may need to address those before considering the elective procedure. Or, in some cases, it may not be advisable to proceed at all. I’ll explain everything in detail once we have the results. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I… I’ll wait for the nurse then. .
