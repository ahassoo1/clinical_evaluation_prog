DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Yes, well, let’s not waste time. I’m here because… frankly, I want to be sure everything works if I decide to… pursue this. I’m 51, not decrepit, but one doesn’t get younger. I want to avoid any… complications. I want a pregnancy, a healthy pregnancy, and I’d like to know, now, if there’s a reason to believe it won’t happen easily. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly clear. You're considering pregnancy and want to assess your overall health and potential obstacles. That's very proactive of you. At 51, there are certainly factors we need to consider. To give you the best assessment, I'm going to ask you a lot of questions, if that's alright. First, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Oh, please. Don’t patronize me. Of course I have. One child. A son. Healthy enough, though a bit… difficult. And a perfectly normal delivery, I might add. No complications on my end. It was… his father who was the issue. Divorced, naturally. But that’s hardly relevant to whether I can carry another child, is it? Honestly, I was hoping for some… testing, not a life story request. Is there a reason you need to know about my failed marriage?
DOCTOR: You’re right to call me out on that, Ms. Shteynberg. I apologize. That was unnecessary. The question was poorly phrased, and I didn’t intend to pry into personal details. Previous pregnancies are relevant, but the details of your personal life are not. Let’s focus on the medical aspects. Since you've had one previous pregnancy, could you tell me roughly when that was?
PATIENT: Twenty-eight years ago. 1997. It was… straightforward. Gained the usual amount of weight, no gestational diabetes, no pre-eclampsia, standard check-ups. I remember everything perfectly. I keep good records. Look, are we going to actually do something here or just rehash ancient history? I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to want to get straight to it. I’m accessing your records now, but it’s helpful to confirm details. Twenty-eight years ago, a straightforward pregnancy with no complications – that's good information. Given the time that’s passed, we’ll want to do a thorough evaluation. I’d like to start with a review of your current health. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Absolutely not. I watch my salt intake. Diabetes? Don’t be ridiculous. I'm not overweight. Thyroid… well, my mother had a touch of it, but I've been tested – perfectly normal. And my heart is… strong. I walk every day, and I don’t smoke. Honestly, I’m healthier than most women half my age. I take a multivitamin, obviously. Are you writing all this down? You should be. It’s rather… reassuring, wouldn't you say?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am, Ms. Shteynberg. And you’re right – that is very reassuring. No history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems, and a healthy lifestyle – excellent. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just the multivitamin, as I said. And occasionally ibuprofen for a headache. That’s it. I avoid unnecessary pills. I believe in a natural approach to health, within reason. And I haven't taken anything… substantial… in years. Honestly, Doctor, are you trying to find something wrong with me? It’s becoming rather irritating. I came here for a positive assessment, not an interrogation.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be frustrated, Ms. Shteynberg. I apologize if my questions feel like an interrogation. I assure you, I’m not trying to find something wrong with you. I’m trying to gather the information necessary to provide you with the most accurate assessment of your health and the potential risks of pregnancy. At your age, a thorough evaluation is crucial to ensure both your safety and the health of the potential pregnancy. Now, to move forward, I'd like to perform a physical exam. That will include checking your blood pressure and heart rate, listening to your lungs, and a pelvic exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Really? At my age? Look, I understand you have protocols, but honestly, it seems… excessive. I assure you, everything is perfectly functional. I'm not experiencing any… issues… down there. Is this absolutely necessary? Can't we just… take some blood tests? Or a scan? I'm rather particular about… personal examinations. And frankly, I find the suggestion… undignified. Is this standard practice for 51-year-old patients? Because I assure you, I've had numerous medical check-ups and this has never been suggested before.
DOCTOR: You're right to question that, Ms. Shteynberg, and I appreciate your candor. A pelvic exam is not absolutely necessary, but it does allow me to assess the condition of your uterus and ovaries, and to screen for any potential issues that might affect a pregnancy. Given your age, it’s more important to have a baseline understanding of your reproductive health. I understand your concerns about a personal examination and respect your wishes. However, without a physical assessment, it’s difficult to provide a comprehensive evaluation. We could start with blood tests, which will give us information about your hormone levels, overall health, and any potential underlying conditions. We can also discuss imaging options, such as an ultrasound, to assess your uterine lining and ovaries. But please understand that the blood tests and ultrasound alone won't give us the complete picture. What are your thoughts on starting with blood tests and an ultrasound, and then re-evaluating the need for a pelvic exam based on those results?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable. Blood tests and an ultrasound. Fine. Let’s get that done. But if the results are… normal, I’m not having anyone near… down there. Understand? And please, Doctor, let's keep this as efficient as possible. I have other appointments. And I expect a clear explanation of the results. No medical jargon, please. I understand English perfectly well, but I have no patience for… obfuscation. Can we proceed with that? Blood tests and a scan? Immediately.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Blood tests and an ultrasound. We can proceed immediately. I’ll have my nurse draw the necessary blood samples. The results usually take about three to five business days. We can schedule an ultrasound for as early as tomorrow. I also want to assure you, Ms. Shteynberg, that I will explain the results clearly and in plain language, without any medical jargon. My priority is to provide you with the information you need to make informed decisions about your health. Now, let me just quickly review your allergies and current medications one last time, to ensure accuracy. Do you have any known allergies to medications or other substances?
PATIENT: No allergies. Absolutely none. And as I've said repeatedly, just the multivitamin. Look, are you deliberately trying to prolong this? I've answered these questions multiple times. Honestly, it's… insulting. Is this some kind of test? Are you trying to assess my… patience? Because frankly, it's wearing thin. Just… let's get the blood drawn and schedule the scan. That's all. No further interrogations, please. I trust that's understood.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right. I apologize for the repetition, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s a standard part of the medical assessment, and I didn't intend to insult your intelligence or waste your time. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’ll also schedule your ultrasound. I'll review the results as soon as they become available and contact you to discuss them. Is there anything else I can do for you at this moment?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… get it done. Quickly. I have a life, you know. And frankly, the sooner I know whether this is even a possibility, the better. Thank you. I think that's enough for today. Don't bother with further questions. I’ll expect a call when the results are in. Please make it quick.
DOCTOR: Understood, Ms. Shteynberg. Sarah will be with you shortly. I’ll ensure you receive the results as quickly as possible. Thank you for your patience. .
