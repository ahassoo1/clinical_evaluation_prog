DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Solero. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Schneer, yes, that’s me. Well, it’s my ears, you see. They just… aren't what they used to be. Things are a bit muffled, if you know what I mean. Not terrible, but I miss hearin’ things clear as a bell. Used to be able to hear a pin drop!
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Muffled hearing can be quite frustrating. It's good you came in to get it checked out. So, to start, can you tell me how long you've been noticing this muffled hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. Seems like… a while now. Not sudden, you understand. More like it faded in, bit by bit. Maybe a couple of years? Hard to say exactly, I don’t really keep track of things like that anymore. I worked in that shoe factory for… oh, ages, though. Lots of noise in there, always machines hummin’ and clatterin’. Could that have somethin’ to do with it, do you think?
DOCTOR: It certainly could. Prolonged exposure to loud noises is a common cause of hearing loss. We'll need to explore that further. You mentioned it's been a gradual change over the past couple of years. Has it been getting worse recently, or has it been fairly stable?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think it has gotten a bit worse lately, now that you mention it. My granddaughter, bless her heart, she keeps tellin’ me I have the TV up too loud. And sometimes I’m askin’ people to repeat themselves, which I didn’t used to do so much. It’s not every time, mind you, but more often than it used to be. It’s just… harder to catch things, especially when there’s any background noise. Do you understand what I mean? It's like everything is…distant.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. That "distant" feeling is a common description. Okay. And is this muffled hearing in both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s another good question! I think… both, yes. I don’t think it’s worse in one than the other, but I'd have to really concentrate to tell you for sure. They both just feel a bit…full, you know? Like there’s cotton wool in ‘em sometimes. I haven't really paid that close attention, I suppose. I just know things aren’t as crisp as they used to be. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Schneer. You’re describing symptoms very clearly. Now, let's go through a quick review of your general health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but I take a little pill every day for it. Seems to be keepin’ it under control. Aside from that… I don’t really know of anything else. I had a bit of a bad knee for a while, but that's just from old age, I reckon. Nothing the doctor ever worried about too much. I get Medicare, if that helps? I don't go to the doctor much, you know. Just when somethin' really bothers me.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the high blood pressure and that it's controlled with medication. And Medicare is helpful information as well. Alright. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young fella, a long, long time ago. And… oh, I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist fallin’ off a ladder. But that was ages ago too. Besides that… I don’t think so. I’ve been pretty lucky, all in all. I mostly just stayed home, kept busy. Never been one for travelin’ or fancy things.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the appendix removal and wrist fracture. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one for my blood pressure, dear. A little white pill. I take it every mornin’ with my breakfast. And… oh, sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis when my knee's actin' up, but it's just over-the-counter stuff, you know? Nothing the doctor prescribed. Just one of those things from the drugstore. I can’t even remember the name of it right now. It's in a little orange bottle, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just the blood pressure medication regularly, and over-the-counter arthritis relief as needed. That's helpful. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me think. No, I don’t think so. Never had any trouble with allergies, not that I can recall. I eat pretty much anything. Not a picky eater, me. And I haven't ever reacted to any medicines, not that I remember. I'm pretty lucky that way, too. My sister, now she had all sorts of allergies! But me? Nope, never been bothered. Is that alright? Should I have allergies? I get a bit of a sniffle in the winter, but everyone does, don’t they?
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright. It's good to know you don’t have any known allergies. A winter sniffle is perfectly normal. Okay, Mr. Schneer, that gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick examination of your ears, just to get a closer look. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear! Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead. I haven't had my ears looked at in… goodness knows how long. I’m a bit nervous about things goin' in my ears, but I suppose you do this all the time. Just be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. I'll be as gentle as possible. It'll only take a moment. Alright, I've taken a look. I see some wax buildup in both ears, which is common. The ear canals themselves look healthy. The eardrums are a bit dull in color, and I can't see much movement when I puff air in, which is consistent with the muffled hearing you've described. It doesn’t appear to be any fluid behind the eardrums, or any signs of infection.
PATIENT: Oh, wax, is that all? I always thought my ears were a bit full. Dull color, you say? That doesn’t sound good, does it? Is it… serious? I’m a bit worried now, I must confess. I get so flustered easily, you know. Is it somethin’ I need medicine for? Or maybe surgery? I don’t like the sound of surgery…
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Mr. Schneer. The dullness of the eardrum suggests some degree of stiffness, which could be related to the wax buildup, or a slight thickening of the eardrum itself. It's not necessarily serious, but it's something we want to address. Let's start with removing the wax. Often, that can improve hearing significantly. We can try a simple earwax removal procedure here in the clinic. It's a gentle process, and usually well-tolerated. We’ll start with that. If your hearing doesn't improve after the wax removal, we can discuss further testing, like a hearing test, to get a more detailed assessment of your hearing. Surgery is very unlikely at this point, and we'll explore all other options first. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh, wax removal, yes, that sounds much better than surgery! A simple process, you say? Well, alright, dear. Let’s try that, then. As long as it’s gentle. I trust your judgment, you seem to know what you’re doin’. A hearing test afterwards, if needed… that sounds sensible too. I'd rather know what's goin’ on, even if it’s not good news. So, yes, let’s get the wax out, then. What does it involve? Do I need to do anything to prepare? I do get a bit nervous easily, you know. Do I need to lie down? Or will I be sittin’ up?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good idea, Mr. Schneer. I’m glad you’re comfortable with that plan. It's a simple procedure, and you’ll be sitting upright the whole time. I’ll use a special syringe and some warm water to gently flush out the wax. It might feel a little bit of pressure, or a slight tickling sensation, but it shouldn't be painful. I’ll tilt your head slightly to one side, and gently insert a small amount of water into your ear canal. Then, I’ll use a bulb syringe to suction out the wax. We’ll do one ear at a time, and I’ll let you know what I’m doing every step of the way. It usually takes just a few minutes per ear. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Oh, that doesn’t sound too bad. Warm water, you say? That’s good. I don’t like cold water in my ears. And suction? Like a little vacuum cleaner? I suppose that's alright, as long as it's gentle. You'll let me know what you’re doing every step of the way, you said? That’s good. I appreciate that. It's just… I’m a bit sensitive, you see. And I do get flustered easily. No, I don’t think I have any more questions right now. Let’s just… get it over with, then. If it will help my hearin’, of course. I’m ready when you are, dear. Just be gentle, alright? And tell me what you're doin’.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. I will be as gentle as possible, and I’ll explain every step of the process as I go. "Okay, Mr. Schneer, I'm just going to gently tilt your head to the side… now I'm going to warm the water… and now, I'm going to gently irrigate your ear canal with a small amount of water… you might feel a little bit of pressure… and now, I’m using the suction to gently remove the wax… good, I see some wax coming out… " "And now, we’re repeating the process on the other ear… I see a bit more wax on this side… just gently irrigating… and suctioning… " "Alright, Mr. Schneer, that's all done. I've removed the wax from both ears. Let’s see if it's made a difference. Can you hear me clearly now?
PATIENT: Oh, that wasn’t so bad! A little bit of water, a little bit of suction… not too uncomfortable at all. I was worryin’ for nothin’, I reckon. Can I hear you clearly now? Hmm… Let me think. It does seem a bit clearer, yes! Not as muffled as before. Things don’t sound so… distant. It's hard to say for sure, though. My hearin’ hasn’t been the best for a while now, you see. It’s a bit of a relief, though, to be honest. It feels… lighter, somehow. Like there's less cotton wool in my ears. Say somethin’, dear. Say somethin’ quiet. Let’s see if I can hear it. Is that alright? Just test it out, you know. I appreciate you takin’ the time to help me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schneer. I’m glad you’re feeling some improvement already. "Can you hear me now?
PATIENT: Yes! Yes, I can hear you. It’s… clearer. Much clearer. Not as loud as when you speak normally, but I can definitely hear it. It's a bit of a whisper, but I can hear it! Oh, that's wonderful. That's a good sign, isn't it? It seems like the wax was blockin' things up a bit. Is that what happened? Oh, I'm so relieved. What do we do now, dear? Do I need to come back for another visit? Or is that all I needed? I'm feelin' much better already, to be honest. But I don't want it to get worse again, you see. Do you have any advice? Perhaps somethin' to keep the wax from buildin' up again?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a very good sign, Mr. Schneer. Removing the wax has clearly made a difference. It’s common for wax to build up over time, and it sounds like that was the main issue here. I recommend avoiding using cotton swabs in your ears, as they can actually push the wax further in and worsen the blockage. You can use over-the-counter earwax softening drops a couple of times a week to help prevent buildup. I can recommend a specific brand if you’d like. We don't need to do any further testing at this time, but if your hearing gets worse again, or you experience any pain or discomfort in your ears, please come back and see me right away. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Oh, no cotton swabs, you say? I always thought they were good for cleanin' things up! Well, alright, dear, I’ll avoid them. No cotton swabs. And earwax softenin' drops… that sounds sensible. Yes, if you could recommend a specific brand, that would be wonderful. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. You’ve been a wonderful help, Doctor Solero. I feel much better knowin' what's goin’ on, and what to do about it. And I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything so clearly. It's good to have someone to trust, you see. Thank you again for your help, dear. I reckon I'll be on my way now, then. Unless you have somethin’ else for me to do?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I’m glad I could help. I recommend Debrox earwax removal drops. You can find it at most pharmacies. Just follow the instructions on the bottle. No, that’s all for today. Just remember to avoid cotton swabs and use the drops as directed. If you have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Schneer. Have a wonderful day, and take care.
PATIENT: Oh, Debrox, yes, I'll remember that. Thank you, dear. And thank you for your help, Doctor Solero. It was a pleasure meetin' you too. You have a wonderful day as well.
