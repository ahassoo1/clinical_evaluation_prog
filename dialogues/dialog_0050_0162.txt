DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're forty years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, I don't really have time for a whole lot of chit-chat, Doc. It's my stomach. Been feeling… puffy. Bloated, I guess you'd call it. It’s just… uncomfortable. Can we just figure out what’s wrong and get it sorted?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. Though a bit more detail is helpful in determining the cause of discomfort, I understand your desire for efficiency. “Puffy” and “bloated” are rather vague descriptions. Could you tell me when this began?
PATIENT: When did it begin? Honestly, I don’t really remember. A while ago, I guess. Maybe a few weeks? Look, things kinda… blur together, alright? It’s not like it came on suddenly. It just… is. Does that help? I really don't keep track of dates and stuff like that. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: I see. “A few weeks,” then. And has this been constant for those weeks, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Definitely comes and goes. Worse after I eat, usually. Big meals, especially. But even when I eat light… sometimes it's just there. It’s just… annoying, Doc. Really annoying. I just want it gone. Is that too much to ask? I need to get back to work, you know? This is costing me money.
DOCTOR: Understandable, Mr. Kristofik. We will endeavor to be expeditious. You mentioned it’s worse after large meals. Could you describe what you typically eat in a large meal?
PATIENT: What do I eat? Look, I eat normal food. You know, meat, potatoes, vegetables… whatever. I'm not one of those fussy eaters. I like a good steak, a big plate of pasta… sometimes I have a curry. I don't really pay attention to what exactly is in it, Doc. It's food. I eat it. Is this really necessary? I'm telling you, it's just bloating. It’s not like I'm, I don’t know, eating rocks or something.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your… directness, Mr. Kristofik, dietary details are relevant. A broad description is insufficient. Do you consume a lot of dairy?
PATIENT: Dairy? Uh… sometimes. Milk with my cereal, occasionally cheese… I don’t really keep track. Look, I’m a grown man. I eat what I want. I don't sit around counting how much dairy I consume. It’s not like I’m deliberately trying to cause myself problems. Why are you asking me all these… personal questions? It feels like you’re implying something.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Kristofik, I am simply gathering information to arrive at a reasonable diagnosis. It is standard practice. Now, let us move on. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Seriously? Look, I don’t discuss those things with strangers. That’s… inappropriate. And frankly, I'm wasting my time here. I came in for bloating, not a full physical examination. Just tell me what’s causing it and give me something to fix it. This is ridiculous. Is there anything else you need to know that involves questioning my entire life? Because if there isn’t, I’d like to leave. Now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, while I appreciate your… forthrightness, a proper medical evaluation requires a certain level of detail. It is not my intention to pry, but to understand the root cause of your discomfort. However, if you are unwilling to provide further information, my ability to assist you is limited. Before we proceed further, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this bloating?
PATIENT: Look, I’m just… tired, alright? Always tired. And a little… achy. But everyone’s achy, right? It's just… getting old, I guess. I work hard, physical job, pile driving. It takes a toll on the body. It’s probably that. Honestly, Doc, I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill. Just give me something for the bloating and let me go. I've got work to do. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kristofik. Given your… reluctance to provide a comprehensive history, and in the interest of respecting your time, I will proceed based on the limited information you have offered. However, please understand that this diagnosis will be provisional. Based on your description of bloating, fatigue, and generalized aches, and your profession, a reasonable initial consideration is Irritable Bowel Syndrome, potentially exacerbated by physical exertion. I will prescribe you a course of antispasmodics to manage the bloating. However, I strongly recommend a follow-up appointment with a gastroenterologist for a more thorough evaluation, including possible dietary modifications and further testing to rule out other conditions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
