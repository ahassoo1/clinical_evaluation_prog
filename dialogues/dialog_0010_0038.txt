DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buonicon ti. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Honestly, it’s… a bit difficult to explain. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… well, should something happen. I believe it has to do with a form? Advance Directive, perhaps? Or a POLST… I was advised to inquire about one or the other, but the details are… hazy.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is wise to plan ahead. Advance Directives and POLST forms – both are excellent ways to ensure your wishes are respected, should you become unable to communicate them yourself. The Advance Directive is a broader document outlining your overall healthcare preferences, while the POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a more specific medical order. To clarify, has anyone specifically recommended one over the other?
PATIENT: I… believe my solicitor mentioned the POLST form. Something about it being more readily available to emergency services, if I were to be… transported. But frankly, Doctor, I’m not entirely certain why. It was during a rather lengthy discussion about estate planning, and I confess my mind wandered a bit. It all seemed very important at the time, but… the specifics escape me. Is that… helpful? I apologize for my lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Buonicon ti. Estate planning can be… comprehensive. A POLST form is designed to be easily accessible to emergency medical personnel; it’s a medical order reflecting your current wishes regarding treatments like CPR, intubation, and artificial nutrition. Before we focus on forms, let's talk about your wishes. Do you have any strong feelings about life-sustaining treatments in general?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. I suppose… I’ve always valued independence. The thought of being reliant on machines… it doesn’t appeal to me. But I also… I don’t want to rush any decisions. It’s a delicate balance, isn't it? My ex-husband… he required extensive care towards the end. It was… difficult for everyone involved. Perhaps that influences my thinking.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable feeling, Ms. Buonicon ti. It sounds like you’ve given this some thought, and it’s understandable that your experience with your ex-husband has shaped your perspective. It is a delicate balance. To help me understand your wishes better, let's briefly review your current health status. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I have regular check-ups with my general practitioner, Dr. Lee, and she assures me I'm in good health for my age. I may have… slightly elevated cholesterol, but it’s well-managed with diet and exercise. I’m not on any medication regularly, beyond a seasonal allergy tablet in the spring. Though, I do have a rather… persistent lower back pain. It flares up occasionally, but it’s never been serious enough to warrant extensive investigation.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Dr. Lee, excellent. And the allergy tablet, noted. Regarding the lower back pain, how long has it been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It comes and goes, you see. I suppose it started… maybe ten years ago? It’s rarely debilitating, just… uncomfortable. I manage it with gentle stretching and over-the-counter pain relief when necessary. It hasn't interfered with my work, thankfully. I’m an etcher and engraver, so I spend a lot of time seated, which doesn’t help, but it hasn’t prevented me from continuing my craft. Though, I do find it more troublesome after a long day.
DOCTOR: Ten years, intermittent, aggravated by prolonged sitting... that’s useful information. And you manage it effectively with stretching and OTC pain relief. To get a better picture, could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, not stabbing. It radiates from the lower back, sometimes down my left leg, but rarely below the knee. It’s more of a stiffness, really. If I sit for too long without moving, it becomes quite uncomfortable. It eases with gentle movement, though. I suppose… it’s not the sort of pain that demands immediate attention. It’s more of a… constant companion, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: A constant companion, yes, I understand. It sounds like it may be a musculoskeletal issue, possibly related to your work posture. Before we return to the Advance Directive, would you mind if I performed a brief physical exam of your back, just to assess the range of motion and identify any areas of tenderness?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment. If it helps to clarify the situation, please proceed. I do hope it won't be too… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't be, Ms. Buonicon ti. I’ll be gentle. Please lie face down on the examination table for me. Alright, just relaxing your shoulders… good. I’m palpating along your spine… there’s some mild tenderness in the lumbar region, particularly on the left side. Range of motion is slightly restricted, but no acute spasm. Straight leg raise is negative bilaterally, which is good. No neurological deficits detected. Muscle tone appears normal. No signs of radiculopathy. It seems consistent with a chronic lumbar strain. Okay, you can sit up now.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… wasn’t unpleasant, thankfully. Chronic lumbar strain, you say? I suppose that’s… not entirely surprising. I do spend a great deal of time hunched over my work. Perhaps I should invest in a better chair. So, where were we? The Advance Directive, if I recall correctly?
DOCTOR: Yes, the Advance Directive. And a better chair is an excellent idea, Ms. Buonicon ti. Proper ergonomics can make a significant difference. Considering your wish to document your healthcare preferences, and given the information we’ve discussed regarding your overall health and your feelings about life-sustaining treatments, it sounds like a POLST form might be the more appropriate starting point. It allows you to specifically outline what interventions you would – or would not – want in the event you’re unable to communicate your wishes. Would you like me to walk you through an example, or perhaps provide you with some resources to review independently?
PATIENT: Perhaps walking me through an example would be preferable, Doctor. I confess, I find dense medical documents… rather daunting. If you wouldn't mind, that would be most helpful. Though, please do feel free to pause and explain anything I don't understand. I wouldn't want to make any decisions without fully comprehending the implications. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buonicon ti. Absolutely no pressure. That’s precisely why we’re here. Let’s start with the basics. A POLST form is divided into sections addressing different types of interventions. The first section concerns Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, or CPR. This addresses whether or not you want chest compressions and attempts to restart your heart in the event of cardiac arrest. There are three options: full treatment, selective treatment, or do not attempt resuscitation. Full treatment means we’ll attempt everything to restore your heart function. Selective treatment allows for a discussion about the potential benefits and burdens of CPR based on your overall health and prognosis. And do not attempt resuscitation means we’ll focus on comfort measures only. What are your initial thoughts on CPR?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. I’ve always believed in doing everything possible to preserve life. But… I also don’t want to be kept alive artificially, if there’s no real prospect of recovery. My ex-husband underwent CPR… it was… traumatic for everyone involved. He ultimately didn’t recover, and the process… prolonged his suffering. So, perhaps… selective treatment would be the most appropriate option for me? Allowing for a discussion, as you say. I would want to be certain it wouldn't simply prolong the inevitable. Is that… reasonable?
DOCTOR: That is very reasonable, Ms. Buonicon ti. And it sounds like you’ve given this considerable thought, and your experience has understandably influenced your perspective. Selective treatment is a perfectly valid choice, and it’s precisely the option that allows for a nuanced discussion about your wishes, taking into account your overall health and prognosis. In that case, we would document on the form that you want a discussion with your healthcare team before CPR is initiated, so we can assess the potential benefits and burdens in the specific situation. The next section concerns artificial ventilation, or mechanical breathing. It addresses whether or not you want to be placed on a ventilator if you’re unable to breathe on your own. Would you like me to explain the options for that section as well?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. I believe I would prefer to understand all the options before making any decisions. Artificial ventilation… that sounds rather… invasive. What are the possibilities, if you wouldn't mind explaining them to me? I suppose… I would want to avoid prolonged mechanical support, if there’s no realistic chance of recovery. But again, I wouldn't want to be… hasty.
DOCTOR: Certainly. For artificial ventilation, the options are similar: full intervention, selective intervention, or no intervention. Full intervention means we’ll initiate mechanical breathing if necessary. Selective intervention allows for a discussion about the potential benefits and risks, taking into account your overall health and quality of life. And no intervention means we’ll focus on comfort measures and allow your natural breathing pattern to continue. Many people in your situation express concerns about prolonged mechanical ventilation and the potential impact on their quality of life. It can be a very challenging experience, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want to avoid it if there’s no realistic prospect of recovery. So, based on what you’ve told me, would you be inclined towards selective intervention, allowing for a discussion before initiating mechanical breathing?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe selective intervention would be the most appropriate option. I wouldn’t want to rule it out entirely, in case of unforeseen circumstances. But I certainly wouldn’t want to be placed on a ventilator indefinitely, with no hope of improvement. It’s difficult to imagine… being reliant on a machine to breathe. So, yes. Selective intervention. Allowing for a discussion. Is that… adequately documented on the form? I apologize if I’m being… indecisive. It’s just… a lot to consider.
DOCTOR: You’re not being indecisive at all, Ms. Buonicon ti. This is a lot to consider, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want to take your time and make informed decisions. And yes, I’m documenting your preference for selective intervention for artificial ventilation, with a clear indication that you want a discussion before any decisions are made. We’ll also address other interventions on the form, such as artificial nutrition, comfort measures, and your desired location of care. But for now, let’s pause here. We’ve covered the most critical aspects – CPR and artificial ventilation. Are you comfortable with the documentation so far?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe so, Doctor. That sounds… comprehensive. And I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. CPR and artificial ventilation… those were the aspects I was most concerned about. Perhaps we can take a brief recess? I feel a little… overwhelmed. And I would like a moment to collect my thoughts before discussing artificial nutrition and the other interventions. If that’s acceptable.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buonicon ti. That’s perfectly reasonable. It’s important to take your time and process everything. Why don’t you take a few minutes to refresh yourself, and then we can continue the discussion when you’re ready?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your understanding. I’ll just… step outside for a moment to collect my thoughts. I’ll return shortly.
DOCTOR: Welcome back, Ms. Buonicon ti. Are you feeling a little more comfortable?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Doctor. A few moments of fresh air were… beneficial. I feel a little more prepared to continue the discussion. Though, I confess, I still feel a little… apprehensive. I suppose I’m worried about making the wrong decisions. But I understand the importance of documenting my wishes, so I’ll do my best. Where were we? Artificial nutrition, if I recall correctly?
DOCTOR: That’s right, artificial nutrition. This addresses whether or not you want to receive nutrition and hydration through a feeding tube or intravenously if you’re unable to eat or drink on your own. Similar to the other interventions, the options are full treatment, selective treatment, or no treatment. Full treatment means we’ll provide nutrition and hydration as long as medically appropriate. Selective treatment allows for a discussion about the potential benefits and burdens, taking into account your overall health and quality of life. And no treatment means we’ll focus on comfort measures only and allow your natural digestive process to continue. Many people find this aspect particularly challenging, as it touches on fundamental beliefs about life and death. What are your initial thoughts on artificial nutrition?
PATIENT: That is a difficult question, Doctor. I’ve always believed in preserving life, but… I also don’t want to be kept alive artificially, if there’s no real prospect of recovery. If I were unable to eat or drink, and there was no hope of improvement… I don’t believe I would want to be sustained artificially. It seems… undignified. So, perhaps… no treatment would be the most appropriate option for me? Allowing for comfort measures only. Is that… reasonable? I apologize if I’m being… difficult. It’s just… a sensitive topic.
DOCTOR: You are not being difficult at all, Ms. Buonicon ti. Your feelings are perfectly valid, and it’s admirable that you’ve given this so much thought. And yes, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like no treatment would be the most appropriate option, allowing for comfort measures only. I’m documenting your preference for no artificial nutrition, with a clear indication that you want to focus on comfort measures only. That means we’ll prioritize pain management and emotional support, ensuring your comfort and dignity. We still have a few other aspects to address, such as your desired location of care and the designation of a healthcare proxy. But we’re making good progress. Would you like to continue, or would you prefer to take another break?
PATIENT: Let’s continue, Doctor. I suppose it’s best to finish it now, while I’m… relatively composed. Location of care and the healthcare proxy… what does that involve? I believe I have a cousin, Lin, who would be willing to act on my behalf, if necessary. But I’m not certain about the specifics. I suppose I would prefer to remain at home, if possible. But I understand that may not always be feasible. Is that… adequately documented on the form?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can definitely document your preference for remaining at home, if possible. We’ll also include a clause stating that we’ll do everything we can to honor that wish, while acknowledging that it may not always be feasible depending on your medical condition. Now, let’s discuss the designation of a healthcare proxy. This is the person you appoint to make medical decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to do so yourself. They would be responsible for communicating your wishes to the healthcare team and ensuring that your values are respected. Your cousin Lin sounds like an excellent choice. We’ll need her contact information and a signed consent form authorizing her to act on your behalf. Once we have that information, we can finalize the POLST form and ensure that it’s readily accessible to your healthcare team. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… comprehensive. Lin would be an excellent choice. She’s… very level-headed, and she understands my wishes. I’ll provide you with her contact information tomorrow. I don’t have it readily available at the moment. And I’ll ensure she signs the necessary consent form. So, once we have that information, the POLST form will be finalized? And it will be readily accessible to my healthcare team? Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and understanding. This has been… a rather overwhelming experience, but I feel much more prepared now.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buonicon ti. Once we have Lin’s contact information and the signed consent form, the POLST form will be finalized and readily accessible to your healthcare team. We’ll also ensure that it’s included in your medical record and that copies are provided to your primary care physician and any specialists you see. I’m glad I could help, and I commend you for taking the time to document your wishes. It’s a very important step in ensuring that your values are respected, and it provides peace of mind for both you and your loved ones. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to contact my office. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Buonicon ti.
PATIENT: .
