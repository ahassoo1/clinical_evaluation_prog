DOCTOR: Hi Jerrel, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, well, it’s this… shaking. It's mostly in my hands, you see? Makes it hard to… do things. Honestly, I don't have time for this, you know? I got things to do. It started… a while back. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're experiencing shaking in your hands and you'd like to get to the bottom of it quickly. We can definitely do that. “A while back” is a little vague – could you try to pinpoint when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Pinpoint? Goodness gracious, are you a lawyer now? A while is a while! Maybe… six months? Eight? I don't keep calendars for my tremors, Doctor. It just… appeared. It wasn't like a sudden thing, more like it got worse gradually. Look, I used to be able to hold a glass steady, now… well, it's a mess. Honestly, it's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Right, no calendars needed, I just try to get a sense of the timeline. Six to eight months then. And it's gradually worsened, making it difficult to hold things, like a glass. Is the shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I'm… trying to do something. Like, if I'm trying to sign something, or… eat. It's not all the time, thankfully. When I'm just sitting, watching TV, it's usually okay. Though, sometimes it’s just… there. A little flutter. Honestly, I think it's just old age creeping up on me. Is that what this is? Just getting old?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know it's not constant, and seems related to activity. While aging can certainly contribute to some changes, we should rule out other possibilities before assuming that's all it is. To get a better picture, could you tell me if anything specifically seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm… stress, probably. Anything stressful. And… coffee. I used to drink a lot of coffee, you know? Still do, actually. Maybe that’s it? It’s the only thing that gets me going in the mornings. But then it shakes more... a vicious cycle, I tell ya. Is that bad? Should I stop the coffee? I don’t know if I can stop the coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay, so stress and coffee seem to be associated with it getting worse. That's helpful to know. It could definitely be playing a role. We don’t necessarily need to stop the coffee immediately, but it's something to consider. Do you notice the shaking anywhere else besides your hands?
PATIENT: Now you're asking a lot of questions. Somewhere else? I don’t know… I mostly notice it in my hands. Maybe… a little bit in my leg sometimes? A little tremor, like when I'm trying to cross it. But it’s hard to tell if that's just… restless legs or something. Honestly, I’ve always had restless legs. Don’t waste your time on that, it’s probably nothing. Just focus on the hands, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, focusing on the hands then. And just to be thorough – have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? Like, am I falling down or something? No, I’m not falling down. Everything else is… fine. A little stiff sometimes, but who isn’t at my age? Look, I'm a busy man, Doctor. Can we just… get a diagnosis here? I haven’t got all day. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, no falls, just some stiffness. I understand you'd like to get to a diagnosis, and I'm working towards that. To help me, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your reflexes, coordination, and look for any other physical signs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But make it quick. I’ve got a luncheon to get to. Don’t poke around too much, you know? I don’t like being touched. Just… get it over with. Honestly, this is a waste of a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay. I'm observing a tremor in both hands, a little more noticeable on the right side. And your reflexes are a bit diminished in your legs. I'm also going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to get a baseline. Everything sounds clear there. Is there any family history of tremors, Parkinson’s disease, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Parkinson's? Goodness no! No one in my family has anything like that. My father was a strong man, never a wobble in his step. My mother… she had arthritis, maybe. A little stiff, like me. But nothing… shaking. Honestly, we're a very healthy family. Well, were. Before all this… fuss. Is it something contagious? I don't want to get my friends sick. .
DOCTOR: No, this isn’t contagious at all. It’s definitely not something you’ll pass on to your friends. Knowing there's no family history of Parkinson's is helpful. Given your symptoms, the gradual onset, and the impact of stress and caffeine, it's possible this is what's called essential tremor. It’s a common neurological condition that causes shaking, and it’s not usually associated with other serious health problems. However, to be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few blood tests, just to check your thyroid function and rule out any vitamin deficiencies. And I may recommend a consultation with a neurologist. How does that sound?
