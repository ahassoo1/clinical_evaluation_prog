DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit silly, really. I just thought… a nice card would be lovely. You know, one of those "Get Well Soon" ones? My daughter says everyone gets them, and it just… lifts your spirits. I haven’t been ill, not exactly. Just… a bit down, and a card from a doctor would mean something.
DOCTOR: A card, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. Not one of those cheap, store-bought things, mind you. Something… professional. With a nice, handwritten note. It’s just… everyone is so busy these days, you know? A little kindness goes a long way. And a doctor’s card… well, it carries weight. It shows you really care, doesn't it? Not like my niece sending me memes. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, with all due respect, this is a medical practice. I am a physician, not a… card service. I treat illnesses, I don’t dispense morale boosters. Are you experiencing any actual medical symptoms that require my attention?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're being difficult. I didn’t ask you to write a novel! Just a quick "Get Well Soon" and your signature. Honestly, the way doctors are these days. No bedside manner at all. And yes, I suppose I feel a bit…tired. But everyone is tired, aren’t they? It's just...a general feeling. But a card would help. It really would. You’d think after all these years, you’d be willing to do something nice for a patient.
DOCTOR: “Tired” is a remarkably broad symptom, Ms. Micucci. Could you elaborate?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Well, I just… don’t have the energy to elaborate, if you must know. I used to be able to do everything, you understand? Garden, cook, clean… now, I just sit. And stare. And feel… blah. It’s not like a cold, or a flu. It's more... inside. Like all the joy has been…sucked out. And a card from a respected doctor would remind me that people do care. Is that so much to ask? Honestly, it's probably the little things that keep people going these days. Not all these tests and poking.
DOCTOR: Let’s review your medical history. I see no prior records here at this clinic. Have you seen a physician recently?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Not recently. My husband, he always took care of things. Appointments, tests… all of it. He passed last year, you see? And… well, I haven't really gotten around to… establishing a doctor. This is my first time, really. But I thought, a card is a nice start, isn't it? Before all the poking and prodding and… whatever else doctors do. It feels… less intimidating. And, frankly, I’m not good with all the medical jargon. It all goes over my head. A card, though… that’s simple. And thoughtful.
DOCTOR: Very well. Before we discuss cards, Ms. Micucci, I need to understand what you're experiencing. You mentioned fatigue. Is this constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s mostly constant, I suppose. Like a weight. A dull ache, not in my body, but… here. It’s worse in the mornings, naturally. Getting out of bed is a struggle. And then it sort of… lingers all day. Not enough to stop me from doing things, but enough to make me not want to. I just…sit. And stare. It's not like I'm screaming with pain, you understand? It’s just… blah. But a little encouragement, a card, would make the "blah" feel a little less…blahy, wouldn’t it?
DOCTOR: Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… my appetite isn't what it used to be. I used to enjoy cooking, you see. All those spices, the aromas… now, food just… doesn't appeal. And I’m sleeping more, but it’s not restful sleep. I wake up feeling… just as tired as when I went to bed. It's rather frustrating, actually. And I've noticed… well, I'm a bit forgetful these days. Not terribly, mind you. Just… little things. Where I put my glasses, what I was saying… But it’s there. Honestly, a card would be a nice distraction from all of this. Something positive to focus on, wouldn’t it? It wouldn’t fix everything, naturally, but… it’s the thought that counts.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I understand you're feeling unwell and would appreciate a gesture of support. However, my priority is to assess your medical condition. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I think so. My daughter keeps saying my clothes are a bit… loose. I haven't weighed myself, mind you. I don't really pay attention to those things. But yes, I suppose I've lost some weight. It's probably just from not having much appetite, you see? All this… feeling blah, it takes it out of you. It’s rather annoying, actually. And a card… it wouldn’t cause any harm, would it? A little kindness, a little encouragement… It might even give me the energy to want to eat again. Honestly, it’s not a big ask.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Now that's a rather personal question, isn't it? I… well, let’s just say things aren't as regular as they used to be. It’s rather embarrassing to talk about, actually. But… yes. There have been changes. Everything seems to be a bit… off, you see? Which is probably why I'm feeling so blah. Honestly, you’re making me feel even worse now. And all I asked for was a card. A simple, encouraging card. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, these symptoms – fatigue, appetite loss, weight loss, changes in bowel habits – are concerning. I need to rule out any serious underlying medical conditions. I’m going to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a Vitamin D level. Additionally, I want you to schedule a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: A… a colonoscopy? Oh, my goodness. That sounds… dreadful. Blood work, I suppose, is manageable. But a colonoscopy? Are you sure that’s necessary? All this… poking and prodding… Honestly, I just wanted a card! A nice little card with a friendly message. This is all becoming very overwhelming. Can’t we just… try a little encouragement first? Perhaps a referral to a nice tea shop? This is all far too much. I’m starting to feel even worse than when I walked in here.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I understand you’re feeling anxious, but these tests are crucial for determining the cause of your symptoms. We cannot simply “try encouragement” when there may be a serious medical issue at play. The colonoscopy is to rule out any potential colon cancer or other digestive problems. I will provide you with a referral to a gastroenterologist. They will explain the procedure in detail and answer any questions you may have. Now, regarding the blood work, I’ll have the nurse draw some samples. .
