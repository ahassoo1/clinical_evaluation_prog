DOCTOR: Hi Gedalya, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Polczynski. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, but I’ve been feeling weaker, progressively so, over the last few months. And my eyelids… they’re drooping. It’s starting to bother me, and people have mentioned it.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and drooping eyelids… hmm. Progressively getting weaker over a few months, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It started… I suppose it started subtly, just feeling a bit more tired than usual. But it’s gotten to the point where… lifting things is harder, even just holding them for a while. And climbing stairs, definitely climbing stairs. It's… worrying, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. So it’s impacting your daily activities now, like lifting and climbing stairs. And the eyelid drooping… is it worse at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: Yes, it is, actually. It seems… worse in the evenings. In the mornings, it’s not so noticeable, but by the end of the day, they feel quite heavy and droop significantly. I find myself having to… raise my eyebrows to keep them open, if that makes sense. It's a strange sensation.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse in the evenings… that’s helpful. And you're having to consciously lift your eyebrows to keep them open. Hmm. Any other symptoms you've noticed alongside the weakness and eyelid drooping?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I’ve been a bit more blurry-eyed, I suppose. Not drastically, but I’ve noticed I need to blink more to focus sometimes. And… I've been rather tired, even after a full night's sleep. I just figured it was… stress, honestly. But now… I'm not so sure. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some increased blurring and needing to blink more, along with general tiredness even after sleep. Those things can be relevant. Let’s go through some more details. Have you noticed any changes in your vision at all – like double vision, or trouble seeing things in your peripheral vision?
PATIENT: Double vision… no, thankfully not. And my side vision seems… alright, as far as I can tell. It’s not like things are… narrowing, if that makes sense. I can still see everything pretty clearly around the edges, I believe. Though, I haven’t… specifically tested it, I must admit. I’ve just been trying to ignore the whole situation, to be perfectly honest. It’s a bit frightening.
DOCTOR: Okay, no double vision and side vision seems okay. Alright. And have you had any trouble with swallowing, or any changes in your voice?
PATIENT: Swallowing… no, that hasn’t been an issue, no. And my voice… I don’t think so. No one’s mentioned anything, and I haven’t noticed any difference myself. I sing a little, just in the shower, nothing serious, and it sounds the same as always, I suppose. I hadn’t even considered it, actually, until you asked. It’s all rather… unsettling, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Okay, no trouble swallowing and no changes in your voice. Let's talk a little bit about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, no. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. A few colds, the usual things, but nothing serious enough for a diagnosis. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, rubella, but that was… a very long time ago. And no surgeries or anything of that nature. I'm quite a simple case, usually. Well, was a simple case.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know you haven't had any major medical issues or surgeries in the past. What about your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a little more complicated. My father… he passed away a few years ago. Heart problems, mostly. And my mother… she's still alive, thankfully, but she’s got arthritis, quite badly. And my sister… she has something… an autoimmune disorder, I believe. Something to do with her thyroid. It’s… a bit beyond my understanding, to be perfectly honest. I’m not very good with medical details. Would knowing more about those conditions be helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems in your father, arthritis in your mother, and an autoimmune thyroid condition in your sister. Yes, that's helpful information, thank you. We can explore that further if needed. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: I don't take anything regularly, no. Occasionally, if I get a headache, I'll take an ibuprofen, but that’s it. I try to avoid medication whenever possible, to be honest. It’s… not something I’m particularly fond of. And I don’t take any vitamins, supplements, or anything of that nature either. A simple case, still. Or… I was a simple case.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications or supplements. Okay Gedalya, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Please, go ahead. I'm rather at your disposal, Doctor. I’m… hoping you can shed some light on all this. I just want to understand what’s happening, to be honest. I’m a little worried, as you can probably tell.
DOCTOR: Okay. Follow my penlight with your eyes... good. And now look to the left… to the right… Okay, good. Your pupils seem reactive to light, which is good. Now, let's check your eyelid strength. Could you close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. Like this? Is that alright? I can hold them closed for a little while, I suppose. It’s… getting harder to maintain, if I’m honest. Not as easy as it used to be. But I'm doing my best.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There is some weakness there, a noticeable lag when you try to keep them closed. Now, I'm going to check your neck and see if there's any swelling. Could you tilt your head back a little?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. Like this? Is there anything specific you’re looking for? It’s… a little uncomfortable, to be honest. Not painful, just… not particularly pleasant. But I'm happy to cooperate, Doctor. Just let me know if there’s anything I can do.
DOCTOR: I'm feeling for any swelling or tenderness in your neck. It doesn’t seem to be any acute tenderness. Now, can you open your mouth and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Ah. Is that alright? I can try again if you'd like. I’m not a particularly good patient, I’m afraid. Always a bit anxious, always fiddling… I hope I'm not making things difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your throat looks normal. Your uvula is midline and there is no redness in the back of your throat. Finally, let’s just quickly check your strength. Could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Is that alright? I’m trying to… really squeeze, but it’s… not as strong as it used to be, to be honest. It’s… getting harder to grip things, as I mentioned earlier. It feels… weak, as if my hands aren’t listening to my brain. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Okay, Gedalya, based on what you've told me and the brief examination, the weakness and drooping eyelids, along with the tiredness, are concerning. Your pupils and throat seem normal, which rules out some immediate causes. It's difficult to say definitively without further testing, but your symptoms are suggestive of something called Myasthenia Gravis. It’s an autoimmune disorder that affects the muscles, causing weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest. It's not uncommon, and it's treatable. But it requires some blood work and potentially other tests to confirm. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Myasthenia… Gravis? An autoimmune disorder… affecting the muscles? I… I've never heard of it, to be honest. Treatable, you say? What sort of… tests are we talking about? And what does it mean… if it is that? Will I… lose the ability to move? I’m sorry, I’m just… a little overwhelmed. I didn't expect… this. It’s… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: I understand, it is a lot to take in. Myasthenia Gravis affects the communication between your nerves and muscles. It doesn’t mean you’ll lose the ability to move entirely, especially if we catch it early. In many cases, it’s manageable with medication and lifestyle adjustments. The first step is a blood test to look for specific antibodies. We might also recommend a nerve conduction study, which assesses how well your nerves are transmitting signals to your muscles. And potentially, an imaging scan of your chest, as sometimes it’s associated with a problem in the thymus gland. We'll take it one step at a time, Gedalya. I'll order those tests for you, and we'll discuss the results as soon as they come back. In the meantime, try to avoid overexerting yourself, and get plenty of rest. Do you have any immediate questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: A nerve conduction study… does that involve… electricity? I’m not very good with needles or… anything like that. And the thymus… is that serious? I… I suppose avoiding overexertion is manageable. It's the waiting that worries me. Waiting for the results… and then… whatever comes next. Is there… anything I should be preparing for? Any lifestyle changes besides rest that I can make now?
DOCTOR: Yes, the nerve conduction study does involve small electrical impulses, but it’s generally not painful – just a little uncomfortable. It’s like a brief, mild muscle twitch. And the thymus gland – well, it’s part of the immune system, and sometimes in Myasthenia Gravis, it can become enlarged or contribute to the disorder. It’s something we’ll investigate further if the tests suggest it’s necessary. Beyond rest, try to maintain a healthy diet, and avoid medications that can worsen muscle weakness – we’ll give you a list of those to avoid. Also, if you experience any difficulty breathing or swallowing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I understand that waiting is the hardest part. We’ll get the tests done as quickly as possible, and I’ll be available to answer any questions you have along the way. I'll also give you a referral to a neurologist specializing in neuromuscular disorders. It's always good to have a specialist on your team. Would you like me to write down those medications to avoid?
PATIENT: Yes, please, that would be very helpful. A list of medications to avoid… and the neurologist’s contact information, if you have it. It's… comforting to know there’s a team. And that you're there, to explain everything. I really appreciate your patience. I'm… not usually this anxious, honestly. I suppose I should… schedule the tests now? Is there anything I need to do to prepare for them specifically? And… thank you again, Doctor Polczynski. For everything.
DOCTOR: Of course. Here’s a list of medications to avoid. And here's the neurologist's contact information – Dr. Anya Sharma, she's excellent. For the nerve conduction study, you don't need to do anything specific, just avoid applying lotion to your arms and legs on the day of the test. It’s best to wear comfortable clothing. My nurse, Sarah, will schedule those tests for you before you leave. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all, even if it's just to talk. We'll get through this together, Gedalya. I'll also send you a summary of our conversation and the test orders electronically to your email address. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfect. Email is fine. Thank you. Dr. Sharma… I'll look her up. And I appreciate your… kindness, Doctor Polczynski. You’ve really put my mind at ease, even if just a little. I think… I think that’s all for now. I’ll let Sarah schedule the tests, and then… I’ll head home. Thank you again, for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gedalya. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. Sarah will take good care of you. Take it easy, and try not to worry too much. We’ll get a clearer picture soon. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
