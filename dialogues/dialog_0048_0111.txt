DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I’m Dr. Sink. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't the faintest idea why I'm here. My wife insisted. Something about my… complexion, she said. And a bit of tiredness, I suppose. I feel quite alright, all things considered for a man of my age. Let’s get this over with, shall we? I have commitments.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “tiredness” is rather vague, Mr. Drahota. Can you elaborate?
PATIENT: Elaborate? I work, Doctor. Reinforcing iron, heavy lifting, you understand. It’s… taxing. I’ve been doing it for decades. One gets tired. It's not a puzzle to be solved. And this… darkening of the skin. It’s probably just the sun. Though, I do try to be careful. It’s just… there. Is that sufficient? Really, I haven't time for a detailed medical history.
DOCTOR: “Tiredness, related to occupation.” Yes, well, even with occupation, we need to rule things out. And “darkening of the skin” can be many things beyond the sun, Mr. Drahota. Has it been getting worse recently?
PATIENT: Worse? Goodness. I… honestly can’t recall. Everything feels rather… the same lately. A bit of this, a bit of that. My memory isn't what it once was. My wife would have a better grasp of the particulars, I assure you. She worries excessively. Is this going to be a lengthy procedure? I have an appointment with the foreman at three.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just do a quick examination then. I’ll need to check your vital signs and take a look at the skin in question. Please sit back and relax as best you can. And try to recall anything new or unusual, even if it seems minor. It might be helpful. Blood pressure first.
PATIENT: Very well. Get on with it. I trust you are competent. Honestly, the fuss people make over a little tiredness. It’s… rather undignified. And please be quick, Doctor. I dislike having my time wasted.
DOCTOR: 160 over 95. A bit elevated, Mr. Drahota. Nothing alarming, but we'll need to monitor that. Pulse is regular, 78. Now, let’s take a look at this complexion… there's some hyperpigmentation on your forearms and face. It appears somewhat patchy… and there’s a slight roughness to the skin here. Have you noticed any itching or discomfort?
PATIENT: Itching? No, not particularly. A bit dry, perhaps. The weather has been rather… changeable. And what is “hyperpigmentation”? Is that something serious? I knew I shouldn’t have come. My wife and her… anxieties. Honestly, I work with iron, Doctor. My skin is going to be rough. It’s hardly a medical marvel. Just tell me if it’s something that will prevent me from working. That's all I care about.
DOCTOR: “Hyperpigmentation – increased skin pigmentation.” It could be related to your occupation, Mr. Drahota, but it’s important to rule out other possibilities. And, frankly, this pattern isn't entirely consistent with simple sun exposure or iron handling. Have you used any new lotions or soaps recently?
PATIENT: Lotions? Soaps? Good heavens, no. I use the same bar of soap my father used. Simple, practical. My wife occasionally tries to foist some… fragrant concoctions upon me, but I refuse. She means well, but… unnecessary frippery. This is becoming tedious. Are you certain this requires such scrutiny? I've never had any trouble with my skin before. Just tell me if it’s something I need to worry about. Directly. No medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. It’s… unusual. Given your age and occupation, it could be nothing more than long-term sun damage and the effects of your work. However, there are other possibilities that need to be considered. To be safe, I'd like to order a simple blood test. It will check your liver function and rule out any underlying medical conditions. It’s a standard precaution. Do you agree to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Absolutely not. My wife will have a field day with that. "See, I told you something was wrong!" No. I refuse. I've lived a long and productive life without the need for constant prodding and poking. If it doesn’t prevent me from working, I’m not interested. This is a waste of my time, and frankly, a bit insulting. I think I've had enough. Thank you for your time, Doctor, but I'm leaving now. Perhaps a different doctor would be more… accommodating. .
