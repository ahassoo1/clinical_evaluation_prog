DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Dr. Sieh, is it? Well, honestly, I’m not entirely sure why I’m here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Said I should “get checked out.” Something about…being my age? I feel perfectly fine, you know. Just curious, I suppose. It’s not like anything’s wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very common for children to encourage their parents to have regular check-ups, especially as we get older. It's good of your daughter to be so thoughtful. Even if you're feeling well, a check-up can help us identify any potential issues early on. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… hmm. Well, I used to be very active. Loved to garden, you know? But it’s been…years. Since my Harold passed. Now I mostly just…sit. Watch television. Eat what’s easy. I don’t really do much anymore. I suppose that’s not very healthy, is it? And my knees…they bother me sometimes. But what old lady doesn't have bad knees?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Life changes can certainly affect our routines. It's good you're acknowledging those changes. And you’re right, many people experience joint pain as they get older. Let’s talk a little bit more about those knees. When did you start noticing the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I start noticing…? That’s a tricky one. It wasn’t sudden, you see. It sort of…crept up on me. Probably…oh, a good five, maybe ten years ago now? After Harold…well, everything just felt heavier, you know? Not just physically. I think I just started paying more attention to the aches and pains then. They weren’t so bad at first. Just a little stiffness. Now…they complain a bit more. Especially when the weather’s damp.
DOCTOR: I understand. Grief can certainly manifest in physical ways, and it's common for pain to worsen with changes in weather. And just to get a clearer picture, where exactly do you feel the pain in your knees?
PATIENT: Well, it's not in the knee, exactly. It’s…around it. Both sides. And sometimes it’s more in the front, sometimes more in the back. Hard to say. It’s just a general…aching. Like they’re full of sand. And when I try to get up from the sofa, it’s…a bit of a struggle. Not terrible, mind you. Just…not as easy as it used to be. I don’t want to make a fuss, you know?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so open with me, Ms. Calvery. It's good you're describing the pain so clearly. We’re not trying to make a fuss, just gathering information to understand what’s going on. Besides your knees, have you been experiencing any pain in other joints – your hands, wrists, or ankles, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, my hands, yes. Now that you mention it. They’re a bit stiff in the mornings. Especially the knuckles. And sometimes they ache if I’m doing…well, anything. Knitting, mostly. I used to knit sweaters for all the grandchildren, but it’s getting harder and harder. Not terrible, like the knees, but…noticeable. It’s probably just old age, though, isn’t it? Everything creaks and groans when you get to be my age.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re telling me about this. While some joint pain can be a normal part of aging, it's helpful to get a better understanding of what's going on. We’ll explore this further. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in your hands or knees?
PATIENT: Hmm. Swelling… not really. Maybe a little bit in the knuckles sometimes, but I just thought it was part of the…lumpiness, you know? I’ve always had rather knobbly hands. Redness…no, I don’t think so. They don’t look red. I suppose I haven't really been looking, to be honest. I just try to ignore it and get on with things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to try and manage things on your own. Now, let's move on to other areas. Have you been experiencing any fatigue, fever, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fatigue…well, yes, a bit. But who doesn’t feel tired these days? I just chalked it up to getting older, and not sleeping as well. I do find myself napping more, if that’s what you mean. Fever…no, I haven’t felt feverish. And weight loss…no, if anything, I’ve probably gained a few pounds. My daughter keeps telling me I should watch my diet.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It’s helpful to have a clearer picture of your overall health. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like arthritis, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… Harold always handled all the doctor’s appointments, you see. I just went when he told me to. High blood pressure… I think the doctor mentioned something about that once, years ago. But he put me on a little pill, and I took it, and that was that. I don’t even remember what it was called. Arthritis…no, I don’t think so. My mother had something with her hands, terribly gnarled they were, but I don’t think I have that. Everything’s a bit of a blur, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s alright. We can try to piece things together. Do you happen to know the name of that blood pressure medication, or at least what it looked like?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I wouldn’t have the faintest idea. It was a little white pill, I think. Or maybe it was pink. They all look the same to me. Honestly, I just took whatever the doctor gave me and didn’t ask questions. Harold always said I worried too much. He handled all the important things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can look into your medication history through the clinic's records. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… not that I know of. I eat everything. Harold always said I had a cast iron stomach. I do get a little sniffly when the pollen is bad in the spring, but that’s just a normal spring cold, I think. Nothing serious. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication, as far as I can remember.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… just that little white pill for my blood pressure, I suppose. And sometimes I take a little something for my knees, when they’re really bothering me. It’s over-the-counter, you know? Ibuprofen, I think. Or naproxen. Something like that. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take a little bit of… well, my daughter calls it a “sleep aid.” A little purple pill. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. We'll make a note of those. And just to be thorough, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Surgeries… let me see. Oh! Yes, I had my gallbladder out, years ago. A long time ago. I don't even remember exactly when. And… I think I had a hysterectomy too, but that was a very long time ago, before I met Harold. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, thinking about your family…are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a tricky one. My mother… she had something with her hands, terribly gnarled they were. Rheumatism, I think my daughter said. And my father… well, he just sort of… faded away. Something with his heart, I think. He wasn't a very healthy man. Harold’s mother… she had diabetes, I believe. But other than that… not really. We weren't a very sickly family, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, it’s not very exciting, I’m afraid. I mostly stay at home. Watch television. Read a little. My daughter visits when she can, which is nice. I don’t really do much anymore, like I said. Used to love gardening, but my knees… well, you know. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. It's a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Calvery, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. That gives me a good overall picture of your health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees and hands. It won’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, dear. I trust your judgment. It’s probably a good idea, you know. Just to make sure everything’s… as good as it can be. My daughter would be very pleased. Go ahead, then.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Calvery, just breathe normally for me. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily concerning, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. As we discussed, you were taking medication for this previously. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Could you please bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, my knees… There we go. A little stiff, you know? Not as flexible as they used to be. There's a bit of creaking and groaning, I'm afraid. And a little bit of swelling, I suppose. Not much, but it's there.
DOCTOR: I do notice some mild swelling and crepitus in both knees, as you mentioned. There’s some tenderness when I press here on the inner side of the knee. Now, let's take a look at your hands. I see some mild swelling in the knuckles, and a little bit of redness. Do you feel any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, a little bit. Not terrible, but… a bit of a twinge. Especially in this knuckle. It’s just a bit stiff, you know? Like they haven't been used properly. It's probably just old age, dear. I used to knit a lot, but it's getting harder and harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Calvery. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me, and from the exam, it sounds like you may have some osteoarthritis in both your knees and hands. The stiffness, pain, swelling, and crepitus are all consistent with that diagnosis. The slight murmur I heard on your heart and your elevated blood pressure are things we’ll need to monitor as well. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Osteo…arthritis? Oh dear. Is that serious? I've heard about arthritis. My mother had something terribly painful with her hands. Will I end up like her? All gnarled and… unable to do anything? And my heart… is something wrong with my heart? I don't want to end up in the hospital. My daughter would worry terribly.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Ms. Calvery. Let’s break it down. Osteoarthritis is a common condition, particularly as we age. It’s essentially wear and tear on the joints. It’s not necessarily serious in the sense that it’s not life-threatening, but it can cause pain and limit your activity. It's different from the arthritis your mother had. There are many different types of arthritis. Yours appears to be related to age and use, and we can manage it. As for your heart, the murmur is mild, and many people have innocent heart murmurs. However, we'll want to keep an eye on your blood pressure and consider an EKG to get a clearer picture of your heart function. I don't expect you'll end up like your mother. With proper management, we can help you maintain your activity level and quality of life. We will not let you deteriorate. Does that ease your worries a little?
PATIENT: A little, yes. A little. It’s just… all this talk of things being wrong. I always thought I was fairly healthy, you know? I don’t smoke, I don’t drink much. I just… watch television and try to stay out of trouble. So… what do I do about this arthritis? Will I have to take more pills? I hate taking pills.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to take more pills, Ms. Calvery. We’ll start with the least invasive measures first. There are many things we can try before resorting to medication. First, let's focus on lifestyle modifications. Losing even a little bit of weight can significantly reduce the stress on your knees. We can talk to a nutritionist about a healthy eating plan. Regular, gentle exercise is also important. We can recommend some low-impact activities like walking, swimming, or water aerobics. Physical therapy can also be very helpful in strengthening the muscles around your knees and hands. For immediate relief, we can try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as you’ve been doing, but we want to make sure you're not taking them long-term without supervision. We can also consider a topical cream or gel for your hands. If those measures aren't enough, then we can discuss medication options, but that's a step we'll take if necessary. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds manageable, I suppose. Walking, I can do. I used to enjoy a good walk. And I suppose I could lose a little weight. My daughter has been nagging me about that for years. Physical therapy… is that like… exercise? I don’t want to be made to do anything too strenuous. My knees aren't what they used to be. And I definitely don’t want to take more pills. A nutritionist… that sounds expensive. I’m on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost of a nutritionist, Ms. Calvery. Let me see if we have any resources available through the clinic or through Medicare that could help cover the cost. We can explore those options together. As for physical therapy, it’s not about pushing yourself to your limit. It’s about learning exercises that will strengthen your muscles and improve your range of motion. The therapist will tailor the program to your individual needs and abilities. We will not push you to do anything you're not comfortable with. We’ll start with gentle exercises and gradually increase the intensity as you get stronger. The goal is to help you manage your pain and improve your quality of life, not to cause you any discomfort. For now, let's focus on lifestyle changes and see how you respond. I'm going to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health and to rule out any other potential problems. I’m also going to order an EKG to evaluate your heart function. Would you like a referral to a physical therapist and a nutritionist?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A referral… yes, I suppose so. But just a gentle one, mind you. I don’t want any strenuous exercise. And if the nutritionist is too expensive, we'll have to forget about that. I can try to eat a little healthier on my own. Blood work and an EKG… that sounds… thorough. Is it going to be painful? I hate needles. And how long will it take to get the results? My daughter is always asking questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Ms. Calvery. The blood work is fairly routine. It will involve a small prick in your arm, but it's usually over very quickly. We'll use a small needle and a gentle technique. The EKG is completely painless. It involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart's electrical activity. It doesn't involve any needles at all. The results will usually be available in a few days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan tailored to your individual needs. I will also give you a handout with information about osteoarthritis and some exercises you can start doing at home. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly, dear. I appreciate your patience. I worry easily, you know. My daughter says I’m a hypochondriac. Thank you for not dismissing me as an old woman rambling.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Calvery. It’s my job to listen to your concerns and provide you with the best possible care. It's perfectly normal to worry, especially when dealing with health issues. You're not rambling at all. We'll take things one step at a time and work together to improve your health and well-being. Here are the referrals to the physical therapist and nutritionist, and the handout about osteoarthritis. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’ll see you then. Have a good day, Ms. Calvery.
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. You too.
