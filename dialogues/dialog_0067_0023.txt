DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my chest hurts. Not all the time, but… sometimes. It’s in my breast.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. That’s certainly something we want to look into. When you say “sometimes,” can you tell me more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s hard to say exactly. Not after… working hard. Not like that. More… just happens. Maybe a few days a week? Sometimes not for a whole week. It’s not… a bad pain, but it’s… there. It’s like… a dull ache, I think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A dull ache that comes and goes a few times a week. Is it in one specific spot, or does it radiate anywhere – like your arm, neck, or back?
PATIENT: Just… in the breast. Not my arm. Not my neck. Just… here. It’s… mostly on this side. Not the other one.
DOCTOR: Okay, primarily on the left side of your chest. And to clarify, when you say "breast", are you referring to the area where pectoral muscle is, or are you feeling this pain in the nipple or surrounding tissue?
PATIENT: Oh… um… good question. I don’t know about… muscle. It’s… not the nipple. It’s… under the skin, I think. Maybe a little bit… around the nipple, but not on it. Does that… help? I'm not good with… body parts.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bulaong. You don’t need to be an expert in anatomy. So, it sounds like the pain is more in the tissue under the skin, and somewhat around the nipple area on your left side. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, even if it’s not consistent?
PATIENT: No… not really. I work on roofs, so… sometimes I bump around. But it doesn't feel like a bump pain. And it’s not… after I eat something. Or… anything like that. Just… happens. Like I said. It’s not a… big pain, so I didn't… come sooner.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re coming in now to get it checked out. Even if it's not severe, we want to figure out what's causing it. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like heart problems, lung issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I… don’t really go to the doctor. Except… maybe when I break something when I was little. But I don’t remember. My wife… she says I should come more often. I don't have any… papers or anything. Just… healthy, I think. Well, except for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses, and you generally consider yourself healthy. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never. No surgeries. Nothing like that. I'm… a simple man.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Um… my mom… she had… something with her stomach, a long time ago. I don't know what it was. And my dad… he was okay. Always working. No… I don't think anyone in my family had… this kind of pain. My wife… she's healthy too. Very healthy. She worries a lot, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had a stomach issue, but you’re unsure of the details, and your father and wife are generally healthy. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I can eat anything. No problems there. And… no allergies to medicine. I've… taken pain pills before, after I hurt my back. No bad reaction.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… water. And… sometimes coffee, when I’m very tired. That’s it. My wife tries to get me to take vitamins, but I forget.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. No smoking. No drinking. No… those things. Never. I work too hard to do those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, one last question. Are you experiencing any other symptoms at all, like shortness of breath, fever, weight loss, or fatigue?
PATIENT: No. No fever. No… losing weight. I eat a lot. Always hungry after working. No… I'm not more tired than usual. Just… this pain. That’s it. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bulaong. Thank you for answering those questions. It sounds like you've been generally healthy, and this chest pain is a new concern. Now, I'd like to do a physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently feel around the area where you're experiencing the pain to see if I can identify anything specific. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Great. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Okay, your heart sounds good. No irregularities that I can hear. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I don't hear any wheezing, crackles, or diminished breath sounds. There is some tenderness when I press here on your left chest, which is where you mentioned the pain. But I don't feel any lumps or anything concerning. Your lymph nodes don't feel swollen. So, based on the exam, there's localized tenderness, but no other obvious findings. It's difficult to say what's causing the pain without further investigation. Because you don't have a significant medical history, and your exam is relatively normal, I'm not immediately concerned about anything serious. However, we should rule out a few possibilities. I'm thinking we could start with a chest X-ray, just to make sure there's nothing going on in your lungs. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A chest… picture? Yes. That’s okay. If you think it’s good, then I want to do it. I trust you, Doctor. I just want to know what’s wrong. It’s… worrying me a little bit.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s always worrying when something new is happening. A chest X-ray is a quick and painless test, and it will give us a good look at your lungs and heart. Okay, I'm going to send an order to radiology. The technician will call you to schedule the X-ray. It's usually done right here in the clinic. Once we have the results, we'll review them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if your pain gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like shortness of breath, fever, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes. I understand. Emergency room… if it gets worse. And wait for the picture. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get those X-ray results back as quickly as possible. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… waiting now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, take care, Mr. Bulaong. And don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns. We'll be in touch as soon as we have those results.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
