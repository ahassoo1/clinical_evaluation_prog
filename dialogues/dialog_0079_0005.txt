DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you too. Well, as I understand it, I’m here to get a check-up so I can move into the Meadowbrook facility. My niece, Sarah, she arranged everything. Wants to be certain I’m fit enough, you see. A good girl, Sarah is.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that here… a pre-admission assessment for Meadowbrook. Very sensible of your niece. Now, to be thorough, let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing another physician regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. For many years, I saw Doctor Albright out at the reservation. A fine man, but he retired last year. Haven’t found anyone to replace him yet, truthfully. Mostly just little things with me, you know? Old age creeping in. Nothing serious. Do you need his records? Sarah might have those, too. She’s very organized.
DOCTOR: Obtaining those records would be helpful, yes. Please have Sarah send them to the clinic's records department – the number is on the paperwork she received. Now, could you tell me about any significant medical problems you have had?
PATIENT: Significant… well, that's a word. When I was a young man, serving in the army, I took a bit of shrapnel in my leg. It didn’t bother me much over the years, mostly just a little ache when the weather turned cold. And I had the pneumonia, oh, must be fifteen years ago now? Spent a week in the hospital for that. Other than that… I’ve been a lucky man, I suppose. Never broken a bone, never had anything truly serious. Mostly just the aches and pains of getting old.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently experiencing any pain, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a little. Mostly in my knees, as I said. Makes getting around a bit harder, but I manage. And my back… sometimes it’s stiff in the mornings. Nothing that a little moving about doesn't help. It's just… old age. I don't expect to be running marathons at my age!
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any difficulty with breathing, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not a bit. I used to spend a lot of time outdoors, you see. Walking, hunting… good lungs, I always had. I can still take a deep breath just fine. Not short of wind at all. Though I don’t get out as much these days. It’s the walking to the outdoors that's the problem, not the breathing once I get there.
DOCTOR: Very well. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just a little something for my blood pressure. A small white pill, once a day. Doctor Albright prescribed it years ago. I believe it's… lisinopril. And sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, you see. But not every day, just when I need it. Sarah keeps track of it all, mostly. She’s very good with those sorts of things.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat most things, thankfully. I enjoy a good piece of Sarah’s apple pie, when she makes it. Never had any trouble with pollen or dust or anything like that, either. A pretty simple man, I am. Don't have much that bothers me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Just to get a baseline, you understand. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your joints. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand. I don't mind at all. Whatever you need to do. I'm a patient man. Go right ahead, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Very good. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. Blood pressure is 148 over 82. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though breath sounds are a little faint. Knees exhibit mild crepitus and slight tenderness to palpation bilaterally. Range of motion is limited, but not severely. Now, could you please tell me if you have any problems with your memory, or any difficulty with your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, my memory… Well, I’m eighty-one years old, Doctor. Things aren’t as sharp as they used to be, I suppose. I forget where I put my glasses sometimes, but nothing serious. Sarah helps me keep track of appointments, mostly. Vision is alright, I think. A little blurry around the edges, but I can see well enough to read the newspaper. And my hearing… I have to ask people to speak up sometimes, but it’s not terrible. It’s just… the natural course of things, you see. A little slower, a little quieter. Nothing that gets in the way too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are there any changes in your bowel or bladder habits that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, now, that’s a bit of a personal question, Doctor. Let’s just say things aren’t as regular as they used to be. A bit slower, a bit more…effortful, if you understand what I mean. And I have to get up a little more often at night. Just part of getting old, I suppose. Sarah worries about it, but I assure her it’s nothing to be concerned about. It’s just… a normal part of life.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Tkac. Based on this brief examination and your history, you appear to be in reasonably stable condition for a man of your age. However, I do recommend further investigation into your bladder habits. I’m going to order a urinalysis and a basic metabolic panel to assess kidney function. I also want you to have a prostate-specific antigen test, just to rule out any potential issues. I would also like to refer you to a geriatric specialist for a more comprehensive assessment of your overall health and mobility. Does this sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I suppose it's best to be certain. Sarah would want me to be certain. A urinalysis, a panel, and… a specialist, you say? Very well. Yes, that sounds agreeable. If that’s what you recommend. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know what I need to do. And perhaps you could explain all this to Sarah, too? She worries so. She'll want to know the details.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will arrange for the lab tests to be done this afternoon. The results should be available in a few days. As for the referral, I will have my nurse provide you with the contact information for Dr. Emily Carter, a highly respected geriatric specialist in the area. Here are the requisitions for the lab tests, and this is the referral information for Dr. Carter. Please schedule an appointment with her as soon as possible. Now, I will write up a summary of our conversation and send it to your primary care physician, and, as you requested, to Sarah. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very thoughtful of you, Doctor. To send it to Sarah, too. She appreciates that. Let me see… Dr. Carter… yes. I’ll have Sarah make the appointment. She’s good at that sort of thing. No, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve answered everything I’ve been wondering about. I suppose I’m just hoping I’m still fit enough to move to Meadowbrook. It would be nice to have a bit of company, you see. And Sarah worries about me being alone. That’s the main thing. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Tkac. I wish you all the best. Should you experience any significant changes in your condition, please do not hesitate to contact the clinic. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and attention. I appreciate it very much. .
