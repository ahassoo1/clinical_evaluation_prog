DOCTOR: Good morning, Keoni. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. Why don't you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Andraca. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot lately. Much more than usual. It’s been quite disruptive, and I was hoping you could help me understand what might be going on. I don’t… I don’t really know where to begin, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Keoni. There’s no need to be embarrassed at all – these things happen, and it’s my job to help figure it out. Frequent urination can be caused by a lot of different things, and we’ll get to the bottom of it. To start, can you tell me a little more about what "a lot" means?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s… difficult to say precisely. I suppose, normally I would go maybe three or four times a day. Now… it feels like every hour or two. Sometimes even more frequently if I’m drinking anything – water, tea, doesn’t seem to matter. It’s just… constant. And at night, too. I’ve had to get up a couple of times, which is very unusual for me. I can’t quite recall when it started, precisely. It feels like it’s been gradually getting worse over the past few weeks, perhaps a month or so. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Keoni. So, an increase in frequency over the past month, happening both during the day and at night, and it doesn't seem to be linked to how much you're drinking. Okay. Are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No… not exactly pain. There’s a little discomfort sometimes, a sort of… pressure, perhaps, when I finish. But not burning, no. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… lingering feeling. And sometimes, when I try to go, it’s…difficult to start. It doesn’t happen every time, but it’s noticeable when it does. I’m afraid I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining perfectly fine, Keoni, don’t worry about it at all. It’s helpful to know about the pressure and the difficulty starting – that gives us some good clues. Now, aside from the increased urination, pressure, and difficulty starting, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been feeling rather tired lately, more so than usual. I chalked it up to the…disruptions at night, honestly. Constantly getting up. And… perhaps a little more thirsty than I normally am. That might just be the weather, though. It’s been quite hot. I don’t think… no, I haven’t noticed anything else particularly. My appetite is normal, no fever, no pain anywhere else. I really can’t think of anything else significant, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and increased thirst along with the other symptoms. That's good information. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, urinary tract infections, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a difficult question. I’ve… not been to the doctor much over the years, if I’m honest. My family wasn’t big on doctors. I think I had a bladder infection once, a long time ago, when I was a teenager, but I don’t recall the details. It wasn’t serious, I just remember feeling unwell for a few days. Other than that… no, I don’t believe I’ve been diagnosed with anything. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I’m divorced, if that’s relevant. Is that helpful? I apologize for being so vague. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Keoni. It's helpful to know you had a bladder infection in the past, and that you haven’t been diagnosed with any chronic conditions. Family history is also important – do you have a family history of diabetes, kidney problems, or any urinary issues?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a tricky one. My mother… she was always rather vague about things. I believe my grandfather, on my mother’s side, had some sort of… illness, something to do with his kidneys, perhaps? He was a fisherman, and I remember my mother saying it was from working so hard. But it was a long time ago, and I don't recall any specifics. As for diabetes… I don’t believe so, not that I’m aware of. My father’s side of the family… I wasn’t very close to them, so I don’t really know much about their medical history. I wish I could be more helpful. It's frustrating not to remember more.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Keoni. You've given me what you know, and that’s what matters. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Definitely not. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I lead a fairly quiet life, honestly. I work as a concierge at the local hotel, and I enjoy gardening in my spare time. I try to eat a healthy diet, although I do have a sweet tooth. I assure you, Doctor, I’m not a complicated case.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Keoni. And you don't sound complicated at all. Okay, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a standard check of your abdomen and a listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I’m quite happy to do whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgment implicitly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could lie back on the examination table, please. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Your heart sounds are regular and lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to press on your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm not feeling any significant tenderness, but I do note your bladder feels slightly full. I'm going to order a urine sample to check for infection or other abnormalities. We'll also do a blood glucose test to rule out diabetes. It would be best to also get a complete metabolic panel, so we have a broad picture of your kidney function. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A urine sample and blood tests… whatever you think is best. I felt a little pressure, but no real pain. It’s just… a bit uncomfortable, perhaps. I understand you need to do a thorough examination, so please don’t hesitate to let me know if you need me to do anything. I’m quite happy to cooperate. Will the blood tests take long? I have work this afternoon, and I don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No significant pain is helpful. The blood tests will take about 10-15 minutes to process, and the urine sample can be collected right now. We can get everything done quickly. The lab technician will come in shortly to draw the blood. While we wait for the results, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to any medications. My mother always said I was very resilient. Although… I did have a reaction to a mosquito bite once, a very bad swelling, but I don’t think that counts as a medication allergy. I’ve never had any problems with penicillin or any other common drugs. I’m not a particularly sensitive person, honestly. I rarely get sick, and I’ve always been quite strong.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Keoni. No known allergies is helpful. Okay, the lab technician is here now. They’ll just need to draw a small sample of blood from your arm. It shouldn't take long at all. After that, we’ll discuss the results and come up with a plan. This is [Technician's Name]. They'll take good care of you.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I trust everything will be alright.
DOCTOR: It will be alright, Keoni. The technician is very skilled. Just relax, and it’ll be over before you know it. I'll be right here. She's all set, [Technician's Name].
PATIENT: It’s alright… it’s alright… just a little prick…
DOCTOR: Alright, Keoni, that’s all done. You did great. Just keep that bandage on for a few hours. Okay… the urine sample shows a slightly elevated white blood cell count. It’s not a definitive diagnosis, but it suggests a possible urinary tract infection. We’ll need to wait for the full culture results to confirm. Based on the preliminary results and your symptoms, I'm leaning towards a possible UTI. To be safe, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of antibiotics. It's important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before you’ve finished all the pills. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A UTI… well, that explains a lot, I suppose. I had a feeling something like that might be the cause. Antibiotics… yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary, then I trust your judgment. I’ve never had to take them before, so I’m a little nervous, but I understand the importance of finishing the entire course. Are there any side effects I should be aware of? And… will this mean I have to take time off work? I really don’t want to fall behind.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It's common to be a little nervous about antibiotics, but they're generally very safe. The most common side effects are mild nausea or diarrhea. If you experience any severe side effects, like a rash, difficulty breathing, or severe abdominal pain, stop taking the medication immediately and contact me. As for work, it depends on how you're feeling. If you're able to stay hydrated and have access to a bathroom, you should be able to continue working. However, it's important to listen to your body and take time off if you need it. We don’t want this to get worse. I’ll prescribe you a 7-day course of [Antibiotic Name]. Take one tablet twice a day with food. I’ll also write you a note for work explaining that you’re being treated for a possible UTI. And please, stay well hydrated. Drink plenty of water. Here's the prescription and the note for your employer. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Seven days… alright. And drink plenty of water. I can do that. Actually… I did read something online about cranberry juice. Does that help at all? Or is that just an old wives’ tale? And… thank you, Doctor. For everything. I feel much better knowing what’s going on, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Keoni. I'm glad I could help. As for cranberry juice… it’s a common question! While it's not a cure for a UTI, it can help prevent bacteria from sticking to the walls of your urinary tract. It’s definitely a reasonable addition to your routine, as long as you don’t have any underlying medical conditions that would make it unsuitable. Just don’t rely on it as your sole treatment. The antibiotics are the most important thing right now. So, to recap: 7-day course of [Antibiotic Name], take one tablet twice a day with food, stay well hydrated, and consider adding cranberry juice to your diet if you wish. If your symptoms don’t improve within a few days, or if they worsen, please contact me immediately. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Seven days of antibiotics, stay hydrated, and maybe some cranberry juice. Thank you again, Doctor Andraca. I really appreciate your kindness and patience. I think I’ll head home now and get started on the antibiotics. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Keoni. It was a pleasure meeting you. Get some rest, stay hydrated, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns. Have a good day as well, and feel better soon. .
