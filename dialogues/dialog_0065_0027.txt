DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's get right to it. It's this... stuff. Coming back up. Food, you know? It's unpleasant. Been happening for a few weeks now, maybe longer, honestly can't say for sure. Just... bothersome.
DOCTOR: Right. “This stuff coming back up,” as you put it. So, you're experiencing regurgitation. For how long, approximately, have you been noticing this?
PATIENT: Regurgitation? Is that what the young folks are calling it these days? Look, I told you, a few weeks at least. Doesn't matter the name, it's food. And I haven't got time to sit here cataloging the exact date it started. It's been long enough that I decided to finally come in, alright? Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… sufficient. And I assure you, “regurgitation” is standard medical terminology. Now, is this happening after every meal, or just sometimes?
PATIENT: Oh, don't get technical with me. It's... mostly after bigger meals. You know, when I actually eat something substantial. Not just a little snack. Though, even then, sometimes it happens. It’s unpredictable, see? That's what makes it so annoying. And frankly, a bit embarrassing. I don't enjoy talking about this, young lady.
DOCTOR: Understandable. And you mentioned “bigger meals.” Could you describe a typical meal when this is most likely to occur?
PATIENT: Look, I eat like a normal person! Steak, potatoes, sometimes some pierogi if my wife's making them. Regular food. Not this… rabbit food everyone's on about these days. Portion sizes are… reasonable. I'm a big guy, I need to eat. It’s not like I’m stuffing myself, if that's what you're thinking. Just a normal dinner, alright? A good, solid dinner. And then… it comes back up. Honestly, I'm starting to lose my appetite just talking about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when this “comes back up,” is it undigested food?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. It's not like... just liquid, if that makes sense. It's bits of steak, a piece of potato. Sometimes a whole pierogi if I'm unlucky. It's… unpleasant. Really unpleasant. And the taste, don't even get me started on the taste. It’s like re-eating it. And I don’t appreciate re-eating, thank you very much. Is there a point to all these questions, or are we just going to dissect my dinner habits all morning?
DOCTOR: We are gathering information to determine the cause of your symptoms, Mr. Altine. It is relevant. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this regurgitation?
PATIENT: Oh, relevant, is it? Well, I’ve got a bit of heartburn sometimes. Not all the time, just… occasionally. Mostly after these meals too, naturally. And I wouldn't say it's pain, exactly, but... discomfort. A burning sensation. Is that what you want to know? Look, I'm not a doctor, I just tell you what happens. It's not like I'm keeping a detailed log of my bodily functions. I’ve got better things to do. Can we wrap this up soon? My wife is expecting me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this heartburn relieved by anything?
PATIENT: Relieved? Sometimes. I take those little tablets… you know, the ones you get at the drugstore. Tums, I think they’re called. They help a bit, but not always. Honestly, it feels like I’m just masking the problem, not fixing it. And frankly, I shouldn’t need to be taking tablets every time I have a decent meal. That's not right, is it? It feels… temporary. Like putting a band-aid on a broken leg. Is that a good analogy? Look, I'm just trying to be helpful here. Are we getting somewhere?
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, I've reviewed your file and see you have a history of hypertension, managed with medication. Do you experience any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Hypertension? That was years ago! Doctor's always going on about something. And no, I don't have any trouble swallowing. The food goes down alright. It's what happens after that's the problem. It just... decides to come back up for a second visit, uninvited. It’s not like it’s getting stuck, if that's what you’re implying. Honestly, I feel like I'm being interrogated here. Can we please just get to the bottom of this? My wife made a roast. It’s probably getting cold.
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, I am attempting to gather a complete history to provide you with the best possible care. It is essential to understand all aspects of your symptoms. Now, I’m going to need to perform a physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? After all this questioning? Look, I don't like being poked and prodded. I'm a perfectly healthy man, except for this… regurgitation. Honestly, I’m not sure I’m comfortable with this. Can't you just prescribe me something? Something to stop this whole mess? I've got things to do. A roast to eat, for crying out loud. I'm telling you, this whole thing is unnecessary. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, without a physical examination and potentially some further testing, it would be irresponsible of me to prescribe medication. I understand your frustration, but I need to rule out any serious underlying conditions. However, if you are unwilling to cooperate with a basic examination, I suggest you seek a second opinion. I cannot provide you with adequate care under these circumstances.
