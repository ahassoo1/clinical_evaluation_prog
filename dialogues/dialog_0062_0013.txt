DOCTOR: Hi Dondre, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seein’ me. Well, it’s… it’s my waterin’. I’m havin’ trouble gettin’ it all out, you see. It just… stays in there. It’s uncomfortable, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing difficulty fully emptying your bladder, and it's causing you some discomfort. Can you tell me a little more about that discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. That’s right. Discomfort… it’s not pain, exactly. More like… a fullness. A heavy feelin’. And sometimes, after I do get some out, it feels like there's still more left. Like a balloon that didn’t quite deflate all the way. It bothers me at night, mostly. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes, gotta get up to try again.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fullness and the sensation of not completely emptying, especially at night. That’s helpful. About how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six, seven months ago? It was just now and then at first. I thought it was just gettin’ old, you know? But it’s been happenin’ more and more lately. The last couple of months, it's been pretty regular. I ain’t been sleepin’ good for a while now.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s been gradually worsening over the past six to seven months, and it’s definitely more frequent in the last couple of months, affecting your sleep. Have you noticed any changes in how you urinate – like straining, a weak stream, or difficulty starting?
PATIENT: Yes. Sometimes it takes a little bit to… get it goin’. Like it needs a push, you know? And the stream… it ain't as strong as it used to be. Not a powerful push like before. I don’t really strain, no, but I do gotta… wait a bit. It's not sudden like it once was. Just takes a moment. And I gotta go more often during the day, too, I suppose. Not a lot more, but… more than I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a delay in starting, a weaker stream, and increased frequency. Have you noticed any fever, chills, pain in your back or side, or blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. No fever. No chills. My back’s been achin’ a bit, but that’s just my age, I reckon. Old work injury. And no blood, no. Just… the waterin’ trouble. It just feels… incomplete, like I said. It’s a worry, that's for sure. I don’t like feelin’ like somethin’ ain’t right.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, chills, or blood in the urine, and the back pain is likely related to an old injury. That’s good information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well… let me see. I had some high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said I got it under control with pills. I stopped takin’ ‘em a while ago, though. He said I was doin’ okay. Other than that… nothin’ really. Just the old work injury, and… arthritis in my hands. That’s about it. I get Medicare now, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure that’s currently managed without medication, an old work injury, and arthritis. And you’re covered by Medicare – good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was a long time ago. And I was in the hospital once for that work injury, when it first happened. Tore somethin' in my back, they fixed it up. Other than that, no. Never been a sickly man, really. Mostly just… gettin’ old now, I suppose. It takes longer to heal, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in the past and hospitalization for your work injury. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. I take somethin’ for my arthritis, a little white pill, can’t remember the name of it right now. And I take a multivitamin every day, just somethin’ to keep me goin’. That's about it, really. I try not to take too many pills, if I can help it. Don’t like feelin’ all loaded up with somethin’ I don’t need.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for arthritis and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I eat just about anythin’ and haven't had trouble. And I’ve been around pollen all my life, livin’ in Alaska, and never had a problem with that neither. I don’t really have allergies, no. Lucky that way, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she smoked for a bit, but she quit years ago. Said it weren’t good for her. I always stayed away from it. Just never had the urge, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a little bit sometimes. A beer with dinner now and then, or a glass of wine on a special occasion. Not much, though. Not a drinker, really. Never really got into it. Used to have a little bit with my wife, but... well, she’s gone now. So, it ain’t somethin' I do much anymore.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife. That must be difficult. Okay, so minimal alcohol consumption. Now, just one last question about your social history. What do you do for work, and are you physically active?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It's been a few years now. I work at the shoe factory, operatin’ the machines. Been doin’ it for a long time. It’s not too hard on the body, mostly standin’ and watchin’. And… I try to stay active. I go for walks when the weather is nice. And I do a little bit of fishin' in the summer. Helps keep me goin', I reckon. Not as much as I used to, but I try.
DOCTOR: Okay, you work at the shoe factory, and you try to stay active with walking and fishing. That's good to hear. Alright, Dondre, that gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable. I ain't as spry as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… Good. Everything sounds clear. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, ma’am, not really. Just feels… normal, I suppose. A little bit soft, maybe, but nothin' painful. It feels like my belly, you know? I've had a few bumps and bruises over the years, but nothin’ special right now. Just a little bit… full, maybe, like I said before. But nothin' hurts when you push on it.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm also going to check your prostate. This involves a brief digital rectal exam. It’s important to assess the size and consistency of your prostate, and it will help me understand what might be causing your urinary symptoms. It’s a standard procedure, but I understand it can be uncomfortable. Please let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Oh. That… that doesn’t sound very pleasant, Doctor. I’ve… I’ve never had that done before. Is it… necessary? I understand it’s important, but… it just sounds a little… invasive. I trust you, of course, but... is there any other way?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Dondre. It isn’t the most comfortable exam, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned. While we can sometimes get clues from other tests, a digital rectal exam is the most reliable way to assess the size and texture of your prostate gland, which is often the source of urinary issues in men. It helps us rule out any concerning abnormalities. However, I completely respect your discomfort. We could start with a urine test to check for infection or other problems, and we can discuss further imaging like an ultrasound if that doesn't provide enough information. That might give us a better picture without resorting to the exam right away. What do you think?
PATIENT: That… that sounds better, Doctor. A urine test first. That I can handle. I appreciate you explainin’ it all to me, and not just… doin’ it. It makes me feel better, knowin’ we got options. A urine test sounds like a good start. Let’s do that first, and see what it says.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dondre. That sounds good. I’ll have my nurse come in to collect a urine sample. She’ll give you a sterile cup and instructions. It’s important to provide a midstream sample for the most accurate results. After that, we’ll send it to the lab, and the results should be back within a few days. While we’re waiting for those results, I also want to note your blood pressure and weight. We’ll need to monitor those as well. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I appreciate you takin’ your time and explainin’ everything. I'm ready when you are. Blood pressure and weight is good, keeps track of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with your weight. Alright, 121 pounds. And now your blood pressure. 145 over 90. That’s a little elevated, Dondre. It's good we're checking this. We’ll want to keep an eye on it, and discuss potential lifestyle changes or medication if it stays consistently high. Now, while we wait for the nurse with the urine cup, let's talk a bit about your current symptoms. Are you experiencing any pain or burning sensation when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. No pain at all. And no burnin’ neither. It’s just… the fullness. And havin’ trouble gettin’ it all out. It’s like it stops before it’s empty. And I gotta go more often, like I said. Not a lot more at a time, just more trips to the bathroom. It’s more of an annoyance, really, than pain. It's just… botherin' me. Especially at night, like you said. Wakin' me up.
DOCTOR: Okay. No pain or burning, just a feeling of incomplete emptying, increased frequency, and nocturnal urination. Do you notice any leakage of urine?
PATIENT: No, ma’am, not at all. No leakin’. It doesn’t just… come out on its own. I just can't get it all out when I go. That's the trouble. It feels like there's always a little bit left. Not a leak, just… retention, I suppose you'd call it. It’s a frustrating feelin'. Always feelin’ like I need to go back.
DOCTOR: Okay. No leakage, just a sensation of retention. Alright, Dondre, based on what you've told me, and given your age, these symptoms could be related to an enlarged prostate, which is common as men get older. The urine test will help us rule out any infection or other causes. If the urine test comes back clear, we may consider further investigation, like a PSA test to assess your risk of prostate cancer, and an ultrasound to get a better image of your bladder and prostate. Do you have any questions about any of this so far?
PATIENT: A PSA test… and an ultrasound? I… I don’t know much about those, Doctor. Is somethin’ wrong? Is it… serious? I mean, you mentioned cancer… and I don’t wanna… I just wanna fix the waterin’ trouble. What does the PSA test tell you, exactly? And what’s the ultrasound like? Is it painful?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask questions, and it's perfectly normal to be anxious when you hear the word "cancer." Let me reassure you that we’re not jumping to any conclusions right now. The PSA test is simply a blood test that measures the level of a protein produced by the prostate gland. A higher level can sometimes indicate the presence of prostate cancer, but it can also be elevated due to other, less serious conditions, like an enlarged prostate or an infection. It's just a screening tool, and if the level is elevated, we would then consider further investigation. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of your bladder and prostate. It’s completely painless, and it doesn’t involve any radiation. A technician will apply a gel to your abdomen and move a probe around to get the images. We’re just gathering information at this stage, Dondre. The goal is to find out what’s causing your urinary symptoms and determine the best course of action. We'll take things one step at a time. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am, that makes more sense. A screener, not a diagnosis. And no pain with the ultrasound. That's good to know. It's just… my wife… she had some trouble with tests a few years back, and it was… not good. So, I get a little nervous when I hear about tests. But I appreciate you explainin' it all so clearly, Doctor. One step at a time. That sounds… manageable. So, first, the urine test, and then we see what that says?
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Dondre. It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling anxious, given your experience. It’s okay to feel that way. And yes, that’s exactly right. First, the urine test. Then we'll review the results together and discuss the next steps. I promise we’ll take things at your pace and make sure you're comfortable every step of the way. I’ll have the nurse come in now to collect a sample. Do you have any questions before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, ma’am, I think that’s all for now. Just the urine test. Thank you for bein’ so patient and explainin’ everything so well, Doctor. It really does help ease my mind. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dondre. That’s good to hear. I'll let the nurse know you’re ready. She’ll be right in. Just let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: .
