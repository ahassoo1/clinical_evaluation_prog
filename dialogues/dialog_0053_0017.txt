DOCTOR: Right, Danny Bartok. 51. Good. Well, Danny, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. That’s right. Fifty-one. The, uh… the paper said somethin’ about a tryout? For a… team? I forget what kinda team. Baseball, maybe? My ex-wife, she signed me up for somethin’. She always liked… pushin’ me. I don’t really remember the details. It’s… for my health, she said. Something like that.
DOCTOR: A tryout. Right. Well, it seems your ex-wife scheduled you for a pre-participation physical as part of this… team arrangement. So, let’s focus on your health, then. Forget the team for a moment. Are you experiencing any specific problems?
PATIENT: Problems? Not… really. I get a little stiff, you know? Mornin’s are hard. And my knees… they make noises. Like old doors. But that’s just gettin’ old, right? Everyone gets stiff. I don’t feel sick. No coughs, no fevers. Just… old. Is that a problem? I don’t understand why they need me to come here if I just feel old.
DOCTOR: "Old" isn't a diagnosis, Danny. And preventative care is important, even if you feel fine. We need to establish a baseline and make sure there isn't anything underlying causing the stiffness and the noises in your knees. It's good you're here. Let's start with this stiffness. Where exactly are you feeling it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Everywhere, I guess. Back mostly. And… my shoulders. I used to be able to lift things, you know? Heavy things. Construction work, I did. Now… not so much. It’s like… when you leave a car sittin’ too long, it gets rusty, right? That’s how my body feels. Not rusty exactly, but… stuck. Does that make sense? I don’t know what kind of answer you’re lookin’ for. It just hurts to move sometimes.
DOCTOR: "Stuck," alright. And how long have you been feeling this "stuckness?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Years, probably. It just… got worse and worse, little by little. I don’t remember when it started exactly. After the divorce, maybe? Things kinda… faded out around then. I was workin’ a lot, didn’t pay much attention to… feelin’ things. She always told me I needed to slow down. She was right about that, I guess. But now she's gone and… well. It’s just been… years. A long time.
DOCTOR: So, it’s a gradual onset, worsening over years, potentially coinciding with a stressful life event. Right. Do you have any pain specifically?
PATIENT: Pain… sometimes. Not all the time. It’s more of a… ache, you know? Like a dull throb. Especially when I try to bend over. Or… lift somethin’. Like I said, I don't lift much anymore. But when I do… oof. Then it hurts. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. And it goes away after a while. It doesn't keep me up at night or nothin'. It's just… there. You know? Is this important? I feel like I'm complainin' about gettin' old.
DOCTOR: “Complaining” is how we gather information, Danny. Now, this ache... where specifically do you feel it?
PATIENT: Uh… lower back, mostly. And sometimes in my hips. When I reach for things, it feels… tight. Like somethin’s pullin’. I don’t know. It's hard to explain. It’s all kinda… mixed up. It’s not like one specific spot. It’s just… there. Like a general… uncomfortableness. It’s why I mostly just sit around now. Less trouble that way. I don’t want to… break somethin’. Or pull somethin’. You know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the back and hips, any problems with your knees?
PATIENT: Oh, the knees. Yes. They… pop. All the time. Especially when I go up stairs. And sometimes they feel… weak. Like they're gonna give out. Not often, but it happens. And… they’re kinda swollen, I think. Not huge, but… puffier than they used to be. My ex-wife, she always said I needed to lose weight for my knees. She was probably right about that too. Everything hurts a little when it rains, I swear. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay. Popping, weakness, swelling… Let’s get a look. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can stand. There we go. Careful now… old bones and all. You want me to just… stand? Or do somethin'? I don't want to fall. This floor looks kinda slippery.
DOCTOR: Just stand for a moment. Let me see how you’re balanced. Now, can you slowly bend over and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oof… There. That’s as far as I go. Hurts a bit, you know? Like somethin’s pullin’ in my back. I haven’t bent over like that in… a long time. This is… not good, is it? Is somethin’ broken? I knew I shouldn’t have tried that.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry, you haven’t broken anything, Danny. Limited range of motion, pain with flexion… Okay, now stand back up slowly. Can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. A few steps. It's… uncomfortable. Feels kinda… shaky. Like I’m gonna fall over. Maybe I should sit down. I get dizzy sometimes when I stand too long. My ex-wife, she said I needed more exercise, but… well. It's hard to exercise when you feel like this. Everything just… creaks. Is this gonna take long? I have an appointment later. I think. Or maybe it was yesterday. I forget things easily, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, sit down, Danny. You’re a little unsteady. Now, let’s take a listen to your heart and lungs, and then we’ll talk about some possible causes for your discomfort. We’ll need some imaging to be certain, but for now, I want to get a better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds good. Sit down. Good. Heart and lungs… Alright. I don’t think there’s much wrong with my heart. I get a little winded sometimes when I climb stairs, but… that’s just gettin’ old, right? You want to hear it beat? It still beats. I think. I forget things easily, you know? And it's hot today. Makes me tired. I hope this doesn't take long. I have an appointment, I think. Or maybe it was yesterday. .
DOCTOR: Yes, I hear your heartbeat. It’s regular, but slightly elevated. Now, take a deep breath… and another… Lungs are clear, but you're breathing is shallow. We'll get those images, and then we'll talk about a plan, Danny. .
