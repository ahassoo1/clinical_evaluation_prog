DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s my back. It’s been really bad lately. Worse than usual. I… I have the cancer, you know? And this pain… it feels different.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you have a history of… malignancy. Different how, Ms. Meigs?
PATIENT: Um… well, it’s not just a dull ache anymore. It’s like… sharp, shooting pains. Down my leg sometimes. And it’s hard to… stand up straight. It hurts even when I’m trying to be careful. Before, it was more just… there. You know? A constant thing. This feels like… something new is happening.
DOCTOR: Shooting pains, you say. And affecting your leg now. Can you pinpoint where in the leg you’re feeling that pain?
PATIENT: Here, Doctor. Down the back of my leg, all the way to my calf. Sometimes my foot feels kinda… tingly, too. Not always, but when the pain is really bad. It makes it hard to walk. I almost fell yesterday getting out of the shower.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long has this new… escalation of pain been occurring?
PATIENT: About… maybe two weeks? It started small, just little twinges. I thought it was just a bad day. But it's been getting worse every day since then. Now it’s almost constant, even when I’m resting. It’s…scary, Doctor. I'm worried it means the cancer is… getting worse.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, pain can be… complex. It doesn't necessarily indicate disease progression. Alright, Ms. Meigs, let’s have you lie down on the examination table. We’ll do a quick neurological assessment and see what we find. Can you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Neurological… you mean like, with my nerves? I…I don’t really have anything else. Just the cancer, and… high blood pressure, the doctor told me a couple years ago. I take a pill for that, every morning. And… oh! I had a really bad flu last winter, but I got over it. That’s about it. I’m not good with remembering… medical stuff.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure. Noted. The medication name, if you recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s a white pill. Small. I… I think it starts with an “A”? Amlodipine? Is that right? My daughter helps me with my pills, sometimes. I forget. She makes sure I take them. I’m sorry, Doctor. I’m not very good at remembering names.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes. Fine. Alright, Ms. Meigs, if you’ll lie face down on the table, please. I need to examine your back. We’ll start with range of motion, then some basic reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. It hurts a little to move, Doctor. Just… be careful, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to feel along your spine to check for tenderness. Let me know if anything is particularly painful. And how about here?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes! That’s… that’s really sore! It feels like a hot poker. Right there, Doctor. And… it makes my leg tingle even more when you press on it. It’s… it’s not just pain, it’s like… electricity shooting down my leg.
DOCTOR: Tenderness with palpation at L5. All right. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your leg. And now the other one.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That one felt… kinda funny. And… it didn’t feel as strong as it usually does. Like… it didn't kick out very much. The other one… felt okay, I think. It’s hard to tell. I’m a little scared, Doctor. What’s happening?
DOCTOR: Reflexes slightly diminished on the left. Well, Ms. Meigs, based on this brief examination, and your history… it is possible you are experiencing radiculopathy. Nerve compression, likely due to… a number of factors. Given your previous cancer diagnosis, we need to rule out metastasis as a cause. I’m ordering an MRI of your lumbar spine. That will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: An MRI? Is that… is that bad, Doctor? Metastasis… is that when the cancer spreads? I… I don’t know anything about MRIs. Will it hurt? And… how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know… what’s going to happen. I'm really worried about my daughter, she's been helping me so much.
DOCTOR: An MRI is a diagnostic imaging scan, Ms. Meigs. It’s painless, but you will need to lie very still for an extended period. It allows us to visualize the structures of your spine. Metastasis, yes, is when the cancer spreads. However, it does not automatically mean that is what's happening. We need the imaging to determine the cause of your symptoms. The results will take approximately 48 to 72 hours. I’ll have the radiology department schedule the appointment for you. In the meantime, I’m prescribing you a short course of muscle relaxants and a mild opioid pain reliever. I would also recommend a consultation with an oncologist as soon as possible. Do you have a primary care physician I can forward the results to?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Yes, I have Dr. Alana Pua. She’s… she’s really good. I’ll… I’ll call her and tell her I’m getting an MRI. And… an oncologist? Is that… someone who specializes in cancer? That sounds… scary. But… okay. If that’s what you think is best. I just want to feel better. And I don't want to worry my daughter anymore.
DOCTOR: Dr. Pua, noted. Yes, an oncologist specializes in cancer treatment. We need to rule out any recurrence or spread before proceeding. Here are your prescriptions and the referral to an oncologist. The radiology department will contact you directly to schedule the MRI. Please follow up with Dr. Pua and the oncologist as soon as possible. Do you have any further questions, Ms. Meigs?
PATIENT: Um… no. I think… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate you taking the time to see me. I’m just… really scared. But I’ll call Dr. Pua and… and schedule the MRI.
DOCTOR: Very well. Try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. .
