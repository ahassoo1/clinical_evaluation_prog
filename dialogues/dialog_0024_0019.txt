DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste time. You’re seventy years old, so I assume something is amiss. Please, tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Seventy… yes, that sounds right. My wife… she wants… a baby. We talk, you know? She very happy idea. I… I just here to make sure… everything okay? It been long time… since babies. I not sure what need check.
DOCTOR: A baby, you say. At your age… and with your wife, I presume, also significantly advanced in years. Right. Well, sir, while I commend your… enthusiasm, there are certain physiological realities we must address. Before we proceed, let’s clarify. You wish to father a child?
PATIENT: Oh. No, no. Not me father. My wife. She… she wants. I just… want to be sure I can… help. Old body… maybe not strong enough? I not sure the words. She very hopeful, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. So, your wife desires to conceive. And you are concerned about your… capacity to assist in that process. I see. Let’s be clear, sir. At your age, the primary concern is not your… “capacity” – though that is, of course, relevant – but rather ensuring a safe and healthy pregnancy for your wife. We must consider her overall health. Now, do you have access to her medical records?
PATIENT: Records… hmm. She has doctor, yes. Dr. Anya… Anya Sharma, I think. Very nice lady. But… I not sure she share records with… with you. She handle everything, you see. I just… I just the support. I not good with papers.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed without them for now, though I strongly suggest she authorize their release. It is, frankly, irresponsible to attempt something like this without a comprehensive understanding of her medical history. Now, Mr. Carlotta, let's start with the basics. Has your wife been experiencing any… difficulties?
PATIENT: Difficulties… hmm. She… she tired sometimes. More than usual. And… she get hot, you know? Little bit of sweating. But she say it just… the weather. We live in city, very warm now. But maybe… maybe it more than weather? I not sure. She not complain much.
DOCTOR: “Tired” and “hot flashes,” you say. While these could be attributed to the weather – as she suggests – they are also common symptoms of… a significant hormonal shift. I’m assuming your wife is… postmenopausal?
PATIENT: Post… what? Hormo… oh dear. She not say much about… body things. We talk about garden, about cooking… not… not those things. I think… I think she stopped… the monthlies… a long time ago. But I not really pay attention. Sorry. I just… I just the support, remember?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, sir, that is… less than ideal. Attempting conception post-menopause is… complex, to say the least. It typically requires hormonal intervention, and carries significant risks. Now, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Has your wife been attempting to conceive for an extended period?
PATIENT: Extended… hmm. Not really. Just… started. Last month. She… she read something in magazine, about… about how people do it now. She very excited. I… I let her. I want her happy. But I worried. Old bodies… not made for this, maybe? Is it… is it safe? For her?
DOCTOR: “Safe” is a relative term, Mr. Carlotta. Given your wife’s age, and the fact that we have no current medical records, I cannot provide a definitive answer. There are risks of miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia… the list is substantial. Before proceeding any further, I require her complete medical history. And frankly, I would strongly advise a thorough cardiac evaluation for both of you. Now, is your wife currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Cardiac… oh dear. No, no cardiac. She healthy. Walks in garden every day. Eats good food. No medications… just vitamins, maybe? For bones, I think. She forgetful, you see. I not always know what she take. She… she very independent. I try not to ask too much. Vitamins… is that bad? Should I find out? I can ask her… but she get angry when I ask about… body things.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Carlotta, with all due respect, this is… deeply concerning. Attempting a pregnancy without knowing your wife's underlying health conditions is reckless. The vitamins are… a minor detail, but indicative of a larger problem. I cannot ethically support this endeavor without a full medical workup. I am going to need her to schedule an appointment with me, alone, so we can discuss her health history in detail. And I insist on a referral to a cardiologist for both of you. If she refuses, I cannot, in good conscience, assist you further. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Alone…? She not like that. She say I always with her. Cardi… oh dear. She scare of doctors. Always has been. Is it… is it very bad if she not go? I just want her happy. She very excited about baby… first grandchild for her sister. I… I don't want to disappoint her. But… I scared too. Old bodies… not made for this, maybe? .
