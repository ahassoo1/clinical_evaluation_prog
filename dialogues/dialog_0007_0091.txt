DOCTOR: Hi Bianca, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez, but please, call me Valerie. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor Valerie. Well, is just… I been drinkin’ a lot of water lately. More than usual. And I feel hungry all the time, even after I eat a good plate of food. Is worryin’ me a little bit, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's definitely something to look into. Increased thirst and hunger can have a few different causes. How long has this been going on – the increased drinking and feeling hungry all the time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think now. Is startin’ maybe… about a month or so ago? At first, I thought is just the heat, you know? Is been real warm this summer. But it didn’t get better when the weather cool down a bit. It just… stay the same. And maybe gettin’ a little worse, if I bein’ honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month, gradually worsening. And you said even after a good meal, you still feel hungry?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A big plate of rice and peas and chicken, and I still feel like I could eat more. My husband, he say I’m eatin’ for two people! Is not a comfortable feelin’, you know? I always feel… empty. And I have to keep sippin’ water all day long. Is disturbin’ my sleep sometimes, havin’ to get up to drink.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. Have you noticed any changes in your weight – either gaining or losing any recently?
PATIENT: That is a good question. I don’t weigh myself often, to be honest. But I think… maybe I lose a little weight? My clothes feel a little looser than before. But I can’t say for sure, I really haven’t been payin’ attention. I just know I feel… lighter, maybe. Is hard to say, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible unintentional weight loss along with the increased thirst and hunger. Have you noticed any changes in how often you're urinating?
PATIENT: Oh yes! Now that you mention it… I been goin’ to the bathroom much more often. Especially at night. I have to get up two, sometimes three times to pee during the night. It’s really tiring, Doctor. And the water… is like, I drink and I drink, and then I have to pee, and then I’m thirsty again. Is a cycle! It's very bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright, so increased thirst, increased hunger, unintentional weight loss, and increased urination, especially at night. Have you experienced any blurry vision or any fatigue, feeling unusually tired?
PATIENT: Hmm… blurry vision, not really. I wear glasses, you know, for readin’, but my vision haven’t change any that I notice. But the tiredness… yes, I have been feelin’ very tired lately. More tired than usual. I used to have plenty energy for gardenin’, but now I get tired just pullin’ a few weeds. Is not good, Doctor. I like to be active.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t been sick with anything. Not a cold, not the flu, nothin’. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat my fruits and vegetables, I don't go out in the cold too much. Is just this thirst and hunger that’s botherin’ me. Is been goin’ on for a while now, and I just wanted to get it check out, to be sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s smart of you to come in. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like high blood pressure or diabetes, for example?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, God rest her soul, she had high blood pressure. But me? I haven’t been diagnosed with anything. I try to stay on top of things, go to the doctor when I need to. I don’t have any other conditions that I know of. I get a check-up every year or so, but the doctor never told me about anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions, mother had high blood pressure. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. I've been blessed with good health, for the most part. Just the usual aches and pains that come with gettin' older, you know? Nothing major that needed a doctor to cut me open. I’m thankful for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my arthritis, Doctor. A tablet every mornin' for the pain in my hands. Is not a strong medicine, just somethin' to help with the stiffness. And sometimes, when I have a headache, I take paracetamol. That's all. Not much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis medication and paracetamol as needed. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I eat all kinds of food, I don’t have any trouble with pollen or dust or nothin’ like that. I'm very lucky in that regard. My husband, he's allergic to shellfish, but me? I can eat anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's all good to know. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll take a look at your hands and feet, and do a quick neurological exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine with me. Whatever you need to do, just let me know. I trust your judgement. I just want to find out what’s causin’ this thirst and hunger. Is worryin’ me, you know? I want to get back to feelin’ like myself again.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which we'll need to monitor. Your pulse and lungs sound good. I noticed some mild swelling in your knuckles, which is likely from the arthritis. Your neurological exam is normal. Now, I’m going to order some blood work and a urine sample to get a better idea of what's going on. The blood work will check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and electrolytes, and the urine sample will check for glucose and infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very good. I'm happy you're doin' all these tests. I trust you to find out what's wrong. Blood work and urine… yes, whatever you need. Just tell me what I have to do. I just want to get this figured out, and get back to feelin’ normal again. Is that somethin’ I have to do before I leave today?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can get the blood work and urine sample done before you leave today. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. It’s best if you can give a “mid-stream” urine sample – that means start urinating, then collect a sample in the cup about halfway through. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh, a mid-stream sample, yes. My daughter, she told me about that once. Is just… let some go first, and then catch it in the cup? Is that right? And how long will it take to get the results, Doctor? I’m hopin’ it ain’t too long. I’m a little anxious, you know?
DOCTOR: That's exactly right. Let some go first, then collect the sample. And I understand your anxiety, Bianca. We usually get the results back within 24-48 hours. The nurse will let you know how to access them online, or we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in person. In the meantime, try to drink your usual amount of water, don’t overdo it, and try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds very good. 24-48 hours… I can wait. And I will try not to worry, I promise. I trust you to take care of me. Thank you for listenin’ to me, and for takin’ the time to figure out what’s wrong. Is a relief just to have someone lookin’ into it. I'll wait for the nurse now, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bianca. That’s what I’m here for. The nurse will be with you shortly. And please, don't hesitate to let us know if you have any questions or concerns before you leave today. We'll get these results back to you as quickly as possible.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I will. Thank you again for everything. I'll be waitin' for the nurse.
