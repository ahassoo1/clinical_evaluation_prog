DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer, so tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. Well, Doctor… Batara, is it? Frankly, it’s rather disruptive. All of it. The… the students. They simply don’t appreciate the order of things anymore. It’s… exhausting, keeping up appearances, you understand. Though I doubt you would. It’s a… a librarian’s burden. A very specific one. I just wish they’d leave the Dewey Decimal System alone.
DOCTOR: Right. Students… and the Dewey Decimal System. I see. So, this isn't a medical issue, per se?
PATIENT: Medical? Good heavens, no. It’s a matter of… professionalism. Lack thereof, mostly. Though I suppose… one gets tired. Very, very tired of explaining things. Simple things! The proper way to handle a first edition, the… the silence required in a proper reading room. It’s… draining. It's all just very… upsetting. I haven’t felt this… flustered in years. And frankly, Doctor, my time is quite valuable.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, with all due respect, you're describing stress and perhaps some emotional fatigue. While I understand it’s upsetting to have your routines disrupted, that doesn’t necessarily indicate a medical problem requiring my attention. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms alongside this… frustration?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Hmm. Let me think… Well, my back aches, of course. Always has. Old injury, you know. From the war. Though that’s hardly… relevant. And I do find myself… less enthusiastic about my morning coffee. It simply doesn't have the same… oomph. And my appetite… it comes and goes. Though, truthfully, the cafeteria food is abominable. Truly. I doubt anyone could enjoy it. Is that what you mean? Physical symptoms?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s what I meant. Back pain, decreased appetite, and changes in your enjoyment of coffee. Now, regarding the back pain – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Mostly goes, thankfully. It flares up if I bend over too much… which is frequently, unfortunately. Students dropping books, you see. A constant hazard. And occasionally, if the air is particularly damp. It’s… a nuisance. Really, a librarian shouldn't have to be bending and stooping. It's undignified. And rather bad for the spine, I imagine. I haven't bothered with a proper doctor for it, though. It's just… an old man thing.
DOCTOR: Right. An “old man thing.” And how long has this been going on – the back pain, I mean?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Decades, I suppose. Since the war, really. A small injury, nothing serious. Though it does… twinge now and again. More recently, perhaps. With all the… upheaval. All the misplaced volumes and the… the general lack of respect. It's… exasperating, frankly. I'm not certain when it began to bother me more, specifically. Everything is rather blurred these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, decades of intermittent back pain, possibly exacerbated by recent stress. And you mentioned a decreased appetite and less enjoyment of coffee. Have you noticed any weight loss recently, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. I haven’t… actively weighed myself recently, no. My wife… my ex-wife, used to be quite insistent on that. A dreadful woman, really. Always fussing. I suppose… my trousers might be a bit looser. Though that could simply be the tailor. He’s gotten rather careless lately, I suspect. I haven’t focused on it, to be honest. There are more important things, you see. Like the proper cataloging of the rare books.
DOCTOR: According to your records, Mr. Schlatterer, you’ve had a noticeable weight loss over the past six months – approximately 15 pounds. You also haven’t had a comprehensive physical exam in over five years. While I appreciate your concerns about the library, these physical changes – the weight loss, decreased appetite, and changes in your back pain – warrant further investigation. I'm concerned about potential underlying causes. We need to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: Serious? Good heavens. I assure you, Doctor, there’s nothing… serious. It’s simply the stress. The students. The… the deterioration of standards. I’m a librarian, not a… a hypochondriac! I haven't the time for tests and prodding and… whatever it is doctors do. Honestly, I just want a bit of peace and quiet and for someone to properly reshelve the philosophy section. Is that too much to ask? I’m wasting my valuable time here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I understand your frustration with the situation at the library. However, dismissing these physical changes as simply "stress" is not responsible medical practice. Weight loss, changes in appetite, and persistent back pain can be symptoms of serious underlying conditions – things like infections, nutritional deficiencies, or even certain types of cancer. I am ethically obligated to investigate these changes, even if you believe they are minor. I recommend a basic blood panel, a chest X-ray, and a stool test to rule out any serious issues. I can also refer you to a specialist if necessary. I am not suggesting you have anything serious, but we need to be thorough. Are you willing to consider these tests?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, for goodness sake. Look, Doctor, I appreciate your… thoroughness, I suppose. But I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. A bit… worn, perhaps. Like a well-loved book. But perfectly functional. I simply need a new assistant. Someone who understands the importance of alphabetical order and the Dewey Decimal System. And possibly a larger budget for rare book acquisitions. No, I will not be having tests. I haven't the time, the energy, or the inclination. I came here to discuss a… professional crisis, not to be subjected to prodding and poking. Honestly, this is quite… ridiculous. I think I’ve wasted enough of both our times. Perhaps a referral to a good… library consultant would be more helpful. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I respect your decision, but I strongly advise you to reconsider. Dismissing these symptoms without investigation could have serious consequences. However, I cannot force you to undergo medical testing. I will document your refusal in your chart. If your symptoms worsen, please consult another physician immediately. I wish you the best in finding a suitable library assistant. And please, try to prioritize your health, even if it means taking a little time away from the Dewey Decimal System. .
