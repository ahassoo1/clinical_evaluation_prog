DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I just need some papers signed, really. Some health forms that need… verifying, I guess you’d say. I don’t really understand all the fuss, but they said I needed to come to a doctor to get it done. I hope this won’t take too long.
DOCTOR: I understand. Forms can be confusing sometimes. No problem at all, we can definitely get those signed. Before we do, though, as your primary care doctor, I do like to get a quick overview of your general health, just to make sure everything is as it should be. It only takes a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I suppose so. As long as it’s quick. I don’t have insurance, so I’m trying to keep costs down, you understand. Just the signing is what I came for, but if you need to ask a few things… alright, go ahead. But please, keep it brief.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Melvenia, and I will absolutely respect your time and concerns about costs. We’ll keep it focused. Let’s start with what’s been going on with your health generally. Have you been feeling well lately?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, at my age, something's always aching, you know? But nothing major. I get tired easier than I used to, and my knees bother me when it rains. But that's just old age, I figure. I haven’t been sick sick, if that makes sense. No fevers or anything. Just…slowed down a bit. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful to know. The slowing down and the knee pain are good things to mention. When you say you get tired easier, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It's just… I used to be able to get up and go all day. Now, I need a nap in the afternoon most days. And even then, I don't feel rested, exactly. It’s like… dragging myself through molasses, you know? Simple things, like gardening, just wear me out now. I used to love gardening. I can't do much of that anymore.
DOCTOR: I see. That sounds frustrating, Melvenia, especially losing enjoyment in something you love. And the feeling of not being fully rested even after a nap is important. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh, sometimes I feel a little… lightheaded when I stand up too fast. Not often, but it happens. And my appetite hasn't been great lately. I used to love a good meal, but now I just don’t feel very hungry. I’ve lost a few pounds, I think, but I haven’t weighed myself recently. Is that useful?
DOCTOR: That is useful, Melvenia. Lightheadedness and decreased appetite are both things we want to note. Now, thinking about your medical history, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had a hysterectomy when I was younger, a long time ago. And I had pneumonia once, but that was years and years ago. Other than that… not really. The doctors always said I was healthy as a horse. A very old horse now, maybe, but healthy nonetheless. I don’t take any regular medications, if that matters. I try to avoid pills as much as possible.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I'm aware of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years for little aches and pains, and never had a reaction. Nothing serious, anyway. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you asking, but are we getting closer to just signing these papers? I really don’t want to cause any trouble or run up a bill I can’t pay. It's just… I need them notarized for something, and I’m trying to get it all done quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Melvenia, and I want to assure you we'll keep costs in mind. Just a few more quick questions, then we can absolutely get to the forms. Have you had any recent changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Well, my eyesight isn't what it used to be, naturally. I wear glasses, as you can see. I got a new prescription last year, but it hasn't really helped much. Everything's a bit blurry, even with them on. And my hearing… well, I have to ask people to repeat themselves sometimes, especially if there’s a lot of noise. But I manage. It’s just getting old, I figure. I don't think it's anything serious. Can we please get to the papers now? I really need to get this done.
DOCTOR: Okay, Melvenia. Before the forms, just one final quick area. Thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my uncle, on my father's side, had something with his heart. He died young, but I don’t know all the details. Other than that… not really. My family was pretty healthy, mostly. Mostly. Look, Doctor, I’m getting a little anxious. This is taking longer than I expected. I really need those papers signed. Are you sure you don’t just need a signature?
DOCTOR: Alright, Melvenia. You are right, let's focus on getting those forms signed. I apologize for the delay and wanting to ask so many questions, but I want to make sure I'm being a thorough doctor. Just so I can document everything, I'm noting your report of fatigue, some lightheadedness, decreased appetite, and some trouble with your vision and hearing. We'll also note the family history of hypertension and heart disease. Now, before I sign, I'd like to quickly check your blood pressure and pulse, just as a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But quick, please. I really don’t want to be here all day. And please, don’t tell me I need any tests. I can’t afford them. Just… blood pressure and pulse, and then the signing, please. Hurry. I have a garden waiting for me, even if I can’t do much in it anymore.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Melvenia. Just a quick check. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. And your pulse is 84, a little irregular. The blood pressure is a little elevated and the irregular pulse is something I want to note. I'm going to document this. Just so you know, this doesn’t mean anything definitive, but it's something we should monitor.
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. What does that mean? Is something wrong? I knew I shouldn't have come. I just wanted a signature! Now you’re telling me something's wrong with my blood pressure and my heart? I don't understand all this medical mumbo jumbo. Just sign the papers, please! I'm starting to feel faint.
DOCTOR: Okay, Melvenia, please try to stay calm. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong, but it’s a little outside of the normal range, and that’s why I want to mention it. Elevated blood pressure and an irregular pulse can be related to stress, dehydration, or a number of other things. It doesn’t automatically mean there's a serious problem. However, given your symptoms – the fatigue, decreased appetite, lightheadedness, and the irregular pulse – I would feel much more comfortable if you allowed me to order a simple EKG and some basic blood work. This will help me rule out any potential issues and give us a clearer picture of your overall health. It would be a basic check just to be safe. It doesn’t mean there’s anything serious, but I want to make sure we’re covering all bases. Here, please drink some water. We can discuss the costs involved and see if there are any programs available to help. But I really do think it's important to get this checked out, even if it's just for peace of mind. Would you be willing to consider it?
PATIENT: No! No tests! I told you, I can’t afford them! And I don't want to know about potential issues! I'm 76 years old, Doctor! Something’s always wrong! I’m tired, I’m a little achy, and my knees bother me when it rains. That’s it! I just need these papers signed so I can get this over with. I’m not sick, I don’t want a diagnosis, and I certainly don’t need an EKG! Are you trying to scare me? Just sign the papers, please. Or I’m leaving. And you won’t get paid, so there! I came here for a simple notary service, and now you’re trying to run up a bill I can’t afford. Just…sign them. Now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Melvenia. I understand your frustration and I respect your wishes. I am truly sorry if I have caused you any anxiety. Given your strong preference, I will sign the forms as requested. However, I must document your declining the recommended EKG and blood work, and I strongly advise you to reconsider if your symptoms worsen. I am documenting your report of fatigue, decreased appetite, lightheadedness, irregular pulse, and vision and hearing difficulties, along with your declining the recommended diagnostic tests. Here are the signed forms. Please, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant worsening of your symptoms, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Just… no. Thank you. I need to go. .
