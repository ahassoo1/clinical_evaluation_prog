DOCTOR: Good morning, Deloris. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it's about this…letter. My daughter, she needs it for her…something. A pet, I think? She just said I needed to come get a letter saying I’m okay with it. You know, confirming I…approve. It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I don’t really keep up with all her…projects.
DOCTOR: Right, a letter of approval… for a pet, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! A pet. She’s…very insistent. I just want to get this over with, if you can just write something saying I'm fine with it. I don’t really understand why a doctor needs to be involved, but…young people these days. Always needing paperwork for everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, well… sometimes these things require a bit of documentation. Just to confirm you’re aware and consenting to her taking on the responsibility. To be thorough, I usually like to just ask a few basic questions. Just to ensure there aren’t any underlying health concerns that might make pet ownership… difficult. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Health concerns? What kind of health concerns? I'm perfectly healthy, thank you very much. A little tired sometimes, but that's it. And frankly, I don't see what my health has to do with a…cat or a dog or whatever it is she wants. This is getting ridiculous. I just need the letter.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Deloris. It’s not to question your health, precisely. It’s more… allergies, perhaps?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, goodness no. Never had allergies in my life. My mother always said strong constitution, you know? We don't get allergies. Seriously, Doctor, are you trying to find a reason not to give me this letter? It's a pet! My daughter wants a pet, and I've agreed. What more do you need?
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all. I just want to be sure we cover all our bases. It’s standard practice. Just a quick review of your medical history… have you been seeing any other doctors recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... I went to see Dr. Adebayo last year for… well, it was just a check-up. A general thing. Honestly, I can't remember exactly what for. Old age, you know? Everything starts to blur together. I don't go to the doctor much. Waste of time, if you ask me. Why would that matter for a…a fluffy animal?
DOCTOR: Okay, a check-up with Dr. Adebayo last year… that’s helpful. And you said no allergies, and generally feeling well, despite being a little tired?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Tired, but that's life, isn't it? Working, you know, even at my age, one gets tired. Just… write the letter, Doctor. I really don't understand what the hold-up is. Is there a form I need to fill out? Or a fee? My daughter didn't mention a fee. This is becoming very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just one more quick question. Do you have any major health concerns that prevent you from physically caring for a pet?
PATIENT: Physically caring for a pet? Doctor, are you implying I'm frail? I can manage perfectly fine, thank you very much. I still go dancing twice a week, you know! I'm not about to collapse from walking a dog. Honestly, this is insulting. I'm a perfectly capable woman. Just give me the letter and let me go. It's a pet.
DOCTOR: Okay, Deloris, I understand your frustration. Let me just document everything... no allergies, generally healthy, occasional tiredness, able to physically care for a pet, seen Dr. Adebayo last year for a check-up… Alright. I’m going to write a brief note confirming your consent for your daughter to obtain a pet, stating that you are aware of the responsibility and have no medical concerns that would prevent you from supporting her in pet ownership. Is that sufficient?
PATIENT: Yes! Finally. That's perfectly sufficient. Just… get it done, please. I have a life, you know? And my daughter is expecting this letter. This whole thing has been… a complete waste of my time. I really don't understand why doctors need to make everything so complicated.
DOCTOR: Here you are. Just sign at the bottom to acknowledge it's accurate. I apologize for the delay, Deloris. Just trying to be thorough. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Fine. Thorough is one word for it. Wasteful is another. Thank you... I suppose. I really must be going now. .
