DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Oh… right. I just moved here, that's why I'm here. Like, for a check-up, I guess? It's… for the insurance. Medicare, I think it is? I don't really… remember everything. It was a lot of forms.
DOCTOR: Certainly. A welcome to the area and a routine check-up, perfectly reasonable. Medicare is straightforward enough, don’t worry about the forms. We'll get everything sorted out. To start with, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Um… general health? Hmm. I work with machines… fixing them. It’s… okay. Lots of standing, and… lifting sometimes. Not too bad, I guess. I mean, I don't feel sick. But I get tired, pretty easy. Is that… normal? I don’t really know what's normal.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Working with machines sounds physically demanding. It’s good you’re aware of your body. Feeling tired easily can be normal, especially with a physically active job, but it's important to explore it a bit further. To get a better understanding, could you describe how long you’ve been feeling this fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time? I dunno. Since… always? Maybe. It’s hard to remember things before… well, before everything. A few months, at least? Maybe longer. It just… comes and goes. Some days I’m okay, some days I just wanna sit down. It’s… kinda annoying, I guess. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Emileigh. And don't worry about explaining things; we’ll work through it together. “Comes and goes” is a very useful description. Just to clarify, when you say “comes and goes,” are there any particular activities or times of day when you notice it’s worse?
PATIENT: Um… yeah. After work, usually. Like, when I get home, I just… crash. I can’t really… do much. And… if I have to lift something really heavy, it gets worse too. Then I just… feel really tired and achy. Not like sick achy, just… tired achy. Does that make sense? My husband says I get grumpy too, but I don't remember that part.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful information. Tired and achy after work and with heavy lifting, and your husband mentions some irritability… that paints a clearer picture. To get a broader understanding, Emileigh, I’d like to ask a few questions about other areas of your health. Have you been experiencing any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Um… no, not that I remember. No fever, no chills… I don't think so. Maybe a little sweaty sometimes, but just… from working hard. And… no weight loss. I think I actually gained a little weight since we moved, but my husband does most of the cooking. I don’t really keep track of that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss. That's good. And your husband handles the cooking, alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or appetite?
PATIENT: Um… bowel habits? Oh… not really. Everything’s… normal, I guess. Regular, like it always is. And my appetite is okay. I eat when I’m hungry. Sometimes I don’t feel like eating much, but that’s probably just because I’m tired. My husband makes really good food, though, so I usually eat. Is that… a helpful answer? I’m not sure what you’re trying to find out.
DOCTOR: That is a very helpful answer, Emileigh. You're doing perfectly fine. I’m just trying to get a complete picture of your overall health. To continue, have you been experiencing any problems with your sleep?
PATIENT: Um… sleep? Yeah. Sometimes. I have trouble… staying asleep. I wake up a lot during the night. And then I just… lay there. Thinking. Or… I don’t know. Just… awake. It’s… annoying. My husband snores, too, so that doesn't help.
DOCTOR: That sounds frustrating. Difficulty staying asleep and your husband's snoring… that can certainly disrupt your rest. Now, Emileigh, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Um… medical conditions? No, not that I remember. I think… I had chickenpox when I was a kid. And… I broke my arm once, when I was little. But nothing… serious. I don't think. My family… we didn’t really go to the doctor much. We just… dealt with things ourselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical conditions, just chickenpox and a broken arm in the past. And your family didn't visit the doctor often. That's helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Um… no. No surgeries. And… no hospital visits. Not that I remember. I mean, maybe when I was a baby, but… I don't remember that. Everything's kinda… fuzzy before… well, before things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations that you recall. We’re gathering a good amount of information. Now, Emileigh, are you currently taking any medications, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… no. Not that I remember. I don't take anything. My husband gives me vitamins sometimes, but… that’s it. Just the vitamins. He says they’re good for me. I think they're orange. I don't really pay attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, just vitamins occasionally. Good to know. Finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors, like pollen or dust?
PATIENT: Um… no. Not that I remember. I don’t think so. I mean, maybe a little bit of dust, but… everyone sneezes when there’s dust, right? Nothing serious. I don't have any bad reactions to anything. At least, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, Emileigh. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your throat and ears. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Um… yeah. Okay. That’s alright. Blood pressure… I think that’s okay. As long as it doesn’t hurt. I’m… a little nervous, but… yeah. Okay.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It won't hurt at all, I promise. Just relax, and I'll explain everything as I go. Your blood pressure is 130/85. That’s slightly elevated, but not concerning at this moment. We can monitor that. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your throat looks clear, and your ears are also clear. Everything seems normal so far. I’m going to feel your abdomen now, just to check for any tenderness. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay… um… that sounds okay. My abdomen? Is that… my stomach?
DOCTOR: Yes, your abdomen is your stomach area. It's just a quick check. Your abdomen feels soft, and there's no tenderness. That's good. Everything feels normal here as well. Alright, Emileigh, the physical exam is complete. Everything seems normal at this point, but your slightly elevated blood pressure and reported fatigue warrant some further investigation. I'd like to order some routine blood work to check your thyroid levels, vitamin D levels, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Um… blood work? Like… needles?
DOCTOR: Yes, it will involve a small blood sample taken with a needle. I understand it can be unsettling, but it's a quick procedure, and the discomfort is minimal. We'll have a phlebotomist—a specially trained professional—draw the blood. They’re very skilled and gentle. It will give us a lot of information about your overall health and help determine the cause of your fatigue and the reason for your slightly elevated blood pressure. Would you like me to explain the blood tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Um… okay. If you think it’s necessary. What kind of things will it… tell you? What’s a “thyroid?” I don’t really understand any of this.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, that’s what I’m here for – to explain things. A thyroid is a small gland in your neck that controls your metabolism—basically how your body uses energy. If it’s not working properly, it can cause fatigue, weight changes, and other symptoms. The blood test will check its function. The complete blood count checks your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can help rule out anemia—a lack of red blood cells—which can also cause fatigue, and check for any signs of infection. And checking your Vitamin D levels can see if a deficiency is contributing to your tiredness. It’s a relatively simple test, and it will give us a better understanding of what's going on. It will take just a few minutes, and we'll get the results back in a few days. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Um… yeah. I think so. So it’s… to see if anything’s missing, or broken, or… not working right? Like… checking the machines, but inside me?
DOCTOR: Exactly! That’s a very good way to put it. Checking the machines, but inside you. It’s to see if anything is out of balance or not functioning as it should. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and create a plan to address any issues. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule the blood work for you?
PATIENT: Um… yeah. Okay. If you think it’s necessary. I just… I don't like needles. But… if it will help me feel better, then… yeah. Okay.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly normal to be nervous about needles. We’ll do everything we can to make the process as comfortable as possible. Alright, I've scheduled you for blood work at the lab across the street tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. They’re very good there, and they're used to dealing with nervous patients. I’ll also give you a lab requisition form—that’s the paper they need to process the tests—and a copy of your insurance information. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don’t think so. You explained everything pretty well. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate it. I'm just… a little worried, but… I guess we’ll see what the tests say.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emileigh. It's perfectly normal to be worried, and we'll take things one step at a time. Remember, we’re here to help you feel better. I’ll see you again after the blood work results are available to discuss them. In the meantime, please try to get some rest and stay hydrated. Here’s your lab requisition form and insurance information. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Emileigh, and I'll see you tomorrow.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You too.
