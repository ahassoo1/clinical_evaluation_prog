DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Puder. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. My heart... it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s beating too fast, but not always. It’s hard to explain. It’s been happening for maybe… a month now?
DOCTOR: Okay, a month of experiencing a fast heartbeat… that’s good information to start with. Can you tell me more about when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… not when I’m doing something hard. Usually when I’m just… sitting. Or maybe after I eat. Not every time after eating, but sometimes. It’s not a pain, just… fast. And a little scary. My wife, she says I look funny when it happens.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it seems to occur at rest or after meals, not necessarily with exertion. And it’s concerning to your wife, which I understand. Does it happen at a specific time of day, or is it random?
PATIENT: Random, I think. Not like… always after breakfast, or before bed. Just… happens. Sometimes in the morning, sometimes at night. It doesn’t last long, maybe a few minutes. Then it goes away. I don’t know if that helps?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. A few minutes at a time, random occurrences… Okay. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger? Like… make it happen for sure? No, not really. I tried to think… sometimes when I'm worried about money, maybe? But not always. And coffee doesn’t seem to do it. I drink coffee every day. I don’t know. It’s just… there. Sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so stress might be a factor, but it's not consistent. And caffeine doesn’t appear to be a trigger. Do you have any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… feel sick? No. Not dizzy, not weak. Just… my heart. Sometimes I feel… a little short of breath, maybe? But not always. Like I can’t get a big breath, but I can still breathe. It’s hard to explain. Not bad, just… different.
DOCTOR: Alright, so occasional shortness of breath alongside the fast heartbeat. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, never. I go to the doctor when I need to, but… nothing like that. I don’t take any medicine. My wife, she has something with her blood, but not me. I don’t think so. Just… this heart thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses or medications. And you’re currently uninsured, correct?
PATIENT: Yes. No insurance. It's… expensive. It is what it is. I hope this isn’t too… bad. I just want to know what's happening.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your overall health. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Puder, if you could just lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this. Just breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your pulse is currently 78, regular rhythm. I’m hearing a normal heart sound, no murmurs or irregularities at this moment. Your lungs are clear. I'm going to palpate your thyroid gland as well. Thyroid feels normal. While the examination doesn’t reveal anything immediately concerning, these symptoms warrant further investigation. I’d like to order an EKG, which is a simple test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It will help rule out any underlying heart conditions. I would also recommend a basic blood panel to check your thyroid function, electrolytes and rule out anemia. Would you be able to afford those tests?
PATIENT: EKG… and blood… how much? I don’t know… I have some money, but not a lot. Is it expensive? My wife, she works hard, but… it’s tight. Maybe we can do one at a time?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. The EKG typically costs around $150 to $200, and the blood panel around $100 to $150. However, since you are uninsured, I can check if the lab offers a discounted rate or a payment plan. We can also prioritize the EKG first, as it’s the more specific test for your symptoms. It's possible we can get more information from that, and then decide if the blood work is absolutely necessary. Let me see what options are available… Okay, it looks like the lab offers a 20% discount for uninsured patients. That brings the EKG down to around $120. We can schedule that for you today, if you’d like. Would that work?
PATIENT: $120… yes. That I can do. Today is okay. If it helps to know what’s wrong… yes. Let’s do the EKG. When do we do it?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab is right down the hall, room 203. They can do it right away. Just tell them Dr. Alzoubi sent you for an EKG. It will take about 15-20 minutes. Once they're done, they will send the results directly to me. I will review them as soon as I receive them and will give you a call with the results, likely tomorrow. Here's a referral note for the lab, just in case. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, dizziness, or severe shortness of breath, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I hope it's nothing serious. I'll go to the lab now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Puder. I hope so too. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns before I call you with the results. And please, if anything changes, go to the emergency room. Take care, and I’ll be in touch tomorrow.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again, Doctor. I will.
