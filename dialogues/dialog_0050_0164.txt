DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggart. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re 51 years of age. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 51, that’s right. Well, it’s a bit strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and I’ve gotten quite yellow – my skin and eyes, you know? It started after I ate some fava beans, which I usually love. It’s just… not normal.
DOCTOR: Interesting. Yellowing of the skin and eyes… that is a rather specific symptom. And it began after consuming fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely after. I had them with dinner a couple of nights ago, and the next day I started feeling weak, and then I noticed the yellowing. It’s gotten a bit worse each day, honestly. I don’t usually have trouble with food, so it’s quite worrying.
DOCTOR: Fava beans… hmm. And you say you’ve not experienced this before, despite consuming them in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I've been eating fava beans for years, since I was a little girl, honestly. My grandmother used to make a wonderful stew with them. This is completely new. I feel silly even mentioning it, but it’s the only thing I can think of that changed before this started happening.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s prudent to consider all possibilities, however improbable. Let's proceed with a thorough history. Now, aside from the fatigue and jaundice – the yellowing – have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, my urine has been quite dark, almost tea-colored. And I’ve felt a little bit nauseous, but not enough to actually be sick. Oh, and I've been a little short of breath when I climb the stairs. It's not a big thing, just… noticeable. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Dark urine and shortness of breath are certainly relevant. Now, regarding your past medical history, Ms. Haggart, do you have any pre-existing conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had chickenpox as a child, and a bad flu a few years ago, but nothing serious. No chronic illnesses, no surgeries, nothing like that. I do take a daily multivitamin, and sometimes I take something for heartburn if I eat spicy food, but that's it.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Hmm. My mother had some problems with her gallbladder when she was older, she needed surgery for it. And my grandfather, on my father's side, he had… well, I don’t really know exactly, but it was something with his blood, a long time ago. Something about not being able to eat certain foods. I was quite young then, and it was never really discussed much. Does that sound helpful? I wish I remembered more.
DOCTOR: Very well. And your social history, Ms. Haggart?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh. Well, I live alone, I’ve been single for many years. I work as a receptionist at a dental office. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I don't travel much, mostly stay around here. And I don’t have any pets. Is there anything specific you need to know? I’m not sure what’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything, which is why this fava bean thing is so strange! I really can't think of anything I'm allergic to.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll palpate your abdomen. I will also examine the sclera of your eyes and look at your skin tone more closely.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. I hope it's not anything too serious. Let me know if I need to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are within normal limits, although slightly rapid. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, but I detect some tenderness in the right upper quadrant. There is no guarding or rebound tenderness. Sclera are markedly icteric—clearly jaundiced. Skin tone is also yellowed, particularly noticeable on the palms and soles. Liver span is slightly enlarged upon percussion. It appears we do have evidence of jaundice, and some tenderness in the right upper quadrant of your abdomen. I suspect a possible issue with your liver or gallbladder, Ms. Haggart. We will need to run some blood tests to confirm this.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? Liver or gallbladder… is it serious? What kind of blood tests? I’m a little scared, to be honest. Will they be painful? I'm not very good with needles…
DOCTOR: Please try to remain calm, Ms. Haggart. It is too early to make any definitive conclusions. A number of conditions can cause these symptoms. We will perform a comprehensive metabolic panel, a liver function test, a complete blood count, and a bilirubin level to assess the function of your liver and rule out other potential causes. The blood draw itself is a minor discomfort, a brief pinch. It is far more important to determine the cause of your symptoms. We will also need to obtain a sample of your urine for analysis. Do you have any questions regarding these procedures?
PATIENT: Okay. A comprehensive panel, liver function, blood count… and urine. That sounds… thorough. No, I don't think so. Just… will the results take long? And will you explain them to me properly? I really don't like being left in the dark, you see.
DOCTOR: The results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. I will thoroughly review them with you and explain them in detail. However, please understand that interpreting medical results can be complex, and further investigations may be required. In the meantime, please remain seated. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect your urine sample. Is there anything else I can address at this moment?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all for now. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’ll just sit here and wait for the nurse. I really hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will be with you again shortly to discuss the next steps once the initial results are available. .
PATIENT: .
