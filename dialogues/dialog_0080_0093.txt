DOCTOR: Hi Chanz, welcome. I’m Dr. Rosanova. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, to be honest, I don’t really remember making an appointment. Someone probably thought it was a good idea. Something about not sleeping well, I guess? And, uh, getting… fitter? It’s all a bit vague. I mostly just fix pianos, you know? Not exactly a physically demanding job. But, yeah, sleep’s been… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright, Chanz. It happens! Sometimes people schedule things and then things get a bit…lost in the shuffle. No worries at all. So, you’re here today because of some trouble sleeping, and maybe to discuss getting a bit fitter?
PATIENT: Right, yeah. That sounds about right. “Trouble sleeping” is a good way to put it. It's not like I toss and turn all night, more like… I just don’t feel rested when I do sleep. And “fitter” is generous. I’m tall, see? All skin and bones, practically. Not exactly what you’d call athletic.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re sleeping a reasonable amount of time, but not waking up feeling refreshed. And you’re generally quite lean, despite being tall. Okay. Let's try to get a bit more specific. When did you first start noticing this lack of restful sleep?
PATIENT: Ugh, specific… that’s the hard part. Honestly? It’s been… a while. Maybe six months? A year? Everything sort of blurs together after… well, never mind. It’s definitely been since… since things got quiet. Before that, I was always busy, always on my feet. Now… not so much. It's just… harder to get going in the mornings. Like I haven’t slept at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months to a year, coinciding with a change in your activity level – that’s helpful. You said things got quieter…can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Right. Well, my wife… she passed away about a year ago. It’s… yeah. Everything just sort of stopped then, you know? The business is still running, people still need pianos fixed, but… it's just me now. Less… incentive to do much else, I guess. Not that I’m complaining, mind you. Just… explaining why things changed. Less going out, less… everything.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear that, Chanz. That's a huge loss, and it's completely understandable that things would change after something like that. It’s perfectly normal to experience changes in sleep and energy levels during times of grief. Let’s talk a little more about the sleep itself. Do you have any trouble falling asleep?
PATIENT: Falling asleep? Not really. I mean, I’m usually pretty tired. It’s staying asleep that’s the issue. I wake up a lot. Not every hour or anything, but… several times a night. And then I just… lie there. Thinking. Or not thinking. Just… awake. It’s frustrating, mostly. And then I feel dreadful the next day. Just… empty.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you fall asleep easily, but have multiple awakenings throughout the night, and then struggle to get back to sleep. And you’re left feeling exhausted and depleted the next day. Do you remember what you’re thinking about when you wake up?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. That’s the weirdest part. It’s not like I’m having nightmares, or worrying about anything specific. Just… awake. And then I’ll try to go back to sleep, and I just… can’t. Sometimes I’ll get up and make some tea, but that doesn’t always help. It’s just… a blankness, mostly. Annoying, more than anything. Like a radio stuck between stations.
DOCTOR: Okay, multiple awakenings, difficulty returning to sleep, and not necessarily tied to specific thoughts or anxieties—that's helpful. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any other changes since your wife passed away?
PATIENT: Changes… Hmm. Well, my appetite isn't what it used to be. I eat, obviously, but I don’t really enjoy it anymore. And I suppose I haven’t been… socializing much. Used to go to the pub with some friends, but… what's the point, really? Everything feels a bit… muted, you know? Like watching a film through frosted glass. And, uh… I suppose I haven’t been keeping up with the piano tuning. Focusing is… hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite, social withdrawal, a sense of things feeling muted, and difficulty with concentration – those all sound like they could be related. Just to rule out anything physical, are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. My back aches a bit sometimes, from bending over the pianos, but that's nothing new. Old injury. Nothing that would keep me awake, I don't think. I’m not taking any medication, either. Just the tea, I suppose. And maybe a bit too much sugar in it, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant pain, no medications. Just the tea. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Could you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Always hated scales. Reminds me of… never mind. 105 kilograms, you said? That sounds… about right. Skin and bones, mostly. It's mostly height, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, 105 kilograms. And you are quite tall, yes. Your height is noted as 190 centimeters in your chart. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, pulse is 72, regular. Let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Everything sounds clear. Okay, lungs are clear, heart sounds normal. Now, let's just check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Reflexes, alright. Used to have pretty quick reflexes fixing those piano hammers. A bit rusty now, probably. Go ahead. I don't mind. Just… get it over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are within normal limits. Everything seems physically normal, Chanz. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing symptoms of grief and possibly some mild depression, which is understandably impacting your sleep and energy levels. The multiple awakenings, lack of enjoyment in food, social withdrawal, and difficulty concentrating are all common signs. However, it’s important to rule out any other underlying causes. I'm going to order some basic blood work—just a complete blood count and a thyroid panel—to make sure everything is functioning normally. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. Though I did have a bad reaction to some antibiotics when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. Just… makes me feel a bit queasy, that's all. Nothing serious. Blood work sounds… alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I've got pianos to fix, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. The blood work is fairly standard, and shouldn't take too long. We'll also do a quick depression screening questionnaire. It's just a series of questions to help us get a better understanding of how you're feeling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A questionnaire, huh? Look, I’m not a fan of being asked a bunch of questions. It all feels a bit… pointless, if I’m honest. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just get it over with, quickly, if you could. I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. It’s quick, I promise. I’ll read the questions, and you just answer honestly. It’s not a test, just information to help me understand how you’re feeling. Okay, first question: “Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things?
PATIENT: “Little interest or pleasure”… a lot, I suppose. Definitely more than a few times. Most of the time, honestly. It's just… everything feels a bit… grey. Like a piano with a broken string. Not much joy in anything these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. "Not at all, several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day?
PATIENT: Nearly every day. Definitely nearly every day. There are a few moments, maybe, when I'm fixing a particularly tricky bit on a piano, and I feel... something. But that doesn't last. Mostly, it's just... nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, nearly every day. Next question: "Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: …More than half the days, I'd say. Not every day, but… often. It's not like I’m actively sad, all the time. Just… empty. Like something’s missing. And it's… tiring. Pretending to be alright, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, more than half the days. Let me just ask a few more questions. "Over the last two weeks, how often have you had trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much?
PATIENT: Several days. Definitely several days. I fall asleep alright, but… staying asleep is the problem. Like I said, waking up a lot. And then just… lying there. Thinking. Or not thinking. Just… awake. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay. Several days. "Over the last two weeks, how often have you felt tired or have little energy?
PATIENT: Nearly every day. Are you going to ask me about everything now? It's just… exhausting, alright? Being tired all the time. It makes everything harder. Fixing pianos, even… and I used to love that.
DOCTOR: Nearly every day. Yes, I apologize. I understand this is exhausting, Chanz. I am almost finished. Next question: “Over the last two weeks, how often have you had poor appetite or have lost interest in eating?
PATIENT: More than half the days. I eat, because I know I need to. But… it doesn't taste like anything anymore. It’s just… fuel. Not a pleasure. I used to enjoy cooking, you know? Making nice meals… now, it's just a chore.
DOCTOR: Okay, more than half the days. One final question: "Over the last two weeks, how often have you felt bad about yourself – or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down?
PATIENT: ...Several days. Yes. Several days, I’d say. I… used to be good at things. Good at fixing pianos, good at providing… now… it feels like I’m just… existing. Letting everyone down, probably. I don’t know. It’s… complicated.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Chanz. That was helpful. The results indicate a moderate level of depression, which, given your recent loss and the symptoms you’ve described, is understandable. I want to be clear: this doesn’t mean you’re “crazy” or anything like that. It simply means you're struggling, and we can work on getting you back to feeling like yourself again. I recommend starting with a trial of antidepressant medication, and also starting some grief counseling. We can discuss the options for both. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Medication… I don’t know. I don’t like the idea of taking pills. It feels… weak, somehow. And counseling… talking about it… I don’t really see the point. It’s done. It happened. What’s the point of digging it all up again? I just want to feel… normal again. But I don’t want to be drugged up to do it. Is there… anything else? Anything that doesn’t involve pills or… talking?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Chanz. You're right to be cautious. It’s perfectly valid to feel that way. Let me assure you, medication isn’t about being “weak.” It’s about restoring balance in your brain chemistry, allowing you to cope more effectively. And if you’re not comfortable with medication right now, we can certainly focus on other options first. We could explore lifestyle changes – regular exercise, a healthier diet, mindfulness techniques – to help improve your mood and energy levels. We also have a support group for people experiencing grief, which might be a less intense way to connect with others who understand what you're going through. We can also look into light therapy, which can be effective for seasonal depression and also improve overall mood. We can also start with just a single session with a counselor, to see if it’s a good fit for you. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Light therapy… that sounds… less intrusive. And maybe one session with a counselor. Just one. To see what it’s like. I don’t want to be stuck talking about my feelings for hours. And I’ll try to… walk more. I used to walk everywhere. But pills… no. Not right now.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a reasonable plan, Chanz. We can start with light therapy and one session with a counselor. I’ll write you a referral for both. The light therapy is fairly simple – you sit in front of a special lamp for about 30 minutes each day. And the counselor will be able to assess your needs and determine if it’s the right fit for you. I’ll also order the blood work to rule out any other underlying causes. Once the results are back, we can review them together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood work, light therapy, one counseling session. Let's… get it over with. Do I need to make appointments myself, or will your office do that? I really don't want to spend all day on the phone.
DOCTOR: My office will handle the appointments for the light therapy and the counseling session. I’ll have the receptionist give you a call tomorrow with the details. Just to be clear, I’m also prescribing a low-dose Vitamin D supplement, as Vitamin D deficiency is common and can contribute to low mood. It’s over-the-counter, so you can pick that up at any pharmacy. Here’s a summary of everything we discussed, along with the referral information. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Vitamin D… alright. I just hope this… helps. I don't want to be like this forever. Thank you… I suppose. I'll… see you later.
DOCTOR: It was good to meet you, Chanz. I understand your concerns, and I'm confident we can work together to improve things. It takes courage to seek help, and you’ve already taken a big step. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, it’s okay to not be okay. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in a few weeks.
