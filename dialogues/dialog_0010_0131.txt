DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sladen. I'm Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been having some trouble with my blood pressure, that’s why I’m here. The pharmacy said it was a little high when I went to get my usual stuff, and they told me I should check in with a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good you followed up on that. High blood pressure is something we definitely want to take a look at. Can you tell me a little more about what the pharmacy told you?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. The pharmacist, Mr. Hernandez, he said my top number was… 142, I think? And the bottom number was 90. He said it was a bit high for me, and that I should get it checked out properly, just to be safe. He didn’t seem too worried, but he said it's better to know, you know? I don’t usually pay attention to the numbers, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Mr. Hernandez sounds like a sensible pharmacist. 142/90 is a bit elevated, yes. It’s good you came in. To get a better picture, I’d like to ask you a few questions. First, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is… new. I usually go to the pharmacy for my allergy meds and things like that, but they’ve never mentioned anything about my blood pressure being off before. It’s just… always seemed fine, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. And have you been feeling any symptoms lately that might be related to high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Not really… not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little bit more tired than usual, but I figured that was just from the heat, you know? It’s been scorching lately. And sometimes I get a little headache, but I get those anyway. Nothing major, nothing I’d think to go to the doctor for, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no severe headaches, no vision changes, no chest pain, no shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, definitely none of that. Just the tiredness and the little headaches here and there. I haven’t been short of breath or anything like that. I do get a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast, but I always figured that was just me being quick!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll keep those symptoms in mind. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just my allergies, really. I get hay fever pretty bad in the spring and fall. And I had the flu last year, but everyone gets the flu, right? Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy, I think. I haven't had any serious illnesses or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, allergies and the flu last year. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been lucky enough to avoid all that! Just the usual doctor’s visits for check-ups and stuff. And for the flu shot every year, of course. I try to stay on top of things.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries. Never had anything like that. Both my parents lived long lives and they didn’t have much done either, so I think I got good genes, thankfully!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney issues in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… My grandmother on my mother's side had diabetes, I think. And my uncle, her brother, he had a heart attack when he was older, maybe in his 70s. But other than that, not really. My father’s side was pretty healthy, as far as I know. He lived to be 85.
DOCTOR: Okay, so grandmother with diabetes and an uncle with a heart attack. That's good information. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I work at a senior center, so I’m on my feet a lot, walking around and helping people. It keeps me pretty busy! I try to eat healthy, lots of fruits and vegetables, but I do have a sweet tooth, I admit. And I don’t exercise as much as I should, to be honest. It’s hard to find the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, active job, tries to eat healthy, sweet tooth, could exercise more. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And I only have a glass of wine maybe once or twice a month, with dinner. Definitely not a drinker. And no, I don't use any drugs. Never have, never will.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, one last thing – are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my allergy medicine, a cetirizine. It's just over-the-counter, you can get it at any pharmacy. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if I have a headache, but that's it. Nothing else. This is all I take regularly.
DOCTOR: Alright, just cetirizine for allergies and ibuprofen as needed. Okay, Ms. Sladen, that gives me a good starting point. I’d like to check your blood pressure now, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we’ll discuss some next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good, Doctor. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 148/92, which is elevated. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I’m also going to palpate your pulses. Pulses are good and equal on both sides. I'm going to order some routine blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel – to get a better understanding of your overall health. I also want to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would you be able to do that today?
PATIENT: Okay, 148/92… that does sound a little high. And yes, I can do an EKG today, I think. Is it something I can do here at the clinic? I have a little bit of time, I didn’t have anything planned after this.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can do it right here in the examination room. It's a quick and painless test. Okay, Ms. Sladen, just relax and breathe normally. This will only take a few minutes. Alright. Your EKG shows no immediate abnormalities, which is good. The results will be sent to me electronically. Based on the elevated blood pressure readings, your family history, and your lifestyle, I suspect you have Stage 1 hypertension. However, we need the blood work results to rule out any other underlying causes. I’m going to recommend some lifestyle modifications to start. These include reducing your sodium intake, increasing your physical activity to at least 30 minutes most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight, and limiting your alcohol intake. I also want you to start monitoring your blood pressure at home. Do you have a blood pressure monitor at home?
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds… manageable. I can definitely try those things. No, I don’t have a blood pressure monitor at home. I figured the pharmacy would have caught it if it was really bad, so I didn’t bother getting one. Would you recommend a certain kind? And is there anything else I should be looking out for while I’m trying to change things?
DOCTOR: That’s fair. It’s good you’re proactive about getting it checked out. I recommend an automatic upper-arm blood pressure monitor. They’re the most accurate and easiest to use. Omron and Withings are good brands. I’ll write you a prescription for one, and your insurance should cover most of the cost. While you’re making lifestyle changes, be mindful of any symptoms like severe headaches, vision changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. If you experience any of those, contact me immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. I'd like to see you back in one month to review your blood work results and see how you’re doing with the lifestyle changes. We can discuss medication options if needed at that time. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. A month is good. I'll get the monitor and start tracking things. And I’ll definitely keep an eye out for those symptoms you mentioned. Thank you, Doctor Annesley. I feel a lot better knowing what’s going on and having a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sladen. I’m glad I could help. Here’s the prescription for the blood pressure monitor and a handout with information on lifestyle modifications for hypertension. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please take care.
