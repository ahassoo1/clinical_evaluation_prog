DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Pirl. The pleasure is all mine. I requested a general wellness check, a lab panel, if you will. Just wanted to see how things are holding up these days. I believe the results are ready for review? I am Alroy Mombrun, by the way, though I suppose you already knew that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Mombrun, of course. I do have your information here. And yes, the initial lab results are available. A general wellness check is always a good idea. It's important to stay on top of things. Before we delve into the results, if you don’t mind, I like to get a bit of a broader picture. It’s been… some time since your last comprehensive visit, hasn’t it?
PATIENT: Indeed, Doctor. It has been quite some time. Perhaps… seven years? My wife, Elena, usually handles these things, bless her heart, but she’s been traveling quite a bit for family matters recently, so I thought I’d take the initiative this time around. I feel perfectly well, mind you, but one can never be too careful.
DOCTOR: Seven years… alright. That's good you're being proactive, Mr. Mombrun. It’s admirable. And it’s perfectly reasonable to want to stay on top of your health. To start, could you tell me a little about any current symptoms you might be experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, Doctor, nothing at all that I’ve noticed. Truly. No aches, no pains, no… well, nothing unusual for a man of my age, I suppose. I sleep soundly, eat a good breakfast – Elena insists on it – and keep myself reasonably active. I still do some work with my hands, you see. Construction, mostly. Though not as much as I used to. Just light duties these days. I might feel a little tired after a long day, but that’s to be expected, isn't it?
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Mr. Mombrun. It sounds like you're quite active and taking good care of yourself. A little fatigue with activity is perfectly normal, yes. Now, let’s just quickly go through a few standard questions, just to be thorough. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight, either loss or gain?
PATIENT: No significant changes, Doctor. Perhaps a pound or two gained over the winter months – Elena's cooking is too good to resist, you understand – but nothing drastic. I’ve remained fairly stable for the last year, I’d say. I weigh myself occasionally, though I don’t fixate on the number. Around 180 pounds, give or take. I am a rather large man, you see – six foot four.
DOCTOR: Six foot four, yes, I see that here. And around 180 pounds… alright. That's good stability. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. My appetite is as robust as ever, thankfully! Elena prepares wonderful meals, and I enjoy them immensely. I eat three good meals a day, and sometimes a little snack in the afternoon if I’m feeling particularly peckish. Nothing out of the ordinary, I assure you. She worries if I don't eat enough, you see. A very caring woman.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Mombrun. A good appetite is certainly a positive sign. Now, let's move on to something else. Have you had any issues with your sleep – difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or perhaps waking up feeling unrested?
PATIENT: No issues whatsoever, Doctor. I sleep like a log, usually. Eight hours, give or take. I've always been a sound sleeper. Elena sometimes says I snore a bit, but I'm usually too far gone to notice! It's a blessing, truly. I wake up feeling refreshed and ready for the day, most of the time. Perhaps a little creaky in the joints, as one might expect, but that’s easily remedied with a bit of stretching.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's very good to hear, Mr. Mombrun. Alright, let's talk about any chronic medical conditions you may have. Have you been diagnosed with things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully nothing of the sort. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. My father lived a long and healthy life, and I seem to have inherited his good constitution. I do get the occasional ache or pain, as one might expect from a man who’s spent decades working with his hands, but nothing that would qualify as a chronic condition. Elena insists on regular check-ups, and I've always passed with flying colors. Though, as I said, it's been some time since my last comprehensive visit. I believe my blood pressure was a little elevated once, a few years back, but it came down with some lifestyle adjustments – less salt, more walking, you understand. Nothing serious, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Mombrun. A family history of good health is always a positive. And it’s excellent that lifestyle adjustments helped with your blood pressure. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… yes, actually. When I was a young man, quite a few years ago now – perhaps forty years – I had my appendix removed. It was a rather routine procedure, thankfully. No complications. And… oh, yes! I had a minor operation on my knee a few years after that, a cartilage tear sustained while playing soccer. Nothing major, a simple arthroscopy. And… that’s it, I believe. Nothing else. Both recovered fully, thankfully. No lingering issues. I was always very careful with my rehabilitation, you understand. I didn’t want to risk damaging the knee further.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. Now, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. Just a low-dose aspirin every other day, as a preventative measure. My doctor recommended it a few years back. And… occasionally, I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, if I’ve overdone it with the construction work. Nothing regular, just as needed. Oh, and I take a multivitamin every morning, Elena insists on that as well. She’s very keen on ensuring I get all the necessary nutrients. Nothing else, I assure you. No prescription medications, no herbal remedies, nothing of the sort. I prefer to keep things as natural as possible, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, aspirin, ibuprofen as needed, and a multivitamin. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. I've never had an allergic reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, take most medications without issue. I've always been fortunate in that regard. Elena sometimes worries about me trying new foods when we travel, but I haven't had any problems. I've always had a rather robust constitution, you understand. Though, I do try to be cautious, naturally. I don't go around eating anything and everything without thinking about it. But no known allergies, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Mr. Mombrun, that’s a very thorough overview. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I’ve always been a firm believer in a healthy lifestyle, and that includes avoiding tobacco. My father was a smoker, and he suffered the consequences, you understand. So I made a conscious decision to stay away from it. Elena is very proud of me for that. I’ve always preferred fresh air and exercise. I do enjoy a good glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s about it. No cigarettes, ever.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Mombrun. That’s a very good habit. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: As I mentioned, Doctor, I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Perhaps a couple of times a week. Nothing excessive, mind you. Just a small glass to accompany my meal. I find it helps me relax and unwind after a long day. Elena and I both enjoy a good red wine. But I certainly don’t drink to excess. It’s more of a social thing, you understand. We enjoy it with our dinner, and that’s about it. No hard liquor, no binge drinking, nothing of the sort. I'm a rather moderate drinker, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, moderate wine consumption. Now, let's talk about your work. What do you do for a living?
PATIENT: As I mentioned earlier, Doctor, I work in construction. Though, these days it's more of a light duty. I used to do a lot of the heavy lifting, but my age is starting to catch up with me, you understand. Now I mostly oversee things, do some planning, make sure everything is running smoothly. I still enjoy being on the job site, but I don't push myself too hard anymore. I've been in the construction industry for over forty years, you see. It's always been a satisfying career, building things with my own two hands. Though, as I said, I'm slowing down a bit. I enjoy the mental aspect of it these days, more than the physical. It keeps my mind sharp, you understand.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Staying mentally active is very important. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your family?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’ve been happily married to Elena for forty-two years. She's a wonderful woman, truly. We have two grown children, a son and a daughter, both married with children of their own. We have four grandchildren, whom we adore. They keep us very busy, you understand. My son lives nearby, which is a blessing, but my daughter lives in another state. We see them as often as we can, but it’s not always easy. Elena and I enjoy spending time with our family, traveling, and just relaxing at home. We’re very fortunate to have such a close-knit family. They're the most important thing in my life, you understand. Elena does most of the planning for family gatherings, she’s very organized. We enjoy cooking together, and just spending quality time with our loved ones. It's a very fulfilling life, truly.
DOCTOR: That’s lovely, Mr. Mombrun. It sounds like you have a very rich and fulfilling life. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let’s take a look at those lab results.
PATIENT: Excellent, Doctor. I appreciate your time, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts. I trust everything is in order, but I always appreciate a professional opinion. Please, don't hesitate to ask if you require any further information from me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun. Overall, the results are quite good. Your cholesterol is slightly elevated, but not significantly. Your blood sugar is within normal limits, as is your kidney function. Your vitamin D levels are a bit low, which is common, especially in the winter months. And your thyroid function is normal. Your complete blood count is also within normal ranges. However, your PSA level is slightly elevated. It’s not dramatically high, but it’s above the normal range for your age. Now, a slightly elevated PSA can be caused by a number of things – benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis, even recent ejaculation. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it does warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: I see, Doctor. Elevated PSA, you say? I must admit, that’s… concerning. I hadn’t considered anything of the sort. I've always felt perfectly well, as I mentioned. What does "further investigation" entail, exactly? Is it something I should be worried about? I apologize for my nervousness, but one hears so many things… I do recall my father had some issues with his prostate later in life… but I’m not sure of the details. Perhaps you could explain it to me in layman’s terms, if you don’t mind?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Mombrun. It's perfectly understandable to be concerned. And you're right to ask questions. A slightly elevated PSA – that stands for Prostate-Specific Antigen – is a protein produced by the prostate gland. As you get older, the prostate can enlarge, and the PSA level naturally tends to rise. However, a significant elevation can also be a sign of prostate cancer. Now, it’s important to stress that most elevated PSAs are due to benign causes. But we need to rule out anything serious. "Further investigation" would involve a digital rectal exam, which allows me to feel the prostate gland and assess its size and texture. It’s not the most comfortable exam, I won’t lie, but it’s very important. We would also likely order a repeat PSA test to confirm the initial result, and potentially a prostate biopsy, which involves taking a small tissue sample to look for any cancerous cells. Given your family history, it's prudent to investigate this further. I want to be thorough and ensure your peace of mind. I want to be clear: this doesn't mean you have cancer. It simply means we need to gather more information. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. A digital rectal exam and a repeat PSA test… and potentially a biopsy. It’s… a bit daunting, to be honest. My father did have some issues with his prostate, as I recall – some discomfort, frequent urination, things of that nature. He never spoke about it much, and my wife, Elena, was quite young at the time. The biopsy… is that painful? And what are the risks involved? I suppose I should ask what the chances are, realistically, that it is something serious? I appreciate your honesty, Doctor. I’d rather know the truth, even if it’s not what I want to hear. Elena is quite protective, you see, and I wouldn’t want to worry her unnecessarily. Perhaps we should discuss this further with her before proceeding?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Mombrun. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned, and I commend you for wanting to be prepared. Let's address your questions. The digital rectal exam, as I mentioned, isn’t the most comfortable. It can cause some mild discomfort, but it’s typically brief. Regarding the biopsy, it's generally performed under local anesthesia, so you shouldn't feel significant pain during the procedure. You may experience some mild discomfort afterward, such as bleeding, bruising, or temporary difficulty urinating. There are some potential risks involved, such as infection or, rarely, urinary incontinence, but these are uncommon. We take precautions to minimize these risks. As for the chances of it being something serious… that's difficult to say without further testing. An elevated PSA is not a definitive diagnosis. It simply means we need to investigate further to determine the cause. Statistically, many elevated PSAs are due to benign conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostatitis. However, given your family history, it’s prudent to rule out prostate cancer. I absolutely agree that you should discuss this with Elena before proceeding. It’s important to make informed decisions together. I can provide you with some educational materials about prostate cancer and the biopsy procedure to share with her. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. Educational materials would be most helpful. Elena is very resourceful and does a lot of research, so having something concrete to review would be greatly appreciated. I suppose we should schedule a repeat PSA test, then, and discuss the possibility of a digital exam at the same time? And perhaps we can plan for the biopsy if the results warrant it. I trust you have a skilled technician who can perform the procedure? I wouldn’t want to risk complications. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness, Doctor. This is… a lot to take in. Perhaps a cup of water would be helpful at this point?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Mombrun. Here you are. I understand this is a lot to process, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. Yes, let's schedule a repeat PSA test as soon as possible. We can perform the digital rectal exam at the same time, if you’re comfortable with that. It will give me a better understanding of your prostate gland. I will personally perform the digital exam, and if the results warrant it, I will refer you to a skilled urologist for the biopsy. I work with excellent specialists in the area. They are very experienced and have a high success rate. We will discuss all the risks and benefits of the biopsy beforehand, and you will have plenty of time to make an informed decision. I'll have my nurse prepare some educational materials for you and Elena to review. She will also schedule the appointment for you. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any immediate questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything for now. The educational materials will be greatly appreciated, and I will discuss this thoroughly with Elena. Scheduling the repeat test and the exam is a good next step. Thank you again for your patience and kindness. You have put my mind at ease, somewhat. I appreciate your honesty and thoroughness. I will await a call from your nurse to schedule the appointment. I believe that is all for now, Doctor. Thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. I’m glad I could help, even if it’s just to alleviate some of your concerns. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes to mind. My nurse will be in touch shortly to schedule the appointment. Take care of yourself, and please give my best to Elena.
