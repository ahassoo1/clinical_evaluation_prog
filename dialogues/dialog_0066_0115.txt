DOCTOR: Hi Annelle, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, well, it’s about my… a friend, you see. He’s gotten quite yellow. His skin, that is. And he has… something with his liver, I believe. It’s been bothering him for some time. I’m afraid I don’t remember all the specifics. It's… rather a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're concerned about a friend who’s experiencing yellowing of the skin and has some liver concerns. It's perfectly alright if you don't recall all the details – we can work through it together. First, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. When… that is a good question. It feels like… a few weeks, perhaps? Maybe longer. Time does seem to slip away these days. I truly can’t be certain. He didn’t mention it to me right away, you understand. He’s a… private man. It was just… one day I noticed it when we were having tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks or longer. And he hadn’t specifically told you about it, you noticed it yourself. That's helpful to know. Besides the yellowing of the skin – which we call jaundice, by the way – have you noticed any other changes in him?
PATIENT: Jaundice, you say? Yes, that sounds right. Other changes… let me think. He’s been… rather tired lately. And a bit of an appetite loss, I suppose. He used to enjoy his meals so much. Now… he just picks at them. And his stomach… it seems swollen sometimes. But then again, perhaps that’s just my imagination.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, loss of appetite, and some swelling in the stomach. That gives me a bit more to work with. Has he mentioned any pain anywhere – in his stomach, maybe his back, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Pain… now that you mention it, he did complain of a dull ache in his side a few times. But he’s not one to fuss, you see. He always says it’s just “old age.” But it did seem to bother him more after he ate. A sort of… discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in his side, especially after eating. That's important information. Has he had any changes in his bowel movements or the color of his urine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I… honestly, I don’t think I’ve asked him about that. We don’t discuss such things, you understand. It’s rather… personal. I’m afraid I can’t be of much help with that question. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Annelle. I understand. It's not always easy to talk about these things. Let’s switch gears a little. Do you know if he's seen a doctor before for this, or has he been diagnosed with anything in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, he did see a doctor… quite some time ago. Something about… hepatitis, I believe. A long time back. He said it cleared up on its own, but… I suppose it’s come back. He didn’t really go into details. He's a very independent man, and doesn’t like to bother anyone with his ailments.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of hepatitis in the past. That’s very important to know. Do you know which type of hepatitis it was, if he ever mentioned it – A, B, or C?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I’m afraid not. He didn’t say. Honestly, Doctor, I’m just trying to recall what little I can. It was many years ago, and he wasn’t very forthcoming with the details. I believe he just said it was “a liver thing.” I apologize for being so vague. I feel quite useless.
DOCTOR: You're not being useless at all, Annelle. It's completely understandable that you don't remember all the specifics, especially given the time that's passed. We're doing the best we can with what we have. Now, has he been taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. He takes something for his blood pressure, I believe. A small white pill. And occasionally, he’ll take something for his arthritis, but only when it flares up. That’s a yellowish one, I think. He gets them from the pharmacy down the street. Other than that… I don’t know of anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure and something for arthritis as needed. Do you happen to know the names of those medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I wouldn't know the first thing about medication names! He handles all of that himself, you see. I just… keep him company. He gives them to me to keep safe, but I don’t pay attention to what they are. I’m afraid I’m terribly unhelpful in that regard. I wish I could be of more assistance.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Annelle. It’s perfectly okay. We’ll do the best we can. I think it would be best to examine your friend. Would you mind if I took his vital signs – his blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then listen to his heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. He’s here, isn’t he? He's… rather frail, so please be gentle with him. He doesn’t like being fussed over.
DOCTOR: Of course. Hello there. I'm Dr. Condray. It’s nice to meet you. Annelle has told me a little about what’s been going on, and I just want to take a quick look and listen to your heart and lungs, okay?
PATIENT: .
