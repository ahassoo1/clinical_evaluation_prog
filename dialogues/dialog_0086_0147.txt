DOCTOR: Alright, Amy Raghunathan, 31 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor. I've been noticing a lump, a mass, in my lower abdomen for a little while now. It's… concerning me, so I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: A lump in your lower abdomen. Okay. And by “a little while,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably around six weeks, maybe a little longer. It wasn’t immediately obvious, you know? It started quite small, and I just… noticed it getting a bit bigger over time.
DOCTOR: Right. And has it been painful at all?
PATIENT: No, not really painful. More… uncomfortable, sometimes. Like a dull ache, if I've been on my feet a lot. It doesn't hurt to touch, exactly, but it feels there, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. And is there anything that seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Not that I’ve noticed, specifically. Like I said, being on my feet all day with choreography does seem to make it a bit more noticeable, but it doesn’t cause pain, if that makes sense. It's just…present more.
DOCTOR: Choreography?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m a choreographer. I teach and create dances. It keeps me quite active, as you can imagine. It's how I earn a living, mostly.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a physically demanding profession. Okay. Now, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. No change in my bowel habits, no weight loss, no fever or anything like that. I’ve been feeling generally well, apart from the lump, of course. Just… a bit worried about it, that’s all.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing like this at all. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Regular check-ups, but no major issues. This is…new. It's a bit unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s have a look then. If you don’t mind, I'm going to need to do a physical exam. Just lie down on the examination table for me, please. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds fine. I will. Just let me know if there’s anything special I need to do.
DOCTOR: Just lie flat on your back, and I’ll listen to your abdomen first, then I’ll palpate it – gently press on it to feel for the lump and assess its size and consistency. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but let me know immediately if it is.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that makes sense. I will, absolutely. Please don’t hesitate to ask if I feel any pain. I’m a little anxious, but I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Normal bowel sounds. Okay. I do feel a mass, approximately… three centimeters in diameter. It's firm, but not particularly hard. Not exquisitely tender to the touch, as you said. Seems to be located… here, in the left lower quadrant. It’s not fixed to the underlying tissues. It seems mobile. Hmm.
PATIENT: Mobile, you say? That’s… good, isn’t it? That means it's not… stuck, I suppose? I'm not a doctor, of course, I'm just trying to understand. What does this mean?
DOCTOR: "Good" is relative, Mr. Raghunathan. Mobile can be better, yes, as it suggests it's not adhered to surrounding structures. But it doesn't tell us what it is. It could be a number of things—a benign cyst, a lipoma… or something else entirely. We'll need to investigate further. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a pelvic ultrasound. The ultrasound will give us a better visual of the mass and help us determine its nature.
PATIENT: An ultrasound, right. That makes sense. A picture will be helpful. And the blood count… just to rule things out? Is there anything specific you're looking for with that? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor, but I am a bit… anxious.
DOCTOR: The blood count is routine, but it can help us look for signs of infection or inflammation. It won’t tell us what the lump is, but it can give us a broader picture of your overall health. Look, I understand your anxiety. It’s perfectly reasonable to be worried when you find something new like this. We're going to get to the bottom of it. I’ve sent the requisitions to the lab. They’ll contact you to schedule the ultrasound, usually within 48 hours. Once we have those results, we’ll discuss them and formulate a plan. I want you to avoid strenuous activity until we know more, understood?
PATIENT: Okay, no strenuous activity. That's… difficult, with my work, but I will manage. 48 hours, that's good. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. And the reassurance. It does help. Will you be the one to call me with the results? Or…
DOCTOR: I’m fully booked for the next two weeks. My assistant, Nurse Davies, will call you with the results. She’s perfectly capable of explaining the findings. If anything is… concerning, she'll schedule a follow-up appointment with me directly. Now, do you have any allergies or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. And no medications currently. I’m generally quite healthy, as I said. Just… this lump. I suppose it's a good thing I don't smoke, either. Anything I can do to help, anything I should be aware of before the ultrasound? Do I need to prepare in any way?
DOCTOR: No, there's no special preparation needed for the ultrasound. You don't need to fast or anything like that. Just wear comfortable clothing. And try not to worry unnecessarily. Most lumps like this turn out to be benign. Now, let’s get a quick family history. Any history of cancer in your immediate family—parents, siblings, grandparents?
PATIENT: Let me think… My maternal grandmother had breast cancer, quite a long time ago. She recovered fully, though. And my father’s brother had prostate cancer, but that was relatively recent. Other than that… not that I’m aware of. No one else in the immediate family has been diagnosed with cancer, to my knowledge. My mother is very diligent about family health records, so I'm fairly confident that's accurate.
DOCTOR: Alright. Breast and prostate cancer. Noted. And finally, do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None of the above. I don't drink alcohol at all, and I've never smoked or used recreational drugs. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Perhaps that’s why this is so unsettling. It feels…out of character. Is there anything else you need to know before I leave?
DOCTOR: No, I think that covers everything for now. Remember, no strenuous activity until we have the ultrasound results. And if you experience any sudden pain, fever, or increased swelling, contact the clinic immediately. Here’s a summary of your visit and the requisitions for the blood count and ultrasound. Nurse Davies will be in touch to schedule the ultrasound. Do you have any further questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you've covered everything very thoroughly. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly. I will wait for Nurse Davies to contact me, and avoid strenuous activity. I appreciate your care. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye, Mr. Raghunathan. .
