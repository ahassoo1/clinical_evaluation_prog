DOCTOR: Good morning, Alayne. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Latisia Finco. Now, why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is lovely to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… Well, it’s a bit hard to say exactly. It’s…family, mostly. My husband, bless his heart, he’s been having these spells, you see. Weakness on one side, like. And my mother… she suffered from terrible headaches. Real debilitating ones. So, I thought… well, I thought it best to get checked out, just in case. It’s probably nothing, but… you never know, do you?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very sensible to be proactive, especially with a family history of health concerns. So, let’s talk about your husband’s spells first. Can you tell me a bit more about them?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the spells. Let me think… They come on suddenly, it seems. He’s perfectly fine, chatting away, maybe doing a little work in the garden… and then, suddenly, his arm will feel heavy, or his leg will drag a bit. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few minutes. But he gets awfully frightened, poor thing. He worries so much. And it’s… it’s hard to describe. He seems a little confused sometimes during it, but mostly just scared. He says it feels like… like a wave washing over him, he says. Does that make any sense? It’s all a bit muddled in my head, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Alayne. A "wave washing over him" is a very helpful way to describe it. And it's good that it's brief. Now, has this happened more than once?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely more than once. It's hard to say how many times, exactly. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. But I'd say… maybe five or six times in the last few months? It seemed to start around springtime, I think. And it’s… well, it’s been worrying me terribly, honestly. I keep thinking it’s something serious, even though he tries to brush it off. He's a strong man, my husband, always has been. He doesn’t like to complain. But I see the fear in his eyes, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Alayne. It's good you’re taking this seriously. And it's wise to pay attention to those subtle cues. Now, let's switch gears for a moment. You mentioned your mother’s headaches. Can you tell me more about those?
PATIENT: Oh, my mother... bless her soul. Those headaches were just awful. She suffered with them for years and years. They weren't just ordinary headaches, you know? They were… pounding, blinding pain. She'd have to lie down in a dark room for hours. Nothing seemed to help much, to be honest. Aspirin would take the edge off sometimes, but not always. And they'd come on without warning. She went to doctor after doctor, but they never seemed to find the root of the problem. They called them migraines, I think… but they were so much more than just a headache. They really crippled her, poor thing. She’d miss so many family events because of them. It was heartbreaking.
DOCTOR: I see. That sounds very difficult for both your mother and your family. So, these were debilitating headaches that were a recurring issue for a long time. Now, Alayne, have you experienced similar headaches yourself, at any point in your life?
PATIENT: Oh, me? No, not like my mother. I get a little headache now and then, like anyone does. Maybe if I don't drink enough water, or if I'm stressed. But nothing… nothing like what she went through. They're just… mild. I can usually take a little something for them and carry on. Nothing that ever keeps me from doing what I need to do. No, I haven't had those terrible, crippling headaches. Thank goodness. I worry enough about my husband and my mother, I wouldn't want to be suffering with something like that too. Though… now that I think about it… I have been feeling a little… dizzy lately. But it’s probably just my age, you know? Things start to go wrong when you get old.
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear you haven't experienced those debilitating headaches yourself. And it’s perfectly normal to experience changes as we get older. Now, this dizziness… can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, the dizziness... It's not constant, you see. It comes and goes. It’s… well, it feels like the room is spinning sometimes, just for a few seconds. Or like I'm a little off balance. Not enough to fall, thankfully. But enough to make me feel a little unsteady. It’s usually when I stand up quickly, I think. Or maybe when I turn my head too fast. It’s hard to say for sure. And it doesn’t happen every day. Just… occasionally. I've always just put it down to getting older, or maybe low blood sugar. I try to eat regularly, but you know… sometimes I forget. Honestly, I'm probably just being a worrywart. My husband always tells me I am. But I can't help but worry about these things, you know? Especially with the family history.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to be aware of these things and to pay attention to your body. So, occasional dizziness, particularly when standing quickly or turning your head, and sometimes a feeling of being off balance. Now, Alayne, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history... Let me see. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe twenty years ago now? That was a bit of a rough patch, but I recovered alright. And I have a little arthritis in my hands, it gets a bit stiff sometimes, especially in the cold weather. Nothing too serious, just a bit of a nuisance. Other than that… not much, I think. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox… but I haven't been seriously ill in years. I try to stay active, walk a little bit every day, eat a reasonably healthy diet… I used to smoke, years ago, but I gave that up a long time ago. Honestly, I think I’m pretty healthy for my age. But you never know, do you? Things can change so quickly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. So, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and some arthritis in your hands. It’s wonderful that you’ve been able to stay active and that you quit smoking. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Medications... I take a little pill for my blood pressure, just a small dose. The doctor prescribed it a few years ago. And I take a little something for my arthritis when my hands are really stiff, ibuprofen, I think it is. Nothing fancy. And… oh, yes! I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I was a little low in it when I had my bloodwork done last year. Other than that… no, not much. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it, to be honest. I prefer a nice cup of tea and a good rest when I’m feeling unwell. Does that answer your question? I sometimes forget these things, you know. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Alayne. And don't worry about forgetting things, it's perfectly normal. I see here in your record that you're taking lisinopril for high blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and a daily vitamin D supplement. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think… No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction to anything, thank goodness. I used to get a little bit of hay fever in the springtime, but that’s just a mild sniffle, nothing serious. And I can eat anything, I’m not a picky eater at all. My mother, she had a bit of a sensitivity to shellfish, but I never inherited that. No, I don't think I have any allergies. I’m pretty lucky in that regard. Though… now that I think about it… sometimes I get a little bit of a rash if I use a certain brand of hand soap. But that’s probably just a sensitivity, not a true allergy. Does that make sense? I’m probably just rambling now.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all, Alayne. It's helpful to have all of this information. So, no known medication, food, or environmental allergies, just a possible sensitivity to a certain brand of hand soap. Now, before we move on, can you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, social history... Well, that's a bit of a simple one. I've been married to my husband, Angelo, for sixty years this November! A long time, isn't it? We raised three wonderful children, all grown up now with families of their own. We live in the same house we've always lived in, a little cottage in the countryside. It’s quiet here, peaceful. I used to be very active in the church choir, but my voice isn't what it used to be. Now, I mostly enjoy spending time with my family, gardening, and reading. We don't travel much anymore, Angelo isn't much of a traveler. And honestly, I'm quite content just staying home. A simple life, but a happy one. Is that what you wanted to know? I hope I'm not boring you.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Alayne. That sounds like a lovely life. Sixty years of marriage is a wonderful accomplishment. Now, have you ever used tobacco, or do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I never took to tobacco. My mother smoked a little when I was a girl, but I didn’t care for the smell of it. Angelo, he smoked for a while, but he gave that up years ago, thankfully. And alcohol… well, we might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, a little red wine. But nothing excessive, just a small glass. It’s mostly for Angelo, he enjoys it. I don’t really care for it much myself. A little bit on special occasions, maybe, but mostly we just drink water or tea. We’re not big drinkers, never have been. A quiet life, as I said. Is that what you were asking about? I hope I'm not taking up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Alayne. You’re providing very helpful information. So, no history of tobacco use, and only occasional, moderate alcohol consumption. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, besides your mother's headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, family history... Let me think. Well, my father had heart trouble when he was an older man. He had a bad heart attack, sadly. And my brother, he developed diabetes a few years ago, type 2, I think. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had arthritis, real bad arthritis, couldn’t even walk without a cane. But other than that… not much that I’m aware of. No cancer, no serious neurological conditions. Just the usual things, heart trouble, arthritis, diabetes. I always worry about the heart trouble, because of my father. But you can't change your family history, can you? You just have to take care of yourself as best you can. Is that what you were looking for? I hope I’m not rambling again. My mind is a bit foggy sometimes.
DOCTOR: No, you are not rambling at all. This is all very helpful. So, a history of heart trouble in your father, type 2 diabetes in your brother, and arthritis in your aunt. Now, Alayne, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. That will give me a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. A physical exam sounds sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I haven't had one in a while, to be honest. But I'm not afraid. Do whatever you need to do. I just want to make sure everything is alright. I’m a bit chilly, though, if that makes a difference. This room is rather cool. And I hope I don't have to take my shoes off! My feet are a little swollen today. Is there a gown I need to wear? I’m always a bit flustered when it comes to these things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. We’ll take things slowly and at your pace. You don't need to take your shoes off, and you don’t need to change into a gown. Just relax. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and do a quick neurological exam, just to see how everything is functioning. And yes, the room is a little cool, I’ll adjust the temperature. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 142/88. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let me listen to your heart… …Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not alarming, but we’ll note it. Now, let’s listen to your lungs… …Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. And finally, I’m just going to check your reflexes… … Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Everything seems generally okay, Alayne, but the elevated blood pressure and the slight murmur are things we’ll want to monitor. And the diminished reflexes are something to keep in mind. Now, do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness… that sounds rather a lot, doesn’t it? A slight murmur… and diminished reflexes… it all sounds so… serious. Is that bad, Doctor? I do worry terribly, you know. My husband always tells me I do. Is the murmur something I need to be concerned about? And what about the reflexes… is that a sign of something… you know… getting older? I try to keep active, but things aren’t what they used to be, of course. Should I be worried about my blood pressure? It's probably just the stress, isn’t it? I’ve been a bit anxious lately, with my husband’s spells and everything. Oh, dear. I’m probably just rambling again. Please tell me everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Now, Alayne, let's not jump to conclusions. The murmur is likely benign—many people have innocent heart murmurs that don’t require any treatment. We’ll want to get an EKG done just to be sure and to have a baseline, and potentially an echocardiogram. An EKG is a simple test that checks the electrical activity of your heart. And the echocardiogram is an ultrasound that shows us the structure of your heart. As for the reflexes, diminished reflexes can be a normal part of aging, but we need to rule out other causes. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and you’re right, stress can certainly contribute to that. We’ll start with some lifestyle modifications—diet, exercise, stress reduction—and if that doesn’t help, we can discuss medication. It's important to remember that we’re being proactive here. We’re gathering information, and we’ll develop a plan based on what we find. We're not making any assumptions or rushing into anything. And no, everything is not necessarily not alright, we just need to investigate a little further. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… a little better, I suppose. An EKG and an echocardiogram… those sound rather complicated. But if you think it's best, Doctor, I trust your judgment. And lifestyle modifications… well, I can certainly try to eat healthier and get a little more exercise. Though my knees aren’t what they used to be, of course. And stress reduction… well, that’s easier said than done, with my husband’s spells and everything. It’s just… I worry about him so much. He’s a strong man, but he’s getting older too, you know? And I don't want anything to happen to him. I just want us to be able to enjoy our remaining years together, in peace. Is there anything I can do for his spells, Doctor? Any tests you recommend? Should I bring him in for an appointment? I just want to make sure he’s alright. And thank you, Doctor, for taking the time to listen to me. I appreciate it very much. You’re very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alayne. And it's completely understandable to worry about your husband. It sounds like his spells warrant a thorough investigation. We should definitely schedule an appointment for him as soon as possible. I recommend a neurological consultation for your husband. The neurologist will be able to perform a detailed examination and order appropriate tests, such as an MRI of the brain, to determine the cause of the spells. They may also order an EEG to check his brain activity. For now, it’s important to keep a detailed record of his spells—when they occur, how long they last, what symptoms he experiences—anything that might be helpful. And remember, we’re in this together. We’ll get to the bottom of this and develop a plan to keep both of you healthy and happy. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. A neurological consultation… and keeping a detailed record of his spells. I can certainly do that. I have a little notebook I can use, I suppose. Though my memory isn’t what it used to be, of course. But I’ll try my best. And an MRI and an EEG… those sound rather complicated too. But if it’s necessary, I trust your judgment. I just want to make sure he’s alright. And thank you again, Doctor, for taking the time to listen to me. I appreciate it very much. You’re very kind. I suppose we should get started on the EKG then, shouldn’t we? And I’ll schedule an appointment for my husband as soon as possible. Is there anything else I need to do, Doctor? Or any questions you have for me? I just want to make sure I’m doing everything I can.
DOCTOR: You’re doing wonderfully, Alayne. And yes, let’s get the EKG done. It's a quick and painless test—we’ll just attach some electrodes to your chest and record your heart’s electrical activity. At this point, I don’t have any further questions for you. I think we've covered everything. We’ll get the results of the EKG back within a few days, and we’ll schedule the appointments for both of you. Now, if you’re ready, we can head over to the EKG room. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’re here to support you both.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Let’s head over to the EKG room then. I trust your judgment. And thank you again for everything. You’re very kind. I appreciate it very much. It's just… I worry so much, you know? About my husband and everything. But I trust you’ll take good care of us both. Let’s go then.
