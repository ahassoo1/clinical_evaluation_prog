DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is the name. Look, I’m here for this… test. For the army. They want me to get checked out first, you know? Seems a bit much, honestly. I feel fine. Always have.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hartness. So this is a pre-employment physical for the Army. I understand it feels a bit excessive if you’re feeling well, but it’s standard procedure to ensure everyone is medically fit for service. We just want to get a baseline and make sure there aren't any underlying issues we need to be aware of. To start, can you tell me a little more about what specifically the Army is requiring you to be cleared for?
PATIENT: Cleared for? What do you mean? They just said a full check-up. Heart, lungs, you know… the usual. Honestly, I didn't really pay attention to the specifics. I’m a mechanic, not a doctor. I fix things, I don’t need fixing. They just handed me this paper with your name on it and said to come here. Seems like a waste of my time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. It can be a bit overwhelming when you’re asked to jump through hoops. We'll try to make this as efficient as possible. Okay, so a full check-up. That’s helpful. To get a better picture, let's start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: Never. Not a thing. Always been strong as an ox. My father was the same, and his father before him. Good Swedish blood, you know? I haven’t even had the flu in… well, I can't remember the last time. Maybe when I was a little boy? It was a long time ago. Definitely nothing serious. I eat good, work hard, and don't bother with silly things like… worrying.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Hartness. A strong family history is definitely a good thing. And staying healthy through good habits is important. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single time. Broke my arm when I was a kid climbing a tree, but that's it. Didn’t even need a hospital. Just a cast from old man Hemmings down the street. He was a carpenter, knew a thing or two about fixing bones. Not like these fancy doctors these days. It healed just fine. Strong as new, I tell ya. Still use that arm every day.
DOCTOR: Good to know. So no surgeries, no hospitalizations. Let’s talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah. Nothing. I eat my vegetables. Don’t need any of that fancy stuff. Makes you weak, relying on pills and powders. My wife, she takes something for her… well, something for her nerves, I think. But I don’t bother with it. Waste of money, if you ask me. I get everything I need from a good meal and a hard day’s work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no medications, vitamins or supplements. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, insect stings, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? You think a Swedish man gets allergies? We're built tough! No. Nothing. Never had a problem with anything. Bees sting me sometimes when I'm working on cars outside, but I just ignore it. A little sting never hurt anyone. Well, maybe a little bit. But it's not an allergy, you understand? Just a bit of… irritation.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's good. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Look, I just told you, good Swedish blood! My father lived to be 85, worked in the shipyard his whole life. Strong as an ox, he was. Mother too, lived a long life. No heart problems, no cancers, nothing like that. They were healthy people. Worked hard, ate good food, and didn’t sit around complaining. It's a simple formula, really. You take care of yourself, you stay healthy. Don't need to look for fancy diseases in the family tree. Honestly, this is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. I'm just trying to gather as much information as possible to ensure a thorough assessment, even if your family history seems very healthy. It helps us establish a baseline and understand any potential risks. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work. I fix things. I come home. I eat dinner with my wife. That's my lifestyle. I don't sit around doing nothing. I'm always busy. I don't drink much, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. Don't smoke. Never have. What more do you need to know? I’m a practical man, I don't have time for… hobbies. A man's work is his hobby.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you work, eat a healthy diet, and don't smoke or drink excessively. That’s all very good. To clarify, when you say you “work,” what type of work do you do?
PATIENT: I told you! I’m a mechanic. I fix cars, trucks, anything with an engine. Been doing it for thirty years. It’s hard work, keeps me in shape. Sometimes I work on tractors for the farmers around here. I’m an engine and other machine assembler, that’s what it says on the papers. Whatever that means. I fix things. That's what I do.
DOCTOR: Right, a mechanic. Thank you for clarifying. That is physically demanding work. Now, one final question before we move on to a physical exam. Have you noticed any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, my knees creak a bit more than they used to. Getting older, you know? Can’t expect to be as spry as I was when I was twenty. And my back… it gets a bit stiff after a long day bending over engines. But that’s just part of the job. Nothing serious. It’s just… wear and tear. A man who works hard pays the price. I’m perfectly functional. Still got plenty of strength left in me. More than most these days, I’d wager.
DOCTOR: Okay, some creaking in the knees and stiffness in your back. That’s not uncommon with physically demanding work. Alright, Mr. Hartness, let's move on to a physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don't expect any surprises. I told you, I'm perfectly healthy. Just wasting my time, this whole thing. Hurry up, will you? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick and thorough as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Heart sounds are regular, rate is 72 beats per minute. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/90. That’s slightly elevated. We’ll want to monitor that.
PATIENT: Elevated? What does that even mean? I feel fine. Always have. Don't tell me I've got some fancy disease just because of a number on a machine. My father had good blood pressure, I guarantee it. Probably this machine is broken. You should get that checked.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily indicative of a disease, Mr. Hartness, but it does warrant further attention. Elevated blood pressure can sometimes be a sign of underlying issues, and it's best to monitor it over time. It can also be affected by stress or anxiety, so it’s not always a cause for immediate alarm. Now, let’s do a basic neurological assessment. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Eye movements are intact. Next, I’m going to check your reflexes. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Finally, I’m going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? I’m a strong man, you know. Been working with engines for thirty years. Builds up the strength. But my wrist… it’s been a bit sore lately. All this poking and prodding… It’s not doing me any good.
DOCTOR: Okay, your grip is strong, but I did notice you flinch when I tested your wrist. Do you experience pain in your wrist frequently?
PATIENT: It’s just a bit of soreness. Old injury. Fell off a ladder when I was younger, fixing a roof. Nothing serious. It flares up sometimes, especially when I’m working on tight spaces with the engines. But I can handle it. I’ve always handled it. It's just part of the job. A man who works hard pays the price, you know? Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hartness. That’s the completion of the physical exam. It appears you are in generally good health, but I do want to address the slightly elevated blood pressure and the discomfort in your wrist. I’d like to order some blood work to get a more comprehensive picture of your overall health, including cholesterol and kidney function. We should also get an X-ray of your wrist to evaluate the cause of the discomfort. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Blood work? X-rays? Look, I told you, I'm fine. This is getting ridiculous. I don't need fancy tests. I just need a signature so I can get on with my life. I don't have time for all this poking and prodding. The army will see I'm perfectly fit. Honestly, I'm starting to think this whole thing is a waste of my time and money. Can’t you just sign the paper?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but as a physician, I have a responsibility to ensure you are medically fit for the demands of service. While you may feel fine, the slightly elevated blood pressure and the discomfort in your wrist warrant further investigation. I am concerned about potential underlying issues that could be exacerbated by the physical stress of military training. Signing the form without addressing these concerns would be irresponsible on my part. However, I can offer a compromise. I can provide you with a list of specialists who can further evaluate your concerns. I’ll also document my findings and recommendations on the form. This will allow you to proceed with your application while addressing potential health risks. Would you be open to discussing that option?
PATIENT: Look, I’m a practical man. I don’t like wasting time. And I don't like being told what to do. Fine. A list of specialists. But I’m not promising I’ll go to any of them. And you will sign the paper. I need to get this done. Just give me the list, sign the paper, and let me get on with my life. I have things to do. This better be quick.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. Here is the completed form and a referral list for specialists in the area. I have included contact information for both a primary care physician and an orthopedic specialist. I strongly encourage you to follow up with at least the primary care physician to address the blood pressure concern. Do you have any questions regarding the referrals or the documentation?
PATIENT: No. No questions. I’ve got everything I need. Thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Hartness. You’re welcome. I wish you all the best in your endeavors. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the future. .
