DOCTOR: Hi Ellan, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about it. Says it’s the only thing that helps her arthritis, and frankly, I’m starting to think she might be right. Though I still have my doubts, naturally. I just need a… certification, I believe she called it. To make it legal.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're looking into getting a certification for medical marijuana, potentially to help with some pain?
PATIENT: Pain, Doctor? Not I have pain. It’s more… preventative, shall we say? One hears things, you know. About it helping with… keeping well. And I wouldn’t want to be caught doing something illegal, now would I? Though, truthfully, I haven't experienced any discomfort myself that would require such a thing. It's just...prudence.
DOCTOR: Right, prudence. I understand. So, you’re interested in exploring medical marijuana as a preventative measure, and want to ensure you’re following all legal guidelines. To properly assess if it’s appropriate, even for preventative use, I'll need to ask a few questions about your medical history and current health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose so. Though I must say, I find it rather… odd, asking about one’s history for something one doesn’t have. Still, if it’s necessary… proceed. But please, keep it brief. I have a luncheon appointment this afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as quick as possible. First, let's start with any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see. Nothing terribly significant, no. I had my tonsils out when I was a girl, of course. And a rather nasty bout of the flu back in… oh, goodness, must have been the seventies. But nothing serious. I’ve always been remarkably healthy, thank goodness. Good genes, you know. My mother lived to be ninety-three.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And have you ever been hospitalized for anything, even for a short stay?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. Hospitals are… dreadful places. Full of germs and… people. I avoid them whenever possible. A brief stay? Absolutely not. I’ve always taken excellent care of myself. Plenty of rest, a balanced diet… and a very good doctor for many years. Though, he retired last year, unfortunately. That's why I'm here with you, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to shellfish, but nothing that requires an EpiPen or anything so dramatic. Really, I can eat almost anything. Though I do try to avoid anything too… processed. It’s simply not refined, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. Just a small dose of potassium each morning. My friend, Eloise, she swears by it for her blood pressure. And occasionally, a multivitamin. Just to be on the safe side, you understand. But nothing regular, truly. I prefer to get my nutrients from my food, whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, potassium and a multivitamin. That's good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family history… Honestly, Doctor, it’s rather depressing. My Aunt Beatrice had… a touch of rheumatism, I believe. And my cousin, Reginald, he suffered from… nerves. Very sensitive man, Reginald. Always worrying. But nothing truly serious, no. Mostly just… frail constitutions. And a tendency to overthink things, I’m afraid. It's a common trait in our family, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. And regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really. I am a woman of refinement. Smoke? Drink? Recreational drugs? The very idea! I might enjoy a small glass of sherry with dinner on occasion, a very small glass, mind you. But that is hardly… recreational. And certainly, I would never engage in anything… untoward. I assure you. It’s simply… not done.
DOCTOR: Of course, I apologize for asking. Just covering all bases. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a general overview of your health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Well… I suppose. Though I must say, I have always been rather particular about my personal space. And I do hope it won’t be too… intrusive. Just a general overview, you said? Nothing… undignified, I trust?
DOCTOR: Certainly not. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a brief look in your ears and throat. Let's start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Very well. But please, be gentle. I do have sensitive wrists, you know. And do tell me if it’s going to be… tight. I dislike surprises. It’s the sherry, I suspect. It lowers one’s tolerance for… constriction. Though it is a very good sherry.
DOCTOR: I will be as gentle as possible. It will feel a little snug for a moment. Just relax your arm. 130 over 80. That's within a normal range. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let me quickly check your ears and throat. Open wide, please. Everything looks normal there as well.
PATIENT: Hmm. Very efficient. Though I do wish you’d explained what you were looking for. It’s rather unsettling, having someone peer into one’s mouth without a proper explanation. So, what does all of this… signify? Are you going to approve my request for this… certification, or not? I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Well, physically, everything seems to be in good order. However, given that you don't have any current medical conditions that would typically warrant medical marijuana use, and you're seeking it as a preventative measure… it's not something I can readily recommend or certify. It’s not standard medical practice, and there’s limited research supporting its use for preventative purposes. I wouldn’t want to put you in a position where you’re potentially using a medication unnecessarily, or risk any unforeseen side effects. While it may be legal in some areas, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s appropriate for everyone. Would you be open to discussing some other preventative health strategies, such as diet and exercise, that have more established benefits?
PATIENT: Diet and exercise? Really, Doctor. Is that all you have to offer? I assure you, I maintain a perfectly adequate lifestyle. I eat a balanced diet, and I take a brisk walk in the garden each morning. This isn’t about… lifestyle. It’s about prudence, as I explained before. My daughter, Eloise, she benefits greatly from this… marijuana, and frankly, I’d like to explore all available options for maintaining my well-being. It sounds as though you are simply unwilling to consider anything outside of your… conventional practices. Perhaps I should seek a second opinion. Someone more… open-minded.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ellan. And I respect your desire to explore all options. I'm not unwilling to consider, but my role as a physician is to provide evidence-based care, and that’s where my guidance lies. Given your circumstances, and the limited evidence for preventative use, I can't ethically provide a certification. However, if you’re still interested, I can provide you with some resources about the potential risks and benefits of medical marijuana so you can make an informed decision. And I can certainly connect you with other physicians who may have different perspectives. Would either of those be helpful?
PATIENT: Resources? Other physicians? Honestly, Doctor, it's all rather… tedious. I came here for a certification, not a lecture on evidence-based care and a list of alternative doctors. It seems you’re intent on obstructing my progress, rather than assisting me. Very well. I think I've heard enough. Thank you for your time. Though, frankly, it has been a rather disappointing experience. I shall take my chances elsewhere. .
DOCTOR: I understand. I apologize that I couldn’t fulfill your request. I wish you all the best in finding a healthcare provider who can better meet your needs. If you change your mind, or have any other health concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out.
