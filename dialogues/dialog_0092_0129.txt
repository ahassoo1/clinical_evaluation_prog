DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I haven't got all day, so let's just get on with it. It's my stool, alright? It's black. Like...tar. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking them for years. That's it. Is that enough information for you?
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Hatchard. I understand you're concerned about the color of your stool – black and tarry, as you described – and that you take pain medication for your arthritis. That is important information. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this change in your stool?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't know exactly when. It just…started. Probably a week or so ago, maybe longer. I don't spend my days examining my…well, you get the idea. It's black, and it's not normal. Is that what you need to know? I really don't see why it's such a big deal. People have black stools sometimes, don't they?
DOCTOR: You're right, Ms. Hatchard, people can have black stools sometimes, but it's important to investigate why it's happening. It can be a sign of bleeding in the upper digestive tract, which is why we need to rule out any serious causes. When you say it started a week or so ago, has it been consistent – meaning every stool is black – or is it intermittent?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t go scaring me with talk of bleeding! Honestly, doctors these days… always jumping to the worst conclusion. It’s mostly black, yes. Some days it’s…darker than others, I suppose. Not bright red, thankfully. And sometimes, it's...well, a normal color. But not often. Look, I eat pretty normally. Maybe it's something I ate? Though I can't think of anything dark enough to cause this. I just want a quick answer, really. Is it dangerous? Can I keep taking my pills?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hatchard, and I apologize if I caused any alarm. It's good that it's not consistently black, and that it's not bright red. However, even intermittent black stools warrant investigation. The pain pills you’re taking for your arthritis can contribute to stomach irritation and, in some cases, bleeding. But we need to rule out other potential causes as well. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions, and then I’ll need to perform a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, more questions? And a physical exam? Really? Look, I’m not a fan of doctors poking around. I’m 73 years old, my body isn’t exactly a masterpiece anymore. But fine, ask your questions. Just make it quick. And don't expect me to remember everything perfectly, alright? My memory isn't what it used to be. Is it about my diet? Because like I said, I eat pretty normally. Steak, potatoes, vegetables… you know, regular food.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Hatchard. I understand. We’ll take it slowly, and I'll keep it as brief as possible. And no worries about remembering everything perfectly; just do your best. Let’s start with your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis is bad enough, thank you very much. Honestly, it's a constant pain. Other than that… let me think. I had my gallbladder removed years ago. Maybe 20 years ago? And I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been under control with medication for… oh, goodness, I don't even remember how long. And… I think that's it. Nothing major, really. I’m a pretty healthy person for my age, you know. I used to be very active, but the arthritis has slowed me down a bit. What does any of this have to do with my stool, anyway?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hatchard. That's helpful information. The gallbladder removal and the high blood pressure are good to know. Both of those conditions, and the medication you take for them, can sometimes have an impact on the digestive system. Now, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication and the pain pills?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens, let me see… besides those two, um… I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said my levels were low. And I think that’s it. Maybe sometimes a little something for my heartburn, but not regularly. It’s a little pink tablet… I can't remember the name of it. Honestly, I have so many pills, it's hard to keep track. My husband usually handles that. He's the organized one. Can we please get this over with? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: We're getting there, Ms. Hatchard. The vitamin D and occasional heartburn medication are good to know. Now, just a few quick questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family had any history of stomach ulcers, colon cancer, or other digestive problems?
PATIENT: Oh, good gracious. Family history? Really? That’s going back a long way. My mother… she had a bit of everything, I suppose. Nothing specific that I remember about the stomach. She died of a heart attack, as I recall. My father… he was a smoker, if that matters. He had lung cancer, naturally. And my brother… he had high cholesterol. Honestly, I don’t keep track of all that. It’s depressing. Look, are we almost done with the questions? My bottom is starting to get sore.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hatchard, we are almost finished with the questions. Thank you for sharing that information, even though it’s not always easy to recall. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I get a bit of a rash sometimes if I eat strawberries, but it's not a serious allergy. Just a little itchy. And I can’t take penicillin, I think. I had a bad reaction to it when I was younger. That's about it. Honestly, I'm pretty lucky. I don't have many health problems. Except for this arthritis, of course. And now this black stool. Can we move on to the exam already? I want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. No more questions, I promise. Let’s move on to the physical exam. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I’ll gently press on your belly to check for any tenderness. I’ll also check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But be gentle, alright? And don’t take too long. I don’t like being poked and prodded. Honestly, doctors these days… always making a fuss over nothing. Just get it over with. And please tell me what you’re doing as you go. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. I will explain everything as I go. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This helps me listen for any unusual sounds, like gurgling or rumbling, which can indicate a problem. I’m listening on both sides now. Sounds are present and normal. Next, I'm going to gently press on your belly to check for any tenderness or masses. I'm starting on your right side now… any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, nothing on the right. Just... don't press too hard, alright? My stomach's a bit sensitive. And honestly, this whole thing feels unnecessary. I’ve had a stomach ache before, it's probably just something I ate. I'm telling you, doctors these days… they always overreact. Keep going, just be careful. And hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay, moving to the left side now... Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, nothing on the left either. Honestly, it just feels like you're poking around for no reason. My stomach feels fine. A little bloated, maybe, but that's probably just from dinner. Can we please be done with this exam now? I have errands to run, you know. And I'm starting to get impatient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. I didn’t detect any significant tenderness or masses during the exam. Your abdomen is slightly distended, which could be related to bloating, as you mentioned. Your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72, and temperature is 98.6, which are all within normal limits. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I’d like to order a few tests to help determine the cause of your black stools. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, for goodness sake. Not more poking and prodding, are there? Honestly, this is ridiculous. What kind of tests are we talking about? Blood work? A stool sample? Because I'm not digging around in that for anyone. I'm 73 years old, I don't have time for this. Just tell me if it's serious or not, alright? I need a quick answer, not a whole battery of tests. I just want to know if I can keep taking my pain pills.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hatchard. We'll keep it as simple as possible. I’m recommending a complete blood count to check for anemia, which can be a sign of bleeding, and a fecal occult blood test to check for hidden blood in your stool. The FOBT involves collecting a small stool sample – it’s a pretty simple process, and we can provide you with a kit and clear instructions. The blood work can be done right here in the clinic. As for the pain pills, I recommend temporarily stopping them until we get the test results back, just to be cautious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Stopping my pain pills?! Absolutely not! I can barely get out of bed without them, let alone run my errands. Are you kidding me? That’s unacceptable. I need those pills. Honestly, doctors these days… they don’t understand anything. Just give me something for the stool, alright? Something to stop it from being black. I don’t want to stop my pills, and I don’t want to dig around in that for a sample. What’s the point of tests if I have to stop my medication and jump through hoops? This is ridiculous. I'm going to get a second opinion.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Hatchard, and I apologize for the inconvenience. However, stopping the pain pills temporarily is a precautionary measure to help us determine if they are contributing to the bleeding. It’s important to rule out all potential causes before continuing any medication that could be masking a serious problem. I strongly recommend getting the tests done, even if it's just to put your mind at ease. But if you absolutely refuse, I will document your decision in your chart. However, I cannot recommend continuing the pain pills without knowing the cause of your black stools. Would you like me to explain the risks and benefits of continuing the pain pills without further investigation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness gracious. You're trying to scare me, aren't you? Risks and benefits? Just tell me straight out. What happens if I keep taking the pills? Will I get sick? Will I die? Honestly, this is just awful. I'm 73 years old, I've lived a long life. I don't need a lecture about risks and benefits. Just tell me if it's going to kill me or not. And then tell me if I can go back to taking my pills. I'm tired of this whole thing. I just want a simple answer. And I want it now. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, I understand your frustration and anxiety. I would never try to scare you. The risk of continuing the pain pills without knowing the cause of your black stools is that they could be masking a serious underlying problem, such as a bleeding ulcer or colon cancer. If left untreated, these conditions can become very dangerous. I cannot definitively tell you whether continuing the pills will "kill you" – that’s impossible to say without further investigation. However, I strongly advise against it. I recommend we schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the test results and create a plan. I would also be happy to provide you with a referral to a gastroenterologist for a second opinion. Would you like me to do that?
