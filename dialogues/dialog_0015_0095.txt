DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s rather inconvenient having to come in for this. I woke up yesterday and…well, I can’t hear out of my left ear. And my face feels…droopy on that side. It’s quite alarming, really. I don't understand why these things happen.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, you say. Right. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping... that is concerning, Ms. Nissenbaum. When you say "yesterday," can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Let me think… It was after breakfast. Yes, definitely after breakfast. Around… 9:30, perhaps? I had toast and a cup of tea. It was a perfectly normal morning until then. Honestly, I don’t see why I need to give a detailed account of my breakfast, but if you must know.
DOCTOR: It’s important to establish a timeline, Ms. Nissenbaum. Every detail can be relevant. So, after breakfast around 9:30 AM, you noticed the hearing loss and facial drooping simultaneously?
PATIENT: No, not simultaneously. The hearing loss was first. I thought maybe I just had something stuck in my ear. I tried to clean it, you know, with a…a cotton swab. Didn’t help. Then, a little while after that – maybe half an hour? – I noticed my face felt…strange. Like it was pulling to one side. It’s rather upsetting, frankly. I haven’t been this inconvenienced in years.
DOCTOR: And you used a cotton swab to attempt to clear the ear…Ms. Nissenbaum, I strongly advise against using any objects in your ear canal. Now, regarding this "strange" feeling – can you describe it more precisely?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t lecture me about cotton swabs. I’ve been cleaning my ears perfectly well for fifty-nine years, thank you very much. As for the feeling… it's hard to explain. Like half my face is…frozen. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it feels…weak. And when I try to smile, it just…doesn't work properly. It’s quite unattractive, I assure you. I’m a radiologist, you know. Appearance is…important.
DOCTOR: A radiologist. Interesting. Alright. And this weakness… is it just when you smile, or does it affect other movements – blinking, closing your eye, speaking?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… it is a little harder to close my left eye all the way. And maybe my speech is a little…slurred? I hadn't really noticed, to be honest. I assumed it was just fatigue. I’ve been quite busy at the hospital, you know. Important cases. Not everyone can read an X-ray, you see. It’s…a skill. And honestly, all this questioning is rather tedious. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Tedious or not, Ms. Nissenbaum, your symptoms are potentially serious. Sudden hearing loss and facial weakness – especially with difficulty closing your eye and possible slurred speech – requires a thorough evaluation. I need to perform a neurological exam. Can you please sit up and follow my instructions?
PATIENT: A neurological exam? Honestly. I’m a doctor myself, you know. I’ve seen neurological exams. Is this absolutely necessary? I have patients waiting, you see. Very important patients. But… fine. Do what you must. Just make it quick, please. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'll be as efficient as possible. First, I'm going to check your cranial nerves. Can you tell me if you're experiencing any dizziness or double vision?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Double vision? Absolutely not. I have excellent vision, thank you very much. I need to be able to read those scans, you see. And I certainly haven’t got time for blurry vision. It’s all rather…elementary, isn't it? Now, get on with it. I’m sure you’ve seen this a thousand times before.
DOCTOR: Very well. Follow my penlight with your eyes. Don't move your head. Your left pupil appears slightly constricted compared to your right. Now, can you raise both eyebrows?
PATIENT: Constricted? Honestly, I don’t see anything wrong with my pupils. They seem perfectly normal to me. And yes, I can raise my eyebrows. There. Perfectly fine. Now, is that all? I really must get back to the hospital. I have a very complex case awaiting my attention.
DOCTOR: It is not "perfectly fine," Ms. Nissenbaum. There's a definite weakness on the left side. Now, smile for me. And stick your tongue out. Your tongue deviates slightly to the left, and there’s some atrophy on the left side. This is consistent with……Bell's Palsy, although we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m concerned about a possible stroke.
PATIENT: A stroke?! Now you're just being alarmist. I feel perfectly fine, aside from the hearing and the…slight droop. I haven't got any of the other symptoms of a stroke. I read medical journals, you know. I know what the symptoms are. This is ridiculous. I need a second opinion. And frankly, I think I deserve an apology.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your skepticism, but your symptoms warrant immediate investigation. While you may be a radiologist, you are my patient, and I must act in your best interest. I am ordering an MRI immediately to rule out a stroke or other central nervous system lesion. Until we have the results, I am referring you to the Emergency Department for further evaluation. This is not optional. We must act quickly.
