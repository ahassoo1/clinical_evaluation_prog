DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I suppose I’m here because…well, it’s getting harder to breathe when I lie down flat. It’s quite bothersome, really. I’d like to get it sorted out if possible. I don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: No, no waste of time at all, Ms. Vanderwiele. It's good you came in to get this checked out. Difficulty breathing is never something to ignore. Can you tell me a little more about this… when did you first notice it getting harder to breathe when lying flat?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it started… oh, maybe three, four months ago? It was subtle at first, just a little bit more effort. But it's gotten progressively worse. Now, if I try to lie completely flat, it feels like… like there’s a weight on my chest, and I have to really concentrate to take a good breath. It doesn’t happen when I’m sitting up, or even leaning back a bit. Just when I’m flat.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it started gradually about three or four months ago, and it’s specifically when you’re lying flat that you notice the difficulty. A weight on your chest, you said. Do you experience that feeling at any other time, or just when lying down?
PATIENT: Just when lying down, Doctor. Sitting, standing, walking… no trouble at all. It's a very specific sensation. And it's not… a cough, or wheezing, or anything like that. Just… difficulty. Like I said, a weight. It’s rather inconvenient, especially trying to get a good night’s sleep. I prefer a firm mattress, you know, and it’s harder to get comfortable now.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is that difficulty constant when you are lying flat, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… constant, I would say. Once I’m lying flat, it’s always there. It doesn't come in waves, or anything like that. It's just… present. I sometimes try propping myself up with extra pillows, and that helps a little, but it’s not ideal. It’s a rather… unsettling feeling, truthfully. I just want to know what’s causing it, and if there’s something that can be done. I’m a practical woman, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite distressing, Ms. Vanderwiele. Alright, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have high blood pressure, it’s been managed with medication for…oh, must be fifteen years now? And I had my gallbladder removed, years and years ago. Otherwise, I’ve been quite healthy, all things considered. I don't take many medications, just the one for blood pressure. And I have Medicare, if that’s relevant. I try to keep active, walk when I can, but this breathing makes it harder, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication for fifteen years, and a gallbladder removal. Good to know. And just to confirm, you said one medication for the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, just the one. A small, white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. My doctor – Doctor Ramirez, before he retired – always said it was keeping things stable. I haven’t had any problems with it, as far as I know. I’m very regular with my appointments, and I always follow instructions. I'm not one to skip a dose. It's just… this breathing issue is new, and it’s quite worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all. Never had one in my life, thankfully. I used to help my grandmother with her herbs, you see, and she always said I had a strong constitution. I've never reacted badly to anything, as far as I know. Just this breathing, and it’s become quite a nuisance, truthfully. I’d like to get it sorted out if at all possible. I don’t want it to progress any further.
DOCTOR: Good to know, no allergies. Now, do you have any family history of heart or lung problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… my mother’s side… my grandfather had something with his lungs, a cough that wouldn't go away. I don't remember the specifics, it was a long time ago. And my father… he had a weak heart, they said. He passed away when he was in his seventies. But other than that, not much that I’m aware of. It’s a rather large family, you know, and I don't keep track of everyone’s ailments. I just know what affected my immediate family.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a grandfather with a chronic cough and a father with a history of heart problems. That’s helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions, Ms. Vanderwiele. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked, before he…well, before he passed, but I always made him smoke outside. It was a terrible habit, truthfully. I always believed in fresh air and good health. So, no, I’ve never smoked, and I don’t appreciate being around it either. It always made me cough. It's a rather silly question, isn't it? I'm a Zuni woman, we respect the air and the land.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Ms. Vanderwiele. It's important to ask. Now, and do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on special occasions. Nothing regular, certainly. It’s not a habit. I prefer a nice cup of chamomile tea, truthfully. It helps me relax. I don’t drink very often, perhaps once or twice a month, if that. And it’s never to excess, I assure you. I'm a sensible woman, Doctor. I don't go in for wild parties or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional wine, a glass with dinner. Thank you. Now, Ms. Vanderwiele, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. The sooner we figure this out, the better, I always say. I’ll do whatever you need me to do. Please, proceed. I just hope it’s nothing serious. I have a lot of things I still want to do, you see. I have grandchildren I want to see grow up. So, yes, please, examine me.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Alright, if you could just sit back and relax. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Just breathe normally. Okay. I'm hearing a slight…diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes of both lungs. And your heart sounds are a bit…distant. I’m also checking your blood pressure now… 140/90. That's a little elevated. And your pulse is 78 and regular. These findings suggest some possible congestion in your lungs, and your blood pressure is a little high. It’s not dramatic, but it warrants further investigation. Now, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray and an EKG, you say? Yes, alright. If that’s what’s needed. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I want to know what’s going on, and I want to get it sorted out. I have Medicare, so I assume that will cover it. Just tell me what I need to do, and where I need to go. The sooner the better, truthfully. I just want to get back to my normal routine. I have a quilt I'm working on, you see, and I'd like to finish it before the winter comes.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, Medicare should cover those tests. Okay, I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, schedule those for you right away. She’ll give you the paperwork and instructions. The X-ray will be done in the radiology department, just down the hall. The EKG will be done right here in the office. It shouldn’t take too long. While we’re waiting for the results, I’m going to prescribe you a low dose diuretic to help with the fluid. It may help improve your breathing. We’ll see how you respond to that. Now, I want to emphasize that these are just preliminary findings. We need the results of the tests to get a clearer picture. But these results will help me determine if we should think about seeing a cardiologist to have a more in-depth look at your heart. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Oh my. Well, I suppose if that’s what’s necessary. I just… I’ve always been quite healthy, you see. I try to take care of myself. But I understand. If that’s what’s best, then I’ll do it. A diuretic, you say? Alright. Just tell me what it looks like, and how much I should take. And what are the side effects, if any? I always like to know what I’m putting into my body. And I'll be sure to ask Sarah any questions I have when she schedules those tests. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate it. I just want to be able to breathe comfortably again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Vanderwiele. It’s important to be informed. The diuretic is called Furosemide, 20 milligrams, one tablet each morning. It’s a small, white pill. The main side effect to watch out for is increased urination, so you’ll want to be near a bathroom. It can also cause some dizziness, so take it easy when you first start taking it. Here’s the information. Sarah will go over everything with you as well. We’ll get the results of the tests back within a day or two, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if your breathing gets significantly worse, or if you experience any chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. Just the diuretic and those tests, then a follow-up appointment. Alright. And the emergency room if things get worse. I’ll remember that. I just… I'm hoping it’s nothing serious. I just want to get back to my quilting. But I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor Smetak. You’ve put my mind at ease, at least a little. I’ll see Sarah now, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Vanderwiele. I understand your concerns, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to ask Sarah any questions you have. And please, call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
