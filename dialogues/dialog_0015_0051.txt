DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's... well, it's about my blood. You see, I need to know what kind it is. My… my husband, he used to always say, "Nini, you should know your blood type." He was a practical man. I just… never got around to it, and now… well, now he's gone. And something came up where I need to know. It’s a bit silly, really.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Nini. Knowing your blood type can be quite important. Though, I must admit, it’s an unusual reason to come to family medicine. Typically, we determine blood type in the context of pregnancy, surgery, or if there’s been a significant trauma. But we can certainly address this for you. Just to clarify, you don’t have any current medical concerns prompting this request besides wanting to fulfill your husband’s wish?
PATIENT: No, no current problems, thankfully. Just… this thing came up with the family. Some paperwork, you see? And it asked for it. It’s probably nothing, really. My memory isn’t what it used to be, but I think… I think it has something to do with an inheritance. A distant cousin, maybe? It's all a bit foggy. He mentioned something about needing it for… for legal reasons.
DOCTOR: Right. Legal reasons. Understandable, though still not a typical presenting complaint. And it’s good you’re addressing this now. Before we proceed with a blood type test, I just want to rule out anything else that might be causing you concern. Have you experienced any unusual fatigue, bruising easily, frequent infections, or shortness of breath lately?
PATIENT: Oh, my dear, let me think… Fatigue, yes, a little. But at my age, who doesn’t get tired? Bruising… not really. I’m a bit clumsy, so I get the occasional bump, but nothing more than usual. Infections… hmm. I had a little cold last winter, but everyone gets those, don’t they? Shortness of breath… sometimes when I climb the stairs, but that's just my old knees acting up. They’ve been bothering me for years. I think it's just getting old, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Nini. It’s good you’re aware of these changes. While these symptoms can be related to aging, it’s important to consider other possibilities, even if it’s just to rule them out. To be thorough, and before we order a simple blood type test, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and order a complete blood count . This will give us a baseline and help to identify any potential issues that might be contributing to your fatigue or shortness of breath. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, a proper exam? Well, if you think it’s best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I haven’t had one in… goodness, I don’t even remember. It’s just… I don’t want to bother you with old lady problems if it’s nothing. But if it will make me feel better, and it’s what you recommend… then yes, please. Do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Nini. Let's start with your vital signs, and then we'll move on to a quick listen of your heart and lungs, and a general physical assessment. Please, have a seat on the table. First, could you please tell me your height and weight, to the best of your recollection?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a bit tricky. I used to be taller, you know? I was quite the dancer in my youth. Let me think… I believe I’m around… five foot eight? Maybe five foot nine? And weight… well, I try not to think about that too much. Perhaps… one-hundred and forty-one pounds? It fluctuates, you see. It’s hard to keep track. I used to weigh less, naturally. But I enjoy my food!
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll verify those measurements shortly. Now, let's begin with listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me, and exhale slowly. I’m listening for any unusual sounds. Everything sounds… reasonably normal so far. Now, I’ll listen to your lungs. Again, please take a deep breath. Breath sounds are a bit diminished, which isn’t uncommon with age, but we’ll keep that in mind. Now, let’s check your pulse and blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. I’ll try to breathe deeply. It's not always easy, you know? Old lungs don’t cooperate like they used to. I used to sing, you see. Soprano. But that was a long, long time ago. Diminished breath sounds… is that bad? I’m probably just worrying needlessly. My husband always said I was a hypochondriac.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 72 and regular. While not alarming, the blood pressure is slightly elevated, something we can discuss further later. And diminished breath sounds, as I mentioned, are fairly common with age, but it's important to be aware of it. It simply means the airflow is slightly reduced. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Normal reflexes. And finally, I'll just take a quick look in your ears. Ears look clear. No signs of infection or excessive wax buildup. Alright, Ms. Nini. That completes the basic physical exam. Now, to get back to your original request, I'll order a blood type test and a complete blood count. This will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and determine your blood type. It will likely take a few hours to get the results back. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… that’s good. Everything sounds alright, doesn't it? Though, slightly elevated blood pressure… I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. I do love my salt. No, I don’t think I have any questions, Doctor. Just… thank you. For taking the time to listen to an old woman’s worries. And for trying to figure out my blood type. My husband would be pleased.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Nini. It’s my job to address your concerns, regardless of how small they may seem. And while your blood pressure is slightly elevated, it’s not immediately concerning. We can discuss lifestyle modifications, such as reducing your salt intake, if the results confirm the elevation. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw your blood. After the results are back, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any allergies to any medications or latex?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. I don’t believe so. Never had any problems with medicine before. Though, I do get a bit of a rash sometimes when I wear cheap jewelry. But that’s not really an allergy, is it? It’s just… sensitive skin. No, no allergies to medicine, as far as I know. I’ve always been quite sturdy, you see. Rarely get sick.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known medication allergies. Good. And you’re currently not taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't like taking pills, if I can help it. I prefer a cup of chamomile tea when I'm feeling a bit under the weather. It's my grandmother’s recipe. Very soothing, you see. No, no medications. Just tea.
DOCTOR: Very well. No current medications. To summarize, you’re here to determine your blood type, you have no known allergies, aren't currently taking any medications, and you’ve reported some mild fatigue, slightly elevated blood pressure, and diminished breath sounds. The lab technician should be with you shortly. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them in more detail. Do you have any other questions for me before I leave you to prepare for the blood draw?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old woman ramble on. I’m just… relieved to finally get this sorted out. My husband… he would be so pleased.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Nini. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get those results to you as quickly as possible. Please let the nurse know if you have any concerns while you're waiting. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
