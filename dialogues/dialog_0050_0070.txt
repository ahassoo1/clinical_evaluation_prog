DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too. Doctor… right? Yes. Well, I just… moved here. New place. Need a doctor, you know? Medicare said I should come. Social healthcare, they call it. Not sure what that means. Just need someone to… check things. Old age, I guess. Everything hurts a little these days.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. A general check-up is perfectly reasonable when establishing care with a new physician, and especially important as we age. “Social healthcare” simply refers to the funding mechanism for programs like Medicare; you needn’t concern yourself with the specifics. To begin, could you elaborate on these aches and pains you mentioned?
PATIENT: Aches and pains… everywhere! Back, mostly. And knees. Used to be a dancer, you know? Long time ago. Not so good now. Everything creaks. It's just… old. I don't remember anything specific that caused it. Just… happened over time. Always working, always moving. Makeup, you know? Very tiring.
DOCTOR: A dancer, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! A dancer. A good dancer. In Russia, of course. Before… everything. Now, just makeup. For the theatre. Local plays, mostly. Not fancy like before. It's… enough. You understand? Not important anymore, the dancing. Just… old.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, it is not uncommon for prior physical activity – even strenuous activity like professional dancing – to contribute to joint discomfort later in life. And, of course, the demands of your current profession can also take a toll. Let’s try to pinpoint the nature of this discomfort. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the pain in your back and knees, currently?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… hmph. Complicated. Right now? Back is… maybe a four? Not terrible. A little ache. Knees are worse. Maybe a six? When I walk up the stairs, it’s… unpleasant. Sometimes a little sharp. Not always, though. Depends on the weather, I think. Everything is connected, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, weather can certainly play a role. And I appreciate you quantifying the pain, Mr. Szmyd. A 'six' is… significant. Now, besides the pain, are you experiencing any other symptoms in your back or knees?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? Fever? No fever. Not sick. Just… old. Sometimes they feel… stiff. In the morning, especially. Hard to bend. And… clicking. Knees click. A lot. Is that bad? Everything is falling apart, I think.
DOCTOR: Stiffness in the morning and clicking sounds are… common occurrences with joint degeneration, Mr. Szmyd. However, we need to ascertain the extent of this degeneration. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in either your back or knees?
PATIENT: Swelling? Redness? Let me see… No, not really. Not that I've noticed. Sometimes my knees feel… warm. But that could be the weather, yes? Everything feels warm these days. Hot, even. I don’t pay much attention. Old people get warm, I think.
DOCTOR: A reasonable observation, Mr. Szmyd. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis, or any other condition affecting your joints?
PATIENT: Arthritis… hmph. Doctors always ask about that. I don't think so. Maybe? A long time ago, in Russia, a doctor said something about my elbows. But I don't remember. Lots of doctors, lots of pills. It was… complicated. I mostly ignored it. Just kept dancing. And working.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s not uncommon for patients to have incomplete recall of past medical diagnoses. And, frankly, many of these diagnoses are… overstated. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… Yes. A long time ago. Appendix. In Russia, of course. Very small surgery. And… maybe something with my teeth? I have many fillings. Does that count? I don't remember much. They give you… something. Makes you forget.
DOCTOR: An appendectomy is relevant, Mr. Szmyd. Dental work, while important, does not typically factor into our current assessment. Now, regarding medications—are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmph. Let me see. Just… something for my blood pressure. The little white pill. And sometimes, when my back really hurts, I take… ibuprofen? Or something like that. The red one. I buy it at the drugstore. And… vitamins. For old people. Vitamin D, I think. And… fish oil? My daughter told me to take it.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication, ibuprofen as needed, Vitamin D, and fish oil. Noted. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. Not that I know of. Maybe a little… itchy sometimes. When I eat strawberries. But that’s just… strawberries. Everyone gets itchy from strawberries, I think. Nothing serious. I’ve eaten a lot of things in my life. Lots of different foods. You have to eat, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, one must eat. Now, finally, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never. Horrible habit. My mother smoked, it was terrible. No, never. Drink? Sometimes a little vodka. For… celebrations. Not much anymore. Old age, you know. And… drugs? Never. What kind of question is that? I am a respectable man. Makeup artist.
DOCTOR: A perfectly reasonable question, Mr. Szmyd. It is important to have a comprehensive understanding of a patient's lifestyle. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. I will need you to remove your shoes and socks, and I would like to assess your range of motion, reflexes, and examine your knees and back. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Hmph. Examination. Of course. Go ahead. But don't expect much. Everything is old and creaky. And cold. My feet are always cold. Take your time, I suppose. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the table, and we will begin. I’m noting some tenderness to palpation along the lumbar spine, and limited range of motion. No radicular symptoms present. I'm detecting moderate crepitus in both knees and mild tenderness along the medial joint line. No significant effusion is present. Range of motion is limited, particularly with flexion. Your patellar reflex is 2+ bilaterally. As expected, there is some degree of degenerative changes present. Further imaging would be helpful to determine the extent of the damage.
PATIENT: Imaging? What kind of imaging? X-rays? I don't like those. Too much radiation. And it won't fix anything, will it? Everything is just… old. I know that already. You don't need a picture to tell me that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, imaging—specifically, X-rays—are not for fixing anything. They are for assessing the degree of arthritis and ruling out any other underlying pathology. While there is a minimal radiation risk, the benefits of obtaining a clear diagnosis outweigh that risk in this case. I would also like to order some blood work to check your inflammatory markers and rule out any other potential causes of joint pain. Would you agree to that?
PATIENT: Hmph. Blood work, more pictures… It's always something. Fine. Do what you have to do. But don't expect miracles. It's just… old. I'll go get the blood taken, I suppose. Where do I go? And will it hurt? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: The phlebotomist is just down the hall, in room three. It will be a quick procedure, Mr. Szmyd. A minimal amount of discomfort, I assure you. Once the blood work and X-rays are completed, we can discuss the results and formulate a treatment plan. For now, I recommend continuing to take ibuprofen as needed for pain relief, and I will write you a prescription for a stronger anti-inflammatory if the ibuprofen is insufficient. I also suggest maintaining a healthy weight and engaging in low-impact exercise, such as swimming or walking, to help improve your joint function. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmph. What good would questions do? It's just… old. No, I don't think so. Just… tell me when I can go. And how long will these pictures take? I have a play rehearsal tonight. It's not important, but… still. And who will read these pictures? Are you a good reader?
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Szmyd, I am a perfectly competent radiologist reader. The X-rays should take approximately fifteen minutes to complete. As for the blood work, the results typically take 24-48 hours to return. We can schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening pain, fever, or any other concerning symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. I will have the nurse draw your blood and send you for the X-rays now. Do you require assistance getting up, or are you able to do so on your own?
PATIENT: Hmph. I can manage. I am not completely helpless, you know. Just… slow. Yes, very slow. Send the nurse, then. And tell her to be gentle with the needle. My veins are… difficult. Old people have difficult veins.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will inform the nurse. Mr. Szmyd, while I understand your skepticism, I assure you that my intention is to provide you with the best possible care. Sometimes, accepting a diagnosis is the first step towards managing a condition and improving one’s quality of life.
