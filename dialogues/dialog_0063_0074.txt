DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. My blood pressure’s been actin’ up, that’s what. Been readin’ high at home, and my daughter, bless her heart, she told me to come get it checked proper. Don't like bein' fussed over, but she worries.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, daughters often do. “Actin’ up,” you say. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. It feels normal most of the time, I reckon. But when I get to doin’ somethin’… like bakin’, or even just walkin’ around the house, it feels kinda tight. Not painful, just… there. And the machine shows higher numbers then. I don't really understand all them numbers, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Numbers are important, Ms. Steines. Do you happen to know what those numbers are?
PATIENT: Shoot, no, I don't. My daughter writes ‘em down, but I just kinda hand her the paper. She says somethin’ about one bein' over a hundred and… well, I lose track. I’m ninety years old, Doctor. Things ain’t what they used to be. Sorry to be a bother.
DOCTOR: It's alright. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Let's not dwell on the numbers just yet. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this “tightness”?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that’s just bein’ old, I figure. And my head feels a little… fuzzy now and then. But I’ve always been a bit forgetful, so I don’t know if that's new. Don’t reckon it’s anything to do with the pressure, if that makes sense. It’s just… old age creepin’ in, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Fuzzy,” you say. And how long has this been going on – this “fuzziness”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now. Maybe a few months, somethin’ like that. It comes and goes, y’see. Not every day. And not all day long, even on the days it is there. It's hard to pinpoint. I mostly just rest when it bothers me. Been doin’ that for years, really. It's like… waves. Comes in, goes out.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications for this, or for anything else, Ms. Steines?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis. Keeps my hands movin’ enough to bake, bless it. It’s a little white pill… can’t recall the name, now. My daughter fills my pill box every week. I don’t keep track of names, I just take ‘em when she tells me to. Is that bad? I'm sorry, I don’t mean to be difficult.
DOCTOR: No, it’s… not ideal. Do you know the dosage of this arthritis medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I wouldn’t have the slightest idea. It's a little tiny pill, that's all I know. She keeps a chart, like I said, with all the times and the amounts, but I don't bother myself with it. I let her handle the details. She’s good at that sort of thing. I just want to feel better, Doctor. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: We’ll see what we can do. Now, regarding your past medical history... have you ever been diagnosed with anything else?
PATIENT: Well, I had the flu somethin’ fierce when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, fallin’ off a horse… used to ride a lot back in the day. But nothin’ serious. Doctor, is this important? I feel alright, mostly. Just a little tired, and this pressure thing. I reckon it's just old age catchin' up to me. I don't like makin' a fuss. Maybe I should just go home and rest?
DOCTOR: We are attempting to ascertain if there is a medical issue that requires attention, Ms. Steines. Now, any surgeries?
PATIENT: Shoot, no, nothin’ like that. Never had any need for cuttin’ or stitchin’. I’ve been lucky, I reckon. Always ate my vegetables, and kept busy. Been bakin’ for… goodness, seventy years, maybe more! Used to bake for the whole town. Don't get around to it as much anymore, but I still enjoy it. Just this pressure thing makes it hard sometimes. It's frustrating, really. I just wanna keep bakin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take your blood pressure now, and we’ll proceed from there. Please remain seated and try to relax. I will need to take several readings. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to nothin’. My daughter always asks, but I always tell her no. Seems like a silly question to me, if you ain't never had trouble. But you go ahead and take your readin's, Doctor. I'll just sit here and try to relax, like you say. It's hard to relax when you're worried, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. First reading... 162 over 94. 168 over 96. 170 over 100. Hmm. That's… elevated. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now.
PATIENT: Goodness. That does sound high. I told my daughter somethin’ was wrong. My heart feels… kinda fluttery sometimes. Not painful, just… a little off. I’ve always had a fast heartbeat, though. Always been a nervous sort, I reckon. But go ahead and listen, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just tell me what’s wrong, if you can. I don’t like bein' left in the dark.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is elevated, slightly irregular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but diminished breath sounds at the bases. It's possible you're experiencing early signs of congestive heart failure. Ms. Steines, I believe you require further evaluation. I will order an EKG and a chest X-ray. We will also need to check your blood work, including electrolytes and a BNP level.
PATIENT: Goodness gracious. Congestive heart failure? That sounds awful. Is that… serious? I just wanted to get my blood pressure checked. I don’t want no fancy tests, and I certainly don't want no X-rays. I don’t understand all these words, and frankly, it's scaring me. Can't I just take a pill for the pressure and be done with it? I'm ninety years old, Doctor. Maybe it's just my time. I don’t want to go through all this fuss. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Steines, I understand your apprehension, but dismissing potential issues at your age is… unwise. We need to determine the cause of your elevated blood pressure and the possible heart complications. I’m ordering the tests regardless. My nurse will draw the blood now, and we will get you scheduled for the EKG and X-ray. These are standard procedures. .
