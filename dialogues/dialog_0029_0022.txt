DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's... well, my tummy. It feels big, you know? And I don't want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to. Everything just… feels off. I don't really remember when it started, exactly. A little bit at a time, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Tummy feels big” and not feeling hungry… and this has been coming on gradually. Can you tell me a little more about what “big” feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… like it’s full of… air, maybe? Not hard, not painful, just… puffy. Like a balloon, but not tight. And it's not just after I eat, it’s… most of the time now. It's hard to explain. I feel… uncomfortable, but not sick, if you understand. It's just… there.
DOCTOR: I think I understand. “Puffy”, uncomfortable but not painful… and constant, not just related to eating. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… oh, you mean… when I go to the bathroom? I… honestly, Doctor, I don't pay much attention to that anymore. Old lady problems, you know? Things just… happen. I don't think so, no. Not really any different. Maybe a little… less? But I forget things, so I can’t be sure. It's all a bit of a blur, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, “less frequent” but you're unsure. And you haven't noticed any blood or changes in the color of your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear. No, no blood. Everything looks… normal, I think. Like it always has. I really don’t look, Doctor. It's not something a lady… talks about. Sorry. I just… try not to notice those things. Makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright, no blood, normal appearance as far as you can tell. Okay. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… oh. I think so, yes. My clothes feel a little… looser. But I haven’t been trying to lose weight! I used to be a good cook, you know? Always making things for people. But now… I just don't have the appetite. It's not like I’m trying to be skinny or anything. It just… happens. I don’t weigh myself anymore. Too depressing, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, unintentional weight loss with decreased appetite. Let’s talk about your past medical history for a moment. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a hard question. So many years… I used to have… something with my heart, I think. A long time ago. But the doctors fixed it, I hope. And I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. But that’s healed now. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit fuzzy. I went to a lot of doctors when I was younger, but now… I try to take it easy. It’s just old age, I guess. I don't remember all the names of things.
DOCTOR: Alright, history of a heart condition that was treated and a previous wrist fracture. Okay. Any surgeries that you recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… The wrist, of course, when I fell. And… I think I had my gallbladder out, a long, long time ago. That was… scary, I think. But it was so long ago, I barely remember. Everything is just a blur these days, Doctor. I apologize. I'm not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: No, you're doing fine, Ms. McConnon. It's perfectly normal to have trouble remembering things from a long time ago. Okay, so wrist surgery and gallbladder removal. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mama… she had problems with her tummy, I think. Something bad. But I don't remember what it was. And my brother… he had a heart problem. I think it was different than mine. He wasn't a strong man, my brother. And my papa… he just… got old. That's all. Nobody talked much about sickness when I was young. It was… bad luck, they said. So I don’t really know what runs in the family. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay. History of family member with tummy problems and another with a heart condition, but limited details. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… just a little pill for my blood pressure, I think. The doctor gave it to me a while back. A small white one. And sometimes, when my joints are bad, I take something for the pain. But not much anymore. I forget the names of everything, Doctor. I just take what the doctor tells me to, when I remember. It's all in that little box in the kitchen, I think. A plastic box. Blue, maybe?
DOCTOR: Alright, medication for blood pressure and occasional pain relief. We'll try to get a more accurate list later. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to eat everything! Pickles, herring, all sorts of things. My mama always said I had a strong stomach. But now… I don't eat much of anything. So I haven't had much chance to be allergic to things lately. No, I don't think so. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam, Ms. McConnon, if that's alright with you. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll feel your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. That sounds fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. My bones get cold easily, you know? And I don’t like being poked and prodded. But if you think it’s necessary… go ahead. My tummy does feel funny. Just be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds a little… distant, but regular. Lungs are clear. Alright, and your abdomen is… soft, not particularly tender. There's some mild fullness, as you mentioned. No masses that I can feel at this time. I'm not feeling any significant enlargement of your liver or spleen. It sounds a little… tympanic, which could indicate some trapped gas. Alright. Based on what you've told me and this exam, I think we need to do some blood work and a scan of your abdomen to get a better idea of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, blood work… and a scan… That sounds… complicated. Is it very expensive, Doctor? I don’t have much money, you know. And I don’t like needles. But if it will help me feel better… I suppose. But please, Doctor, explain everything to me very slowly. I get confused easily. And if it's going to cost a lot… maybe we can just leave it, and I’ll try to eat a little more? My tummy is just a little bit big, after all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. McConnon. Let's talk about the tests first. The blood work will help us check your overall health and look for any signs of infection or anemia. It’s a standard test, and relatively quick. The scan—a CT scan of your abdomen—will give us a picture of your organs to see if we can identify the cause of the fullness you’re feeling. Regarding the cost, I’ll need to check with the billing department to give you an accurate estimate. We can discuss options if the cost is a concern. I don't want you to worry about that right now. We will explore all options to keep costs manageable. I’m concerned about the unintentional weight loss and fullness in your abdomen, so I want to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It's important to rule out anything serious. Would you be willing to let me order the blood work today?
PATIENT: Oh… a picture of my insides… that sounds frightening. But if you think it's important… alright. Blood work today… yes, I suppose. But please, Doctor, just take a little bit. I get dizzy easily, you know? And don’t let it hurt. And if it costs too much… we'll talk about it. Just promise me you won't do anything expensive without talking to me first. I'm a poor old lady, and I don’t want to get into trouble. And… can I have a cup of tea afterwards? It always makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. McConnon. I promise. We'll take just a small amount of blood, and I'll make sure the phlebotomist knows you get dizzy easily. They're very experienced and will be gentle. And absolutely, we will discuss all costs with you before proceeding with anything further. A cup of tea afterwards sounds lovely. I’ll have the nurse bring one for you after the blood work. Nurse, could you please come in and draw some blood for Ms. McConnon?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. You’re a kind man. And please, tell the nurse to be gentle. My veins are old and fragile, you know. And… I don’t like needles. But if it will help me feel better… I’ll try. Just… take your time. And… where do I sit for the blood work?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I'll speak to the nurse directly. She's very skilled and will be as gentle as possible. She'll take her time, I promise. The blood draw is done right over there, in that comfortable chair. They’ll have you sit comfortably and take your blood pressure before they start. It shouldn't take long at all. I’ll be right here if you need anything. Just let me or the nurse know. And remember, we’ll discuss the results of the blood work as soon as they're available. We’ll take things one step at a time. Do you need any help getting over to the chair?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I can walk. But thank you for offering. It’s… a bit of a walk, but I’m not completely helpless yet. Just… try not to leave me alone too long, Doctor. I get nervous when I'm alone. And… please, remind the nurse to be gentle. And maybe have a little something sweet afterwards? A cookie, perhaps? It always cheers me up. Now… let's get this over with. I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Nurse, Ms. McConnon is a little nervous about the blood draw. Could you please be extra gentle and take your time?
PATIENT: .
