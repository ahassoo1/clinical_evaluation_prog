DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I need some papers signed, actually. It’s for… verification of some health forms. I just want to get it over with, if that’s alright. It's a bit of a hassle, all this paperwork.
DOCTOR: Papers, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. They need a doctor to… confirm everything. I don’t really understand why they need a doctor for it, honestly. It’s just basic stuff, you know? Height, weight… things like that. But they insisted. Do you need me to get them for you? I have them in my bag.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do. It’s… policy, unfortunately. Just to have everything documented properly. It’s better to be thorough, even if it seems redundant. And frankly, I need to see what they’re asking for before I can just “confirm” anything. Bring them over when you're ready.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Here they are. It’s a mess, I warn you. I’ve had to fill out like, five copies of some of these. It’s all about my height and weight, mostly. And a list of… allergies, I think? Honestly, I don’t even remember what’s on half of these forms. I hope you can make sense of it.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's see… height, weight, allergies… Hmm. And what exactly is this for, Melvenia?
PATIENT: It's... for a program. A senior living program, actually. They need all this information before I can even be considered. It’s supposed to be a nice place, but the paperwork is… exhausting. They said something about needing a doctor's verification for everything, even things I already told them on the phone. It feels a little silly, if you ask me. Are you finding everything alright?
DOCTOR: Current medications… it’s blank. Melvenia, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh. Goodness. No, not really. Well… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, but it’s just over-the-counter. Ibuprofen, mostly. Nothing a doctor prescribed, if that makes a difference. I usually just get it at the drugstore. Should I write that down? I didn't think it was important enough to mention.
DOCTOR: Over-the-counter medications are still medications, Melvenia. And frankly, taking ibuprofen regularly isn’t ideal. It can have side effects. Do you know the dosage you're taking, and how often?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I… I don’t really keep track. Two pills, I think? Maybe three, when it’s really bad. And… every few hours, when my joints are aching. It’s just as needed, you see? I never thought it was something I needed to tell a doctor about. It’s just ibuprofen! I get it at Walgreens. Do I need to write all of this down? It feels like I’m back in school. I’m sorry, I’m not very good with details.
DOCTOR: Melvenia, it's important to be accurate about these things. Ibuprofen can cause stomach ulcers, kidney problems... it’s not harmless. We need to document everything. Let’s start with your height and weight. I’m going to need to verify that myself. Please step on the scale and I'll measure your height. And then we’ll go back to these medications.
PATIENT: Oh. Well. Alright. I suppose so. It's just… I feel like I'm being interrogated. I already told them my height and weight on these forms. But fine, I’ll step on the scale. It’s just… a bit embarrassing, you know? Getting weighed like this. I haven't weighed myself in ages.
DOCTOR: Hmm. 110 pounds. And your height is listed here as 5’8”. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Five foot eight. Always been tall, you see. My mother was tall, and her mother before her. It's a family thing. Though, I might be a little shorter now, if you want to be honest. I’ve shrunk a bit in my old age, I suppose. But 5’8” is close enough, I always say. Is that what you needed to know? Can we please get this over with? I have an appointment to get my hair done later.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's go back to the allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… Let me think. I don’t think so. Not really. I get a little sniffly sometimes in the spring, but that’s just the pollen, I suppose. And I’m not fond of shellfish, but that’s a preference, not an allergy. I haven’t ever had a serious allergic reaction, if that makes a difference. Is this what they’re worried about? I’m just a plain old lady, Doctor. I just want to get these papers signed.
DOCTOR: So, no known allergies. And you take ibuprofen… sporadically, as needed. Is there any family history of significant medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you're asking about my family? Well, my father had a weak heart, I think. He passed away when I was young. And my aunt… she had something with her stomach, but I don’t remember exactly what it was. It was a long time ago. Everyone on my mother’s side lived to be very old, though. They all had good constitutions, you see. I'm not sure if that helps. Honestly, all this talk about sickness is making me nervous. Can we just… skip this part? I’m sure the senior living place won't mind if I don’t know every single detail about my ancestors.
DOCTOR: Look, Melvenia. I understand you're frustrated, but this isn't just about signing papers. I need to have a basic understanding of your health status before I can… well, before I can responsibly complete this form. It's about ensuring your safety. It sounds like you have a limited understanding of your own medical history. Frankly, it's concerning. I'm going to recommend a full physical exam and some blood work.
PATIENT: A… a full physical? Blood work? Now hold on just a minute! I just wanted some papers signed, not a whole medical investigation. I don’t have insurance, you know. I can’t afford all that. This is ridiculous! I'm perfectly healthy for my age, thank you very much. I just want to move into a nice place where I can relax, not be poked and prodded like a… like a science experiment. I think I’ll just… I’ll just take my papers and go. I’ll find someone else to sign them.
DOCTOR: Suit yourself. But don’t come back here complaining when something happens. .
