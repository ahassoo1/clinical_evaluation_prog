DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're 86 years of age. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? Eighty-six, yes. Getting old is no fun, I tell you. They sent me. The company, that is. Said I need to be checked. Even though I feel alright. Just checking, they say. Waste of time, if you ask me. But they pay me, so… I come. Something about… the dust. Down in the mine. Been working there a long time, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, I see a note here regarding your employment… and potential dust exposure. “The mine,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, the mine. Been there… oh, almost fifty years now. Digging and moving things. Always dust. Not a big deal, really. Everyone coughs a little. They just worried now 'cause… I don’t know. New rules, maybe? Always something new. Back in my day, we didn’t need all this checking. We just worked.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your… resilience, Mr. Bigger, preventative measures are quite important. It’s good they’re being thorough. Now, regarding this cough… is it a recent development, or has it been present for some time?
PATIENT: Recent? Hmph. Like I said, always a little cough. Especially after a shift. Dust gets in your lungs, what do you expect? Not new new. Just… there. Not bothering me none. Used to it. My wife used to make me tea for it. But she's… gone now.
DOCTOR: I see. And aside from the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I feel… old. Tired, sometimes. Back aches. Is that a symptom? I get winded climbing the stairs, but I ain't climbed stairs much since the wife went. You want me to list everything that hurts? I’m eighty-six!
DOCTOR: No, no, that won’t be necessary. Just trying to ascertain if anything new has arisen. Have you experienced any shortness of breath at rest?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… at rest? You mean… when I’m sitting? Like now? No. I breathe fine when I sit. Maybe a little heavy after walking to the bus stop. But that's the heat. August heat is terrible, you know. Hotter every year.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you noticed any chest pain, or wheezing when you breathe?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Never had chest pain. Maybe a little… tightness sometimes. Like a band around. But that's from eating too much stew, my wife used to say. Wheezing? What's 'wheezing'? Sounds like a fancy word for coughing. I cough. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, regarding your medical history… have you ever been diagnosed with any lung conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Bronchitis? Pneumonia? Doctors gave me pills sometimes when I was sick. Maybe for that. Don't remember the names. I ain't one for remembering fancy names. Just took the pills and got better. Always been strong, you know. Never been one to stay sick long. Wife took care of all that doctor talk.
DOCTOR: Right. And were you ever exposed to any other significant dusts or chemicals in your work, aside from the mine?
PATIENT: Chemicals? No. Just dust. Always dust. Sometimes a little smoke from the machinery. But not like… fancy chemicals. Just… work dust. The company always said it was safe enough. That's why they hired us, you know.
DOCTOR: I see. And how about family history, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmph. Lots of family. Back in Nigeria, you have lots. My father, he was strong. Worked the land. Died old. Mother too. Lots of children. Can’t remember if anyone had… lung trouble. They didn’t go to doctors much back then. Died of old age, mostly. No fancy illnesses.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, before we proceed, Mr. Bigger, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Just listening to your lungs, checking your oxygen saturation, things of that nature. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Examine me? What for? I told you, I feel fine. Waste of time, if you ask me. But… alright. If you have to. Get it over with. Don't poke me too hard. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Very good. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Your breathing is slightly diminished bilaterally, with some mild wheezing present, particularly on exhalation. Oxygen saturation is 94%. I’d like to check your heart as well. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly muffled. No edema present. Now, can you tell me if you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. Ate anything put in front of me back in Nigeria. That's why I'm still here, you know. Strong stomach. Now, are you going to tell me what this is all about? I feel like you’re looking for trouble where there ain’t none. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, while you may feel fine, the examination reveals some findings that warrant further investigation. The diminished lung sounds and mild wheezing suggest some degree of airway obstruction. Given your lengthy exposure to dust in the mine, we need to consider the possibility of pneumoconiosis – commonly known as “black lung disease.” It's a condition caused by inhaling coal dust over a prolonged period. Now, I’m not saying you definitely have it, but we need to confirm or rule it out. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests. These tests will give us a clearer picture of your lung function. Are you amenable to that?
PATIENT: Black lung? You mean… I got sick from the mine? After all these years? They always said it was safe. Safe enough. This is… this is ridiculous. They sent me here to get sick? This is what happens when you trust people, you know. Fine. Do your tests. X-rays and… whatever those other things are. But if it’s nothing, I expect an apology. And maybe the company should pay for my tea. I'm going to need a lot of tea.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bigger. We will proceed with the chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests as soon as possible. I'll also need a detailed list of any medications you’re currently taking, if any. And, to be thorough, could you recall any previous hospitalizations or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Medications? Just the pills the wife gave me when I had a cold. Can’t remember what they were. Serious illnesses? Nothing serious. Maybe a bad stomach once or twice. The wife made me ginger tea, that fixed everything. Hospitalizations? No. Never been in a hospital. Too busy working. Look, are you almost done here? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. To summarize, Mr. Bigger, we've discussed your history of dust exposure in the mine, your current symptoms—or lack thereof, as you’ve described—and your family history. We will be performing a chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests to assess your lung function. I will also have the receptionist schedule you for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever, please seek immediate medical attention. I will also document my concerns regarding your potential exposure to pneumoconiosis. Now, do you have any questions for me before we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Pneumo… whatever you said. Sounds bad. So, you think I’m sick? After all these years? This is… upsetting. No, I don’t have any questions. Just get it over with. Get the tests done. And tell the company I want extra tea. A lot of extra tea. That's all.
DOCTOR: Very good. The receptionist will assist you with scheduling the tests and will provide you with instructions. I will be in touch to discuss the results as soon as they are available. Thank you for your time, Mr. Bigger. And, again, if you experience any concerning symptoms, do not hesitate to seek medical attention. .
PATIENT: .
