DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. Why don’t we start by you telling me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor, good morning! It's nice to meet you too. Well, I've been having these chills, and it's a little worrying. Not like a fever chill, just…cold. It comes and goes, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. “Chills” can mean a lot of things. It's helpful you specify it's not like a fever chill. Can you tell me a little more about when these chills started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started maybe three days ago? I don't really remember the exact date, sorry. It wasn’t constant at first, just a few shivers here and there. But yesterday it felt more frequent, and I thought I should probably get it checked out. It's just…uncomfortable, and I don't want it to be something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, three days ago, increasing in frequency yesterday. That's good information. And you mentioned it's uncomfortable. Can you describe where you feel the chills most prominently?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my arms and legs, I think. Like, my skin feels cold even when I don’t feel cold, you know? Sometimes my back too, but not always. It's weird, it doesn't feel like a muscle thing, just…coldness. It's hard to explain. I don't have any aches or anything with it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. So, chills primarily in your arms and legs, sometimes your back, feeling cold to the touch even when you don't feel generally cold, and no associated aches. Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the chills?
PATIENT: Let me see… Now that you mention it, I’ve been feeling a little more tired than usual. Not exhausted, just…easily worn out. And maybe a little bit of a headache, but it’s very mild. It comes and goes, and I thought it was just from being stressed, honestly. I've been a bit busy with work lately. Oh! And I think I had a bit of a stuffy nose yesterday evening, but it cleared up this morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, mild headaches, and a brief episode of nasal congestion. Those are helpful details. Do you have any other symptoms at all – any cough, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No cough, no sore throat, definitely no vomiting or diarrhea. My appetite’s been normal, I think. I haven’t noticed any changes there. I've been eating pretty regularly. I'm just…concerned about these chills, you know? It’s just a strange feeling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Let’s go through some general health questions to get a better picture of things. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles – but nothing serious. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but that healed fine. As an adult, I had a really bad bout of food poisoning a few years ago, but that was just a one-time thing. Other than that, I'm generally pretty healthy. I try to eat well and get some exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a typical childhood history and a single episode of food poisoning. And no ongoing medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. I’ve been lucky so far, haven't needed any. I try to avoid hospitals if I can, honestly. I'm not a fan of being poked and prodded!
DOCTOR: I completely understand. No surgeries. That’s good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mom is healthy, thankfully. She’s got a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. My dad passed away a few years ago, he had heart problems. And my brother is healthy too, as far as I know. Nothing major on either side, really. It's just... my dad's heart issues always worry me a little.
DOCTOR: I see. Your mother has managed hypertension, and your father had heart problems. Knowing that family history is helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, honestly. I try to take it most days, but sometimes I forget. Nothing else. No prescription medications or anything like that. I really don't like taking pills unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin, occasionally. And no allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I'm aware of. I can eat pretty much anything. I love trying new foods, actually! No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky in that department, too.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Just to complete the picture, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. I used to drink occasionally – maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes – but I stopped a while ago. And no, I don't use any recreational drugs. Never have. I just…don’t have an interest in any of that. I prefer a good cup of tea, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. No smoking, no current alcohol use, and no recreational drug use. Thank you for sharing that. Now, Ms. Aslan, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s causing these chills. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I'm going to check your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll take a look at your throat and ears, and do a quick neurological exam. Your temperature is normal, your pulse is good, and your blood pressure is within a normal range. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Your throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Your ears are also clear. Your reflexes are normal, and your balance appears good. I'm not finding any obvious signs of infection or anything immediately concerning. Your skin does feel slightly cool to the touch, though. Do you feel cold right now?
PATIENT: Yes, actually, I do feel a little chilly right now. Not freezing, just…cool. It's like a shiver trying to start, but it doesn't quite happen. It's weird. And thank you for checking everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It's reassuring to hear that everything sounds okay. But what could be causing these chills then? It's been really bothering me.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Aslan. It's good that we are getting a more detailed picture. Given your symptoms – the chills, fatigue, mild headache, and brief nasal congestion – and the normal physical exam, several things could be going on. It could be a mild viral infection, even if you don't have a full-blown cold. Sometimes these can present with vague symptoms. It could also be related to stress, though we’ve ruled out a lot of other possibilities. It’s less likely, but we should also consider things like thyroid issues or even early stages of certain autoimmune conditions. To rule out some of those possibilities, I'd like to order some blood tests. I'm going to order a Complete Blood Count to check for infection, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel to assess your organ function, a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test to check your thyroid, and an Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate and C-Reactive Protein to look for inflammation. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I mean, if it helps figure out what's going on, absolutely. Blood tests are fine. I just… I hope it's nothing serious. It's just been unsettling. So, a CBC, CMP, TSH, ESR, and CRP? Okay, I'll remember that. Will I need to fast for any of them?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours before the CMP. So, no food or sugary drinks after midnight tonight. Water is fine. The CBC, TSH, and ESR don’t require fasting. I’ll write you a lab order, and you can go to the lab at your convenience. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, severe headache, difficulty breathing, or any other concerning symptoms – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything really well, Doctor. So, don’t eat after midnight for the CMP, and come back when the results are ready. And go to the ER if things get worse. Got it. Thank you so much for your time and for explaining everything so clearly. It's a relief to have a plan. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Aslan. I'm glad I could help. And don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here’s the lab order. I wish you all the best, and I’ll see you soon.
