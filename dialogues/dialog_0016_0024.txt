DOCTOR: Hi Kiante, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor. I need a letter, actually. Confirming I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but I need it for an upcoming trip.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fit-to-fly letter. I can definitely help with that. To get started, can you tell me a little bit about why you need the letter?
PATIENT: It’s… about my husband. He passed away last year, unexpectedly. We had a trip planned, fully paid for, to Mongolia. It was supposed to be our anniversary trip. The airline is… being difficult about letting me use the tickets on my own, even though I’m the one handling his estate. They want a doctor’s note saying I’m fit to travel, to confirm it’s not… a mental health thing, preventing me. Does that make sense? I just want to go, you know? It feels important.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Kiante. I understand completely. It's very thoughtful of you to want to honor your husband's memory that way. And I appreciate you explaining the situation so clearly. Let me pull up your chart here… Okay, I see you’ve been seen at this clinic before. Just to be thorough, and to make sure I have the most up-to-date information, can you tell me about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… well, I’m generally okay, I think. I’m 33, and usually pretty healthy. I’m 176 centimeters tall and weigh about 131 pounds. I don’t really have any major conditions. I have Medicare, and… that's about it, I guess. I haven’t been sick or anything recently. Nothing that would stop me from flying, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any need for them, thankfully. Just… the usual check-ups and things. Nothing major, I promise. I really just want to get this letter so I can sort this trip out. It's been a whole ordeal with the airline.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… my parents are both still alive, thankfully. My mother has high blood pressure, but she manages it with medication. My father… he’s always been pretty robust, actually. No major health problems on either side, that I’m aware of. Nothing that runs in the family that I should be concerned about, no. Honestly, the biggest issue I’ve had recently is just… grief, if that makes sense. But physically, I’m fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… well, as I mentioned, my husband passed away last year. We didn’t have any children. I used to work full-time in advertising sales, but… I’ve been working part-time since he died. It's… hard to focus, you know? I mostly keep to myself these days. I don't drink or smoke, and I don’t take any medications, apart from the occasional pain reliever for a headache. I prefer quiet activities like reading, mostly. That’s… pretty much it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Kiante. That gives me a good understanding of your background. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies at all. None. I eat pretty much everything. No reactions to anything, ever. I’ve always been lucky that way. So… are we getting closer to the letter? I really appreciate you being patient with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. That’s excellent. So, to summarize, you’re a 33-year-old female, generally healthy, with no significant medical history, no surgeries, no family history of major health concerns, no medications, no allergies, and you're currently grieving the loss of your husband. You're requesting a fit-to-fly letter for an upcoming trip to Mongolia. Now, to make sure I can provide you with the most appropriate documentation, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, and blood pressure, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you need. I just want to get this done. The sooner I can get the letter, the better. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, let’s check your blood pressure. 120/80 – that’s perfectly normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. And finally, let’s listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds good so far, Kiante. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not anywhere. I've been feeling… a little tired, maybe, but that’s probably just… everything. Grief takes a lot out of you, I guess. But physically, I'm fine. Really. It’s good to hear everything sounds good, though. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No pain, just some fatigue, which is understandable given the circumstances. Based on your history and this brief physical exam, I don’t see any medical contraindications to you flying. I’m happy to write a letter stating that you are medically fit to travel. Here you go. This states that you are cleared for travel as of today, August 2, 2025. Please let me know if there are any specific requirements from the airline that aren’t covered here. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, perfect! Thank you so much, Doctor Maskal. This is exactly what I needed. No, I don’t think I have any questions. You’ve been very thorough and kind. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Hopefully, this will be enough for the airline. Thank you again. I think that’s all. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante. I’m glad I could help. I truly hope you have a peaceful and meaningful trip. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything further in the future. Take care of yourself.
