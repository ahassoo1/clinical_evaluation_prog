DOCTOR: Alright, Nicoletta, good to see you. I'm Dr. Billman. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Billman. It’s very nice to meet you too. Well, I suppose you could say I’m here for a little… freshening up. I’m 87 years old, you see, and while I feel… mostly alright, I wouldn’t mind a little jumpstart, if you know what I mean. A reset, perhaps? Just to make sure everything is still ticking along nicely. I used to be a teacher, you know, kindergarten and elementary. Lots of energy then! Now… well, now I just want to feel my best for as long as I can.
DOCTOR: "Freshening up," huh?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s a good way to put it. I still get out and about, do my gardening, visit with family… but it takes a little more effort than it used to. I want to keep doing those things, Doctor. And I'd like to do them without feeling quite so… worn out afterwards, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Well, “worn out” can mean a lot of things. Is this a new feeling, or something that's been building up gradually?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been gradual, definitely gradual. Not something that just popped up overnight. Maybe… the last year or so, I’ve noticed it more. It’s not painful, mind you, just… tiring. Like I have to coax my body into moving sometimes, you know? And then I need a longer rest afterwards. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, but it’s… a little discouraging, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, gradual onset of fatigue with activity. And it doesn’t involve pain, which is good. Let's try to get a better picture of this. When you’re gardening, or visiting family – what specifically feels tiring?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Well, with the gardening, it’s mostly just my legs, I think. They feel heavy, and then ache a little after a while. Not a sharp ache, just… used-up. And with visiting family, it’s more like… everything, all at once. Keeping up with the conversation, walking around… just the whole effort of being social, if that makes sense. It’s exhausting! Not that I don’t enjoy it, mind you, I just need a good nap afterwards.
DOCTOR: So, legs with physical activity, and a general feeling of exhaustion with social engagements. Okay. Are you noticing this fatigue at other times, besides when you’re gardening or with family?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sometimes. Not as bad, but… in the afternoons, I find myself just wanting to sit. I used to be able to putter around the house all day, but now… I’ll read for a bit, then need to rest. And honestly, getting a good night’s sleep isn’t always easy anymore. I wake up a few times during the night, even if I haven’t done much during the day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nicoletta. So, fatigue with activity, general exhaustion, and some trouble sleeping. Have you had your thyroid checked recently?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My… thyroid? I don’t think so. Not for a very long time. I had a doctor back on Guam, but I can’t remember exactly when he checked it. It must have been… years ago. Perhaps when I was still teaching? I honestly can’t recall. Is that something important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It can be, Nicoletta. Thyroid problems can cause fatigue, and affect sleep, and… well, lots of things. I’ll check your records, see if anything is noted. And we'll probably want to order some bloodwork just to be sure. Now, aside from the fatigue and trouble sleeping, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Bloodwork sounds sensible. As for other changes… hmm. Let me think. My appetite isn’t quite what it used to be, I suppose. I used to love a good meal, but now I’m often just not very hungry. And sometimes… just sometimes, I feel a little… forgetful. Not anything major, mind you, just misplacing things, or struggling to remember names. It could just be old age, though, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Well, Nicoletta, appetite changes and forgetfulness can be normal at your age. But it’s good you mentioned them. Just to cover all our bases. Now, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh my. That's... a rather personal question, Doctor. Well, I suppose they haven’t been regular as they once were. Sometimes a bit… constipated, if I'm being honest. I take a little something for it now and then, a mild laxative, but it doesn’t always help. I try to drink plenty of water, but… well, it’s not always easy, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Constipation, occasional laxative use. Very well. Now, let's talk about your medications. You mentioned a laxative. Are you taking anything else, regularly?
PATIENT: Oh yes, let me think. I take a little something for my blood pressure, a tiny white pill. And… and something for my cholesterol, a little yellow one. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take ibuprofen. Not every day, just when I need it. And then there’s the occasional prune juice for… you know.
DOCTOR: Right, blood pressure medication, cholesterol medication, ibuprofen as needed, prune juice. We’ll get all of that documented. Now, Nicoletta, I’m going to ask you some questions about your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything, besides maybe a routine procedure?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a very long time ago. And… and when I was about forty, I had a gallbladder surgery. That was a bit rough, but I recovered alright. Aside from that, no. Nothing major, I don’t think. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing to write home about.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy as a child, gallbladder surgery at forty. Fine. Any significant medical conditions currently?
PATIENT: Oh, well, the doctor told me a few years back that I have… arthritis, in my knees and hands. That’s why I sometimes take the ibuprofen, you see. And my blood pressure isn't always the best, that’s why I take the other pill. And I suppose… being my age is a medical condition in itself, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Nicoletta, age is… a factor. Alright. Do you have any allergies to any medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong stomach! I can eat all sorts of things, and I've never had a problem with any medication. Though, like I said, I don’t take much these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And finally, Nicoletta, let’s talk about your family. Is there a history of any significant medical problems in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother lived to be 92, so that's good. She had a little bit of trouble with her heart at the end, I think. And my father had… diabetes, I believe. He wasn't very good about taking care of himself. And my brother, he had high blood pressure too, like me. It seems to run in the family, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Maternal history of heart trouble, paternal history of diabetes and high blood pressure. Thank you, Nicoletta. Now, I think it's time for a brief physical examination. Can you please step up on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Here we go. I haven't weighed myself in quite some time, actually. It’s sometimes easier just not to know, isn't it?
DOCTOR: 149 pounds. And your height is documented as 199 centimeters. Alright, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. There you go. It feels a bit tight, doesn’t it? But I suppose it has to be, to get a good reading. I always did have a strong pulse, even as a little girl. My grandmother used to say I had a lot of life in me!
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 150 over 88. Pulse is 78 and regular. A bit elevated, but not alarming. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. Good. No murmurs or crackles that I detect. Now I'm going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Just let me know if you need me to do anything else. It's been a long time since I’ve had a thorough check-up like this. It's reassuring to know someone is looking after things, you see. My children are lovely, but they're busy with their own lives, and I don't want to bother them.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are a little diminished, as expected for your age. Alright, Nicoletta. Everything appears reasonably normal for someone of your age. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and your fatigue warrants further investigation. I’m going to order some bloodwork – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a Vitamin D level. We’ll also check your cholesterol levels again, just to be sure.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… thorough. Bloodwork, you say? I suppose that's sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Are those tests… difficult? Will they take a long time? I have a gardening club meeting on Wednesday, you see.
DOCTOR: No, the bloodwork isn’t difficult at all. A simple draw. Shouldn’t take more than fifteen minutes. Results will take a few days to come back – probably by early next week. You can go about your gardening club meeting as usual. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are in to discuss them. Here’s the requisition. You can take this to the lab at [Clinic Name] across the street. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Early next week, you say? That’s good. I’m glad it won't interfere with the gardening club. Across the street… yes, I know where that is. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… what exactly are you looking for with these tests? Is something seriously wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Nicoletta, it’s standard procedure. We’re looking for any underlying causes for your fatigue – anemia, thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, so we'll check those levels as well. I don’t want to alarm you, it's unlikely anything is seriously wrong, but it’s best to rule everything out. It's always better to be thorough, especially as we get older. Now, if you’re experiencing any new symptoms – chest pain, shortness of breath, severe weakness – call the office immediately. Otherwise, just follow up with me next week. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Anemia… and thyroid issues… yes, I understand. Just… ruling things out. That’s sensible, Doctor. Chest pain, shortness of breath… yes, I'll remember that. So, I just go across the street, give them this paper, and they’ll… draw some blood? Is it painful? My veins aren’t always easy to find, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, you just go across the street, give them the requisition, and they’ll draw some blood. As for pain, there may be a brief pinch, but it's usually very minimal. They’re professionals, Nicoletta. They’re used to difficult veins. If you’re particularly nervous, let them know. They can use a topical anesthetic. Alright. I think that covers everything for today. We’ll see you next week to discuss the results. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. And… patient, I suppose. I appreciate your time. I'll let them know about my veins. Yes. Have a good day, Doctor Billman. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Nicoletta. Have a good day.
