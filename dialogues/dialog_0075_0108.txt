DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, to be honest. But…well, things came up. Been throwing up blood, mostly. Not a ton, but enough to worry my neighbor into driving me here. It started a couple days ago, outta nowhere. Feels…unpleasant, obviously.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Throwing up blood is definitely something we need to investigate, even if it’s not a large amount. It’s good your neighbor encouraged you to come in. “Out of nowhere” is helpful information. To start, can you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean describe it? It’s…red. Like blood usually is. Honestly, I don't need a lesson in what blood looks like. It wasn’t bright red, more…dark, I guess? Like coffee grounds, maybe? My wife—God rest her soul—used to drink coffee. It reminded me of that. Though, honestly, I was more focused on getting rid of it than analyzing the shade.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Gentz. That wasn't meant to be a silly question. Dark, coffee-ground-like blood is very important information. It suggests the blood may have been partially digested in the stomach. And you're right to focus on getting rid of it – it’s perfectly natural to react that way. Has this happened before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve had a stomach ache here and there, like anyone, but nothing like this. Definitely not throwing up anything resembling coffee grounds before. I eat pretty plain, to be honest. Not much upsets my stomach usually. This really came as a shock. And it's been…distracting. I run the crematory, you know? Can’t be…distracted on the job.
DOCTOR: I can only imagine how unsettling this must be, especially with the nature of your work. It’s good you came in. And I understand needing to be focused. To help me get a clearer picture, can you tell me about anything else you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Anything else? Hmm. Well, I’ve been feeling a bit…tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. And weak, kinda shaky. Thought it was just the heat, honestly. It's been brutal lately. But, yeah, just generally run down. And my stool…well, it’s been dark. Black, almost. Like tar. Now that I think about it. Didn’t really connect it to the…other thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very important information, Mr. Gentz. Dark stools—melena, as we call it—and the fatigue you’re describing certainly raise my concern. Given the blood in your vomit and the black stools, we need to investigate the source of bleeding in your digestive system. Do you take any medications regularly, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Nope. Never been much of a pill-popper. My wife…she had high blood pressure, always on something. But me? Nothing. Not even aspirin. I don’t believe in loading up on chemicals if I can avoid it. Maybe a multivitamin now and then, if I remember, but that’s about it. Honestly, I’m pretty healthy for my age, or was before all this started.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications or supplements. That simplifies things a bit. Have you had any recent changes in your diet?
PATIENT: Diet changes? No, not really. I eat the same stuff pretty much every day. Rice, some lamb, a little bit of vegetables. Simple stuff. Been eating that way for years. My neighbor—old Mrs. Henderson—she's always trying to get me to eat healthier, more fruit, less lamb. But I like what I like. Haven’t changed a thing recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And have you had any abdominal pain, besides what you might experience with the vomiting?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain... well, it's not like a sharp pain, if that makes sense. More like a dull ache, kinda low down. Comes and goes. I figured it was just indigestion. Honestly, I haven’t paid it much mind. I’m a practical man. A little discomfort isn't going to stop me. It’s been there off and on for…a week or so, maybe. Before the…incident.
DOCTOR: Okay. Dull, intermittent abdominal pain. Alright. To get a better understanding, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Get it over with. I don’t like being poked and prodded, but if that’s what you need to do, go ahead. Just…be quick about it, alright? I got things to do. And please, no unnecessary chatting.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gentz. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Okay. I'm listening to your heart and lungs now. Everything sounds clear. Now, I'm going to press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort in a specific area. Okay. I do detect some tenderness in your lower abdomen, on the left side. Not severe, but present. Your abdomen is also slightly distended. It's not alarming, but I want to note it. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, I’m concerned about possible bleeding in your upper or lower digestive tract. The coffee-ground emesis and black stools are indicative of that, as is the tenderness I’m feeling now. We need to determine the source of the bleeding. I’m going to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, and a stool test to check for blood. I’m also going to order an upper endoscopy. That involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera down your esophagus to examine your stomach and duodenum. It's the best way to visualize the source of the bleeding. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An endoscopy? You want to stick a camera down my throat? That sounds…unpleasant. Is there…anything else we can do? I don't like the sound of that at all. I mean, I understand needing to find out what’s wrong, but that sounds barbaric.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Gentz. It does sound invasive, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about it. However, it’s the most effective way to determine the cause of your bleeding and allows us to potentially stop the bleeding during the procedure if needed. There are other tests we could do, like a colonoscopy, but that would only examine the lower portion of your digestive tract. Given your symptoms—the coffee-ground emesis points towards an upper source of the bleeding—an upper endoscopy is the most appropriate first step. It’s a relatively quick procedure, and you’ll be sedated so you won’t feel any discomfort. We'll also ensure you have appropriate pain management afterwards. If we don’t find the source of the bleeding with the endoscopy, or if it’s not accessible, then we can consider other options. But right now, this is the best course of action. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Sedated, huh? That’s…something, I suppose. Still doesn’t sound appealing. What are the risks? I don’t want to wake up with a hole in my stomach or something. And who will run the crematory while I’m…out of commission? That’s a real concern. Old Man Hemmings isn’t reliable. He once burned the wrong urn. The wrong urn.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Mr. Gentz. Let’s address them one by one. Regarding risks, complications from an upper endoscopy are rare, but they can include bleeding, infection, and, very rarely, perforation – a hole in the stomach lining. We take every precaution to minimize those risks. The procedure is performed by a highly skilled gastroenterologist, and we continuously monitor you throughout the process. We’ll also have you sign a consent form that outlines all the potential risks. As for the crematory, I understand your concern about staffing. Unfortunately, that’s not something I can directly assist with. However, I can provide you with a medical note detailing your condition and the need for time off work. Perhaps you can explore temporary staffing options or discuss it with your business partners, if you have any. For now, let’s focus on getting you scheduled for the endoscopy. It’s the most important step to determine what’s causing your bleeding and getting you back to your normal routine, and running the crematory. We can discuss medication and pain management options afterwards, to help with your comfort and recovery. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But I want the best doctor you’ve got. And I want a detailed explanation of everything they’re going to do before they do it. I don’t want any surprises. And…I suppose a medical note is better than nothing for Hemmings. Just make sure it’s…strong. He needs to understand this isn't a suggestion.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Gentz. I completely understand. I will personally ensure you are scheduled with Dr. Anya Sharma – she’s one of our most experienced gastroenterologists and known for her thorough explanations and patient care. She will explain the procedure in detail before it begins and answer all your questions. I will also draft a medical note for Mr. Hemmings, detailing the seriousness of your condition and the necessity of your time off work. It will be strongly worded, as you requested. It will also state any restrictions you may have upon your return to work. Here is the information for your endoscopy appointment. Please read the pre-procedure instructions carefully, as they contain important details about fasting and medication adjustments. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: Fasting? What am I supposed to eat? Or, more accurately, not eat? I have a pretty regular schedule. And what about…the other thing? Will that…affect it? I need to be…functional, even before. I can’t just be…lying around.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Gentz. The instructions detail a clear liquid diet for 24 hours before the procedure. That means no solid food, and limited to things like clear broth, water, plain tea, and clear juice – no pulp. It’s essential to have an empty stomach so the doctor can get a clear view and minimize any risks. Regarding the black stools and vomiting, they are symptoms we need to investigate with the endoscopy. The fasting won’t directly affect them, but it’s crucial to follow the instructions to ensure the procedure goes smoothly. The sedation will make you drowsy for the rest of the day, so you’ll need someone to drive you home and monitor you. The sedation will likely make you feel relaxed and tired, but it’s a temporary effect. You should be able to resume your normal activities the following day, as long as you don't have any complications. I’ll provide you with post-procedure instructions as well. Do you have any other questions about the instructions or anything else?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. I suppose. Just…make sure they tell me everything before they start. No surprises, alright? And get that note to Hemmings ASAP. He’s…difficult. Honestly, I’m more worried about him messing things up than about this…camera.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Gentz. I will personally communicate your concerns to Dr. Sharma and ensure she explains every step of the procedure before it begins. I understand your anxiety about Mr. Hemmings, and I will have the medical note faxed to him immediately. I'll also send you a copy for your records. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just…get it done. And try not to let Hemmings burn anything down while I’m out. .
DOCTOR: You take care, Mr. Gentz. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this and ensure everything goes smoothly. And I’ll keep Hemmings in mind. .
