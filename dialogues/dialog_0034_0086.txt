DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, if you could just get straight to it, that’d be great. I’ve got a pretty full day.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand you're pressed for time. Let me pull up your chart… Okay, I have the results of your blood work and urine analysis here. Before I go over them, could you remind me what specifically we were testing for?
PATIENT: Oh, right. It was… um… that thing my last doctor wanted to check for, you know, with the tiredness and… feeling off? Something about my iron levels being low, I think? And… something else. Honestly, I don’t really remember all the details. He just said it was a standard check-up to see why I was so tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It sounds like your previous physician was investigating potential causes for your fatigue. We ran a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, iron studies, and a urinalysis. Your complete blood count was within normal limits, which is good. Your metabolic panel was also largely normal, with no significant abnormalities. However, your iron studies did show some concerning results. Your ferritin level, which is a measure of your stored iron, is quite low. Also, your serum iron is on the lower end of the normal range, and your total iron-binding capacity is elevated. Does that make any sense at all?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. Ferritin… is that bad? And what does "elevated" mean? Honestly, I’m terrible with this stuff. Is it… serious? Is that why you wanted to see me?
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable; medical terminology can be confusing. No, you’re not alone in feeling that way. Ferritin is a protein in your body that stores iron. A low level indicates that your iron stores are depleted. "Elevated" means the level is higher than what we typically see in a healthy person. In your case, an elevated total iron-binding capacity suggests that your body is trying to grab onto any iron it can find, which happens when your iron stores are low. To put it simply, it appears you have iron deficiency. This can definitely contribute to feelings of tiredness and being “off,” as iron is essential for carrying oxygen throughout your body. Now, the important question is why your iron is low. Did you recently have any heavy menstrual bleeding, or have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Heavy… no. Not really. My periods are pretty normal, I guess. And definitely no blood in my stool, no. I haven’t noticed anything like that. I just… always feel tired. I figured it was just… life, you know? But it’s getting worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Since we've ruled out obvious causes like heavy bleeding, we need to investigate further. Sometimes, iron deficiency can be due to difficulty absorbing iron from your diet, or even a slow, internal bleed that isn't readily visible. I'd like to start with a stool occult blood test – a simple test to check for hidden blood in your stool. We’ll also want to repeat the iron studies in a few weeks to see if the levels are changing. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Uh… a stool test? Seriously? That doesn’t sound fun. But… okay, if you think it’s necessary. And repeating the blood work… yeah, fine. Just… how long until I know something? And is there anything I can do in the meantime? Like, anything I can eat or something?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation; it's not the most pleasant test, but it's a crucial step in figuring out what's going on. The stool test is fairly straightforward – you'll just need to collect a small sample at home. The lab will give you detailed instructions. As for knowing something, we should have the stool test results back in about 5-7 business days. We'll then review those results and decide if further investigation is needed. Repeating the iron studies will give us a baseline to compare against. In the meantime, you can certainly try to increase your iron intake through diet. Lean red meat, poultry, fish, beans, and leafy green vegetables are good sources of iron. Combining these foods with vitamin C-rich foods – like oranges, strawberries, or bell peppers – can help with iron absorption. You can also consider an over-the-counter iron supplement, but I would advise against starting one until we have a clearer understanding of the cause of your deficiency, as too much iron can also be harmful. Would you like a handout with a list of iron-rich foods?
PATIENT: A handout would be great, yeah. Thanks. And… okay, no iron pills until I talk to you again. Got it. Honestly, I just want to feel normal again. This is exhausting. So, stool test… and then we see what happens? Is there anything else I need to do? Or schedule?
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It's frustrating to feel unwell, and I want to assure you we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Yes, for now, the plan is a stool test. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that for you as you check out. She’ll also give you the instructions and a collection kit. I’ll also have her print out a handout with information on iron-rich foods and tips for increasing absorption. For now, no iron supplements. We’ll review the stool test results and then discuss if further testing is needed—perhaps a referral to a gastroenterologist—or if we should start you on an iron supplement at that time. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Um… no, I think that’s everything. Just… try not to make me do too many more tests, okay? I really don’t like this whole thing. Thanks, Doctor. I guess I'll go talk to the receptionist.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. We'll take things one step at a time and only do what's necessary. I'll make a note in your chart about your preference to minimize testing. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Have a good day, Ms. Kovtun, and I hope you feel better soon. .
