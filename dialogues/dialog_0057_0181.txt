DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Sieh. The pleasure is all mine. It’s very kind of you to have me. I requested a general wellness check, if you will. Just… a look-see to make sure everything is as it should be, you understand. At my age, one likes to be certain, yes? I believe I filled out some paperwork beforehand detailing everything, but happy to go over it again if that’s easier.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That paperwork is very helpful, but it’s always good to hear it directly from you. A wellness check is an excellent idea, especially as we get older. I see here you requested a general wellness visit. Before we dive into anything specific, perhaps you could tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling generally lately?
PATIENT: Generally? Hmm. Well, I feel… good. Truly. No major complaints, thankfully. I still work, you see – construction. Keeps me moving, keeps me… useful. A few aches and pains, naturally, but nothing a good night’s sleep and a little stretching can't handle. I eat well, I think – my wife is a wonderful cook, very particular about fresh ingredients. And I sleep soundly, most nights. I suppose I am… fortunate. Is there something specific you are looking for when you ask about “generally”?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Mombrun. It sounds like you’re very active and taking good care of yourself. When I ask about “generally,” I’m trying to get a sense of any changes you've noticed, even small ones, in your energy levels, appetite, sleep, or mood. Sometimes things change gradually, and it’s good to catch them early. You mentioned some aches and pains – are those mostly related to your work, or do you experience them elsewhere?
PATIENT: Ah, I understand now. Gradual changes… yes, that’s a good point. It’s easy to dismiss little things as just “getting older.” Well, the aches and pains are mostly from the work, I believe. My knees, sometimes, after a long day. My lower back, too. But… now that you mention it, I have noticed a bit of stiffness in my hands in the mornings. Not debilitating, mind you. Just… a little harder to grip things firmly at first. It usually goes away after I’ve been moving around for a bit. And… perhaps my energy isn’t quite what it used to be, but truthfully, I attribute that to the heat we’ve been having. It’s been exceptionally warm, even for Venezuela this time of year.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Stiffness in the hands in the mornings and some fatigue… we’ll definitely want to explore those a little further. Do you have any trouble with swelling in your joints, particularly in your hands or knees?
PATIENT: Swelling… No, not that I’ve noticed. No visible swelling, anyway. Sometimes they feel a little… warm to the touch, perhaps, but not noticeably. I haven’t had any trouble using my hands, just the stiffness in the morning. And my knees… they sometimes feel a little creaky, but that’s been the case for years. I've always assumed it was just wear and tear from the work. My wife always tells me I push myself too hard. She may be right, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re aware of those feelings, and that your wife looks out for you! Now, let’s talk a bit about your overall health history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Nothing chronic. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, perhaps twenty years ago, but I recovered fully. And I broke my arm once, falling from a ladder – another story for another time! But otherwise, I’ve been… remarkably healthy, I believe. My father lived to be eighty-five, and my mother, eighty-two. So, I suppose good genes play a part, too. I see a dentist regularly, of course, and I get a flu shot every year, religiously. My wife insists. I did have my cholesterol checked a few years back, and it was… satisfactory, as I recall.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear about your family history and your preventative care. It sounds like you’ve been very proactive about your health. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of. None whatsoever. I’ve eaten all sorts of things throughout my life, traveled to many places, and never had a reaction. My wife sometimes worries about me trying new foods, but I assure her I am perfectly fine. I've taken antibiotics when needed, and pain relievers for headaches, and never had an issue. No rashes, no itching, no difficulty breathing… nothing. I did have a bit of a reaction to a mosquito bite once, a rather large bump, but that hardly counts as an allergy, does it?
DOCTOR: No, a mosquito bite doesn’t count! That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. My wife buys them for me. She says I need to keep my strength up. It’s a standard one, nothing fancy. And occasionally, when my knees are particularly sore, I’ll take an ibuprofen. But that’s only when absolutely necessary, perhaps once or twice a month. Other than that, nothing. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself, you understand.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable. Okay, Mr. Mombrun. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out for me. Heart sounds are regular, rate approximately 72 beats per minute. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Now, I’m going to take a look in your ears. External auditory canals clear bilaterally. Tympanic membranes are pearly grey and intact. I’m also going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Finally, I’d like to examine your hands and knees. Could you please flex your hands for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here you are. As I mentioned, a little stiffness in the mornings, but nothing drastic. You can see there’s no swelling, just a little… creakiness, perhaps? And my knees… They're a bit uncomfortable, but I've grown used to it. It's worse after a long day of work, naturally. Do you need me to do anything specific?
DOCTOR: I’m noting mild crepitus in both knees with flexion and extension, consistent with osteoarthritis. Range of motion is slightly limited, but no acute signs of inflammation or swelling. Hands exhibit full range of motion with mild tenderness to palpation in the metacarpophalangeal joints, no visible swelling or deformities. Skin is warm and dry. Okay, Mr. Mombrun. Thank you. That was helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you have some mild osteoarthritis in your knees and possibly some early signs of age-related changes in your hands. The stiffness you're experiencing is likely related to this. Your overall health appears to be very good. Your blood pressure and pulse are within normal limits, and your heart and lungs sound clear. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That… doesn’t surprise me, Doctor. Honestly. I’ve always suspected as much. My father had trouble with his knees, too, towards the end. What does this mean, exactly? Is there anything I should be doing about it? Some sort of… treatment, perhaps? Or medication? I’m not particularly keen on taking pills, as you know, but I want to make sure I can continue working for as long as possible. It’s important to me to remain active, you understand. And is there anything I can do to prevent it from getting worse? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Mombrun. It's good you're thinking about prevention. Mild osteoarthritis is very common as we age, and it’s often manageable with conservative measures. First, let’s talk about things you can do on your own. Weight management is important, as excess weight puts more stress on your knees. You're already active, which is excellent, but we want to focus on low-impact exercises like swimming, walking, or cycling. These exercises strengthen the muscles around your knees and help support the joints without putting too much strain on them. Stretching regularly can also help improve flexibility and range of motion. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, which you already take occasionally, can help manage pain and inflammation. We can also consider a topical cream like diclofenac, which you apply directly to your knees. For now, I don’t think prescription medication is necessary. We can revisit that if your symptoms worsen. I also recommend physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you specific exercises to strengthen your muscles and improve your range of motion. Would you be interested in a referral to a physical therapist?
PATIENT: That all sounds… sensible, Doctor. Very sensible indeed. I suppose I’ve been neglecting the stretching. My wife always tells me I need to warm up properly before work, but I tend to rush into things. And the swimming… that’s a good idea. I used to enjoy swimming when I was younger. A referral to a physical therapist… yes, I think that would be beneficial. It can’t hurt, can it? I’d like that very much. And the topical cream… I suppose I can try that as well. I’m always willing to try something if it might help. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. My wife will be pleased to hear I’m finally listening to her advice! Is there anything else I should be aware of? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. It’s good to know you’re willing to try these things. And it’s always good to listen to your wife! The main thing is to pay attention to your body. If you experience any sudden or severe pain, stop what you're doing and see a doctor. Also, be mindful of your posture and lifting techniques at work to avoid further strain on your knees and back. I'm going to write you a referral to a local physical therapy clinic. They'll evaluate your condition and develop a personalized treatment plan. I’ll also send a prescription for the topical diclofenac to your pharmacy. Do you have any questions about the physical therapy or the medication?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I understand about paying attention to my body – my wife has drilled that into me for years! The referral and the prescription… perfect. I’ll make an appointment with the physical therapist as soon as possible. I believe that’s all for today, then. Thank you again for your time and your expertise, Doctor Sieh. You’ve been most helpful. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. It was a pleasure meeting you. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if your symptoms worsen or if you have any concerns. Here's the referral information and a summary of our discussion. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself. And tell your wife I said hello!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. I certainly will. And I'm sure she'll be pleased to hear that. Have a wonderful day as well, Doctor Sieh. And thank you again for everything.
