DOCTOR: Hi Keoni, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been needing to go to the bathroom a lot lately. More than usual, and it’s quite disruptive, to be honest. I’m not entirely sure when it started, to be frank. Everything feels a bit… hazy, these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds frustrating. It’s perfectly alright to feel embarrassed, but we’re here to figure things out, and lots of things can cause frequent urination. Don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of it. When you say “a lot,” could you give me a rough idea of how many times a day you're needing to go, compared to what’s normal for you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's kind of difficult… Normally, I’d say… perhaps three or four times a day? Maybe five if I’m drinking a lot of water. But recently… it feels like every hour or two. Sometimes even more often. It’s hard to keep track, truly. And I find myself getting up several times during the night, which is… exhausting. I apologize for being so vague. I just… don’t remember specifics very well.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Keoni. It’s very common to not remember exact numbers, especially when something is disrupting your routine. Getting up multiple times at night – that is disruptive. And it’s good you’re noticing the difference from your normal pattern. Besides the frequency, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes, a bit of discomfort, yes. Not pain, exactly. More like… a pressure, low in my abdomen. And occasionally, a slight burning sensation when I… urinate. It’s not constant, but it’s there sometimes. I haven’t noticed anything else, I don't believe. Though, I do feel rather tired lately, but that could just be… everything. I’m divorced, and it’s been… difficult adjusting.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure and occasional burning with urination are good things to know. And it's completely understandable that adjusting to a divorce is exhausting – that definitely contributes to fatigue. We'll factor that in as we try to figure things out. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… I don’t think so. It looks normal, as far as I can tell. The usual colour, I suppose. No blood, no… foam, or anything unusual. I haven’t really paid much attention, to be honest. I apologize for my lack of… detail. It’s just not something I typically observe. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Keoni. Most people don’t spend a lot of time observing their urine! You’re doing great just telling me what you have noticed. Okay. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, or a urinary tract infection, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a difficult question. I… I believe I had a bladder infection once, many years ago. Perhaps ten or fifteen years ago? I was treated with antibiotics, and it resolved. Apart from that… nothing comes to mind. I’ve always been relatively healthy, I think. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly in quite some time, to be honest. I suppose that’s not ideal.
DOCTOR: It’s not uncommon to fall out of the habit of regular check-ups, Keoni. Don't worry about that. And it's good to know about the previous bladder infection. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. No surgeries at all. I’ve been very fortunate in that regard. I’ve always been a bit… clumsy, so I’ve had my share of scrapes and bruises, but nothing requiring a hospital visit or surgery. I hope that's helpful.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s another difficult question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had some heart problems later in life. But apart from that… not that I’m aware of. My grandparents… they lived quite long lives, and were generally healthy. I’m not very close to my extended family, so I don’t know much about their medical histories. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. I wish I had more information.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Keoni. You’ve given me a good start. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don't use any recreational drugs. I’ve always been very health-conscious, despite my… current predicament. I find comfort in a healthy lifestyle, generally. It just… doesn't seem to be helping much at the moment.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And it's completely understandable to feel frustrated when things aren't going as planned, even when you're doing your best. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not currently. I stopped taking a multivitamin a few months ago. I wasn’t really noticing a difference, so I figured it wasn’t worth the expense. Apart from that… nothing. I don’t like taking medications unless absolutely necessary. I prefer natural remedies, when possible. Is that all the questions? I feel terrible for not being more helpful with the details.
DOCTOR: You’ve been very helpful, Keoni, honestly. And I appreciate your openness. Okay, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just a basic check – listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and a quick urine test. That will give us some more information to work with. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. A urine test sounds sensible. And I suppose a physical exam is necessary. I… I do get a little anxious about medical procedures, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, just be gentle. And perhaps explain what you're doing as you go? It helps me feel a little more… at ease. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Keoni. I’ll explain everything as I go, and we’ll take it slow. And I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Good. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. I’m just checking for any tenderness or masses. There’s a little bit of tenderness in your lower abdomen, but nothing too concerning. Now, we'll just need a urine sample. I'll give you a cup, and I'll show you how to collect it. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a sample about halfway through. I'll meet you back here when you’re finished, and we’ll send the sample to the lab.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. A mid-stream sample… I remember that from… a long time ago. I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: Let’s see… no recent medical records. A previous bladder infection ten to fifteen years ago. And no allergies listed. Okay, let’s note the recent symptoms and physical exam findings. Frequent urination, nocturia, lower abdominal tenderness… I’ll order a urinalysis and a complete blood count to rule out infection and other possibilities.
PATIENT: Here you are. I hope I did it correctly. It’s been a while. I’m terribly sorry for being such a bother. Is there anything else I can do? Or… anything you need me to do? I just want to help in any way I can.
DOCTOR: You did perfectly fine, Keoni. No need to apologize at all. This is what I’m here for. Now, we'll send this sample to the lab, and it usually takes about 24 to 48 hours to get the results back. In the meantime, I want to rule out a few other possibilities. Are you experiencing any pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: No, not at all. No pain in my back or sides. I did have a little bit of fatigue, as I mentioned, but that could just be… everything else. I suppose I've been rather stressed lately, and haven’t been sleeping very well. Is there anything else? Should I be worried? I apologize for being so… anxious. It’s just… I don’t like feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be anxious, Keoni. And it’s good you’re acknowledging the stress and lack of sleep – those can definitely contribute to your symptoms. While we wait for the lab results, I’m going to suggest a few things. First, let’s try to increase your fluid intake a bit – about 8 glasses of water a day. But try to avoid drinking a lot of fluids before bedtime. Second, let’s focus on improving your sleep hygiene. That means going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, even on weekends, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine. And third, let’s monitor your symptoms closely. Keep a diary of how often you’re urinating, and whether you’re experiencing any pain or burning. If your symptoms worsen, or if you develop a fever, chills, or severe abdominal pain, please call the office immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Eight glasses of water, consistent sleep schedule, and a symptom diary. I suppose it’s a lot to remember, but I’ll try my best. And… what if it’s something serious? What if the tests show something… bad? I apologize for being so… negative. It’s just… my mind tends to wander.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be concerned, Keoni. It’s good to be prepared, and it’s important to address your fears. But let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. Most of the time, frequent urination is caused by something relatively minor, like a urinary tract infection, or bladder irritation. But if the tests do show something more serious, we’ll discuss it openly and honestly, and we’ll work together to create a treatment plan. We’ll start with the basics, and we’ll take it one step at a time. And I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Now, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I suppose I just need to… wait for the results. And try to relax. Which is easier said than done. Thank you for being so patient with me. And for not judging my… anxiety. It means a lot. I’ll be sure to call if anything changes. Have a good day, Doctor Georgiou.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Keoni. And you take care. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Alright, let’s get the lab orders sent and document everything thoroughly. And follow up with her in a couple of days to discuss the results. .
