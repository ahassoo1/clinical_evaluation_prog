DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Rakosky. Good to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, mostly. It’s been… not great. I’ve been having diarrhea for a while now. It's been pretty constant, to be honest. I... honestly, I can't really remember when it started, exactly. It feels like a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Diarrhea for an extended period of time. It's good you came in to get it checked out. When you say "a long time," could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, rough estimate… See, this is hard. Maybe… a couple of months? Or maybe longer? I really wish I could be more precise. Things just… blur together, you know? It’s been pretty disruptive, though, that’s for sure. I feel like I’m always running to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly when something started. A couple of months is helpful, though. And I appreciate you telling me it’s been disruptive. Could you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Okay, um… it’s watery. Pretty watery. And… frequent. Like, a lot more often than normal. It’s… not always painful, but it’s uncomfortable. And it smells… bad. Sorry, that’s probably too much information. Sometimes there's… stuff in it, but I don’t really look, if that makes sense. It just… isn’t pleasant to think about.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Jase. It’s important to be thorough, and that’s helpful information. Watery, frequent, and with a noticeable odor. You mentioned sometimes seeing “stuff” in it. Has there been any blood, or mucus?
PATIENT: Oh… um… I think maybe once or twice I saw a little bit of… red. Not a lot, just a streak. And sometimes it’s kind of… slimy? I guess that's the mucus? It’s hard to tell. It doesn’t happen every time, though. Mostly it’s just… watery and unpleasant. I get worried, obviously, but I didn’t know if it was worth mentioning.
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned both the red streaks and the sliminess, Jase. Those are definitely worth noting. We’ll need to investigate that further. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… when I eat a lot, it gets worse. Like, if I have a big meal, I’m pretty much guaranteed to be running to the bathroom later. And dairy… I think dairy makes it worse too. But I’m not totally sure. I haven’t really kept track, to be honest. It's just… been so constant, it’s hard to tell what’s causing what, you know? Also, stress makes it worse, definitely. I get really anxious about it, and then… well, you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Large meals, dairy, and stress are all potential triggers. We'll explore those further. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you experienced any fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Okay, um… no fever, definitely. And I haven’t been sick, like vomiting or anything. Abdominal pain… sometimes, yeah. It’s not sharp pain, just… cramping. It comes and goes. And weight loss… actually, yeah, I think I’ve lost a little weight. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t actually weighed myself recently. I haven’t been feeling up to it, you know? Just trying to get through the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever or vomiting, but cramping and some unintentional weight loss. That's helpful to know. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so? Nothing I’m aware of. I've never had a really bad reaction to anything. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it. Oh! I used to be allergic to penicillin, as a kid, but I haven't taken that in years. I think I've outgrown it. I'm married, by the way, just in case that's relevant. My insurance is Medicare. And I… I think I had a really bad stomach bug once, a long time ago. But other than that, I’m pretty healthy, usually.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Jase. No known current allergies, a childhood penicillin allergy that you believe you've outgrown, and a history of a previous stomach bug. We’ll make a note of the penicillin allergy. Now, have you had any previous surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the stomach bug you mentioned?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, I don't think so. I mean, I was born via C-section, but that doesn't really count, does it? And… no, I haven't really been sick enough to go to the hospital. I try to take care of myself, you know? I'm usually pretty good at just… dealing with things. This is just… different. It's been going on for so long. I’m getting a bit worried it's something serious.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. C-sections don’t typically need to be listed as a surgical history. And I understand your concern about it going on for so long. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. Now, let's talk about your family medical history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a hard one. My family… we don’t really talk about health stuff much. My mom has… high blood pressure, I think. And my dad… he has diabetes. But that's about all I know, honestly. They're not really the sharing type, you know? And I didn't pay much attention when I was younger. I wish I knew more, but… I don’t. I think someone on my mom's side had… stomach problems, but I don't know what kind. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright, Jase. High blood pressure and diabetes in your parents, and a vague history of stomach problems on your mother’s side. We’ll note that. Finally, let’s briefly touch on your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink alcohol, and I definitely don’t do drugs. I just… I don't really have a lifestyle for that. I work as a sales rep, mostly making calls and stuff. It's not very glamorous. Mostly I just try to relax at home with my husband when I'm not working. This stomach stuff has really messed up my routine, though. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Jase. No smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no drug use. And I understand your desire to feel normal again. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just… I'm a little nervous, to be honest. But I trust your judgment. I just want to know what's wrong, so I can start feeling better.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright to be nervous. We'll take things one step at a time. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and then I'll gently palpate it to check for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Bowel sounds are present, though slightly hyperactive. That’s not necessarily concerning in itself, given your symptoms. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that’s okay, that doesn’t hurt. Just… feels normal. A little pressure, but nothing bad. I think my stomach's always been a bit sensitive, to be honest. It gets easily upset. Keep going, if you need to. I just want to get this figured out.
DOCTOR: Okay, and here?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s… a little tender there, on the left side. Not painful, exactly, but definitely sensitive. It feels a little… cramped, almost? Like a muscle spasm. It's not constant, just when you press. Is that… bad? I'm getting a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Tenderness on the left lower quadrant, with a sensation of cramping. That’s helpful information. I'm also going to check your reflexes and listen to your heart and lungs to rule out any other potential issues. Heart and lungs sound clear. Reflexes are normal. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial physical exam, it’s possible this could be a case of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS, or potentially some form of inflammatory bowel disease, though we'll need to do some further testing to rule that out. The cramping and tenderness on the left side could be indicative of diverticulitis as well, though it's not presenting with all the typical symptoms. Given the duration of your symptoms, it’s important to investigate this thoroughly. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, inflammatory markers, and a stool sample analysis. This will help us rule out infection, inflammation, and other potential causes. Do you have any concerns about those tests?
PATIENT: Oh… wow. That’s a lot. IBS… I’ve heard of that. But… inflammatory bowel disease? Diverticulitis? Those sound… serious. I… I don’t know. I guess… blood work is okay. I don’t really like needles, but… if it’ll help figure out what’s wrong, then yes. A stool sample… That sounds… unpleasant. But if you think it’s necessary, then yes, I’ll do it. I just want to know what’s going on, so I can get better. What exactly will the tests tell you? And… how long will it take to get the results? I’m worried it’s something really bad.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Jase. It's natural to feel worried when you're facing uncertainty. I want to assure you that we are taking this seriously and working to get to the bottom of things. The blood work will help us look for signs of infection, inflammation, and anemia, which can be common with long-term diarrhea. The stool sample analysis will check for bacteria, parasites, or blood in your stool, which can help us identify the cause of your symptoms. IBS is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder, meaning there’s something wrong with how your gut is functioning, but there’s no visible damage. It's often managed with diet and lifestyle changes. Inflammatory bowel disease, like Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, is a more serious condition that involves inflammation of the digestive tract. Diverticulitis is an infection of small pouches in the colon. The results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have those results, we can discuss the next steps and create a treatment plan that’s right for you. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated, avoiding dairy and overly processed foods, and managing your stress levels. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Okay… 3-5 days. I can handle that, I guess. Hydrated, no dairy, less stress… Easier said than done, with all this worrying! I think… I think I understand. Mostly. What if it is something bad? Like, inflammatory bowel disease? What does that even mean? Would I… would I need surgery? And… what about work? I can't just… take off for weeks, if I need surgery. I'm a bit overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, Jase. It's okay to be scared and ask questions. Let's take things one step at a time. If it turns out to be inflammatory bowel disease, it doesn't automatically mean you'll need surgery. Many people manage it effectively with medication, diet changes, and regular monitoring. Surgery is usually reserved for more severe cases that don't respond to other treatments. We'll discuss all your options in detail if we get that diagnosis, and we'll work together to create a plan that fits your lifestyle and needs. As for work, we can talk about a note for your employer if you need it. Depending on the diagnosis, you might need some time off, but we can also explore options like working remotely or adjusting your schedule. Right now, let's focus on getting those tests done. Once we have the results, we'll have a much clearer picture of what we're dealing with and can make a plan together. Do you have any immediate concerns that I can address right now?
PATIENT: No… I think… I think that's okay. Just… getting the tests done. And waiting. That’s the hardest part, I think. Waiting and worrying. I guess… I guess I’ll go schedule the tests. Thank you, Dr. Rakosky. For explaining everything and… not making me feel stupid. I really appreciate it. I think that’s all for now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. It's my job to make sure you feel comfortable and informed. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns while you're waiting for the results. We're here to support you. I'll have the nurse give you the lab requisition forms and instructions for the stool sample collection. Take care of yourself, and try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, Jase. .
