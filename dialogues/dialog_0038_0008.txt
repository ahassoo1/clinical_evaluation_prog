DOCTOR: Good morning, Leander. I'm Dr. Auelua. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, right. My ear… it feels blocked, you know? Full. Been like that for a bit now. Honestly, I don’t really remember when it started, just… is full. I’d like to get it sorted if possible. Don’t have time for this, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blocked ear that feels full. I understand you’d like to get it sorted as quickly as possible. No problem, we’ll do our best. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. It’s not painful, thankfully. Just… there. Like something’s stuffed in there, but it isn’t. And it’s… both ears, I think? Or maybe just the left one is worse? It’s hard to say. I work outside a lot, you see. Agricultural inspections… dust, wind… all sorts of things. Could be that. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologise at all, Leander. That’s perfectly alright. Dust and wind exposure certainly could be a factor. It's good to hear there's no pain. So, both ears feel blocked, but the left one is worse… Is the blockage constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, I think. Or… mostly. I wouldn’t say it disappears entirely, but sometimes it’s… less noticeable. When I’m busy, maybe? Distracted. It’s hard to tell if that’s just me not paying attention, though. Look, is there a quick fix for this? I really need to get back to work. Inspections are piling up.
DOCTOR: I understand your need to get back to work quickly, and we'll try to be efficient. Constant blockage, even if it fluctuates… Okay. Before we jump to a quick fix, I'd like to take a quick look in your ears to get a better idea of what we’re dealing with. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Just… quick, if you wouldn’t mind. I’ve got a lot on my plate. I don’t really like things in my ears though, if you can avoid it. Is there anything… unpleasant about this? Like water? Or loud noises?
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Leander. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. We use a light and an otoscope – it doesn’t involve any water, and won't be loud. It might feel a little cool, but it shouldn't be unpleasant. I'll explain everything as I go. If you could just sit back and relax, I’ll take a look. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Relax… easier said than done when you've got deadlines looming. Just… be careful, okay? And don't take too long. This is… unnerving, I must admit. I haven’t had my ears looked at since I was a boy, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Leander. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. I’ll be as quick and gentle as I promised. Okay, looking at your left ear… there's some cerumen – earwax – present, and it does appear to be quite impacted. That’s likely contributing to the blockage. Your right ear has some wax build-up as well, but it's not as severe. The ear canals themselves look normal, no redness or swelling that I can see. The tympanic membranes – eardrums – look a little dull, but I can see them moving normally. No obvious signs of infection.
PATIENT: Dull, you say? Is that bad? I don't know what any of that means. Look, can you just… get the wax out? Is that the problem? If it’s just wax, just remove it and I’ll be on my way. I’ve got inspections to do, you know. Fields aren't going to inspect themselves.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask. "Dull" can indicate fluid behind the eardrum, which could be a sign of a mild infection or fluid buildup, but it’s not necessarily a cause for immediate concern, especially given your symptoms. Given the amount of wax build-up, that’s the most likely culprit for the blockage. We can certainly try removing the wax. It’s a relatively simple procedure. We have a few options: we can try a simple irrigation with warm water, or I can use special instruments to gently remove it manually. Do you have a preference?
PATIENT: Irrigation sounds… less invasive. I don’t like things poking around in my ears. If warm water will do the trick, let’s try that. Just… promise me it won’t be cold. And quick, please. I really appreciate you trying to be efficient. These fields… they’re a mess this year.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Warm water it is. We'll use a device to gently flush out the wax. It shouldn't be uncomfortable, but let me know if you feel any pain or dizziness during the process. I'm going to tilt your head slightly and gently flush warm water into your ear canal. It might feel a little strange, like a pressure sensation. I'll then use a bulb syringe to suction out the water and any wax particles. We'll repeat the process if necessary. Ready?
PATIENT: Ready, I suppose. Just… don't fill it with water, alright? I've heard stories. And be gentle, like you said. These ears are all I’ve got for listening to the complaints of farmers. They have a lot of complaints, believe me. Just get it done, quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with the left ear. Tilting your head slightly… and here we go. Gentle warm water… Okay, that seems to have loosened a significant amount of the wax. Still a bit left, but much improved. Let's repeat on the right ear… Alright, that's much better on both sides. I've removed the bulk of the wax from both ears. The ear canals look clear, and the tympanic membranes appear brighter now. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Hmm. It feels… less blocked, yes. It’s hard to say. Like a weight has been lifted, maybe? Still a little… muffled, but much better. It’s definitely an improvement. Can I… hear you better now? Honestly, it’s difficult to tell. I’ve been straining my ears for years talking to those farmers. They mumble. But yes, I think so. Is that all you need to do? Can I go now? The fields… they’re waiting.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Leander. "Less blocked" is a good sign. It's common to have some residual muffling after wax removal, especially if you've had a build-up for a while. I'd like to do a quick hearing test just to get a baseline and see if there's any hearing loss. It's a simple test, just listening for tones in headphones. It won’t take more than a few minutes. Then we can discuss a plan to prevent this from happening again. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A hearing test… Look, I really don’t have time for tests. I appreciate you trying to be thorough, but those fields aren’t going to inspect themselves. Honestly, just tell me if I’m going deaf and I’ll get on with it. No time for headphones and tones. I’ll just… turn up the volume. Can we skip the test? Please? I’m sure my hearing is fine. I hear the complaints just fine, don't I?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Leander. I wouldn’t push you into anything you're not comfortable with. While a hearing test would give us a more precise measurement, it's not essential at this point. Given that you’re able to hear and communicate, and you’re not experiencing any significant difficulty, we can skip the test for now. However, I strongly recommend that you consider getting one in the future if you notice any further changes in your hearing. Let’s discuss some preventative measures, then. Do you work in particularly dusty or windy conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, constantly! Fields, you see? Dust, wind… all sorts of things blowing around. I wear a hat, usually, but it doesn’t cover my ears, obviously. I suppose I could try… earplugs? But they’d be uncomfortable, I imagine. And I need to hear what the farmers are saying, even if they are mumbling. It’s a difficult situation. Is there anything else I can do? Perhaps a special hat? Do they make hats that cover your ears? I'd rather not wear earplugs if I can avoid it. Honestly, I just want to get back to the fields.
DOCTOR: You're right, a special hat could be a good option. There are hats designed with ear flaps or integrated ear protection. We could also look into custom-molded earplugs with filters that allow speech to pass through while reducing harmful noise levels. Those would be more comfortable than standard foam earplugs. For now, I recommend that you try to avoid prolonged exposure to loud noises and dust whenever possible. And if you notice any changes in your hearing, such as ringing in your ears, dizziness, or difficulty understanding speech, please come back to see me immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just... get back to the fields, that's all. Thank you for… unblocking my ears, I suppose. And thank you for trying to be quick. I appreciate it. I'll look into a hat, maybe. If I can find one that doesn't look ridiculous.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Leander. I’m glad I could help. And don't worry about the hat – practicality is more important than appearance! Here’s a summary of our visit: we removed impacted earwax from both ears, discussed preventative measures, and agreed to monitor your hearing. If you experience any changes, don't hesitate to come back. Have a good day, and good luck with the inspections. .
