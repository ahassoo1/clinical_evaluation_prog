DOCTOR: Hello, Ms. Fabing. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's not really seeing you for anything, I just need to get some forms filled out. Medicare sent me over – said I needed to have a doctor sign off on some things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Medicare paperwork can be…involved. Let me pull up your file here… Fabing, Thyra… yes, here we are. It looks like this is the annual wellness visit paperwork. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. Annual wellness… yep. I don't really know all the names of 'em, to be honest. Just what the lady on the phone told me. Is it going to be a long process?
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't be too long. Mostly just some questions about your health history, and a quick check of your vitals. We'll go through it together. First, let’s confirm some basics. You were born in…?
PATIENT: March 12th, 1990. That's right. And I’m married, still. To Dale Fabing. We’ve been together a long time now.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And are there any changes to your insurance information, or your emergency contact details?
PATIENT: Nope, everything's the same. Still got Medicare, and Dale's my emergency contact. Phone number hasn't changed either. He's a pretty steady guy, Dale is.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let's get into a bit more detail about your health. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Nothing major, really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. And I had my tonsils out when I was little, but that was ages ago. Nothing in the last, oh, ten years, at least. I’ve been pretty healthy, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to hear. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I can eat pretty much anything. No known allergies. My mom always said I had a cast iron stomach. I've never had a reaction to any medicine that I can remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. I try to just… eat healthy and get enough sleep, if I can. Dale always says I worry too much, so I try not to take a lot of stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant health problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: That’s a tough one. My grandma, on my mom’s side, had diabetes. And my grandpa, he had some heart trouble when he got older. On Dale’s side… I don't really know, to be honest. We haven't talked about it much. It’s not something people really talk about in our families, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s quite common. Just let me document what you do know, and that’s perfectly fine. So, diabetes in your maternal grandmother and heart trouble in your maternal grandfather. Now, thinking about your lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, not at all. Never smoked a day in my life. And I don’t drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. And definitely no drugs. I work, and then I spend time with Dale. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. Just a few more questions, and then we can do a quick physical exam, just to make sure everything looks okay. Do you have any current complaints or concerns that you'd like to discuss today?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really. I mean, I get tired sometimes, but that’s just from work, I think. I’m a control and valve installer, so it’s pretty physical. Nothing that keeps me up at night or anything. Everything’s been pretty good, all things considered. Just trying to get this paperwork done, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's good to hear. Now, let’s just do a quick check of your vitals – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. And then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your ears, nose, and throat. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yep, that's fine. Sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is 122/78, which is good. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. Ears look clear. Nose looks clear. Throat looks fine, no redness or swelling. Everything looks good so far.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear. I always get a little nervous with the stethoscope, to be honest. Glad everything checked out alright. So, what happens next? Is that all the paperwork I need you to sign off on?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel that way! Yes, this is all the information I need for the annual wellness visit. I'm just finalizing the form now and adding my signature. Here you go. This is a copy for your records. You can submit this to Medicare. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Perfect! Thank you so much, Dr. Piet. You made that really easy. No, I think that’s everything. I appreciate your help. Have a good day! .
