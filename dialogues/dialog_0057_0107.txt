DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thank you. My heart… it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s flapping. Not always, but… yeah. It’s hard to explain. It’s why I came.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Funny” and “flapping” are good ways to describe it. It’s helpful that you’re trying to explain it to me. When you say it feels funny, can you tell me a little more about that sensation?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not pain. Not like a hurt feeling. It’s… fast. Like a bird maybe? Inside my chest. And sometimes I feel… tired after. Not a big tired, just… a little weak. Does that make sense? I don’t know much about hearts, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Puder. A fast fluttering sensation is a common way people describe palpitations. And feeling tired afterward is good information to know. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me roughly how often this happens?
PATIENT: Not every day. Maybe… two or three times a week? Sometimes it happens when I am working, sometimes when I am just sitting. It’s not on a schedule. I try not to worry about it, but my wife, she says I should see a doctor. She worries more than me.
DOCTOR: That’s good of your wife to encourage you to come in. It’s always better to check things out. And it's helpful to know it's not consistently linked to activity. When this happens, how long does the fluttering sensation last?
PATIENT: Not long. Maybe… thirty seconds? Sometimes a minute. It stops on its own. Then I feel okay again, mostly. Like I said, just a little tired sometimes. It doesn’t scare me, but it’s… not normal, right? I feel it in my chest, here.
DOCTOR: No, it's not necessarily normal, and it's good you're paying attention to it. Thirty seconds to a minute is helpful to know. And pointing to where you feel it is very useful. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other symptoms when this happens – like dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain – even a mild discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness. And I can breathe okay. No pain. Like I said, just the fast feeling and maybe a little tired after. Sometimes I feel warm, like a little sweat, but not always. I don't get scared, but it’s… unsettling. It just happens. Is it… serious, Doctor? My work is… important.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness or shortness of breath is good. And the occasional warmth or sweating is noted. It's understandable to be concerned about your work. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything with your heart?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I've never been to a doctor much, honestly. Just for small things, like a cold. My wife, she goes regular. I try to stay healthy. I work hard, but I eat okay, I think. Mostly rice and chicken. Sometimes fish. No… nothing wrong with my heart before, Doctor. I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And it’s helpful you haven’t had any previous diagnoses. What about your family?
PATIENT: My father… he had problems with his legs. Old age, the doctor said. My mother, she was healthy. No heart problems that I know of. No one in my family… sick with the heart, I think. They all lived long lives, mostly. Not like me, worrying about things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And it's good to hear your family had long lives. Now, do you take any medications currently – even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't like taking pills. I drink tea sometimes, when I am tired. But no medicine. My wife, she takes something for her blood pressure, but not me. I try to stay away from the doctors, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And I understand your preference to avoid medication. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing. I eat everything. My wife, she's careful with what she eats, but I... I eat. No problems with allergies, ever. I've never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very good to know. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs and check your pulse. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Puder. I’m listening now. Your heart rate is a little fast, even at rest, which is consistent with what you’ve described. I also hear a slightly irregular rhythm – meaning the beats aren’t perfectly even. Your lungs sound clear. Your pulse is a bit weak. Blood pressure is 128/78. That is within normal range. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to order an EKG – that’s an electrocardiogram – to record your heart’s electrical activity. We’ll also do some blood work to check your electrolytes, thyroid function, and complete blood count. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: EKG… is that bad, Doctor? Blood work… I don't like needles. But… if you think it’s important, I will do it. My wife, she says I should listen to you. So… yes, okay. What do I have to do?
DOCTOR: No, an EKG isn’t bad at all. It's completely painless. It just involves placing some sticky patches on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart’s electrical activity. It takes just a few minutes. The blood work will involve a small needle prick to draw some blood. The lab technician is very skilled, and it will be over quickly. We just need a small sample. I think it’s important to rule out any underlying causes for your palpitations, and these tests will help us do that. We can get those done right here in the clinic. How about we get the EKG done first, and then we’ll do the blood work?
PATIENT: Okay. EKG first. That sounds… easier. My wife always says I worry too much. But… better safe, right? Where do we do it? And… will it take long? I have work this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, better safe is always a good approach. It won’t take long at all, Mr. Puder. We’ll just go to the room next door. The technician, Maria, will explain everything to you. It will likely take around 10-15 minutes total, including preparation. Once the EKG is done, we’ll get the blood work started, and then you should be able to get back to work this afternoon. Let’s head over there now. Maria is ready for you. Do you need help getting up?
PATIENT: No, I am okay. I can walk. Thank you, Doctor. Lead the way. I hope it doesn’t take too long. Work is… busy.
DOCTOR: Maria, this is Mr. Puder. He’s here for an EKG. Maria will take excellent care of you. Just let her know if you have any questions or feel uncomfortable at any time. I’ll be right next door if you need me.
