DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s this pain in my side… my flank, I think it’s called? It keeps coming back, and with it, these water infections. It’s been happening for a while now, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, flank pain and recurrent water infections… I understand. Let's get some more details so we can figure out what’s going on. When did this pain start initially?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it's hard to say exactly. It feels like it started… maybe six months ago? It wasn’t too bad at first, just a dull ache now and then. But it’s gotten worse over time, and more frequent, you see. It comes and goes, but it's rarely completely gone.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months ago, starting as a dull ache and progressing. And you mentioned the water infections happening at the same time – how often would you say you’ve been getting those in the last six months?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I’d say at least four times, Doctor. Maybe five. Each time the pain gets really bad, then I feel like I need to go to the bathroom constantly, and it burns. It’s quite unpleasant. I usually go to the pharmacy for something, but they just keep coming back.
DOCTOR: Okay, recurrent urinary tract infections roughly four to five times in the last six months, coinciding with the flank pain. Have you noticed any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting with either the pain or the infections?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills, Doctor. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. Sometimes I feel a bit weak when the pain is bad, and a little bit queasy, but I haven’t actually been sick, you understand? No vomiting or anything like that. Just… generally unwell.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, or vomiting, just weakness and occasional nausea. And the pain… can you describe the pain more specifically?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… it’s a deep ache, mostly. It’s on my side, here, just below my ribs. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a constant pressure. And sometimes it feels like it goes all the way through to my back. It doesn’t really move around, it stays pretty much in the same spot. It’s hard to explain, really. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a constant, deep ache localized to your flank, radiating to your back. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor at the hospital… a few years back now… he told me I have something wrong with my kidneys. Polycystic Kidney Disease, he called it. I don't really understand it myself, to be honest. He said there were lots of little… bubbles on my kidneys. He sent me to a specialist, but they didn’t really explain much, and I haven’t been back since. It was a lot to take in, you see, and I just… sort of left it at that. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Polycystic Kidney Disease… that’s very important information, thank you for telling me. And have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations other than the diagnosis of PKD?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the usual childhood things, like tonsils out when I was little. Nothing major. No other hospital stays or surgeries, no. I’ve always been quite healthy, otherwise. Until this started, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out as a child, otherwise no significant surgical history. Now, regarding your family, has anyone else in your family had kidney problems, or any similar symptoms to what you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my older brother… he had some trouble with his waterworks when he was older, but I don’t know what it was. He didn’t talk about it much. Nobody else, not that I’m aware of. We don’t really keep in touch with the rest of the family, you see. It's a long story.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I live alone in a small house, just me. I try to keep active, go for walks most days when the weather is nice. I enjoy gardening, mostly vegetables. I don't smoke, and I only drink a little bit of alcohol – a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I eat pretty healthy, I think… lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. I don’t do much travelling these days, just potter about really.
DOCTOR: Okay, healthy lifestyle, no smoking, minimal alcohol. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any problems with medicines before. The pharmacy lady usually asks, and I always tell her I don’t have any allergies. I haven't had any reactions, anyway. Is that everything?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for that thorough information, Mr. Espinueva. Now, I’m going to perform a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your abdomen, check your back for tenderness, and take your blood pressure. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds. There is some mild tenderness when I press on your left flank, and a bit of discomfort when I tap over your left kidney area. Your blood pressure is 145/90, which is a little elevated. I’m also noting some swelling in your ankles, which could be related to kidney function. Based on your history and this quick exam, your recurrent flank pain and water infections, combined with your history of Polycystic Kidney Disease and elevated blood pressure, are concerning. I want to order some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Specifically, I want a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a urinalysis with culture, and an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your kidneys. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you see. It’s been worrying me. So, yes, please, go ahead with those tests. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. The lab is just down the hall. You’ll need to give a blood sample and a urine sample. The urine sample is best collected first thing in the morning, so if possible, try to collect it before you eat or drink anything. The receptionist will give you the necessary containers and instructions. Once we have the results, which usually takes a few days, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a treatment plan. In the meantime, it’s important to stay well-hydrated – drink plenty of water. Also, try to avoid strenuous activity. If you experience a fever, chills, severe pain, or difficulty urinating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think I understand. Drink plenty of water, avoid strenuous activity, and see a doctor if things get worse. Yes. Just… how serious is this Polycystic Kidney Disease? I didn’t really understand when they told me at the hospital. Is it… life-threatening?
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Mr. Espinueva, and it’s good you asked. Polycystic Kidney Disease is a genetic condition that causes cysts to grow on your kidneys. These cysts can gradually enlarge, damaging the kidneys and eventually leading to kidney failure. It's a progressive disease, meaning it gets worse over time. However, the severity can vary greatly from person to person. Some people may live a relatively normal life for many years with minimal symptoms, while others may experience more rapid decline in kidney function. It can be life-threatening if it progresses to kidney failure, which would require dialysis or a kidney transplant. But with proper management – including controlling blood pressure, staying hydrated, and avoiding certain medications – we can slow down the progression and manage the symptoms effectively. These tests we’re ordering will help us determine the extent of the damage and guide our treatment plan. It’s important to remember that we’re catching this early, and there are things we can do to help. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so, Doctor. That’s… a lot to take in. But thank you for explaining it so clearly. I appreciate that. I’ll go and get those tests done, and I’ll… I’ll try not to worry too much. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything I should avoid eating or drinking?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. It is a lot to take in, and you’re right to ask questions. For now, there aren't any specific dietary restrictions you need to follow. However, it’s generally a good idea to limit your sodium intake, as high sodium can raise your blood pressure. Also, avoid excessive protein intake, as your kidneys may have difficulty processing it. I’ll also give you a referral to a nephrologist – a kidney specialist – once we have the test results. They can provide more specialized care and guidance. It’s important to remember that you’re not alone in this. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any further questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything. Thank you so much for your time and for explaining everything so patiently. You've put my mind at ease a little, at least. I’ll go and get those tests done now. Thank you again, Doctor Annesley.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll be in touch as soon as the test results are available. Take care, and I’ll see you soon. .
