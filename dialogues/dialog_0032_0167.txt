DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you're 87 years young. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, eighty-seven. Seems like yesterday, but… time goes fast. I have a sore on my foot. A bad one. It hurts a lot, especially when I try to walk. It’s been getting worse, and my daughter, she told me I need to come see a doctor. She worries a lot, that one.
DOCTOR: A sore on your foot, getting worse… understandable that your daughter is concerned. Can you describe the sore for me?
PATIENT: Well… it’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It’s… red, and kinda deep. Not a scrape, you know? More like… a hole. And it’s wet sometimes. It smells a little bit too, I think. I try to keep it clean, but it’s hard to reach.
DOCTOR: A deep sore, red, wet, and with an odor… I see. And how long has it been present, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I’m not so good with dates these days. Maybe… a month? More than a few weeks, for sure. I thought it was just a blister at first, from my slippers maybe. But it didn’t get better, and then it got… like this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling around the sore, or any redness extending from the sore itself?
PATIENT: Swelling… not much, no. A little puffy around it sometimes, but not like… big and hard. And the red… it mostly stays in the hole, not spreading too much. It’s just… angry-looking, that sore. Very angry.
DOCTOR: "Angry-looking" is a good way to put it, Mr. Stoegbauer. Now, I'm going to need to take a closer look at this sore. Would you mind if I performed a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, no problem, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust your judgment. It’s just… I don’t like things on my feet. Always been sensitive. Be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle as possible. Please have a seat and I’ll take a look. Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. There is a fairly deep ulceration on the plantar surface of your foot, near the base of the fifth toe. The surrounding skin is slightly erythematous, and there's a small amount of purulent drainage. No significant warmth to the touch, but the area is tender to palpation. The pulses in your foot are present, though somewhat diminished. Do you have diabetes, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh… yes. My doctor told me a long time ago. Type 2, I think. I try to take my medicine, but sometimes I forget. I also try to watch what I eat, but I like my rice. It’s hard.
DOCTOR: I see. And how often would you say you check your blood sugar levels at home?
PATIENT: Well… not very often, Doctor. Maybe once a week, if that. My daughter, she bought me a machine, but it’s… complicated. And it pokes my finger. I don’t like that part. It makes me feel faint sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. This sore, combined with your history of diabetes and infrequent blood sugar monitoring, is concerning, Mr. Stoegbauer. It's possible this is a diabetic foot ulcer. These can become quite serious if left untreated. We need to get this properly assessed and treated. I’m going to order some labs – a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel – to check your overall health and blood sugar levels. I’d also like to get an x-ray of your foot to rule out any underlying bone infection. Do you have any allergies to medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife, she used to keep track of all that, but… she’s gone now. I don’t think I’ve had an allergy ever. But I do get a little sleepy when I take some medicines.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, Mr. Stoegbauer, I’m concerned enough about this ulcer that I’m going to recommend a referral to a podiatrist – a foot specialist. They’re better equipped to manage these types of wounds and will be able to provide the specialized care you need. I’m also going to strongly advise you to get your blood sugar under better control. We can discuss strategies for that, and I can refer you to a diabetes educator if you’d like. In the meantime, it’s vital that you keep all weight off of this foot as much as possible. Do you have a cane or walker you can use?
PATIENT: A cane… yes. I have one. My daughter bought it for me too. I don’t use it all the time, but I have it. It’s in the hallway. Keeping weight off… that’s going to be hard. I like to walk in the garden. But I understand. If you think it’s best… I’ll try.
DOCTOR: It is best, Mr. Stoegbauer. And believe me, preventing complications is much easier than treating them. I’m going to write you a prescription for a course of oral antibiotics to help prevent infection while we await your podiatry appointment. I’ll also send these lab orders to the front desk, and they’ll get you scheduled for blood work. I’m going to give you a written summary of these instructions, as well. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Not right now, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. But… how long will it take to see this foot doctor? And will it hurt? I don’t like pain.
DOCTOR: The podiatrist’s office is quite busy, unfortunately. It looks like the earliest appointment is in approximately three weeks. As for pain, they will likely need to debride – that is, remove – any dead or infected tissue from the ulcer, which can be uncomfortable. They will use local anesthesia to minimize the pain during that process, and will be able to prescribe pain medication if needed. We will do everything we can to ensure your comfort. And remember, ignoring this problem will only make it worse and more painful in the long run. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Three weeks… that’s a long time. Okay. I’ll try to be patient. No, I don’t think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for your help. You’ve been very kind. And please tell your staff I appreciate them too. They were very nice.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. Get some rest, and try to keep the weight off that foot. The staff does their best. I’ll see you back in a few weeks. .
