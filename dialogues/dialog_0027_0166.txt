DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Tarin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for having me. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s been… persistent enough that I thought I should get it checked out. It started a little over a week ago, I believe – August 26th, to be precise.
DOCTOR: Okay, August 26th… persistent numbness. Right. And is it in just one leg, or both?
PATIENT: It’s just the right leg, Doctor. From the hip down, although it’s more noticeable in my foot and lower calf. It doesn’t feel… completely gone, more like… pins and needles, and a bit of a dull ache sometimes.
DOCTOR: Pins and needles, dull ache… okay. And has anything specific caused it, as far as you know?
PATIENT: That’s the thing, Doctor – not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any injuries, no falls, nothing like that. I’ve been working fairly regularly, mostly at my desk, animating. It just… started one morning. I did spend a rather long stretch bent over the drawing tablet, perhaps twelve hours, but I do that often enough without issue. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Twelve hours bent over… alright. And is it constant, this numbness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, it isn’t constant. It comes and goes. When I’m actively working, it tends to be worse, but even when I’m resting, it flares up occasionally. It's not debilitating, thankfully, but it's… distracting, and a bit worrisome, to be honest. It seems to be a little better in the mornings, but worse as the day goes on.
DOCTOR: Worse with activity, better in the mornings… alright. Have you noticed any weakness in your leg, or any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: No weakness, Doctor, not that I’ve detected. I haven’t dropped anything, or stumbled, or had trouble walking. My balance feels perfectly normal. I do a fair amount of walking when I’m gathering reference materials, and haven't noticed any issues there. It really is mostly the sensation of numbness and the ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No weakness. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’m generally quite healthy. No diagnosed conditions, allergies, or anything of that nature. I've had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I get a yearly checkup with my primary care physician, and everything is always in order. I do have private insurance through my work, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good to know. No allergies, no significant medical history... Alright. And how about family history?
PATIENT: That's a bit… complicated, Doctor. My mother’s side, the Yupik side, we don’t have a lot of detailed medical records. Historically, access to healthcare was limited in many of our communities. My father’s side is of European descent, and they’ve had the usual things – some heart conditions, a bit of diabetes, but nothing that’s particularly concerning or hereditary that I’m aware of. My grandparents on both sides lived to a good age, generally.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s helpful to know either way. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t smoke. I’ll have a glass of wine occasionally with dinner, perhaps once or twice a month, but I don’t drink regularly. And I don’t use any recreational drugs. I maintain a fairly healthy lifestyle, all things considered. Mostly I’m focused on my work and getting outdoors when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s all very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please proceed. I trust your assessment. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just lie down on the table for me, face up. Okay, let's check your reflexes first. Right leg… good. Left leg… good. Now, I'm going to ask you to flex your toes and push against my hand. Right leg… push against me… good strength. Left leg… push against me… good strength. Now, I'm going to lightly touch your legs with this. Tell me when you feel it. Right leg… can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can feel that. It feels… normal. Not overly sensitive, not dull. Just… normal sensation. It’s about the same all the way down my leg, as far as I can tell. Although… now that you mention it, the sensation is a bit muted on the top of my foot, compared to the rest of my leg. Very subtle, but I notice it when you focus on it. Perhaps a little less distinct.
DOCTOR: Muted sensation on the top of the foot… that's helpful to know. And is that where the numbness is most pronounced?
PATIENT: Not necessarily, Doctor. The numbness itself tends to be more… widespread, like a general tingling. But the muted sensation on the top of my foot seems to correlate with the areas where I feel the numbness the most consistently. It’s not a sharp distinction, but it’s a pattern I've noticed. It’s a bit difficult to describe, to be honest. I’m more aware of it when someone – like you – specifically asks about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's understandable. It can be difficult to pinpoint these things. And have you noticed any changes in the color or temperature of your right leg, compared to your left?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No noticeable changes in color or temperature. I haven't seen any swelling, redness, or anything like that. Both legs look and feel the same, visually speaking. It’s almost entirely a sensory issue, not a physical one. It doesn’t look different. That’s why I was concerned enough to come in – it’s more a feeling, an absence of feeling, than anything I can see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tarin. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you could be experiencing peripheral neuropathy. It's a condition that affects the nerves, causing symptoms like numbness, tingling, and pain in the extremities. There are many potential causes. Sometimes it’s related to diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, or other medical conditions. Sometimes it develops for no apparent reason. Given your age, and generally good health, we’ll want to rule out some of the more common causes. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, blood sugar, and thyroid function. I'd also like to consider an MRI of your lower back, just to rule out any nerve compression. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate you outlining the possibilities and suggesting a methodical approach. Yes, blood tests and an MRI sound perfectly alright. I trust your judgment, and I want to get to the bottom of this. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any activities I should avoid, or positions I should be mindful of?
DOCTOR: Good. I’ll get those orders sent to the lab and imaging center. As for now, there's no need to significantly alter your activities. Avoid anything that clearly exacerbates the symptoms - prolonged bending over, if that makes it worse. Gentle stretching and walking can be beneficial, but listen to your body. If something causes pain or worsens the numbness, stop. I'll also recommend a daily multivitamin, just as a precaution. And I'll provide you with a handout explaining peripheral neuropathy, its potential causes, and what to expect. Once we have the results of the tests, we can discuss further treatment options. Depending on the cause, these could range from simple lifestyle changes to medication or physical therapy. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s all very clear. Thank you for being thorough and explaining everything so well. The handout sounds helpful, and I appreciate the advice about listening to my body. I think I'm comfortable proceeding with the tests and seeing what they reveal. I’ll contact the lab and imaging center to schedule appointments. Thank you again for your time and attention to this matter.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tarin. I'm glad I could help. If you have any concerns or questions before your appointments, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. And feel free to reach out after you receive the results, and we can schedule a follow-up to discuss them. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well.
