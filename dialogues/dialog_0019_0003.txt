DOCTOR: Well, hello there, Jerrel. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Nathaneil Renzi, but you can call me Nathaneil. I see you’re 80 years young – that’s wonderful! Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah, hi. Look, I don't have all day, okay? It’s this… shaking. My hand, mostly. It’s been happening for a while now, and frankly, it’s embarrassing. My grandkids were over, and… well, let’s just say serving the spaghetti wasn’t pretty. Is that all you need to know? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Jerrel. No need to rush, but I appreciate you telling me. It is good to get these things checked out, and you’re right, it sounds frustrating. So, this shaking… mostly in your hand, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. Though sometimes my leg does it too. It’s not constant, see? It comes and goes. I thought it was just… old age, you know? Everything starts to fall apart after a while. I don't need a whole song and dance about it. Is this going to take long? I have a bridge game later. Important one.
DOCTOR: I hear you, Jerrel. It's good you're getting it checked out even if you suspect it's just part of getting older. It’s always worth looking into. And don’t worry, we’ll try to be as efficient as possible so you don’t miss your bridge game. You said it comes and goes… can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: When it happens? Honestly, I don't pay that much attention. When I’m trying to do something, usually. Like, holding a fork, or… writing a check, though I mostly have someone else do that these days. It's definitely worse when I'm trying to be precise, I guess. Look, are we going to need blood tests or something? Because I hate needles. And I don't do well waiting around.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be more noticeable when you’re concentrating and needing to be accurate. That’s helpful to know. And you're right to ask about tests – we may need a few, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I certainly won't push anything you’re uncomfortable with. Before we talk about tests, let's just go over a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with anything in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, history. Honestly, it was a long time ago. Let me think... I had… high blood pressure, I think? Years ago. My wife, bless her soul, she kept track of all that. I don’t really remember the details. Maybe some arthritis in my knees. Nothing serious. Look, I’m on Medicare, okay? Whatever they cover is fine with me. I just want this shaking to stop. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Jerrel, that’s not too much to ask at all. We’ll do our best to figure it out. High blood pressure and some arthritis... good to know. And Medicare is perfectly fine – we'll definitely work within your coverage. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications for those conditions, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… I think I have a little pill for the blood pressure. Small, white one. I take it… every day, I think? My daughter fills a little pill organizer for me, so I don’t really keep track. And… sometimes I take something for my knees when they really bother me, but that's just when I need it. Honestly, I don't want to make a big deal out of this. It's just a little shake, alright? I've seen worse. Frankly, I'm starting to feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels that way, Jerrel. I'm just trying to get a complete picture of things. It's not an interrogation, I promise – just routine questions. So, a small white pill for blood pressure… do you happen to know the name of it?
PATIENT: Name? Ugh, no. Absolutely not. I wouldn't know a Lisinopril from a… a… well, anything. My daughter handles all that. She's very organized, thank goodness. Look, I really have to go. Is there anything else you need to know, or can we just get this over with? My partner's going to be upset if I'm late. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Jerrel. It's okay. We can move forward without the specific name right now. Perhaps a quick physical exam would be a good next step?
