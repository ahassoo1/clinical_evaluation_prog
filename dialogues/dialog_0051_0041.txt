DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this weakness, you see. It's been getting worse, little by little. My wife, Leilani, she says I need to come get it checked. She worries about me.
DOCTOR: Weakness… alright. And how long has this weakness been going on, Mr. Astore?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. Maybe… six months now? At first, it was just a little harder to get up from the chair. Now, it’s… well, it takes more effort to walk even. Not all the time, but more often than it used to. It’s in my legs mostly, I think.
DOCTOR: Six months… okay. And is it both legs, or is it worse on one side than the other?
PATIENT: Hmmm… I believe it's both legs, Doctor. But maybe… maybe a little worse on my right side. It's hard to say for sure. Sometimes it feels like they’re both just… heavy. Like trying to walk through water, if that makes sense. Leilani says I shuffle a bit when I walk now, too. She notices these things.
DOCTOR: “Heavy” and shuffling… alright, that's helpful. And has this weakness been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… yes. My vision… it’s been blurry sometimes. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. And I get tired… very tired. Even after a good night’s sleep. It’s not like the tired you get from working hard, it’s… a different kind of tired. Is that… is that normal?
DOCTOR: Blurry vision and fatigue… alright. We'll want to look into that. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… bladder habits? Hmm… I don’t think so. Everything seems… regular, if you know what I mean. No trouble there. Leilani hasn’t said anything about that either, and she always notices. She's very observant.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Astore. And how about any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness… tingling… Yes, sometimes. In my feet, mostly. It’s not constant, comes and goes. Like… pins and needles, you know? It’s worse when I try to sleep sometimes. Makes it hard to get comfortable. It doesn't hurt, exactly, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, numbness and tingling in your feet… We’re gathering a good picture here. Now, have you had any falls recently?
PATIENT: Well… I tripped last month. Didn’t fall all the way down, but I stumbled pretty badly. Leilani helped me steady myself. I haven’t fallen completely down, but I feel… unsteady sometimes. Especially when I turn quickly. It’s been worrying me, that’s for sure. Is this something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for telling me. That’s important information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got that under control with medicine. And… oh, years ago, I had a bad infection in my leg. But that was a long time ago, and it healed up fine. Other than that… not much, I don't think. Leilani handles most of the doctor’s appointments, so she’d know better. I leave the details to her. She's very organized.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure and a previous leg infection. Do you recall what kind of medication you were on for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was a long time ago, Doctor. I believe it started with an ‘A’… amlodipine? Or maybe atenolol? I’m not very good with names, especially medicine names. I just took what the doctor gave me. I stopped taking it a few years ago when he said my blood pressure was under control. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Astore, we can look that up. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I was low on it. And… Leilani gives me something for my joints sometimes, when they bother me. It’s a herbal thing, I think. Something she buys at the store. I don’t know the name of it. She just says it's good for the aches. She’s always looking after me. That’s all I can think of right now.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat all sorts of foods, take any medicine the doctor gives me… I’m pretty lucky that way. Leilani always asks me before she gives me anything new, just to be safe. She’s very cautious. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmmm… Let me see… I had my appendix taken out when I was a young man. That was a long time ago. And… I had a small operation on my knee a few years back, just to clean up some cartilage. Nothing major. Other than that… no, I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a knee operation. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother, she had arthritis. Bad arthritis in her hands and knees. And my brother, he had something with his nerves… made it hard for him to walk sometimes. I don’t remember exactly what it was, something with tingling and weakness. He passed away a few years ago, so I don’t know much more than that. Leilani might know more, she met his wife. It was a long time ago. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful information, Mr. Astore, thank you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I'm retired now, so I don’t work much anymore. I used to work as a trainer, helping athletes. I enjoy spending time with my wife, Leilani. We like to garden, and go to church. I used to be very active, but with this weakness, it's getting harder to do the things I enjoy. I try to walk a little bit each day, but I get tired easily. I don't smoke, and I only drink a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes. That's about it, really. I try to stay healthy, but it’s getting harder these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, Mr. Astore, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not necessarily cause for alarm. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tight as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? I’m trying my best. It feels a little weaker than it used to, but I’m doing what I can. Is that… alright? It doesn’t feel as strong as it used to, I must admit.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, can you push against my hands like this?
PATIENT: I'm trying, Doctor. It's a little harder than it used to be, I'll be honest. I feel… a bit unsteady when I push. I hope that’s alright. I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore, you’re doing great. It does appear your strength is somewhat reduced, particularly in your legs, and your balance is a little unsteady. Now, I’m going to check your feet. Your sensation seems a little diminished in your feet, and there’s some slight swelling. Alright, that completes the basic exam. Now, based on your symptoms and the exam findings, I would like to order some blood work and an MRI of your lower back. The blood work will help rule out any underlying medical conditions, and the MRI will help us see if there’s any compression of the nerves in your lower back. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Blood work and an MRI… That sounds… serious, Doctor. What are you thinking it could be? You mentioned nerves… my brother, he had trouble with his nerves… Is this something like that? What does all this mean?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Astore. It's good you're asking questions. It could be nerve-related, but it’s too early to say definitively. Several things could be causing your symptoms – everything from vitamin deficiencies to spinal compression. That's why we need to run these tests. The MRI will help us visualize the spine and identify any potential issues. The blood work will check for things like vitamin B12 levels, which can affect nerve function. We need to gather more information before we can determine the exact cause and the best course of treatment. It's important not to jump to conclusions at this point. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, which is sometimes used in MRIs?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… no, I don't think so. I've never had an MRI before, so I've never been exposed to it. Leilani hasn't mentioned anything about allergies, and she remembers everything. So, you think it’s not a bad thing to get these tests done? I’m just worried about what they might find. What happens if they find something… serious?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel anxious, Mr. Astore. Getting the tests is the best way to find out what's going on and determine the best course of action. Even if we do find something, knowing what we're dealing with allows us to create a treatment plan. Many conditions are manageable with medication, physical therapy, or other interventions. Regarding the contrast dye, we’ll ask you a few more questions before the MRI to ensure you're a good candidate. We always prioritize your safety. Let’s focus on getting the tests scheduled first. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, come in and explain the process and schedule the appointments for you. She can also answer any questions you have about the logistics and preparation involved. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Maria… alright. I appreciate that. It’s good to have someone explain things in detail. I just want to get this figured out, you know? And get back to spending time with Leilani in the garden. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Astore. That's a wonderful goal, and we'll do everything we can to help you get back to enjoying those things. I’ll have Maria come in now to schedule the tests and answer your questions. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as increased weakness, numbness, or difficulty walking – please don't hesitate to call the office immediately. Maria, could you please come in for a moment?
