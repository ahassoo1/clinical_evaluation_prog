DOCTOR: Right, Ms. Nissenbaum. Yes, well, let’s get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s quite simple. I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of my left ear. And half my face feels… floppy. Like when you’ve been to the dentist and it’s still numb, but not quite as bad. It’s very inconvenient, you understand. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes. Right. Floppy… hmm. And this happened just this morning?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly this morning. I went to bed perfectly fine, and woke up like…this. It wasn’t a gradual thing, if that’s what you’re asking. I didn’t bump my head or anything silly. Really, it’s just… appeared. I do hope it’s not something terribly serious, because I have a board meeting next week.
DOCTOR: Board meeting… Of course. And no pain at all?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. More…a strange pressure, perhaps? It's difficult to describe. And it's mostly just the not being able to hear, and this…droopiness. It's unsettling, frankly. Are you going to poke and prod at me now? Because I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we have to see what’s going on, don't we?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Just…be gentle, alright? I don’t need a complicated procedure if a simple fix exists. I’ve never been one for fuss. And please, don't tell me everything that could be wrong. I’m not a doctor. I just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I'm just going to do a quick exam. Please open your mouth and say “Ah.” And then I’ll take a look in your ears.
PATIENT: Honestly. It's like being a child again. Ah. There. Now can we hurry this along? I have a reputation to maintain, you know. It’s not all about board meetings, though those are important too.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tongue is…normal. Ear canal appears clear, but the tympanic membrane…slightly dull on the left side. Not a significant amount of cerumen. And…yes, there is some mild facial droop, particularly on the left side. Can you raise your eyebrows?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s…difficult. The left one doesn't quite go as high. And it feels…tight. Are you sure this isn’t just a muscle spasm? I did have a rather stressful week. It's not as if I spend my days lounging around. A lot is expected of me.
DOCTOR: Stress can contribute to…things. But the unilateral hearing loss and the facial weakness… those aren't typical for just stress. Can you smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Perfectly pleasant, isn’t it? Although it feels…strange. Like half my face is going to slide off. Honestly, this is quite alarming. Are you certain you've seen cases like this before? Because I’d feel much better knowing you aren’t experimenting on me.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Nissenbaum, I am a qualified physician. Your presentation is…concerning, and strongly suggests Bell’s Palsy. Though, to be certain, we need to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Absolutely not. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, thank you very much. Organic diet, regular exercise, the usual. I’m very particular about my health. Though, my late husband…he had some issues with his blood sugar. But that was him, not me. Surely that’s irrelevant? This all sounds rather complicated, and I’m beginning to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: Yes, family history is…noted. Alright. Given your age and symptoms, and the fact that you have no other neurological deficits…Bell’s Palsy remains the most likely diagnosis. However, we need to rule out a stroke. I'm going to order a CT scan, just to be safe. And I’ll write you a prescription for Prednisone. It won't necessarily cure it, but it can help reduce inflammation.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Prednisone? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. I didn't come here for tests and drugs! Can't you just fix it? Is this going to interfere with my board meeting? Because if I can’t speak properly, it’s going to be a disaster. And what are the side effects of this…Prednisone? I don’t want to gain weight.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your frustration. But a CT scan is necessary to rule out a more serious condition. Prednisone has potential side effects, yes, but the benefits in this case outweigh the risks. Weight gain is a possibility, but it's often minimal. As for your board meeting… I can write a note explaining your condition, but ultimately, you need to prioritize your health. I'll refer you to a neurologist for follow-up. They’ll be able to provide a more definitive prognosis and treatment plan. Now, do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I'm very careful about what I put in my body. I eat all organic, as I said. But this…neurologist? More doctors? Honestly, it's like a revolving door here. Will they be able to undo this, or am I stuck looking like this forever? I have important appearances to maintain, you know. This is utterly unacceptable. And frankly, I’m beginning to suspect this all started after that flu shot I got last month. Is that a possibility? Because I distinctly remember the nurse saying there could be…side effects. .
DOCTOR: Flu shot…possible, though not directly causative. The timing is…coincidental. I'll make a note of it. I’m referring you to Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s excellent. And yes, it’s possible to recover fully from Bell’s Palsy, but it can take time. I’ll print out the CT scan order and the referral, and the note for your board meeting. Are there any other questions before I…conclude this consultation?
