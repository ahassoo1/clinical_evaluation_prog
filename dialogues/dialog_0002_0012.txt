DOCTOR: Hi Velda, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because I’m planning a cruise – a rather lovely one, actually – and the cruise line requires some medical information before I can confirm my booking. They’ve asked me to get a statement from my doctor, and I thought it best to come directly to you.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes perfect sense. A pre-cruise medical clearance is pretty standard. Let me pull up your chart… Alright, Velda Squiers, age 45. Just so I have a good understanding, are there any specific concerns the cruise line mentioned, or are they just looking for a general statement of your health?
PATIENT: No, nothing specific, Doctor. They sent a rather long form, truthfully. It asks about all sorts of things - past illnesses, medications, allergies… just a comprehensive overview, really. I didn’t quite know what they were looking for, to be honest, and I thought it simpler to just have a doctor complete it. It’s a bit overwhelming for a layperson, if you understand me.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand. Those forms can be quite detailed! No problem at all, that's what I'm here for. Let's work through it together. We can start with your past medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I had a rather bad case of pneumonia when I was about twenty-two, and spent a week in hospital for that. Other than that… and a broken wrist as a child, falling out of a tree – a rather silly incident, now that I think of it – I’ve been quite healthy, thankfully. My late husband always said I had a constitution of iron.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! Pneumonia is significant, so thank you for mentioning that. And a broken wrist is good to note, too. Okay, pneumonia at age 22…anything else related to that hospitalization – any complications, ongoing issues afterwards?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. I recovered fully. The doctors said it was a particularly stubborn strain, but thankfully it cleared up. I did have a bit of a lingering cough for a few weeks afterwards, but that passed with time and plenty of rest. It didn’t require any further treatment, thankfully. It was many years ago now, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. So, no lasting effects from the pneumonia. Now, let's move on to past surgical history. Have you ever had any operations or procedures done?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. I've been very fortunate – I’ve never required any surgery or procedures. Just the usual things, I suppose - vaccinations as a child, that sort of thing. Nothing more substantial, I assure you. I’ve always tried to avoid hospitals when possible.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful! Alright, no surgical history. Now, how about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a bit of a tricky one, Doctor. My father had high blood pressure, I believe. And my mother… she suffered from arthritis in her later years, quite badly. And my grandmother, on my mother's side, had diabetes, but that was a very long time ago. Beyond that, I’m not entirely certain, truthfully. My family wasn’t terribly forthcoming with medical details, if you understand me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Family medical history can be difficult to gather. Okay, so high blood pressure in your father, arthritis in your mother, and diabetes in your grandmother. That gives us a starting point. Do you know if anyone in your family has had heart disease, cancer, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… My uncle, my father’s brother, had a stroke about ten years ago, I believe. And…oh dear, now I’m wracking my brain. I recall my cousin, on my mother’s side, was diagnosed with breast cancer a few years ago, but she’s doing well, thankfully. Beyond that…nothing immediately springs to mind, Doctor. I truly wish I could be more helpful. I feel rather inadequate recalling these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Velda. You're doing great. It's common to not have all the details. Okay, stroke in an uncle, breast cancer in a cousin. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a small glass of sherry at Christmas, but that’s it. I’ve always preferred a cup of tea, truthfully. I find it much more soothing.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Well, "regularly" might be a bit strong, Doctor. I do enjoy a good walk in the park most days, if the weather permits. And I potter about in my garden quite a bit – that keeps me fairly active. It’s not strenuous exercise, but it keeps me moving, certainly. I used to do a bit more when my husband was still with us, but…
DOCTOR: Okay, walking and gardening – that’s excellent. Keeping active is important. Now, I’m going to ask a slightly more personal question, just to get a complete picture of your health. Are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Goodness. Doctor, with the greatest respect… my husband passed away five years ago. I am a widow, and… well, I have not remarried. So, no. I am not currently sexually active. I apologize for the bluntness, but I wasn’t quite prepared for such a question.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that question was a bit abrupt, Velda. It’s part of a routine health assessment, but I understand it can be sensitive. Thank you for your honesty. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything, and I've never had any issues with medications. I do occasionally get a slight rash if I use a particularly harsh soap, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Alright, Velda, that covers a lot of important information. Just to quickly recap: no significant medical history beyond childhood pneumonia, no surgeries, family history of high blood pressure, arthritis, diabetes, stroke, and breast cancer, non-smoker, occasional alcohol, regular walking and gardening, and no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. I'm happy to proceed. I trust your judgment completely. Just tell me what you'd like me to do, and I'll do my best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just step onto the table for me, please. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi. Respiration is unlabored. Now, I’ll take your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Finally, I’ll take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Nose is clear. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. Everything appears to be within normal limits.
PATIENT: That’s very reassuring to hear, Doctor. I appreciate you being so thorough. It's good to know everything appears to be in order. What does this mean for the form, though? Can you complete it now, based on what we’ve discussed?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I’m noting your past pneumonia, the family history details, and the results of the physical exam – everything within normal limits. I’ll also add a statement confirming that you are currently in good health and fit to travel, based on this assessment. Here you go. Please review it to make sure everything is accurate. I’ve included my contact information should the cruise line require any further clarification.
PATIENT: Oh, excellent! Yes, this all looks perfectly correct, Doctor. You’ve been wonderfully comprehensive, and I’m very grateful for your time and attention. This will put my mind at ease considerably, and allow me to enjoy my cruise without worry. Thank you again. Is there anything I owe you for this consultation?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Velda. I’m glad I could help. As you haven’t got insurance, the fee for the consultation is £75, please. I hope you have a wonderful time on your cruise! Do feel free to reach out if any concerns arise before your trip.
PATIENT: Certainly. Here you are, Doctor. And thank you again for everything. I will certainly keep your details in mind, should I need them. I appreciate your kindness and thoroughness. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ll be on my way. Have a lovely day, Doctor Ranjan. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Velda. Enjoy your cruise, and please don't hesitate to contact me if you need anything. Have a wonderful day to you too! .
