DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, I keep getting… a red face. A flushing, I think my daughter called it. It just… comes and goes. It's been happening for a few weeks now, maybe a month. I don't know exactly.
DOCTOR: Alright, a flushing, coming and going for about a month. Okay. And can you describe what that feels like exactly?
PATIENT: Well, it doesn't feel like anything, really. It just… gets hot. My face, neck, sometimes my ears. Like I’m… embarrassed, but I’m not! It’s just red. And warm. Not painful, just… noticeable. My wife… she used to say I looked like a tomato. She passed last year, so… it's been a while since anyone noticed much.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Withycombe. That must be difficult. Thank you for sharing that with me. So, this flushing… does anything seem to bring it on?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is. Hmm… that’s a good question. Not really. Not that I’ve noticed. I eat the same things, do the same things. Sometimes it happens after I’ve been walking, maybe? But not always. Sometimes when I’m just… sitting. I drink tea, you know? Black tea. Always have. But I don’t think that’s it. I don’t think so. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Alright. So it seems to be fairly random, not consistently linked to activity or diet. And you said black tea – how many cups a day do you usually have?
PATIENT: Oh, maybe four? Five, sometimes. I like my tea. Always have, like I said. My mother used to make it for me when I was a little boy. Very strong, with a bit of sugar. Not much sugar now, though. Doctor told me to cut back. A different doctor, a long time ago. But the tea… I enjoy it.
DOCTOR: Four or five cups of strong black tea… okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the flushing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… my heart feels a little fast when it happens. Not racing, just… quicker than normal. And maybe a little sweaty? But it’s hot outside, so that could be anything. No… I don’t think so. Nothing else really. I sleep okay. I eat okay. I’m not… dizzy or anything. Just the red face and the sometimes-fast heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional palpitations and some sweating alongside the flushing. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or any heart problems before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve been to doctors before, of course, but they never said anything about my heart. Just… the usual check-ups. Blood pressure was always… okay, I think. Not high. I don’t remember exactly. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Not any. I try to stay away from them if I can. My wife… she was always taking pills. Didn’t like it. I just take a little… something for my joints, sometimes. When they bother me. It’s not a pill, it’s a cream. And I don't use it every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat… well, I eat most things. Spicy food, sometimes. My daughter brings me things. I think she likes to see me… surprised.
DOCTOR: That's good. No known allergies. Alright, Mr. Withycombe, let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. My wife always said I worry too much. Maybe you can tell me what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/90. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. I'm not feeling any significant swelling in your thyroid. Your pulse is 88 and regular. Skin appears normal, with some mild redness on your face and neck. The blood pressure is a little elevated, but that could be due to being in the clinic. The flushing is definitely visible.
PATIENT: Hmm. Elevated? Is that bad, Doctor? I don't really understand these things. I just want to know what's causing the red face. It's… embarrassing, you know?
DOCTOR: It's okay, Mr. Withycombe. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. Elevated blood pressure just means it’s a little higher than we’d like, but it doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a problem. We'll keep an eye on it. Regarding the flushing, there are several possibilities. Given your symptoms – the flushing, occasional palpitations, and the tea consumption – it could be related to caffeine sensitivity. Sometimes, even moderate amounts of caffeine can trigger these symptoms. It could also be something called rosacea, which is a common skin condition, but it usually presents with more persistent redness and sometimes small bumps. And less commonly, it could be related to other underlying conditions. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few basic blood tests – a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. These tests will help us rule out any other potential causes and assess your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh dear. I don’t really like needles, Doctor. But… if you think it’s important. And if it will help me find out what’s wrong with my face, then… yes. Yes, I suppose so. But… will they hurt? How much blood do they need?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be anxious about needles, Mr. Withycombe. The blood draw itself is usually very quick. You might feel a small pinch, but it shouldn't be painful. They only need a small amount of blood – a few vials. And the phlebotomist, the person who draws the blood, is very skilled at making it as comfortable as possible. We'll send the samples to the lab and I should have the results back within a few days. Once I have those, we can discuss the findings and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, I would recommend trying to reduce your tea consumption to one cup a day to see if that makes a difference. Also, try to avoid anything that might trigger flushing, such as spicy foods or alcohol. Would you like me to write you a requisition for the blood tests now?
PATIENT: One cup? That’s… a lot to ask. But… alright. If it will help. Yes, please. A requisition. Whatever that is. Just… tell me where to go. And… will they need to see my insurance card? I don't have one, you know. My wife… she handled all that.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Withycombe. This is a request for the lab to perform the blood tests. You'll take this to the lab at [Name of local lab], which is located at [Address of local lab]. They're open from [Opening hours]. And that's perfectly alright about the insurance. Since you’re uninsured, you'll need to pay out of pocket. The lab should be able to give you a price estimate before they perform the tests. It's usually around [Approximate cost], but it can vary. I also have a pamphlet here with some information about rosacea, just in case that’s what’s going on. It explains the symptoms, treatment options, and things you can do to manage it. Do you have any questions about where to go or what to expect at the lab?
PATIENT: [Approximate cost]? Oh dear. That’s… more than I expected. Rosacea… doesn’t sound very nice. No… I think I understand. Just… go to the lab, give them this paper, and pay them money. Then they take some blood? Is that right? I don’t think I’ll remember everything.
DOCTOR: That’s exactly right, Mr. Withycombe. You go to the lab, give them this requisition, and they’ll draw a few vials of blood. They’ll take care of everything. And don't worry about remembering everything. If you forget anything, just call my office and we'll be happy to help. Here's a copy of this requisition for your records, and our phone number is on this card. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for a week from today to discuss the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: A week? Yes, that sounds… alright. A week. I’ll try to remember. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. I still worry about the tea, though. One cup seems like… a very small amount.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. It’s my job. And I understand your concern about the tea. It's a significant change, I know. But let's try it for a week and see if it makes a difference. If it doesn't, we can discuss other options. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. We're here to help. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… the blood tests, and try to drink less tea. And… one cup. Thank you again. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. We’ll see you next week. .
PATIENT: .
