DOCTOR: Hi Yamir, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. I… need check for referee. For fitness. I want to be sure I okay. It for… sports, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You need a physical exam to make sure you're healthy enough for sports. No problem at all, we do those frequently. To get started, can you tell me what sport you're planning on participating in?
PATIENT: Referee. Basketball. I… check lines, you know? And… run a little. Not much, but… some. It important to be fast. Sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right, basketball refereeing. That makes sense – a good level of fitness is definitely helpful even if it’s not constant sprinting. Okay, so to get a better idea of what we need to check, let’s go through some questions. First, have you noticed any pain, discomfort, or injuries that have been bothering you recently?
PATIENT: No… not really. Maybe… back a little sore sometimes. After… stand long time. But not big problem. Old. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little back soreness after standing for a while. We can definitely take a look at that. And just to clarify, how long have you been feeling that soreness – is it something new, or has it been going on for a while?
PATIENT: A while. Maybe… six months? Not every day. Just… when I work long shift. It go away when I sit.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of intermittent back soreness that improves with sitting. That gives us a good starting point. Now, thinking about your overall health, do you have any existing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. I… don't think so. Doctor check me before, but… nothing bad. I… healthy, I think. Wife… she take care of me. But… she gone now. So… I try.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you've had check-ups before, and it sounds like you're making an effort to stay healthy. We’ll make sure to do a thorough check today too. Just to be complete, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat… everything. Maybe too much sometimes. No problem with… pills or anything.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… water. And… sometimes coffee. For work.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Perfect. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any serious medical problems – like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Um… wife's mother… she had… something with heart. Long time ago. I not sure what. My… parents gone. I not know much about… their health. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Knowing about your wife’s mother is helpful. Okay, and just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No. Never. Bad for health. Wife… she not like.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Small beer. With dinner. Not every day. Maybe… one or two times a week.
DOCTOR: Okay, small beer a couple of times a week. Alright. Now, before we do a physical exam, can you tell me about your typical daily activity level outside of work?
PATIENT: Work… long hours. Stand. Walk. Referee… sometimes practice. But not much. Mostly… sit and watch TV. Sorry. I try to do more. After wife… hard.
DOCTOR: I understand, Yamir. It takes time. We’ll work with where you are at. Okay, let's move on to a quick physical exam. We’ll start with your height and weight, then check your blood pressure and heart rate. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. Fast, right? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Okay, let's start with your height and weight. Okay, height is 174 centimeters and weight is 134 pounds. Now, I'm going to take your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Blood pressure is 128 over 82, and your heart rate is 72. That's all within a normal range. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. Good. Fast. Is all good? I need pass test, you know.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal on both sides. Now, let’s just take a look at your back. Can you bend forward and touch your toes for me, and then stand back up?
PATIENT: Ow. A little sore. See? That's what I mean. Old.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There’s some mild tightness in your lower back, and you’re right, bending forward does seem to cause some discomfort. There's no significant tenderness to the touch, though. I'm going to have you lie down on the exam table so I can check your range of motion. Then we can discuss a plan.
PATIENT: Okay. Lie down. Fast.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just assessing how far you can bend and twist. It does seem like you have some limited range of motion in your lower back. Nothing alarming, but it’s consistent with the soreness you’ve been experiencing. Okay, you can sit back up when you're ready. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it seems like you're dealing with some mild lower back strain, likely from prolonged standing and activity. Your vitals are good, your reflexes are normal, and your heart and lungs sound clear. The good news is, this is very treatable. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Treatable? Good. What… I need do? Can I still referee? That important.
DOCTOR: Yes, treatable! And that’s the most important thing. You should be able to continue refereeing, but we need to manage the strain to prevent it from getting worse. Here’s what I recommend: First, focus on gentle stretching and strengthening exercises for your lower back. I can give you a handout with some examples. Second, be mindful of your posture while standing and refereeing – try to keep your back straight and core engaged. Third, if you feel pain, take breaks and avoid activities that worsen it. Finally, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help manage any discomfort. I also think it would be helpful for you to see a physical therapist for a few sessions. They can create a personalized exercise program and teach you proper techniques for lifting and moving. Would you be interested in a referral to physical therapy?
PATIENT: Physical… therapy? More appointments? I… busy. Can I just… stretch? And… be careful?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about adding more appointments, Yamir. Stretching and being careful are definitely a good start, and in some cases, that might be enough. However, given the fact that you've been experiencing this for six months, and you're planning to continue with a physically demanding activity, seeing a physical therapist for a few sessions can really help prevent it from becoming a chronic issue. They can teach you the right stretches and strengthening exercises to target the specific muscles causing your pain and show you how to move correctly to avoid future strain. Think of it as an investment in your health and your ability to continue refereeing. We're talking about maybe 3-4 sessions to get you set up with a good routine. Would you be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. Three sessions. But… quick ones. I have games.
DOCTOR: Okay, three quick sessions. That’s perfectly reasonable. I’ll write you a referral to a physical therapist. They’ll schedule you for appointments that work with your schedule. I'm also giving you a handout with some basic stretches and back care tips to get you started. I'm also going to recommend you take an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen or naproxen, 200-400mg every 6-8 hours as needed for pain. Always follow the directions on the label. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Yamir. Yes, you're all set. Here's the referral for the physical therapist. If your pain worsens or doesn't improve with these measures, please don't hesitate to call the office. Take care, and I hope you have a successful season refereeing!
