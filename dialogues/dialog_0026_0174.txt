DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Latisia Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Finco. It’s…pleasant to meet you as well. Honestly? I just… I haven’t been myself lately. A bit down, you see. It’s…difficult to explain, and truthfully, I’d rather not spend too long on it if you don’t mind. I have commitments, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. I understand completely. We’ll go at your pace. “Not yourself” can mean a lot of things. Perhaps we can start with how long you’ve been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It’s been…a few months, I suppose. Maybe since around February? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. Everything just feels…grey, you know? Not necessarily sad, just… lacking. And I’m tired. Very tired, even when I’ve had enough sleep. It’s… frustrating. I used to be so active, always doing something. Ski patrol, the beach… now, I mostly just sit.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months, starting around February, with a general feeling of… grey, and increased fatigue despite adequate sleep. And a change in your activity level, moving from very active to mostly resting. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… Let me see. My appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don’t really crave anything anymore. And I find I’m…less interested in seeing my friends. We used to have game nights every week, but I’ve been cancelling a lot lately. Just don't feel up to it, you understand. It’s…embarrassing, to be honest. I used to be the life of the party.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not embarrassing at all to be honest about changes in how you're feeling, Nani. It sounds like you've noticed a decrease in appetite and a loss of interest in social activities, alongside the fatigue and general “grey” feeling. Have you experienced any difficulty with sleep itself – trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early?
PATIENT: No, not really. I sleep enough. It’s just… not restful, if that makes sense. I wake up feeling just as tired as when I went to bed. And sometimes, I just lie there for a long time before I can get up. Thinking… mostly about nothing. It's…unproductive. And irritating. I used to jump out of bed ready for the day. Now, it’s a struggle.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you are sleeping a sufficient amount of time, but the sleep isn't restorative, and you experience difficulty getting out of bed in the morning despite feeling tired. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I have. I’ve lost a bit of weight, I think. Not a lot, but enough that my clothes feel a bit… loose. I haven’t been actively trying to lose weight, mind you. It’s just… happened. I suppose from not eating much. It’s not something I’ve been terribly concerned about, to be perfectly frank. I just thought I'd mention it since you asked. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Nani, thank you for mentioning it. Unintentional weight loss can be a sign of several things, and it’s good we're keeping track of it. Now, thinking a little broader – have you experienced any physical symptoms like aches, pains, digestive issues, or anything else that feels off?
PATIENT: Hmm. My joints have been a bit achy, now that you mention it. Mostly my knees and back. It could just be old age, of course. I was a ski patrol, you know. Lots of wear and tear. And…sometimes my stomach feels a little unsettled. Not exactly pain, just…queasy. But nothing major. I take some antacids sometimes, and it usually helps. Is this getting us anywhere, Doctor? I really do have a rather full schedule this afternoon.
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Nani. It’s helpful to have all of this information. Joint aches and occasional nausea… Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I've always been quite healthy, thankfully. High blood pressure, a few years back, but the doctor put me on medication and it’s been under control ever since. Otherwise, nothing significant. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older. I was always very active, so I haven't really had much time for illness. I’m afraid I don’t remember the name of the medication for my blood pressure, though. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of hypertension managed with medication – we can look that up in your records. And no other significant medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just one, really. Appendectomy when I was a girl. A very long time ago. It wasn't very serious, and I recovered quickly. That’s it. Nothing else. I'm not a fan of hospitals, you see. Prefer to stay out of them whenever possible. And honestly, I don't have the best memory for dates and details. It’s… frustrating. Is this important? I’m starting to feel a little… overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed, Nani. We’ll take things at your pace. The appendectomy is good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother had…arthritis, I think. Badly, towards the end. And my father… he had a weak heart, I believe. Passed away when I was quite young. But beyond that, I don't really know. My family isn’t very forthcoming about medical history. It was…not something we discussed much. Can we move on, please? I’m afraid my mind is starting to wander.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. We can move on. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never have, never will. I've always been very health-conscious, you see. And I find I don't need those things. I prefer a good cup of tea and a brisk walk. That's enough for me. Honestly, Doctor, are we getting anywhere with this? I’m starting to feel quite… agitated. Is there a diagnosis, or at least a plan? I really must be going soon.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Nani. We are getting somewhere, and I appreciate your patience. Based on what you’ve told me – the fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, sleep disturbance, joint aches, and the general feeling of being “grey” – along with your history of hypertension and a family history of heart issues, I’m considering a few possibilities. One thing I'd like to rule out is vitamin deficiencies, specifically Vitamin D, and also check your thyroid function. It's also important to consider the possibility of depression, which can present with many physical symptoms. I'd like to order some blood tests to get a clearer picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Very well. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. But please, be quick about it. I really do have commitments. And please, explain the process clearly. I don't want any surprises. And… try to be gentle. I don’t like needles. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? I just… want this over with, you understand?
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Nani. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. You don't need to do anything special to prepare. You can eat and drink normally before the tests. We’ll just need a small sample of blood from your arm. The phlebotomist – the person who draws the blood – is very experienced and will explain everything step-by-step. It will only take a few minutes. I’ll also give you a form to sign. After the results come back – usually within a few days – we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. A few days, you say? That’s… acceptable. As long as it doesn’t take much longer. And gentle, you promised? I’m not fond of hospitals, and this is… close enough. Very well. Let’s get it over with then. I'm ready, I suppose. Please, just… be efficient. And tell me precisely where I need to go. I don't want to wander around aimlessly. I'm feeling rather… drained already.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. We’ll head down the hall to the lab – it's just two doors down on the left. The phlebotomist, Sarah, is already expecting you. She’ll explain everything. And yes, she's very gentle. I’ll walk you over and introduce you. “Sarah, this is Nani Derasmo. She’s here for some routine blood work.” “Sarah will take excellent care of you. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.”
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your assistance. I trust this won't take long. And I sincerely hope they have comfortable chairs. My knees aren't what they used to be. Just… try not to leave me waiting too long. It's… unsettling, being in a place like this.
