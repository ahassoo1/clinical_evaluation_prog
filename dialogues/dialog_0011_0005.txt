DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you too. I am here today… let me see… Yes. My niece, she wants me to be cleared to move into one of those… Senior Living Facilities, she calls them. Wants to make sure I’m… fit enough, I suppose. I am Lennie Tkac, by the way. Though I suspect you already know that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Tkac, I do. Thank you for confirming. It's perfectly reasonable for your niece to want that assurance, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your current health?
PATIENT: Well now, that’s a question. Let me think… I bake, you see. Been a baker my whole life, practically. Keeps me on my feet, though not as much these days as it used to. My hands… they ache a bit sometimes, arthritis, the doctor back home said. Nothing terrible, just stiff in the mornings. And my eyesight isn't what it used to be, you can see. Otherwise… I eat pretty well, I think. My niece brings me things. Mostly. I don’t have any major complaints, really. Not for an old man.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Tkac. Baking is excellent exercise, and it’s wonderful you’re able to continue enjoying it. You mentioned arthritis in your hands and some difficulty with your eyesight – we'll certainly make note of those. Could you tell me a bit more about the arthritis?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my knuckles, you see. And the base of my thumbs. It flares up sometimes, especially if the weather is changing. Damp weather is the worst. Makes them real stiff and sore. It doesn't keep me from baking, mind you. Just takes a little longer, and I have to take more breaks. I use warm water sometimes, soak my hands in it. And I take those little pills… the white ones. My niece makes sure I have them. Can’t recall the name, to be honest. It’s been… a while.
DOCTOR: I understand. The damp weather certainly can aggravate arthritis. And it’s common to forget medication names; don’t worry about that at all. We’ll look those pills up in your record here. Ah, yes. Naproxen. You’ve been taking Naproxen 500mg twice daily. Now, apart from the arthritis and your eyesight, are there any other medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Naproxen, that’s it! Yes, that’s the one. Goodness, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Let me see… Diagnosed with… well, the doctor back home said my blood pressure was a little high a few years back. Put me on a pill for that, too. Small, blue one. I’m still taking that, I believe. And… Oh! I had a bit of a scare a long time ago, maybe twenty years back. Something with my heart… they said I had a little flutter, but it fixed itself. Never needed any… cutting, or anything like that. Just told me to take it easy. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Tkac. That's very helpful. The blue pill is likely Lisinopril, judging from your record. And good to know about the heart flutter—that’s important information. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than that heart flutter?
PATIENT: No, sir. No surgeries. Never needed any. And no hospital stays, apart from the heart scare. They kept me in for a couple of nights just to keep an eye on things, but nothing serious. A little poking and prodding, that’s all. I’ve been a lucky man, I think. Don’t go to the doctor much, generally. Always figured fresh air and hard work were the best medicine.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Tkac. It sounds like you've led a very active life. Now, thinking about your family—do you have any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well now, that’s a tricky one. My mother… she lived a long life, but towards the end she… wasn’t herself. The doctor said something about her mind slipping. Dementia, I think. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t the one taking her to appointments. My sister did that. My father, he was strong as an ox, but he had… trouble with his sugar. Diabetes, I believe. Always eating sweets, he was. And my sister, she had some issues with her… joints. Something similar to my arthritis, but worse. That's about what I remember, to be honest. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about those things much.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Tkac. That's very helpful information. A family history of dementia, diabetes, and arthritis – we'll certainly make a note of those. Now, could you tell me a little about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, as I said, I bake. Not as much as I used to, but still a little every day. I mostly stay around the house. My niece comes by often, checks on me, brings me groceries. She worries, you see. I read a bit, mostly Westerns. And I like to listen to the radio. Old time radio shows. That is… mostly what I do. I don’t go out much anymore. It gets cold in the winter, and… well, it’s just easier to stay in. Not a very exciting life, I suppose, but it’s a peaceful one.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very comfortable life, Mr. Tkac. And peace is valuable. Now, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never smoked a day in my life. And I haven’t had a drink… oh, goodness, must be fifty years. Maybe more. Not my cup of tea, you see. Always preferred a good glass of water. Or a cup of coffee, sometimes. My niece brings me coffee. That is a good niece.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, are you currently taking any medications other than the Naproxen and Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Let me think… Hmm. There was… Oh! Yes. The doctor back home gave me something for my… water. Trouble with my water, he said. I have to take it every night. Small, yellow pill. Helps me sleep, I think. And… that’s about it, I believe. Though my niece sometimes gives me little things for my… tummy. When it’s upset. But those aren’t regular, you see. Just when I need them.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Tkac. That yellow pill is likely Tamsulosin, which is prescribed for prostate issues. Let's move on to a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That sounds fine. Tamsulosin, is it? Goodness, my memory. I appreciate you keeping track of all this. Yes, a physical exam is fine. Do whatever you need to do, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 148/82. Your pulse is 76 and regular, and your respiratory rate is 16. Your lungs sound clear, and your heart sounds normal, though there is a slight murmur, likely benign given your history. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender. No tenderness noted. I'll also check your reflexes and range of motion in your extremities. Your reflexes are normal, and your range of motion is slightly limited in your hands, consistent with your arthritis. I'll also perform a brief neurological assessment. Your balance is stable, and your coordination is good. Overall, your physical exam is largely unremarkable, with findings consistent with your reported history. Do you have any questions about what I’ve found so far?
PATIENT: No, sir. That all sounds… reasonable. Elevated blood pressure, I suppose, isn't too surprising. I haven’t been as active lately, perhaps. And limited range of motion in my hands… that's to be expected, I reckon. You said something about a murmur? Is that… bad? I've never been told about a murmur before.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Mr. Tkac. The murmur I detected is a soft one and, given your history, is likely a benign flow murmur, meaning it’s a normal sound that occurs with aging and doesn't typically require intervention. However, to be certain, I would like to order an EKG - an electrocardiogram – to assess your heart’s electrical activity. It's a simple, painless test. Also, I'd like to check your blood sugar, kidney function, and a complete blood count. This will give us a more comprehensive picture of your overall health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That sounds… sensible. An EKG and some blood tests… if it will help make sure I'm fit enough for that Senior Living place, then absolutely. You do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything is… worrisome, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tkac. I will explain everything thoroughly if any concerns arise. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. No allergies that I know of. Never had any trouble with any medications. And… nothing else, either. Dust doesn’t bother me, and I haven’t been stung by a bee in years. Never had any… reactions to food, either. No allergies at all, to my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Mr. Tkac. We’ve covered a good deal of information today. To summarize, we're ordering an EKG and blood work to assess your heart health, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. This will help me determine your overall fitness for a transition to Senior Living. I’ll have the lab technician draw your blood now, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That sounds perfectly agreeable. Blood work and a follow-up… I appreciate you taking the time to sort everything out. I trust your assessment. And thank you for being so… thorough.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. It’s my pleasure. I believe the lab technician is ready for you now. They’ll call you back shortly. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions.
