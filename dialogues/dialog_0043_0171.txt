DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Well, my nails. They just… look funny. Not good funny. I don't really know why they look funny, just that they do. They changed. It's been a bit, I guess. Maybe a few weeks? I dunno. It bothers me.
DOCTOR: I see. You're concerned about changes in your fingernails. That's certainly something we can take a look at. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few weeks. Maybe longer. Time… slips. They're not… smooth anymore. And one of them is kinda… stripey? Not a good stripey, like a… a bad painting stripey. I don't know what's wrong with 'em. It's just… weird. I keep putting polish on, but it doesn't help hide it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. It’s good that you’re bringing this to my attention. Changes in the nails can sometimes indicate underlying issues, so it’s wise to get them checked out. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe these stripes a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Stripes… hmm. Okay. They’re… long ways. Like, from the top of the nail down to the skin. Not all of them have 'em, just one or two. And they're… kinda darkish. Not black, but not your normal nail color. Like a… a dirty brown, maybe? I don't know what color. Look, I'm not good with colors. Just weird stripes. They weren't there before, that's all I know.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Dirty brown" stripes running lengthwise on some of your nails, and you’ve noticed they weren’t present previously. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with the nail changes?
PATIENT: Changes… like what kind of changes? My hands are always cold, if that counts. And they ache sometimes. Old lady aches, you know? I dunno if that has anything to do with it. No, that's about it. I haven't… fallen or anything. No injuries. Just the nails and the cold hands. And the aches. I forget things too, but I always forget things. That's normal for me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that, Ms. Thut. The cold hands and aches are good information to note. And it’s helpful to know you experience some forgetfulness regularly. Now, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of, such as diabetes, thyroid problems, or skin conditions?
PATIENT: Uh… medical conditions. Let me think. I have… Medicare, does that count? No, seriously, I don't really have any. The doctor always asks, and I always say no. Maybe high blood pressure? I think he said something about that once. But I don't take pills for it or anything. And no, no skin stuff. Just… normal old lady skin. Wrinkles and stuff. Everything else works okay, I guess. I mean, I forget things, but that's just me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. So, no diagnosed medical conditions other than potentially some high blood pressure that hasn’t been formally treated. And you've been generally healthy otherwise, aside from the forgetfulness. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think really hard. My tonsils, when I was little. That's about it. And I had a baby, but that wasn't a surgery, right? No hospitals. Not since the baby. That was… a long time ago. Everything was fine. Just the tonsils. A long, long time ago. Don't remember much about it. It was scary, I think. Little kid scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tonsillectomy as a child, and a normal delivery with your baby, no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Oh dear. My family is… complicated. Lots of people. And they don't tell me anything. My sister had… something with her heart, I think. But she doesn't talk to me anymore. And my brother… well, he just drinks. And my mother… she just complained a lot. I don't really know if anything… runs in the family. They don't tell me these things. Everyone keeps to themselves. It’s… a long story. Not a good story.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Thut. It can be difficult when family medical history isn't readily available. Alright, let’s move on to your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I tried some vitamins once, but I forgot to take 'em. And my doctor… he doesn't give me much. Just tells me to eat better. Which I try to do, but… well, I forget. No pills. No powders. Nothing. Just… me. And my funny nails. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. No medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nope. I eat everything. I used to eat dirt when I was a little girl, but I stopped. No hives. No swelling. Nothing. I’m a pretty tough old lady, I guess. Never had any problems with allergies. Everything goes down okay. Except maybe… bad attitudes. I’m allergic to bad attitudes. But that's not a medical allergy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Thut. No known allergies. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to take a closer look at your nails and hands. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. Just be gentle. They're sensitive. And don't judge 'em too hard. They've seen better days, I guess. What are you looking for anyway? I mean, what can you tell from just looking at nails? Seems silly. But go ahead. I don't mind. Just be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Thut. I’ll be very gentle. And it’s not silly at all. Nails can actually tell us quite a bit about your overall health. Changes in color, texture, and shape can be indicators of various conditions. Alright. I am noticing some longitudinal melanonychia – those dark stripes you mentioned – on a few of your nails. They are more prominent on your index and middle fingers. I’m also observing some slight ridging and a bit of brittleness. Your nail beds appear generally normal, with good capillary refill, and the skin around your nails doesn't show any signs of infection.
PATIENT: Melano-what? That's a big word. Is that bad? Stripes? I knew something was wrong with 'em. Brittleness? Well, I do a lot of gardening. And washing dishes. And I don't wear gloves. Is it from the dirt? Is that why they're funny? And what does capillary… refill mean? This sounds serious. Don’t tell me I have to cut 'em all off! I like my nails! Well, I used to like my nails. Before they got… funny.
DOCTOR: Melanonychia just refers to the dark lines you’re seeing in your nails. It’s not necessarily a cause for immediate alarm, but it does warrant further investigation. Capillary refill refers to how quickly blood returns to the nail beds after being pressed – it’s a quick check of circulation. Now, the gardening and dishwashing could certainly contribute to the brittleness. However, longitudinal melanonychia can have various causes, including trauma, certain medications, and, less commonly, underlying medical conditions. We need to rule those out. And no, Ms. Thut, you absolutely do not need to cut your nails off! We're not at that point. We're going to start with some simple tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I would like to order a complete blood count and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. We should also consider a nail sample for fungal culture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. I don't like tests. Blood? I hate needles. And a nail… sample? You mean, take a piece of my nail? That sounds awful. Is it going to hurt? And what if it’s… something bad? My sister always gets bad test results. I don't want bad test results. TSH? What even is that? And what does it have to do with my nails? Is it contagious? Look, can't you just give me some cream? Or a nice polish? Something to hide 'em? I just want 'em to look normal again. Not tests and samples and… and TSH. It sounds scary.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Thut. Tests can be unsettling, and I want to assure you we're taking a cautious, step-by-step approach. The blood test is a standard check to rule out any underlying deficiencies or infections. The needle is very small, and it's usually a quick pinch – it’s over before you know it. The nail sample is also relatively painless. We'll just trim a small piece of the nail and send it to the lab to check for any fungal infections. TSH stands for thyroid-stimulating hormone. The thyroid is a gland in your neck that controls many bodily functions, and sometimes, thyroid problems can affect the nails. It's a simple blood test to see if everything is functioning properly. And no, it’s not contagious. I realize this sounds like a lot, but these tests will help us determine the cause of the changes in your nails and ensure you receive the appropriate care. We’re not jumping to conclusions; we’re simply gathering information. While cream or polish might temporarily improve the appearance of your nails, they won’t address the underlying cause. Would you be willing to proceed with the tests, Ms. Thut?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. But I don't like it. Not one little bit. Blood… and nails… and that… TSH thing. You promise it won’t take long? And promise the needle won’t hurt too much? And promise you’ll tell me what everything means? In plain English? Not those big words. And… can I have a sticker afterwards? Just kidding… mostly. Okay. Let's get it over with. But be gentle. And hurry up. I have things to do. Gardening to do. And dishes. And… and forgetting things. Just please… hurry.
DOCTOR: I promise, Ms. Thut. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. The blood draw and nail sample will only take a few minutes. And I absolutely promise to explain the results in plain English – no big words, I assure you. And while I don’t have stickers on hand, I’ll do my best to make this as comfortable as possible. Alright, Ms. Thut, we're all done. The samples will be sent to the lab, and we should have the results back in about a week. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss them. In the meantime, if you notice any changes, such as pain, swelling, or bleeding around your nails, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: A week? That seems like a long time to wait. What if it's something terrible? My sister... she always has to wait. And it's never good. No, I don't think so. Just… try not to lose the sample, okay? And please… remember my name? I always feel like doctors forget my name. I'm Lacreasha Thut. T-H-U-T. Okay. I guess I'll go now. Thank you… I think. And please… be gentle with the samples. And don't forget me. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, I absolutely will remember your name. Lacreasha Thut – I’ve made a note of it right here. And I assure you, we will take excellent care of your samples. I understand your anxiety, and I want to reassure you again that we’re simply being thorough. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available, and we’ll develop a plan together. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Thut. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and enjoy your gardening. .
