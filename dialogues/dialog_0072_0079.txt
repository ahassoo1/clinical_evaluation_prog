DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I am Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 47 years old. Thank you for coming in today. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, that's right, 47. Um, it's about my bruising. It's been...worse lately. I'm on something for my blood, you know, to thin it, and I just keep getting these big bruises for no reason. It's a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that’s worsening, despite being on a blood thinner… I see. And how long have you noticed this increased bruising, Ms. Hainley?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I'd say, maybe a month ago? But it’s definitely gotten more noticeable the last week or so. Like, I bumped my arm on the counter just yesterday and it’s already the size of my hand. Usually it’s not this bad.
DOCTOR: A month ago… and significantly worse this past week, even with minor trauma. And you mentioned being on something to thin your blood. Do you know the name of that medication, and what it’s for, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The name… Dr. Thompson, he put me on it. It’s a small, blue pill… I wish I remembered the name, honestly. He said it was for… my heart, I think? Something about clots. I just know I have to take it every day. I can bring the bottle in next time, if that helps? I'm terrible with names.
DOCTOR: It would be helpful to have the bottle, yes. But for now, let's try to recall as much as possible. Was Dr. Thompson specific about why you needed a blood thinner?
PATIENT: He said something about... atrial fibrillation. Is that right? That's what he called it. He said it was making my heart beat irregularly and the blood thinner would help prevent a stroke. Something about blood pooling, I think he said. It was a lot to take in at the time, sorry. I just wanted to get the pills and go.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation… yes, that explains the need for anticoagulation. Okay, Ms. Hainley, so you've been on anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. Now, aside from the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No, not really. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but I always chalk that up to just getting older, you know? No bleeding gums or anything like that. Nothing major, definitely. Just the bruises. They're really the only thing I'm worried about.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any recent injuries or falls that you haven’t mentioned?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I haven’t fallen or anything. I’m pretty careful. Like I said, even just bumping my arm lightly now causes a huge bruise. It’s just… not normal. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, either. It's just started happening.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to assess the bruising and look for any other signs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on, you know? It's a little scary when things change like this.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat on the examination table, and we'll begin. I'll need to examine your arms and legs, and then listen to your heart and lungs. Please let me know if anything is painful.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just let me know if I need to move anything, alright? I'm a little sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm noting significant ecchymosis on both forearms, varying in size and coloration. Some appear relatively recent, others a bit older. There's no noticeable swelling or warmth. Now, can you tell me if you've been taking any other medications – over-the-counter, supplements, anything at all – besides the one for your heart?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Um... I take a multivitamin, sometimes. And occasionally ibuprofen, for headaches, but not regularly. Maybe once or twice a month? Nothing else, I don’t think. I really try to avoid taking too many pills, honestly. Especially after starting the blood thinner.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a bit rapid, but rhythm appears regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, Ms. Hainley, given your history of atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation, and recent increase in bruising despite infrequent ibuprofen use, we need to investigate the cause further. I'd like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a coagulation panel – to check your INR and other clotting factors – and a basic metabolic panel. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out. Blood work is okay. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Hainley, it won't be painful. A phlebotomist will draw a small amount of blood from your arm. It may feel a brief pinch, but it's generally well-tolerated. We'll send the samples to the lab, and the results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid any activities that could result in injury, and if you experience any unusual bleeding – such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in your stool – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, good. I'm alright with a pinch. And no, I don't think so. Just…try not to take too long, alright? I have a few things I need to get done today. So, just avoid bumping into things and watch for bleeding. Got it. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hainley. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. If anything changes or worsens before then, please do not hesitate to contact the clinic. I will also have a copy of your blood work request printed out for you. Have a good day. .
