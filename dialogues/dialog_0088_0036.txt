DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I have… a check-up. For the insurance. Before it starts, yes? I need to make sure everything is… correct, for the papers.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A wellness check for insurance purposes. That's perfectly reasonable. We can certainly do that. It's good to be proactive. Just to be clear, are you experiencing any specific symptoms or health concerns at the moment, or is this purely for the insurance requirements?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms. Nothing… bothering me. Just the insurance. They want me to come. A waste of time, really, but… they pay, I come. Is that… alright? Do I need to say more about… problems? I don’t have any.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to hear. No, you don’t need to fabricate anything. We can absolutely proceed with a standard wellness check. It will involve some basic questions about your medical history, a physical exam, and possibly some routine bloodwork, depending on what your insurance requires. Let’s start with some background information then. Have you had a primary care physician before?
PATIENT: A… primary what? I don’t… understand. I see doctors when I am sick. Not… always the same one. Different ones. When I need them. Is that… bad? They all ask the same questions anyway. Do I need to remember all of them?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not bad, Mr. Barban. A primary care physician is just a doctor you see regularly for all your health needs – routine check-ups, vaccinations, and managing any ongoing health issues. It's helpful to have someone familiar with your medical history, but it sounds like you've been managing as needed. We’ll just do our best here today. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. My father… he had problems with his stomach. But I do not have stomach problems. I eat… normal food. Sometimes spicy. I am healthy. I work hard, I don’t sit around. I don't need a list of things wrong with me. Is this… taking long?
DOCTOR: No, it's not taking long. Just trying to be thorough. Okay, no stomach issues. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. One time, I broke my arm when I was a boy. Playing football. They put it in a cast. But that was… a long time ago. It healed fine. I do not go to the hospital unless something is… very broken. It is expensive.
DOCTOR: Alright, broken arm as a child, healed without complications. Good. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? My mother… she lived a long life. Very old. My father, he… passed away. Like I said, stomach problems. My brothers and sisters… they are all… fine, I think. We do not talk much about health. It is… not polite, maybe? Do you need to know about everyone? It will take a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Knowing about your immediate family – parents, siblings – is most helpful. If your mother had a long life without major health issues, that’s good to know. And your father had stomach problems… Was that diagnosed specifically as anything?
PATIENT: No. Not diagnosed. He just… hurt. A lot. He went to doctors, but they didn’t… fix it. He just… got weaker. They gave him pills. That is all. I do not know what kind of pills. He didn't tell me. He didn’t like talking about it. Are we… done with the questions? My back is starting to hurt from this chair.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can move on to a quick physical exam then. It will just be basic – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a general look. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. Spicy food, sometimes. No problems. I can handle it. But… if you are going to poke me with needles, I want to know now. I don’t like needles. Is the needle… big?
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, that’s good. And yes, there may be a small blood draw, depending on what your insurance requires. It's a standard needle, not a large one. We can talk about minimizing discomfort if you’re concerned. First, let’s check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick. My time is valuable. And do not poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130/80 – a little elevated, but not concerning at this point. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, if you could just extend your arms, I’ll take a quick look at your reflexes and check your range of motion.
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. I have things to do. And do not pull my arms too hard. I need them for work. This is… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything appears normal. Reflexes are good, range of motion is within normal limits. Given your blood pressure reading, and to fulfill insurance requirements, I would recommend a basic blood panel – cholesterol, blood sugar, and a complete metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever it takes. But if it costs extra, I’m not paying. And I want the results quickly. I need to show the insurance people. No waiting around. Is there… a form I need to sign?
DOCTOR: Here's the form. It just has some basic information, and your insurance information is already pre-filled. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll take care of the blood draw. They’re used to patients who aren’t thrilled about needles. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. We can fax them directly to your insurance company, or I can give you a copy to hand deliver. Do you have any questions before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No questions. Just… get it done. And make sure they don’t take too much blood. I need to go to work. Thank you… I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re welcome, Mr. Barban. The lab technician will be right with you. Have a good day.
