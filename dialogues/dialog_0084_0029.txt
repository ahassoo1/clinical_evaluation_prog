DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Just Norval is fine, please. Well, it’s… it’s my stomach, mostly. I just get full awful quick these days. Even with a little bit of food. It's been happening for a few weeks now, I'd say.
DOCTOR: Okay, Norval. Just Norval is perfectly fine. And thank you for letting me know. “Full awful quick,” you said. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, like… I could be eating a piece of toast, or a small bowl of soup, and I feel stuffed after just a few bites. Not painful, exactly, just… done. Like my belly’s telling me “no more!” even though I haven’t eaten much at all. It’s strange, 'cause I used to have a pretty good appetite. My wife, Elsie, keeps saying I'm not eating enough, but I want to eat, you know? It just doesn't feel good to keep going after a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not pain, but more of a fullness sensation that stops you from wanting to continue eating, even though you haven't had a full meal. And this started a few weeks ago, after a period of having a good appetite. Is this fullness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. It’s… mostly with meals, like I said. I don’t really feel it when I haven’t eaten anything for a while. But then, as soon as I start, it’s like a switch flips. And it doesn’t seem to matter what I’m eating. Elsie made me salmon the other night – usually I’d eat a good chunk of that – but I couldn’t get past a few mouthfuls.
DOCTOR: Alright. So it's related to eating, and not a constant feeling. And it happens with different types of food. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I've noticed. Elsie says I've been a bit more tired lately, but I’m an old man, Doctor! I figure that just comes with the territory. No nausea, no stomach pain, no… well, nothing else really. Just the quick fullness, and maybe a little less pep in my step.
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea, no pain, just the early fullness and some fatigue. And you haven't noticed any changes in your bowel habits, like constipation or diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, no changes there. Everything's… regular, you might say. Elsie keeps a close eye on me, you know. She’d definitely mention it if things weren’t working right in that department. She’s a good woman. So, no, nothing different there. Just the full belly and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… I think I might have lost a little bit. Elsie's been saying I'm looking a bit thin, and my pants feel a little looser. But I haven’t weighed myself, and honestly, I'm not sure how much. It could just be my imagination, or the summer heat. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so possible unintentional weight loss, though you haven’t actually weighed yourself. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I had a bit of a bad cold last winter, but that’s about it. Elsie keeps telling me to get my blood pressure checked, but I always put it off. I’ve never been one for doctors, to be honest. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Nothing major, never had any operations or anything like that. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical conditions, no surgeries. Have you been taking any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just a little bit of aspirin now and then for my knees, you know, when they’re acting up. And Elsie gives me a multivitamin every morning, says it’s good for an old man. But that's it. Nothing else. Just the aspirin and the vitamins. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, aspirin for your knees as needed, and a daily multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Elsie's always cooking up all sorts of things, and I've never had a reaction. She's a good cook, like I said. Never had any trouble with medicine either. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I think I'd know if I was allergic to something, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you certainly would. Okay, now, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. Well, my mother lived to be 85, but she had a bit of trouble with her heart in the end. My father died younger, maybe in his 70s, but he wasn't one for going to the doctor either, so I don't really know what he died of. Elsie's side… her mother had diabetes, I think. Nothing else springs to mind, to be honest. We weren’t really ones for keeping track of all that sort of thing. It was a simpler time, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with heart problems, father’s cause of death unknown, and Elsie’s mother with diabetes. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life, Doctor. My father tried, but my mother wouldn't let him smoke in the house. And I picked up that habit, I suppose. Always thought it was a silly thing, myself. No, never smoked. And I don't drink much either, just a little glass of wine with dinner now and then, if Elsie's making something special. But that's about it. Mostly just tea, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very limited alcohol consumption. Now, just one more question for now. Can you tell me a little about your diet?
PATIENT: Well, Elsie does most of the cooking, like I said. We eat pretty healthy, I think. Lots of salmon, fresh vegetables from the garden, berries when they're in season. She makes a good soup too, even though I can't eat much of it these days. We try to avoid processed foods, mostly. And I do like a good piece of toast in the morning. Not much red meat, honestly. Just a pretty standard diet, I suppose, for an old couple living in the suburbs. Nothing fancy. It’s just… I just wish I could eat more of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, healthy diet with fresh foods. Thank you for all of that information, Norval. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll feel your abdomen. It’ll just take a few minutes. Would you please sit up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good, Doctor. I’ll do my best to cooperate. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. My bones ain’t what they used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath for me… and let it out slowly. Another deep breath… and out. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs auscultated. Now I'm going to listen to your lungs. Again, deep breath in… and out. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. And now I'm just going to feel your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, nothing there. It doesn’t hurt or anything, you’re just poking around. A little ticklish, maybe. But no pain. It just feels… normal, I suppose. Like my belly always feels these days. Sort of… full, even when it’s empty. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just feeling for any masses or tenderness. Your abdomen is slightly distended, but soft and non-tender. No guarding noted. Alright, that's all for the physical exam. Now, given your symptoms – early fullness, some fatigue, possible weight loss – and the findings of the exam, I'd like to order a few tests just to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? Tests are fine. Elsie always says it's better to be safe than sorry. What kind of tests are we talking about? And will they be… unpleasant? I’m not a fan of needles, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Norval. I'll try to make it as comfortable as possible. We’ll start with a complete blood count – that checks for anemia and other signs of illness. We’ll also do a basic metabolic panel – that looks at your kidney and liver function, and your electrolyte levels. And I’d like to order a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, just to rule out any thyroid issues. Finally, I think a stool test to check for blood would be a good idea. As for needles, there will be a blood draw for the first three tests, and the stool test is… well, you collect a sample at home. It won’t be pleasant, but it’s not painful. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable, Doctor. Blood draw and a sample… I can handle that. Elsie will help me with the sample, I'm sure. She's good at those sorts of things. So, blood tests, then a sample… How long will it take to get the results? And will you explain what they mean to me when they come back? I don't understand a lot of that medical jargon, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll send the blood samples to the lab, and it usually takes about three to five business days to get the results back. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. I'll explain everything in plain English, I promise. No jargon. And we can go over the options, if any treatment is needed. Okay, I'm going to write up the orders for the lab tests now. In the meantime, continue to eat a healthy diet, stay hydrated, and try not to worry too much. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve put my mind at ease, to be honest. Elsie will be glad to hear we have a plan. She always worries about me. Just let me know when I can come back for the results. And thank you, Doctor Voytek. You've been a great help.
