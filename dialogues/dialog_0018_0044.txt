DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sachar. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It's August 2nd, 2025. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I'm here for a home health eligibility certification. I was told I needed to come in to get that sorted out, to see if I qualify for some assistance at home. It’s a bit confusing, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Home health eligibility requires a medical assessment to determine the level of care needed. It is often a confusing process, so you’re not alone in finding it a bit overwhelming. To begin, let’s talk a little bit about what’s been going on with your health. Could you tell me about any current health concerns you have, or any difficulties you’ve been experiencing that might require assistance at home?
PATIENT: Well, it's mostly with my back, to be honest. It’s been bothering me for a while now, gets worse with standing and… well, just moving around generally. Makes things like housework really difficult, and even getting dressed some days. I used to be very active, but lately… not so much. And it’s just gotten progressively worse over the last few months. I also find myself getting tired very easily, even after a full night’s sleep. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see. So, primarily back pain that’s worsened over the last few months, impacting your ability to perform daily activities and accompanied by fatigue. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not a sharp, sudden pain, but a constant, nagging feeling. It's worse in the lower back, and sometimes it radiates down my legs a little bit. Not often, thankfully. And it definitely feels stiffer in the mornings, or after I’ve been sitting for a while. Like… like an old woman, really. I apologize, that probably sounds silly. It just makes everything harder.
DOCTOR: No, not at all silly, Ms. Sachar. It’s important to be precise with these descriptions, and you're doing a good job. The radiating pain is helpful information. When you say radiates, could you tell me where exactly down your legs you feel that pain?
PATIENT: It’s mostly on the back of my legs, down to my… calves, I think. Not my feet, thankfully. And it's not constant, like I said. It comes and goes. Sometimes it's just a little tingling, other times it's more of a… ache, similar to the back pain, but less intense. It’s hard to explain, to be honest. It’s not always in the same spot either. Sometimes it's just one leg, sometimes it's both. It really depends on the day, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s difficult to pinpoint. The variability is important. Now, beyond the back and leg discomfort, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been feeling a little bit… unsteady on my feet lately. Nothing major, just a little bit clumsy, I suppose. I haven’t fallen or anything, but I worry about it. And… I’ve noticed my appetite hasn’t been great. I’m not losing weight or anything dramatic, but I just don’t feel hungry as much. I used to love cooking, but now… it’s just not appealing. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Sachar. Both the unsteadiness and the decreased appetite are relevant. Now, let's move onto some more general questions. Have you experienced any recent fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No fever, chills, or night sweats. Nothing like that at all. I have been sleeping…okay, I suppose. A little restless sometimes, but nothing major. I think it’s just worry about the pain keeping me up. I haven't been sick with anything recently, if that’s what you mean. No cough, no cold, nothing like that. Just this back pain. It’s really the main thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No recent illness, primarily just the back pain and associated symptoms. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as arthritis, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me see… No diabetes, no heart problems. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years back, but it's been well-controlled with medication for the most part. I also had a bout of shingles a couple years ago, but that’s cleared up completely. Other than that… I haven't had any major health problems, to be honest. I used to be very healthy. I apologize if I’m rambling. It’s just…a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Ms. Sachar. This is all very helpful information. High blood pressure, well-controlled with medication, and a history of shingles – noted. And, to clarify, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Not to medications, food, or anything else as far as I know. I've never had any reactions to anything. My mother was allergic to bee stings, but I don’t seem to have inherited that. I've always been lucky in that regard, I suppose. I've been able to take most medications without any issues.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me what medications you are currently taking, including the dosage?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me think… I’m taking Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day, for my blood pressure. And… that’s it, actually. Just the Lisinopril. I used to take something for occasional headaches, but I haven't needed it in a while. And sometimes I take ibuprofen when my back is particularly bad, but that's just as needed, you know? Nothing regular. Just the Lisinopril daily.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lisinopril 20mg daily, and ibuprofen as needed for back pain. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history, if that’s alright. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, arthritis, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Yes, that's alright. Let me see… My mother had heart disease, unfortunately. She passed away from it a few years ago. And my father had arthritis, quite badly. He was in a lot of pain towards the end. My brother has diabetes, type 2, but other than that… I don't really know much about the rest of my family's medical history. My parents weren't really ones to talk about it, if I’m honest. It’s a little frustrating, to be honest, not knowing more. But that’s about all I know. Heart disease on my mother’s side, arthritis on my father’s.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful information. Now, to get a better understanding of your current situation, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I’m divorced, been divorced for about five years now. I live alone in a small house, fairly rural. I used to work full-time, but I had to stop a few months back because of the back pain. I used to be a presser, in a textile factory. It was hard work, but I enjoyed it. Now I mostly just… take it easy. I don't have any children. I have a few friends, but they all live quite far away. It can get a little lonely, to be honest. I mostly just try to keep busy with reading and… trying to manage the pain. It’s not a very exciting life, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Sachar. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot recently. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, let me quickly summarize what we’ve discussed so far. You’re experiencing lower back pain that’s been progressively worsening over the last few months, radiating down your legs, accompanied by fatigue, some unsteadiness, and decreased appetite. You have a history of high blood pressure, well-controlled with Lisinopril, and a past episode of shingles. You have no known allergies, and you take Lisinopril 20mg daily. Your family history includes heart disease and arthritis. And you’ve recently stopped working due to the pain. Is that an accurate summary?
PATIENT: Yes, that's… remarkably accurate, actually. You’ve remembered everything. Yes, that’s a very good summary. Everything you’ve said is correct. It’s a little overwhelming to hear it all laid out like that, but… yes, that’s everything. You've done a very thorough job.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sachar. Now, to help determine the cause of your back pain and assess your overall condition, I would like to perform a physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs, examining your back and legs, testing your reflexes and muscle strength, and assessing your gait and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I'm ready when you are. I understand it's necessary, and I appreciate you taking the time to do a thorough examination. I just hope you can figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll do my best. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, if you wouldn’t mind, please lie down on the examination table for me. I'm listening to your lungs and back now. Take some deep breaths for me, please. Everything sounds clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your back to check for tenderness or muscle spasm. Does this cause you any pain?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… a little tender, actually. Right there, on the lower left side. It’s not excruciating, but definitely uncomfortable. It’s the same spot that’s been bothering me for months, I think. It’s a dull ache, but it’s definitely more pronounced when you press on it. And…yes, I think I can feel a little bit of a muscle spasm. It’s hard to describe, but it feels tight and knotted.
DOCTOR: I see. There is definite tenderness and some muscle spasm in the lumbar region, primarily on the left side. Now, I'm going to check your range of motion. Can you bend forward and touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… difficult. It’s not easy. I can’t quite reach my toes, Doctor. It’s very stiff. And it feels… uncomfortable. It's a sharp pain, shooting down my left leg a little bit when I bend that far. It's not terrible, but I don't want to push it too much. It feels like something is catching.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's quite alright, don’t push yourself. Now, let's try bending backwards slightly. And how about side-to-side?
PATIENT: That’s… also difficult, and also a bit painful. It’s a different kind of pain than bending forward, more of a pulling sensation in my back. It’s not as sharp, but definitely uncomfortable. Side-to-side is limited too. I can’t bend very far in either direction. It feels… tight, like something is blocking me. It’s definitely worse on the left side. I’m sorry, I’m not very flexible. I haven’t been able to move like this in ages.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Sachar. I’m not expecting you to be flexible. We're simply assessing your range of motion. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs straight and relaxed. And I'm going to check your reflexes now. Your reflexes are normal and equal bilaterally. Now, I’m going to test your muscle strength. Can you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? I’m trying to squeeze as hard as I can. Okay, good. Your grip strength is good. Now, can you please push against my hands with your feet? I’m going to resist. Push against me as hard as you can.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your foot strength is also good. Now, I’m going to perform a straight leg raise test. Please lie flat on your back, and I’m going to lift your leg, keeping it straight. Let me know if you feel any pain radiating down your leg. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. That’s… causing some pain down my left leg. Right there, in the back of my thigh and down to my calf. It’s not excruciating, but definitely noticeable. It’s a shooting pain, like pins and needles. I feel it more when you lift it higher. It’s the same pain I’ve been feeling, Doctor. I think that’s the test that confirms it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s what I suspected. You’re experiencing positive straight leg raise test on the left side, which indicates possible nerve compression. Now, I’m going to have you stand up and walk a few steps for me. I’m observing your gait now. Please walk normally. I notice you have a slight limp on your left side and a somewhat antalgic gait, meaning you’re altering your walk to avoid pain. Okay, Ms. Sachar, that completes the physical examination. Based on your history and the findings of the examination, I believe you are experiencing sciatica, likely due to a compressed nerve in your lower back. We can get further imaging to confirm that if we would like, and plan accordingly. How do you feel about that?
PATIENT: Sciatica… That's what my mother had, actually. It makes sense, I suppose. It explains a lot. A compressed nerve… so it’s not just… old age? I think… I think getting some imaging would be a good idea. If we can confirm it, and know exactly what we're dealing with, then that would be best. I just want to understand what's going on, and figure out how to manage it. And, if possible, get some relief. It's been… debilitating, to be honest. So yes, imaging would be good. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sachar. It’s good that we have a clearer picture of what’s going on. It is not necessarily old age, though age can be a factor. There are a number of causes of nerve compression. I'm going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. This will provide a detailed image of the nerves and discs in your lower back and help us determine the source of the compression. The imaging center is located at [address and phone number]. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend some conservative treatment. This includes over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or naproxen, and applying heat or ice to your lower back. I also recommend gentle stretching exercises and avoiding activities that worsen your pain. I am also prescribing a muscle relaxant, cyclobenzaprine, to help ease the muscle spasm. I'd like to see you back in two weeks, or sooner if your symptoms worsen, to discuss the MRI results and formulate a more comprehensive treatment plan. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: That sounds… very agreeable, Doctor. Thank you. So, imaging first, then we'll see you in two weeks with the results. And the muscle relaxant should help with the pain in the meantime. Yes, that sounds good. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I feel a little bit more hopeful now, knowing what we’re dealing with. Thank you again, Doctor Stilaire. I’ll schedule the imaging appointment right away.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sachar. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if your symptoms worsen significantly before your follow-up appointment – for example, if you experience weakness in your legs, loss of bowel or bladder control, or severe, unrelenting pain – please seek immediate medical attention. Here are the written instructions we discussed, along with the prescription. I wish you the best, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Sachar.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Stilaire. I will. And I will contact you if anything changes. You have a good day as well.
