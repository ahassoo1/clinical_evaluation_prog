DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s rather upsetting. I seem to be…losing things. My sight, my hearing… it’s all very inconvenient, and frankly, I haven’t got all day to sit here explaining it. It just happened.
DOCTOR: “Happened”… could you elaborate on that, please?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Well, it simply did. I woke up, and things weren't as…clear. Sounds were muffled. I don’t need a detailed interrogation, Doctor. I’m a surgeon, you know. I understand these things generally. It’s a sudden…decline. Is that satisfactory? I have patients waiting, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, a "sudden decline" is… helpful. And you are a surgeon, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a pediatric surgeon. A very good one, I might add. Though, it's becoming rather difficult to be a good one if I can’t properly see my patients, or hear what their mothers are telling me. Honestly, the inefficiency of it all is… appalling. Now, are you going to do something about this, or are we simply going to discuss my professional credentials all morning?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Julie, I assure you I’m not here to evaluate your career. Let’s try to be systematic. When did you first notice these changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not entirely certain. It wasn’t a singular event, more of a…gradual fading, I suppose. Perhaps a week? Two weeks? It’s all rather blurry. I truly don’t keep track of such…trivial matters. Though, I do recall feeling a bit off last Saturday. Was that Saturday? Time just…slips away, you know.
DOCTOR: And this "off" feeling… can you describe it?
PATIENT: Describe it? It was…a general malaise. A bit lightheaded, perhaps. And sounds seemed…distant. I dismissed it, naturally. One doesn’t have time to dwell on every little ache and pain. I had a gala to attend, you see. Very important people. Now, is this relevant, or are we going to catalog my social life? I assure you, it’s quite busy.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Julie, let’s take a look at your ears and do a brief neurological exam, just to get a baseline. Could you please follow me?
PATIENT: A neurological exam? Honestly. Is this absolutely necessary? I haven’t got… well, never mind. Fine. Lead on. But if this takes long, I may simply have to leave. I have responsibilities, you understand. And I expect a full explanation of everything you find – or don’t find – afterwards. Don’t patronize me with medical jargon, though. I’m a doctor, remember?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Julie. We’ll keep it concise. I’ll just check your reflexes, balance, and do a quick hearing test. Please sit here, and I’ll begin. First, let's take a look at your ears. Open wide, please.
PATIENT: Honestly, “open wide”? Is this a dentist’s office? Very well. Get on with it, then. And be gentle. I have a very important charity event next week, and I can’t afford to have an ear infection. It's simply unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your left tympanic membrane appears normal, though there is a slight cerumen impaction. And the right… also normal, with similar cerumen buildup. No signs of infection. Now, let’s check your hearing. I'm going to put these headphones on you, and you’ll tell me when you hear the tone. Can you do that?
PATIENT: A “tone”? Honestly, Doctor, I am not hard of hearing, simply… experiencing some temporary muffledness. But very well. Put your headphones on. Though, I highly doubt it will reveal anything useful. And do try to hurry. This is all rather…undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright, just let me know when you hear anything, even a faint sound. … Okay. Now the right ear. And now, a few simple balance tests. Can you stand with your feet together, and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Close my eyes? Honestly, Doctor, are you attempting to make me fall? Very well, but if I stumble, it is entirely your fault. And do have someone nearby, just in case. I do not wish to cause a scene. There. Are you satisfied? This is all rather precarious.
DOCTOR: Steady now, Ms. Julie. Yes, I've seen enough for now. Your balance is slightly impaired, and the hearing test indicates mild to moderate hearing loss in both ears, more pronounced on the right. And you mentioned feeling lightheaded?
PATIENT: Lightheaded? Yes, briefly. It was…a fleeting sensation. Honestly, it’s probably just from the indignity of all this testing. I haven't had this much prodding since I was a child. What does this all mean, Doctor? Don't tell me I need a hearing aid. That would be simply…unacceptable. I have important meetings.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I’m not going to jump to any conclusions. These initial findings suggest a possible inner ear disturbance, or… something affecting your vestibular system, which controls balance. The hearing loss, while present, isn't severe enough to require immediate intervention. However, given your symptoms, and the fact that they came on relatively quickly, I would like to order an MRI of your brain to rule out anything more serious. And I'd also recommend a consultation with an ENT specialist.
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds… drastic. And an ENT specialist? Are you suggesting I am… broken? I assure you, I am perfectly capable. I’ve performed countless surgeries! This is preposterous. I do not have time for endless tests and specialists. This is simply… inconvenient. Is there not a simple pill I can take? I simply do not understand why this is necessary. I feel perfectly fine – aside from the slight muffledness and occasional dizziness. Honestly, it’s probably just stress. I have a very demanding schedule. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your frustration. However, dismissing these symptoms as “stress” without a proper workup could be… unwise. An MRI is not invasive, and it will give us valuable information. And while I respect your expertise as a surgeon, these symptoms are outside your field. It’s my professional responsibility to investigate them thoroughly. I am recommending these tests not because I believe you are "broken", but because I want to rule out any potential underlying issues that could be affecting your health. I can refer you to a highly-regarded ENT specialist and a radiology center. If you prefer, I can provide a list of alternative specialists. However, I strongly advise you to consider these recommendations. Now, do you have any allergies or medications I should be aware of?
