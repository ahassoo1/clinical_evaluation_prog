DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Sieh, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in… my body odor. It’s not like, bad bad, just… different. Not what I’m used to, and it started a few weeks ago, maybe a month.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kerriann, no need to be embarrassed at all. Changes in body odor can happen for a variety of reasons, and it's good you're getting it checked out. It's definitely something we can explore. To help me understand what’s going on, can you describe what you mean by "different"?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay, let me think. It’s…sweeter, I guess? Usually, I don't really smell much of anything, honestly. Just a clean scent after I shower. But now, it’s…fainter, but sweeter. Almost fruity, maybe? It’s hard to explain. And it seems to be more noticeable after I’ve been working, you know, laying floors. Lots of physical labor.
DOCTOR: Okay, sweeter and perhaps a fruity scent, and more noticeable with physical activity. That's helpful. And you mentioned you lay floors – so a physically demanding job. Have you noticed any other changes alongside this change in odor?
PATIENT: Let me see… not really, not that I’ve noticed. I’ve been a little more tired lately, but that could just be the work. It’s been really busy. My appetite hasn't changed, and I haven't lost or gained any weight. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it… my hands have been a little clammy, even when it’s not hot. But I figured that was just from…well, from laying floors all day. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That's good information, Kerriann. The increased fatigue and the clammy hands could be relevant. Let's explore that a little more. When you say fatigue, is it a general tiredness, or do you feel it more at a specific time of day?
PATIENT: It’s pretty general, I think. I just feel worn out at the end of the day, even after a full night’s sleep. It used to be that I’d be tired, of course, but I’d bounce back pretty quickly. Now, it takes me longer to recover. And sometimes, even on my days off, I still feel sluggish. It’s not debilitating, but it’s… noticeable. It’s been gradual, though, so it’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset of fatigue that's lasting longer than usual, even on your days off. And the clammy hands, along with the change in body odor… Do you have any history of diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother had type 2 diabetes. She was diagnosed when she was in her sixties, but she had it for a while before that, I think. And my aunt on my father's side, she had it too. She had complications, unfortunately. I’ve never been tested myself, though.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Kerriann. That family history is important. Given your symptoms – the change in body odor, the fatigue, the clammy hands, and the family history of diabetes – I’d like to do a few tests to rule out some possibilities. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’d like to draw some blood to check your blood sugar levels, including a fasting glucose and an A1C. We can also do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Sieh. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I'm a little worried, I won't lie, with my mother and aunt both having diabetes. So, checking those levels sounds smart. Blood pressure and everything else is good too, if you think it's necessary. Let's get it done.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Please just relax your arm for me. And then we'll head over to the lab to get the blood drawn. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today – 138 over 82. Your pulse is 78 and regular. This isn’t necessarily cause for alarm – it can fluctuate based on a lot of factors, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let's go get that blood drawn. I’ll explain everything as we go.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Dr. Sieh. I appreciate you explaining things. I'm a little nervous about the blood draw, I don't usually do well with needles, but I’ll try to stay calm. Lead the way. I hope it doesn't take too long. I have a job to get back to, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Kerriann. We'll try to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. The phlebotomist here is excellent. And I’ll be right here if you need anything. It usually only takes a few minutes. While we're waiting for the lab results, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. No, not that I know of. I haven’t had any reactions to anything in the past. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times over the years, and some over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, and I haven't had any problems with those. I'm usually pretty good with medications, thankfully. Nothing serious, anyway. I did have a bit of a rash once when I used a new laundry detergent, but that wasn’t a medication, obviously.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies, and just a rash with a new laundry detergent. That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to avoid taking anything if I can help it. I believe in letting my body heal itself, if possible. I eat pretty healthy, I think, and I get a lot of exercise with my job. I do take a multivitamin sometimes, but I’ve been forgetting lately, to be honest. It’s been so busy. I haven’t taken one in…oh, maybe a month or so. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just a multivitamin occasionally, and you haven’t taken one in about a month. That’s helpful. Let's see... Okay, it looks like the phlebotomist is ready for you. I'll be right outside if you need anything. Once we have the lab results, we'll discuss them and figure out the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good for now, Dr. Sieh. Just a little anxious about the blood draw, but I’ll try to be brave. Thank you for being so thorough and patient with me. I really appreciate it. Let’s get it over with. I’m ready when you are. I hope these results aren’t too worrying.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. We'll take it one step at a time. And try not to worry too much – we're just gathering information. I’ll be right outside when you're done. Here's the technician, she'll get you all set up. Let me know if you feel faint or have any discomfort at all during the procedure. I’ll be close by.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Dr. Sieh. Alright, let’s do this.
