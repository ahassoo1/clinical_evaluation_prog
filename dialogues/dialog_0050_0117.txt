DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Uh... coughin’. Been coughin’ for a bit now. And… there’s stuff in it. Red stuff. Not a lot, but... yeah. Red. I smoke, see. Been smokin’ a long time. Don’t remember exactly when I started, though. Long time.
DOCTOR: I see. A cough with some blood-tinged sputum. And you do have a history of smoking, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Smokin’. Always have. Doc, is this gonna be a long thing? I got things to do, you know? Power needs distributin’. Folks rely on that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Mr. Reyno. However, a cough with hemoptysis—that is, coughing up blood—requires a thorough investigation to determine the underlying cause. It's impossible to say whether this will be a “long thing” without further evaluation. We need to ascertain the source of the bleeding. Before we proceed, could you describe the cough in more detail?
PATIENT: Detail… uh… it’s a wet cough. Deep down, feels like it’s comin’ from real low. Happens mostly in the mornin’. And like I said, not a ton of red. More like… streaks. Sometimes it’s just… brownish. I don’t… I don’t know what color is what, really. Been feelin’ kinda tired too, but… I’m always tired. Work’s hard. Is this… bad?
DOCTOR: A productive cough—one that brings up mucus—deep in the chest, with blood-tinged sputum, particularly in the morning, and associated fatigue… yes, Mr. Reyno, this warrants investigation. While it could be a number of things, including a chronic bronchitis related to your smoking history, we must rule out more serious causes. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the cough and fatigue?
PATIENT: Other stuff… lemme think. No fever, I don’t think. No chills. Maybe a little short of breath sometimes, but… I live up high. Altitude. Gets to ya. And… my appetite’s been off. Not eatin’ like I used to. Everything tastes kinda… flat. Does that make sense? I ain't been sick, though. Not like a cold or somethin'. Just... tired and coughin'.
DOCTOR: No fever, no chills, intermittent shortness of breath which you attribute to altitude, and a decreased appetite with a change in taste… I see. And to clarify, you haven’t had any recent infections – no cold symptoms, no body aches, nothing like that?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that. Just this cough. And bein’ tired. Like I said, power needs watchin’. Can’t be layin’ around. Uh… is this somethin’ I can just… take somethin’ for? A pill or somethin’? I got a long shift tonight.
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, while I appreciate your concerns about your work schedule, it is not prudent to simply address symptoms without determining the underlying cause, particularly with the presence of hemoptysis. A pill, as you say, may mask the symptoms temporarily, but it will not resolve the issue and could potentially delay a diagnosis of something serious. Before we consider any treatment, I would like to perform a physical examination and order some preliminary tests. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests… ugh. Look, Doc, I ain’t a fan of hospitals. Or tests. But… alright. If you think it’s gotta be done. What kinda tests? And how long will it take? I really gotta get back to work. People depend on me. Just… try to make it quick, okay?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Reyno, and I will certainly strive to be as efficient as possible. We will start with a chest X-ray to get a visual assessment of your lungs. We may also need to collect a sputum sample for analysis, and I would like to perform a blood test to check your overall health and rule out any infection. The X-ray should only take a few minutes, the blood draw will be relatively quick, and the sputum sample can be collected in the office. The results will take a few days to come back, and we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Now, if you would please follow me, we can begin with the physical examination. We'll start by listening to your lungs and checking your oxygen saturation. Afterwards we will do the tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds… alright. Just get it over with, okay? Oxygen… you mean like, the stuff you breathe? Look, I gotta be honest, Doc, I’m not good with medical stuff. Explain it to me like I’m… five. And quick, please. People are relyin’ on me.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Reyno. We will take it slowly. Yes, oxygen is the air you breathe. It’s what keeps your body working. We’re going to listen to your lungs with this – it’s called a stethoscope – to hear if there's any unusual sound when you breathe. It doesn’t hurt. Then, we'll check how much oxygen is in your blood with this small clip on your finger. It's also painless. And finally, we will collect a sample of the mucus you cough up. We are simply trying to see what’s going on in your lungs so we can get you back to feeling better and back to your work. First, please take a deep breath and exhale slowly… like blowing out candles.
PATIENT: Like this? Feels… weird. Okay. Just… hurry. Power needs distributin’, Doc. And folks are dependin’ on me. It’s important. Really important. I… I ain’t good at sittin’ around.
DOCTOR: I am listening now. I hear some… diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs. It's not necessarily alarming, but it's consistent with a possible obstruction or inflammation. Now, I will check your oxygen saturation with this clip. 92 percent. That is slightly below the optimal range, but not critically low. It could be related to your altitude, as you mentioned, or the issues with your lungs. Next, we will need to collect a sputum sample. I'll provide you with a sterile container and instruct you to cough deeply into it. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Cough… deep. Container… yeah, I understand. Just get it over with. I don’t like feelin’ weak. Folks are relyin’ on me, Doc. And this cough… it's makin’ me feel weak. Just tell me what to do. And quick, okay? Power needs distributin’. Really needs it. I… I gotta get back.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please take a few deep breaths, then cough forcefully into this container, trying to bring up as much mucus as possible. If you can’t produce much at first, try again. It’s important to get a good sample for analysis. I will be right here when you are finished. Take your time, but try to collect as much as you can. And please, let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: There. Is that… enough? Feels like I’m gonna cough my lungs out. It’s… hard. Folks are relyin’ on me, Doc. And this cough… it’s makin’ it hard to… breathe. Just… tell me when we can go. I gotta get back. Power needs distributin’. Really needs it.
DOCTOR: That should be sufficient for now, Mr. Reyno. Thank you. Now, we will send this sample to the lab for analysis. The results typically take 2-3 business days. I will also order a chest X-ray to get a better visual assessment of your lungs. The radiology department is just down the hall. Do you know how to get there, or would you like me to send someone to escort you?
PATIENT: X-ray… down the hall. I… I can find it. I used to work construction, see. Used to read blueprints. I can read a map. Just… tell me when it's over. I gotta get back. Power needs distributin’. Really needs it. And folks are dependin’ on me. This cough… it's makin’ it hard. Just… hurry, okay?
DOCTOR: Very well. Please proceed to the radiology department. They will take an image of your chest. Once that is completed, you can return here, and we will discuss the next steps. I will have the lab results sent to me as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room… yeah, I understand. Worsen… shortness… pain… fever. Got it. Just… try to make it quick, okay? Power needs distributin’, Doc. Really needs it. And folks are dependin’ on me. This cough… it's makin’ it hard. I gotta get back. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Reyno. Please take care. And, as I said, do not hesitate to seek immediate medical attention if your condition deteriorates. .
