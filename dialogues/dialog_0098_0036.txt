DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a physical. For the insurance. I need to have this done, yes? Before it starts. It is… important to have, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, a physical, absolutely. That's very good of you to be proactive with your insurance requirements. It is important. Just routine, or were you having any specific concerns you wanted to discuss today while we're at it?
PATIENT: Concerns? No. Nothing… specific. I feel… alright. I work. I eat. I sleep. It is a normal life. Why would I be here if something was wrong? It is a waste of time, frankly. But the insurance… they require it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Many insurances do require a baseline physical, even if you're feeling well. It’s good for tracking your overall health. Alright, well, let's just go through a standard checklist then, if you don't mind. I'll ask some questions about your medical history, do a quick physical exam, and we'll be all set. First, can you confirm your date of birth for me?
PATIENT: August 14th, 1997. Is that… correct? I do not always remember dates very well. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. August 14th, 1997. Thank you. Now, have you had any significant illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospital? No. Never. I… I broke my arm when I was a small boy, falling from a tree. But it was… fixed. Quickly. That is not a significant illness, is it? Just a bone. They put it in a cast. It healed. It is… finished.
DOCTOR: No, a broken arm doesn’t count as a significant illness. Good to know. And have you had any surgeries at all?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. I have not had… cutting. No one has cut me. Why would they? I do not understand this question. I am a healthy man.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. Some people have procedures that don’t necessarily involve large incisions, but it sounds like you haven’t had any. Let’s move on to family history then. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My father… he passed away. Some years ago. Heart. It was… not good. My mother, she is… alive. She lives in Yemen. I speak to her sometimes. She is… old. But still strong, I think. For her age. She has… the usual old lady problems, I suppose. I do not know the details.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your father. It sounds like your mother is doing well, considering. Do you know if anyone in your family—either your father’s or mother’s side—has had any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… my grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had that. Very bad. He… he suffered, yes? And… my aunt, she has the sugar sickness. Diabetes, you call it? She needs… injections. It is not good. The rest… I do not know. My family is very large. I do not see them often. It is… complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. High blood pressure and diabetes in the family. That’s good to be aware of. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. It is… unhealthy. I do not understand why people do that. It smells bad. I have no need for it. My father… he used to smoke, a little. But he stopped, before he… you know. It is a bad habit.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Sometimes. With food. A little wine, maybe. Or… a beer. Not often. I do not drink… to excess. It is… not necessary. It makes one… silly. And I have work to do. I need to be… clear-headed.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Nothing. I do not like taking pills. They make me feel… strange. I eat healthy. I sleep well. I do not need medications. Maybe… sometimes I take something for a headache. But only if it is very bad. Just… a simple painkiller. But not regularly. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Good. Just occasional painkillers for headaches. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I do not… react. I have eaten many things. I have been around many… things. I do not think I have any allergies. My skin sometimes gets… itchy. But that is the sun. The Yemen sun is very strong. It is not an allergy. It is… the sun.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just occasional itchy skin from the sun. Alright, that completes the questions. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Whatever you need to do. Quickly, please. I have… things to do later. But yes. Do it. Just… be quick. I do not want to spend the whole day here.
DOCTOR: Of course. It won’t take long at all. Please, have a seat on the exam table and lean back. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Alright, your blood pressure is 130/85. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, let's take a look in your ears.
PATIENT: Ears… alright. Do what you need to do. I do not like things in my ears. But… proceed. It is better to get it over with. This is… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Ears look clear, no signs of infection. A little bit of wax, but nothing concerning. Now, I’ll just take a quick look at your nose and throat. Open wide, please. Throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Everything looks good. Alright, everything looks good. Your overall health seems to be in good condition. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which we can monitor. We should keep an eye on that.
PATIENT: Monitor? What does that mean? Do I need… pills? I do not want pills. And what about the insurance? Will they… approve this? I need this physical to be… sufficient. It is very important. I do not wish to have complications.
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily pills right away. "Monitoring" simply means checking your blood pressure again in a few months to see if it stays consistent. We can start with lifestyle changes – diet and exercise – and see if that helps lower it. I wouldn’t prescribe medication without trying those options first. As for the insurance, yes, this physical should be sufficient. It meets the standard requirements for a routine check-up. I’ll document everything thoroughly in your chart, and the insurance company should approve it without any issues. I’ll also give you a summary sheet to take with you, just in case. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: A summary sheet… yes, that would be… good. Just to be sure. And… about the blood pressure. What sort of… diet? What must I stop eating? I like… many things. And exercise? I work all day. I do not have time for… running around. Explain this… clearly. I need specific instructions. It is important.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s talk about blood pressure. The main things to focus on are reducing your sodium intake, eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and limiting saturated and trans fats. Specifically, try to avoid processed foods – things like canned soups, frozen dinners, and fast food – as they are usually very high in sodium. Also, limit your intake of salty snacks, like chips and pretzels. As for things to stop eating, it’s not about completely cutting things out, but more about moderation. Try to reduce your red meat intake, and limit sugary drinks and sweets. As for exercise, you don't need to run a marathon! Even a 30-minute brisk walk most days of the week can make a big difference. You can break it up into smaller chunks – three 10-minute walks, for example. If your work involves a lot of physical activity, that counts too! I'll also write you a note recommending you start a low-sodium diet and aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. And we can schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to check your blood pressure again and see how you're doing. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Three months… yes. That is… acceptable. A note… good. I will… try to follow these instructions. But if my blood pressure… remains high, what then? More tests? More… poking and prodding? I do not wish for complications. And what if the insurance… rejects this? Do I need to call them? I do not wish to deal with… paperwork. This is… stressful.
DOCTOR: If your blood pressure remains high after three months, we'll discuss further testing to rule out any underlying causes. It might involve a simple blood test or a 24-hour blood pressure monitor, which is a device you wear that measures your blood pressure throughout the day and night. We won’t jump to any conclusions without gathering more information. As for the insurance, don’t worry about paperwork just yet. I’ll submit everything on my end. If they reject it for any reason, my billing department will contact you to let you know, and they can handle the appeal process for you. You won’t have to deal with it directly. I’m also going to write a referral to a nutritionist who can help you develop a personalized diet plan to manage your blood pressure. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: A nutritionist… yes. That would be… helpful. Someone to tell me exactly what to eat. I do not trust myself with… decisions. This is… satisfactory. Will they contact me? And what about the… summary sheet you mentioned? I need to have something… concrete to take with me. To show my mother. She worries.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nutritionist will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. The referral form has their contact information on it. Here's the summary sheet, which includes everything we discussed today – your physical exam results, blood pressure readings, and recommendations for lifestyle changes. And here's the referral form for the nutritionist. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. I think… that is all. This has been… thorough. And stressful. But satisfactory. Thank you, Doctor. I hope… I do not need to return anytime soon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Barban. Remember to take things one step at a time, and don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions. And I hope you won't have to return soon either, but if you do, we’ll be here. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
