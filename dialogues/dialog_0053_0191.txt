DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit difficult to talk about, but I asked to come in… I wanted to get tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been thinking about for a while now, and I just want to know where I stand.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s good you’re being proactive, I suppose. Though, frankly, at your age… still. But that's neither here nor there. To be clear, you’re requesting an HIV test?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. An HIV test. I understand it's… less common for someone my age to be thinking about this, but I would just like the peace of mind, you understand? It's better to know, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, “better to know.” Though, frankly, I suspect this is a waste of resources. Still. We’ll proceed. Before we do anything, let’s get a bit of your history. Have you had any… recent risky behaviors that might necessitate this test?
PATIENT: Risky behaviors? Well… that’s a rather blunt way to put it, Doctor. My husband and I… we’ve been married for a very long time. But, to be honest, he travels quite a bit for work. And… well, I suppose it’s best to be thorough, isn't it? I haven’t been with anyone else, if that’s what you’re asking. But he… I don’t always know where he is or what he’s doing when he’s away. It’s difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Difficult to explain?
PATIENT: It’s… a long story, Doctor. He's a businessman, travels all over. He says it's all work related, of course. But sometimes… sometimes I worry. I haven't seen anything, mind you. It's just a feeling, a nagging worry at the back of my mind. And with everything you hear on the news… well, I thought it best to be safe. Is that… alright? I’m sorry if I’m being unclear. It’s not a comfortable subject.
DOCTOR: "Feelings." Right. Well, regardless of your… suspicions, we’ll proceed with the testing. Have you ever been tested before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have never been tested before. This would be my first time. As I said, I've been with my husband for a very long time, and we’ve always… trusted each other. But, as I explained, things haven’t been quite the same lately. I just want to make sure everything is alright. What does the test involve, exactly? Is it painful?
DOCTOR: It’s a simple blood draw, Ms. Shaub. Hardly painful. A small needle prick. We'll also need to discuss your medical history – any significant illnesses, surgeries, medications you’re currently taking, allergies. And family history, if you can recall. Let’s start with allergies. Any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, I don't believe I have any serious allergies, Doctor. I used to have a bit of a reaction to penicillin when I was a child, but that was many years ago. I haven't taken it since. Other than that… nothing comes to mind. I do get a bit of a sniffle during the rainy season, but I wouldn't call that an allergy. As for medications, I take a daily vitamin, and sometimes a pain reliever for my joints, but that’s about it. Nothing regularly prescribed by a doctor, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no prescribed medications. And a childhood reaction to penicillin. Noted. Now, regarding your medical history... Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses. I’ve been very fortunate in that regard. I've had the usual colds and flu, of course, but nothing serious. My joints do bother me sometimes, as I mentioned, but the doctor said it's just age-related. And… I had a rather difficult childbirth with my youngest, but I recovered fully. Other than that, I've been quite healthy, thankfully. I try to eat well and stay active, you know?
DOCTOR: "Difficult childbirth." Right. And you said age-related joint pain. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the pain?
PATIENT: Well, sometimes they feel a bit stiff in the mornings, and they ache more when it rains, like I said. And occasionally… occasionally they swell up a little. Not terribly, but enough to notice. I just thought it was part of getting older, you know? My mother had similar problems when she was my age. Nothing that requires any special treatment, I thought. Just a bit of discomfort. Is that… relevant, Doctor? I’m sorry if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: “Relevant” is subjective, Ms. Shaub. We’re documenting. Now, and this is important: any history of sexually transmitted infections, either in yourself or your husband?
PATIENT: Oh… my. That’s… a rather personal question, Doctor. To be honest, we… we never discussed such things. Not openly, anyway. When we were younger, perhaps, but not in recent years. And… I have no reason to suspect anything, truly. But… I suppose it’s best to be thorough, as you said. I haven't personally had any… issues, if that's what you mean. But I… I don't know about my husband's past. He doesn’t discuss those things. Is that… acceptable? I feel rather embarrassed discussing this.
DOCTOR: “Embarrassed” won’t help us, Ms. Shaub. Look, you came in requesting an HIV test, and you’re now telling me you have no idea about your husband’s sexual history?
PATIENT: I'm telling you we don't discuss it, Doctor. We've been married for a very long time. We trusted each other. Until recently, I had no reason to question that trust. And frankly, I don’t believe it’s my place to pry into his past. But if you need to know, to proceed with the test, I can’t provide you with that information. I simply don’t have it. I'm being honest with you, Doctor, and it feels rather invasive to be questioned about these things. Is this test even necessary if I'm explaining all this? Perhaps it's a waste of everyone's time.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Shaub. You want to know your HIV status. Fine. But you’re also conveniently omitting details that are vital for proper risk assessment. Your husband’s travel, your lack of knowledge about his past… These things are not irrelevant. They increase your risk. Now, before we proceed, I need to document this thoroughly. Do you understand that this test carries a window period?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. A window period. Meaning it might not be accurate right away. And you are saying my concerns, and my husband’s… lifestyle, increase my risk. Yes, I understand that. And yes, I want the test. I want to know. Even if it means I have to answer uncomfortable questions and feel… judged. I suppose. So, please, tell me what you need to document. And then… let's just get it over with. What exactly is involved with this test, beyond the blood draw? Will I need to come back?
DOCTOR: Right. The blood draw itself is straightforward. We'll send it to the lab. Results typically take 7-10 business days. However, as you correctly stated, there is a window period. Meaning a negative result now does not definitively rule out infection. We’ll need to repeat the test in three months, regardless of the initial outcome. And if it's positive, well… then we’ll discuss further testing and potential treatment. Now, I'm documenting your request for the test, your lack of knowledge of your husband’s sexual history, and your stated concerns regarding his travel. Anything else you think I should note?
PATIENT: Just… that I am married. And that I love my husband. And that I am doing this because I want to protect myself, and him. I don’t want to cause any trouble, or make accusations. I just want to know the truth, whatever it may be. And… perhaps you could be a little kinder in your questioning? It’s rather difficult enough as it is.
DOCTOR: “Married, loves husband, wants to protect both.” Noted. Alright, Ms. Shaub. Let's proceed with the blood draw. Nurse will be in shortly to take your sample. After that, I'll need a detailed family history, as well. And I suggest you discuss your concerns with your husband. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. The nurse will explain the aftercare instructions. .
