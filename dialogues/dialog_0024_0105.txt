DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It's... well, it's about getting surgery. For, you know, weight loss. It's a pre-surgery thing, I think? My wife helped me set it up. I don't really remember all the details, honestly.
DOCTOR: Surgery, you say. A rather…significant undertaking. And your wife scheduled this appointment?
PATIENT: Yeah, she did. She’s… very organized. I’ve been wanting to lose weight for a long time, and she thought this was a good step. I just… I don't recall exactly what kind of surgery it is, or what I need to do to get ready. It was a lot of talk with doctors and paperwork, and my memory isn't the best. Is this… is this the right place for that kind of thing?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, this clinic does offer pre-operative assessments. It seems your wife has been doing some preliminary research, which is… commendable, I suppose. To clarify, are you referring to bariatric surgery – a gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy, perhaps?
PATIENT: Bariatric… yeah, that sounds right. My wife used that word. I think it was… a sleeve? Something about taking part of my stomach out? I honestly couldn't tell you which one. It all just kind of blended together. It's good to have someone else keeping track of it all, really.
DOCTOR: A sleeve gastrectomy, then. Very well. Before we proceed, it is vital I establish a comprehensive medical history. To ensure appropriate candidacy and minimize complications, I require detailed information. Let us begin with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, and my blood pressure, the doctor said it was a little high once, but he didn't say anything about it being a condition. Honestly, I haven't been to the doctor much over the years. Just when something really hurts. I don't really... keep track of that stuff. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It creates… difficulties. Very well. Past surgical history, then. Have you undergone any operations previously?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. No surgeries at all. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but they just put a cast on it. That's it. My wife might know if I forgot something, but I'm pretty sure I haven't had any operations. It's one of the things she said was good - no complications from old surgeries.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history. Are there any significant medical conditions prevalent in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: That’s… tough. My family is… back in Iraq, mostly. We haven’t seen them in a while, and we don't really talk about health stuff. I know my grandfather, on my mom's side, he had something with his heart, I think. But I don't know what, exactly. And my aunt… she got sick a few years ago, but I don't know what kind of sickness. It's… not something we talked about much. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Social history, then. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never have. My wife wouldn't allow it. She's very health-conscious. And… honestly, the smell makes me sick. I drink a little sometimes, just a beer with dinner, maybe a glass of wine on the weekend. Nothing heavy.
DOCTOR: “A little”, you say. And do you engage in any regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Regular? Not really. I walk a bit, you know, around the store at work. It's a lot of standing. But… that's about it. I used to play soccer when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. My wife tries to get me to go for walks with her, but… I get tired easily.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us proceed to allergies. Do you have any known allergies – medications, food, environmental factors?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I'm outside, but I figured that was just bugs. My wife always checks the ingredients in food, so I haven't had anything that should give me an allergy. I think I'm pretty good on that front.
DOCTOR: And finally, medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Not even vitamins. My wife keeps saying I should take something for my energy, but I haven't gotten around to it. I just... don’t like taking pills. I figure if I lose the weight, I won't need any. Is that a good answer?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Kochubey, based on this… limited information, and your wife's diligence in securing this appointment, we can proceed with a preliminary assessment. However, your lack of a detailed medical history is… concerning. I will require a complete blood work panel, including a lipid profile and comprehensive metabolic panel. We will also need an EKG to evaluate your cardiovascular health. And frankly, given your family history – or lack thereof – and your overall lack of engagement with preventative care, I would strongly recommend a consultation with a cardiologist prior to any surgical intervention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Wow… that's… a lot. Blood work, EKG… and a heart doctor? Uh… I think I understand. It’s just… everything is happening so fast. My wife will be glad I’m getting checked out, but… it’s a little scary, honestly. Is this… is this normal? Before surgery? I just want to feel better, you know? And I trust my wife, but… it’s a lot to take in. Can she come with me to the next appointment? To help me remember everything?
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Mr. Kochubey. A responsible surgeon exercises due diligence. As for your wife attending the next appointment… that is permissible. However, I expect you to be actively engaged in your own care. I will have my nurse schedule the necessary tests and provide you with the appropriate requisitions. We will discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any further questions now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… tell me, is this going to hurt? The tests, the surgery… I’m not good with pain. And… my wife will definitely want to know what the doctor said. She’s the one who really knows everything, anyway. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. I think.
DOCTOR: The tests will be… uncomfortable. Surgery inherently involves a degree of discomfort, managed with appropriate analgesia. However, your overall health profile will influence the anticipated recovery period. I will discuss these details further upon review of your test results. The nurse will be with you shortly to schedule your appointments. Have a good day, Mr. Kochubey. .
