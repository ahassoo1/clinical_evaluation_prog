DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s try to be efficient, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, good morning. Efficient is… good. My wife and I, we want… a baby, maybe? It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: A baby?
PATIENT: Yes. We talk. She wants. I… I think so too. But… old, you know? Maybe hard now. We not… not sure. She say come see you. For… planning? Is that right? I forget things easy these days.
DOCTOR: Right. Planning. Well, Mr. Carlotta, at your age, and frankly, given the… extended timeframe, we need to be quite thorough. Let’s start with a little history. You mentioned your wife is interested in starting a family now. And you are experiencing some… memory difficulties?
PATIENT: Yes, memory. It comes and goes. Like the wind. Sometimes clear, sometimes… nothing. My wife, she mostly remembers for both of us. She is very good. And… I make things with my hands. Metal, plastic… little models. Keeps my mind busy, sometimes. But not always enough for the remembering, you see?
DOCTOR: Alright. And when did you first begin noticing these memory lapses, Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a hard one. A long time now. Maybe… five years? Ten? It's difficult to say. Things just… started to slip. Not all at once. Slowly. Like sand through fingers. I used to remember dates very well. For the models, for the… for everything. Now... not so much. My wife gets frustrated, sometimes. But she is patient. Very patient.
DOCTOR: And do these memory issues impact your daily life, beyond forgetting dates?
PATIENT: Yes. Sometimes… I forget what I was doing. I go to the workshop, and I… I look around and I don’t remember why I went there. Or I start making something, and I forget what I was building. Small things, mostly. But… worrying. And… I worry I forget things important to my wife. Things she tells me. That makes me sad.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for this, or have you been evaluated by anyone for these memory concerns?
PATIENT: Medications? No. No medications for… for the forgetting. No. And… evaluated? I don’t think so. I went to the doctor for my knee, a few years back. But not for… for my head. My wife, she says maybe we should. But I… I don’t like doctors much. Too many questions. And poking. But she is probably right. She usually is.
DOCTOR: I see no record of any neurological evaluation, or complaints of cognitive decline previously documented. Mr. Carlotta, while I understand your reluctance, it is important to rule out any underlying medical causes for your memory loss. We should start with a basic cognitive assessment here in the office. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: A… a what? Assessment? You mean… testing? I don't like tests. Makes me nervous. But… if it helps. If it helps my wife, and… maybe helps with the baby… then okay. Okay, I will try. But please… no poking. And go slow, yes? Slow is good.
DOCTOR: Very well. It’s a simple questionnaire, mostly. And no, no poking. Just some questions. Now, let’s begin. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date…? Hmm. That's the hard part, yes? Let me think… It’s… August. I know that much. August… and… is it the first? No… my wife said something about the… the second? August 2nd? Is that right? I think so. August 2nd, 2025. Maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright, August 2nd, 2025. And can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where…? Oh! The doctor’s office. Doctor Yackey's office. In the… the village. Rural, you said. Yes, very rural. Small office. Nice pictures on the wall. Flowers. And… a waiting room. I remember waiting. My wife is outside, probably. Reading. She likes to read.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Carlotta. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me. Please listen carefully. The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes. Apple, table, penny. I think I remember those. Apple, table, penny. Is that… is that right? I'm trying. It’s hard to hold them all in my head. Like trying to catch smoke.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple math questions. What is 5 plus 7?
PATIENT: Five plus seven…? Hmm. Let me see. Five… and seven… That’s… twelve! Yes, twelve! Is that right? I used to be very good at numbers. For the models, you see. Very precise. But now… it takes a little longer. My brain feels… slow. Like wading through water.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you tell me the current President of the United States?
PATIENT: The President…? Oh dear. That’s a tricky one. I… I used to follow the news. But now… everything blurs together. Is it… Biden? I think it’s Biden. Yes, I believe it’s Biden. But I’m not sure. So many names. So many faces. My wife knows all these things. She always knows.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. That's enough for a preliminary assessment. Based on these results, and your reported memory difficulties, I recommend a more comprehensive neurological evaluation. I'll refer you to Dr. Olsen, the neurologist in Anchorage. They can perform more detailed testing and determine the underlying cause of your cognitive decline. We also need to do some blood work to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or other medical issues. In the meantime, let’s discuss your desire to start a family. Is your wife with you today?
PATIENT: Yes, she is. She's just… waiting patiently, as always. She'll be very glad to hear we're doing some tests. She worries about me. And about… having a baby. She wants to know if it's… safe. If I am… strong enough. I think she’s very brave, my wife. She always looks after me. Maybe you should talk to her? She has all the important questions. She remembers everything I forget.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Carlotta?
