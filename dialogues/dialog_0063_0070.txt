DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Eh? Oh. Yes. Doctor… Jules, you say? Right. Well, I just… moved here. New place. Needed to find a doctor, you know? Medicare said come here. Social thing, I think. Old bones, mostly. Not much to tell, really.
DOCTOR: “Old bones,” you say. Vague. Very vague. And you expect me to diagnose you with… what, exactly?
PATIENT: Diagnose? Oh, no, no. Not diagnose. Just… check. Make sure nothing serious. You know, the usual. I used to work with actors, very famous ones, very demanding. They always had something. Little aches, little pains. I’m probably just… getting old. Like everyone else.
DOCTOR: Actors. Fascinating. Though, I find their complaints are rarely… genuine. Very prone to exaggeration, that lot. Still. “Little aches and pains,” you say. Can you be more specific, Mr. Szmyd?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm… let me think. My back… sometimes it’s stiff. When I bend over. Not all the time, you understand. And my knees… a little clicky. Not bad, though. Like old wood. I suppose. It's hard to explain, really. It just is.
DOCTOR: “Clicky knees.” Right. And how long have these… “clicky knees” and “stiff back” been bothering you?
PATIENT: Long? Oh, goodness. A while. Years, maybe? It comes and goes, you see. I don’t pay much attention. It’s just… being old, I think. Maybe since… since the divorce, yes. A long time ago now. Everything aches a little more when you are… alone, I suppose.
DOCTOR: The divorce is hardly a relevant medical detail, Mr. Szmyd. We are discussing your physical ailments. Years, you say?
PATIENT: Well, everything is connected, isn't it? Stress, you know. It makes everything worse. The back, the knees… even the little aches. But... yes. Years. I would say... five, maybe six years. It started slowly. I didn't think much of it then. Just thought I was working too hard. Always rushing around, you see. Making up the pretty faces.
DOCTOR: “Making up the pretty faces” is… irrelevant. Let’s focus, Mr. Szmyd. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? I'm not sick. Well… sometimes my hands feel a little… numb. Not always. More in the morning, I think. Makes it harder to… well, to do the work. Delicate work, you understand? Applying the… the colour. But it goes away. Like everything else.
DOCTOR: Numb hands, mornings. And what sort of “delicate work” requires such precision?
PATIENT: Makeup! Theatrical makeup, you see. Performance makeup. I used to do the faces for… for a very famous theatre company. Big productions. Very demanding. It’s… a skill, you know? Very precise work. Blending, shading… making them look… younger, prettier. It requires steady hands. Or it used to.
DOCTOR: Right. So, theatrical makeup. And this numbness… does anything specifically trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger it? Hmm… Cold, maybe? If it’s very cold. Or… if I'm very tired. It's hard to say. It just… happens. Sometimes it’s worse when I’m… focusing, I think. Really concentrating on the… the details. Tiny lines, shading, things like that.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a quick physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We need to assess your range of motion and reflexes. I haven’t all day.
PATIENT: Lie down? Oh. Must I? I don’t see why. I told you, it's just old age! I'm perfectly functional, you know. Still… Alright, alright. But be gentle, Doctor. These bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Please. It will be brief. Now, lie flat on your back, arms at your sides. I need to check your reflexes first.
PATIENT: Reflexes… Honestly, Doctor. All this fuss for a little bit of… well, getting old! I’m ready. Just… try not to hit me too hard, alright? It's a very delicate operation, this aging process.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Patellar reflex… present, but diminished. And now the other side. Also diminished. Slightly. Not entirely absent. Now, please flex your neck forward. I need to assess your range of motion.
PATIENT: Oof! There. Like this? It’s a little stiff, you know. Haven't been doing much stretching lately. Too busy… well, never mind. It’s just old age, really. Like everything else. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion. Some crepitus present. Shoulder movement…slightly restricted. And now, can you grip my hand firmly?
PATIENT: Restricted? Everything is restricted when you get to a certain age, Doctor. It’s a fact of life. Like this? Not as strong as I used to be, I admit. Used to have very strong hands. Very precise work, you see. All that… blending and shading.
DOCTOR: Weak grip strength. Diminished. And now, please stand up slowly. I need to observe your gait.
PATIENT: There. See? Perfectly functional. Just a little… slow. Old bones, you see. Takes a while to get going. You young doctors… always rushing around. Everything takes time.
DOCTOR: Slightly unsteady. Mildly antalgic gait pattern. Very well. Based on this brief examination, it appears you may be experiencing mild osteoarthritis, along with some possible early signs of… reduced peripheral nerve function. Though, frankly, given your age, some degree of these issues is almost inevitable.
PATIENT: Osteo… what now? Fancy words, Doctor. Sounds very serious. So, you’re saying I'm falling apart? Is that it? I knew it! All this rushing around, all this stress… It finally caught up with me. Still, I suppose it's better to know, yes? What do you propose to do about it?
DOCTOR: "Falling apart" is… a rather dramatic interpretation. We’ll start with conservative management. Physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your joints. I'll prescribe a mild analgesic for the pain, and I recommend avoiding activities that exacerbate your symptoms. We’ll also schedule some blood work to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions. Though, I suspect it’s simply… wear and tear. Now, do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… Well, I don’t really do exercise. Never have. Too busy making up the pretty faces, you see. Analgesic… is that a pill? I don’t like taking pills. Allergies? Hmm… I think… maybe to penicillin? Years ago, I had a… a rash. A very nasty rash. But that was a long time ago. It was… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. We will avoid that, naturally. Very well. I am prescribing you a course of ibuprofen, as needed, for the pain. Do not exceed the recommended dosage. And I will refer you to a physical therapist. I expect you to follow their instructions. Now, are you currently taking any other medications?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… alright, alright. But I'm warning you, I don’t like taking pills! Other medications? Hmm… Let me think… I take something for my blood pressure. A small white pill. Doctor… Doctor… Kowalski, I think? Prescribed it a few years ago. That's all. I think.
DOCTOR: “Doctor Kowalski…” Incredibly vague. Very well. I will note the blood pressure medication. I will also write you a prescription for the ibuprofen, and the referral to physical therapy. Do you have any questions for me, Mr. Szmyd?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm… Well… will this… physical therapy… make me younger? I'm rather hoping it will. And will I still be able to… well, do my work? It's very delicate work, you know. Very precise.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, physical therapy will not make you younger. It will help to improve your strength and flexibility, which may alleviate some of your symptoms and allow you to continue… your work, within reasonable limitations. However, it requires dedication and consistent effort. I expect you to follow the therapist's instructions diligently. Now, I believe we have covered everything. I will have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to assess your progress. Please do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any concerning symptoms. You may get dressed now.
PATIENT: Dedicated effort… Alright, alright. But don't expect miracles, Doctor. Alright. I understand. Thank you, Doctor… Doctor… Jules, yes? I suppose I should get going. Four weeks, you say? Right. .
