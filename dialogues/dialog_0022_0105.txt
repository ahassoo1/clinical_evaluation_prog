DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s about getting surgery. Weight loss surgery, that is. My wife helped me set up the appointment. To be honest, I don’t really remember all the details about why exactly we’re here today, just that it’s… a check-up before the surgery? Everything feels a little fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kochubey, that's perfectly alright. It's common to feel a little overwhelmed with all the information surrounding surgery. We can definitely go over everything again. So, you're here for a pre-operative evaluation for weight loss surgery. I see here your wife helped schedule this appointment. Do you know what type of weight loss surgery you are considering?
PATIENT: I… think it was the sleeve? Or maybe the bypass? Honestly, Doctor, I really don’t know. My wife did most of the research and talking to the other doctors. I just… agreed. She said it was the best option, and I trust her. I’m not very good with remembering things like that, sorry. It all just kinda happened quickly.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Kochubey. It’s perfectly fine. We can definitely clarify everything. It’s important you understand the procedure you’re considering. Okay, let’s start with a little background. To help me understand your overall health and make sure you’re a good candidate for surgery – whichever type that may be – could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical history. That’s… tough. I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, to be honest. I think I had… the usual childhood stuff, like chickenpox. And I broke my arm once, when I was little. But serious stuff? Not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy… until recently, I guess. My weight’s been a problem for a long time now, but other than that… I’m drawing a blank. Does that help? I feel bad I can’t be more useful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It’s helpful to know you haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past. We’ll fill in the gaps as we go. Let's talk about your current health. Besides your weight, are you experiencing any other symptoms currently – things like pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, digestive issues, or anything else that’s bothering you?
PATIENT: Well… I get tired easily, yeah. Really easily. Even just walking up the stairs leaves me winded. And my knees… they ache a lot, especially at the end of the day. Sometimes my back hurts too, I guess from carrying the extra weight. And… I sweat a lot, even when it’s not hot. I thought it was just because of the heat, but… I don't know. Everything feels connected to the weight, I think. I haven’t really told anyone about it, though. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Kochubey. It's good you’re telling me about these symptoms. Fatigue, knee pain, back pain, and excessive sweating are all things we need to consider. They could be related to your weight, but it's important to rule out other potential causes as well. Do you have any trouble breathing at night, like snoring or waking up gasping for air?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, actually. My wife says I snore really loud. She’s had to start sleeping in the other room sometimes. And… yeah, I do wake up sometimes feeling like I’m choking, or gasping for air. I just thought it was a bad dream, or something. I never really paid much attention to it. It doesn't happen every night, but it’s… often enough, I guess. She’s the one who said I should mention it to the doctor. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: That’s important information, Mr. Kochubey. Loud snoring and waking up gasping for air could indicate sleep apnea, which is a condition where you stop breathing briefly during sleep. It's common in people with obesity and can have serious health consequences. Before we discuss potential surgical options, we need to get a better understanding of your overall health. Would you mind if I perform a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: No, no, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. I just… want to feel better, you know? My wife says this is the best chance I have. So, yeah, a physical exam is good. Just… let me know if anything feels weird, okay? I get a little nervous with doctors sometimes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kochubey. I’ll explain everything as we go, and please, don’t hesitate to let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, let’s start by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat and abdomen. I'll also check your knees and back for any tenderness or swelling. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, Mr. Kochubey. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and exhale. Another deep breath…
PATIENT: Okay… deep breath… inhales deeply, then exhales slowly. Another one… inhales deeply, then exhales. It feels a little tight in my chest, sometimes, when I breathe. I don’t know if that’s normal. My wife says I should’ve gotten this checked out a long time ago. She’s always right, honestly. I just… put it off. I didn't want to hear bad news, I guess.
DOCTOR: I do hear a little wheezing in your lungs, Mr. Kochubey, which could explain the tightness you’re feeling. It’s not necessarily a cause for immediate alarm, but it's something we need to investigate further. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Are you experiencing any digestive issues – bloating, constipation, diarrhea, heartburn?
PATIENT: It’s… tender, yeah. Especially here, on the right side. points to his lower right abdomen. Not really pain, just… uncomfortable. And… yeah, I get heartburn a lot. Almost every day. I take those antacid tablets, the pink ones, but they don’t always help. And… I have trouble going to the bathroom sometimes. Constipation, mostly. It's really… embarrassing to talk about. I feel bad even bringing it up. My wife says I need to be honest with the doctor, but it’s hard.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being honest with me, Mr. Kochubey. It's important to discuss all of your symptoms, even the ones that feel embarrassing. Tenderness in your lower right abdomen and the heartburn and constipation are all things we need to consider. Now, let's check your knees and back. Do you have any pain when I bend your knees?
PATIENT: Yeah, it hurts when I bend them. Especially this one. points to his right knee. It feels… creaky, and stiff. And it aches when I go up the stairs, like a dull, throbbing pain. grimaces slightly as I gently bend his knee. My wife bought me some knee braces, but they don't really help that much. It's just… getting worse, I think. sighs softly. It's hard to get around sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do feel some crepitus, which is a grinding sensation, and a little swelling in your right knee. It sounds like you have some osteoarthritis, which is a common condition in people with obesity. Now, let’s check your back. Do you have any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yeah, that hurts. winces slightly as I press on his lower back. Right there, in the middle. It’s a dull ache, most of the time, but it gets sharp when I move. Especially when I bend over. I try to lift things carefully, but… it still hurts sometimes. My wife helps me with the heavy stuff now. She said I shouldn’t strain my back. She's right, she always is. chuckles softly, then winces again. It's just… getting old, I guess.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have some lower back pain, likely due to muscle strain. It’s not necessarily related to getting older, Mr. Kochubey. It’s often caused by carrying extra weight. Okay, Mr. Kochubey, thank you for your patience. I've completed the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the examination, it seems you have a number of health issues that need to be addressed, including high blood pressure, possible sleep apnea, osteoarthritis in your knees, and lower back pain. You also reported heartburn and constipation. These are all common issues associated with obesity, but it’s important to rule out other potential causes. Before we discuss potential surgical options, I recommend we order some blood tests to check your overall health, including your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. I also recommend a sleep study to evaluate for sleep apnea. And, depending on the results of the blood tests, we may need to do further imaging of your knees and back. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better, you know? I trust you to figure out what’s wrong. Blood tests, a sleep study… whatever it takes. I just… hope it doesn't take too long. My wife is already talking about dates for the surgery, and I don’t want to disappoint her. She's been so supportive through all of this. sighs softly. It's just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s a lot to take in, Mr. Kochubey. We'll take things one step at a time. The blood tests and sleep study will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. I will call you as soon as the results are available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to follow the diet and exercise plan recommended by your wife. And, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything really well, Doctor. Honestly, my wife probably has more questions than I do. She’s the smart one. chuckles softly. I just… appreciate you listening to me, and taking the time to figure things out. It means a lot. I guess… I’ll just wait for the phone call, then. shifts in his chair, looking slightly relieved. Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I’m glad I could help. And don’t underestimate yourself – it takes courage to come in and discuss these issues. I'm confident we can get you on the right track. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, Mr. Kochubey, and please, take care.
