DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um... I'm here because... well, I have cancer. It's... a lot, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chellsea. Thank you for sharing that with me. It is a lot, and you're very brave for coming in and talking about it. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about your diagnosis?
PATIENT: I... I don't really know a lot about it, to be honest. My husband... he handled all the appointments and stuff. He... he passed away a few months ago, and then I found out it was getting worse. The doctors told me… something about it being in my lungs? I just… I haven’t really been able to keep track of everything since then. It’s a lot to take in when you're on your own.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Chellsea. Losing your husband and dealing with a cancer diagnosis at the same time… that’s an enormous amount to cope with. It's perfectly alright that you haven't been able to keep track of everything. We can go over everything together, at your pace. Do you happen to have any paperwork from your previous doctors – discharge summaries, pathology reports, anything like that?
PATIENT: I think I do. My husband kept everything in a folder… it's at home. I… I haven't really looked through it yet. It’s… hard. Everything reminds me of him. But I can get it. I’ll try to bring it next time? Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chellsea. That's perfectly fine. There's no rush at all. We can certainly start where we are today and then go over the paperwork when you're ready. In the meantime, could you tell me anything you do remember about the cancer?
PATIENT: Um… they said it started in my lungs, like I said. And… that it had spread? I don't remember where, exactly. I mostly just remember a lot of coughing. And being very tired. That's… about all I really recall, honestly. They did some scans and… and tests. And then… they told me it was serious. It’s all a bit blurry, I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: You don't need to apologize at all, Chellsea. It's completely understandable that things are blurry. It sounds like you've been through a great deal. Okay, let's focus on how you're feeling now. Besides the coughing and tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes I get pain. In my chest, mostly. It comes and goes. And… I’ve lost some weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser. I haven't really been eating much, to be honest. It doesn’t really… taste good anymore. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, Chellsea, that is very common with cancer and with the treatments often used for it. Loss of appetite and weight loss are frequently seen. And chest pain certainly warrants further investigation. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: It's… a dull ache, mostly. Not a sharp pain. It gets worse when I cough, and… sometimes when I take a deep breath. It’s mostly on the left side, I think. And it doesn’t really go away completely, even when I’m resting. It’s just… always there, a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache on the left side, worse with coughing and deep breaths, and consistently present to some degree. Thank you for describing that so clearly. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t really have much of a medical history. I’ve always been pretty healthy, actually. I… I had the flu a few times, when I was a kid, and… I broke my arm once. But that’s about it. My husband… he was the one who always went to the doctor. I mostly just… took care of him. I have Medicare, because of him. That's… about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so generally good health previously, with only minor childhood illnesses and a broken arm. And you are currently covered by Medicare. That’s helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never. Just… the broken arm when I was little. They put it in a cast. That's all. I… I don't really like doctors, to be honest. Or hospitals. They always remind me of… everything. But I know I need to be here. It’s just… hard.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Chellsea. It's perfectly natural to feel anxious about doctors and hospitals given everything you've been through. And it's very brave of you to come in today. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant illnesses – like cancer, heart disease, or diabetes – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um… my grandmother, on my mother’s side… she had cancer. I think it was… breast cancer? A long time ago. And my father… he had heart problems. He… he passed away when I was in high school. But… other than that, not really. My mother is still alive, and she’s pretty healthy. I think. We don't talk much. Does that… matter?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Chellsea. A history of cancer in your grandmother and heart problems in your father are relevant. And it’s alright that you and your mother don't talk much – we can work with the information you have. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never. My husband… he smoked for a while, but he quit a long time ago. I always told him it was bad for his health. He… he listened to me, eventually. I don't drink much either. Just… a glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. And I don’t do any drugs. I'm… a pretty boring person, I guess.
DOCTOR: There’s nothing boring about taking care of yourself and your loved ones, Chellsea. And thank you for being honest with me. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. My husband… he was the one who kept track of those things. I never really had to take much medication. Just… painkillers for my broken arm, when I was a kid. And maybe some antibiotics once or twice. But… I don’t remember anything specific. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Chellsea. We’ll work through this together. It sounds like you don't have any known medication allergies. Alright, now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’d like to listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and feel your lymph nodes. It will give me a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… okay. I guess. It’s just… it’s a little scary, all of this. But I know I need to do it. Just… please be gentle? And… try not to take too long? I’m… a little anxious.
DOCTOR: Of course, Chellsea. I will absolutely be gentle, and we'll take it at your pace. It won’t take long, and I'll explain everything as I go. Okay, let's start with listening to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth. I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds in the lower left lobe, and some… crackles. These could indicate fluid buildup or inflammation. Your heart rate is a little elevated at 92, and your blood pressure is 130/80. That’s slightly above normal, but could be related to anxiety. I'm feeling some slight swelling in the lymph nodes in your left armpit. It’s not dramatically enlarged, but it's something we need to investigate further. Okay, that’s all for the exam. I’ve noted diminished breath sounds, some crackles, a slightly elevated heart rate, and some swelling in the lymph nodes in your left armpit. These findings warrant further investigation. Do you have any questions about what I've found so far?
PATIENT: That… sounds bad. Does that mean it’s… worse? What does it mean? I'm… I'm getting scared again. Is there something… seriously wrong? What do we do now?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be scared, Chellsea. What I've found doesn’t necessarily mean it's worse, but it does mean we need to get more information to understand what’s going on. Diminished breath sounds, crackles, and swollen lymph nodes could be caused by several things, including the cancer itself, an infection, or inflammation. We can't know for sure without doing some further testing. The next step is to order some imaging tests – specifically a chest X-ray and a CT scan of your chest and abdomen. This will give us a better look at your lungs, lymph nodes, and other organs. We’ll also need to do some blood work to check your overall health and look for any signs of infection or cancer markers. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds okay. Whatever you think is best. I just… want to know what’s going on. And… I want to feel better. Is the CT scan… painful? And will the blood work take long? I have… an appointment next week, and I don’t want to miss it. It’s… important.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chellsea, that’s the goal - to get to the bottom of this and get you feeling better. The CT scan itself isn't painful. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It’s a bit noisy, and you’ll need to hold very still for a few minutes at a time while the images are taken. Some people feel a little claustrophobic, but the technicians will be right there with you the whole time. We can discuss options if you’re concerned about that. As for the blood work, it shouldn’t take long at all – usually just a few minutes. We’ll order it now, and the results should be back within a few days. We’ll schedule the CT scan as soon as possible, taking your appointment next week into consideration. Okay, I've ordered the blood work and scheduled the CT scan for this Friday morning. The lab is just down the hall, and the CT scan will be at the imaging center across the street. I’ll give you the paperwork for both. Do you have any questions about these tests or the appointments?
PATIENT: No, I… I don't think so. That's… a lot to take in. Friday morning, okay. I’ll try to remember. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. You've been very kind. I… I just want to know what’s going to happen. And… if there’s anything I can do to help myself. Are there… any foods I should avoid? Or things I should be doing? I don’t want to just… sit here and wait. Is there anything I can do now to… feel a little better? Even just a little?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, and it's good that you want to be proactive. While we're waiting for the test results, there are a few things you can do to help yourself feel a little better. It’s important to focus on good nutrition to support your body, even if your appetite isn’t great. Try to eat small, frequent meals, and choose foods that are easy to digest. Staying hydrated is also very important. As for specific foods to avoid, there aren't any strict restrictions at this point. However, avoiding processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive caffeine is always a good idea. Most importantly, try to get as much rest as possible and manage your stress levels. Gentle exercise, like walking, can also be helpful, if you’re up to it. We have a resource here at the clinic for stress management and coping with illness. I can provide you with some information. This brochure has some helpful tips and resources. And remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. We’ll discuss the test results as soon as they’re available, and we’ll develop a plan together. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. Really. You’ve… helped me a lot. I feel… a little less scared, I think. I’ll… try to eat better, and get some rest. And I'll look at the brochure. Um… is it okay if I… just ask you questions next time? If I… forget something? Or… if I get confused? I don't want to bother you.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chellsea. Please don't hesitate to ask me any questions at all, anytime. That's what I'm here for. It's perfectly normal to forget things or get confused, especially when dealing with a lot of information. You're not bothering me at all. We’ll take it one step at a time, and I'll do my best to explain everything clearly. It was nice meeting you, Chellsea. I look forward to seeing you next week. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then. .
