DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome. I’m Dr. Bombara. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get this over with. It’s my hand. It shakes. Been shaking for… well, a while now. Honestly, it’s annoying, that’s all. My grandkids keep pointing it out. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, I understand. It’s frustrating when something like that interferes with everyday life, and certainly understandable that it bothers you. “A while now” is a bit vague, though – could you tell me roughly how long it’s been shaking?
PATIENT: Roughly? Geez, lady, you want precise? I don’t do precise. Months, I guess. Maybe six? Longer? I don’t keep track of these things. I've got better things to worry about, you know. Like, remembering where I parked the car... which, honestly, is happening more and more.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. Six months is helpful, even if it’s approximate. And forgetting things occasionally is… well, it happens. We can certainly look into both. Now, is the shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's... mostly when I'm trying to do something, alright? Like, holding a fork. Or signing a check. Anything that requires a steady hand. It's not, like, shaking all the time, just when I need it to be still. It's real inconvenient, if you must know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s more prominent with intentional movements. And is it just your hands, or do you notice shaking in other parts of your body as well?
PATIENT: Just my hand, alright? Don't go lookin’ for problems where there aren't any. I'm eighty years old, a little tremor in the hand is to be expected, right? I don't need a whole body examination over this. Honestly, this is taking too long.
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out, Mr. Baide. A little tremor can be common with age. But it's important to rule out anything else that might be contributing. Just to get a clearer picture, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Look, I’m old. I have lots of symptoms! My knees ache, my back hurts, I forget things... what do you want from me? Is this going to take all day? I have a lunch date, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. I'm not trying to make you list every ache and pain. I’m just checking for anything unusual that might point to a specific cause. Have you noticed any stiffness in your hand or fingers, or any changes in your handwriting?
PATIENT: Changes in my handwriting? Honestly, I haven’t even looked. I have someone else do most of the writing these days. Too much trouble. Stiffness… maybe a little. But what eighty-year-old doesn’t have a little stiffness? Look, can we just get to the bottom of this and I can go? I'm not a fan of doctors, never have been.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I can certainly try to be quicker. Just so I can get a better understanding, have you noticed any weakness in your hand, or any tingling or numbness?
PATIENT: Weakness? No, not really. It just shakes. It’s annoying, that’s all. Tingling... sometimes. Hard to say. I get all sorts of little sensations, you know, at my age. Look, are you gonna give me something for this, or what? Because if it's just gonna be a lot of questions, I'm outta here.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional tingling, but no significant weakness. And the main issue is the shaking, which is most noticeable when you're trying to perform precise movements. Before we discuss potential treatments, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your hands and nervous system, if you’re agreeable. It will involve some simple tests of your strength, reflexes, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Ugh. Fine. Get it over with. Just... don't poke me too much. And make it quick. I really do have that lunch date, you know. And frankly, this whole thing is giving me a headache.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please sit back and relax. First, could you please extend both of your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? This is ridiculous. I feel like I'm in school again.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see a slight tremor in your right hand when it's at rest, and a bit more pronounced when you try to open and close your fist. I'm also checking the muscle tone. Please keep your arms relaxed. And I’m checking your reflexes now. Just a quick tap. How’s that feel?
PATIENT: Hey! Watch it! That tickles… and it’s annoying. What are you looking for, anyway? I told you, just a little shake. It’s not a big deal. And it doesn’t feel like anything, except annoying. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that was uncomfortable. I’m just checking to see how your nerves are responding. Everything appears normal there. Now, can you please try to squeeze my hands as firmly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Happy? Look, are we almost done? This is taking forever. And my hands are getting tired now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, just a few more quick tests. I'd like you to touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger, and repeat that a few times. We're just checking your coordination.
PATIENT: There. Is that good enough? Honestly, this is… humiliating. I used to be a very coordinated man, you know. Directed films, for goodness sake.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Thank you. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing essential tremor. It’s a common neurological condition, especially as we get older. It causes rhythmic shaking, often in the hands, and can be more noticeable with movement. The reduced grip strength and slightly reduced coordination could be related, or simply age-related changes.
PATIENT: Essential... what now? Is that bad? Am I… falling apart? Look, just tell me straight. Do I need surgery? Because I’m not having surgery. I've seen what happens to people after surgery. It's not pretty.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Baide, essential tremor is not usually a sign of a serious underlying condition. It's generally not life-threatening. And no, you absolutely do not need surgery at this point. Most people manage it quite well without surgery. Often, it can be managed with lifestyle adjustments, like avoiding caffeine or stress, or using assistive devices if needed. There are also medications that can help reduce the shaking, though they can have side effects, so we would discuss those carefully.
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. I don’t like the sound of that. Side effects… always something. Assistive devices? Like what? A special fork? Look, I'm not gonna walk around with a fancy fork because my hand shakes a little. Can I just… try to ignore it for now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a perfectly reasonable approach, Mr. Baide. If it’s not significantly interfering with your daily life, we can certainly try a “wait and see” approach. Keep an eye on it. If it worsens, or starts to affect other activities, or if you develop other symptoms, please come back to see me. We can then discuss medications or other options. There are also occupational therapists who can suggest techniques and tools to help you manage daily tasks if needed. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's it. Just... don't expect me to be back anytime soon. I don't like doctors, remember? And I really need to make my lunch date. Alright then. Thank you… I suppose.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Baide. I understand your reluctance, and I hope you enjoy your lunch date. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and take care. .
