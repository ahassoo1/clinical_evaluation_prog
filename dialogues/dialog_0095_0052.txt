DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's this morning sickness, like. It's a bit daft, really, at my age. But it's been happening for a wee while now, and I thought I best get it checked. It’s connected to my heart, the other doctors said.
DOCTOR: Okay, morning sickness… and it's related to your heart, you said?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. They said something about heart failure, and that this nausea is... a sign of it gettin' worse, maybe? I’m not the best with the medical bits, I'll admit. It just feels like I'm gonna be sick every morning, and sometimes it lasts longer than just the morning, if you catch my drift. Nothing actually comes up, mind you, just the feeling. It's unsettling, like.
DOCTOR: Alright, so nausea, potentially related to heart failure as determined by other doctors. And it's not necessarily vomiting, just the feeling of being sick, and it can last throughout the day. When did this start, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started properly maybe a month ago, give or take a week. At first, I thought it was just something I ate, a dodgy bit of fish or somethin'. But it kept comin' back, every mornin'. Now it's nearly every day, and it's not gettin' better. I’m tryin' to keep track, but it’s hard when you're feelin' queasy all the time.
DOCTOR: A month ago, consistent nausea... Alright. And have you noticed anything else alongside the nausea?
PATIENT: Aye, now that you mention it… I've been a bit more breathless than usual, I suppose. Not when I'm doin' anythin' strenuous, mind you, just walkin' up the stairs or carryin' a bag of groceries. And my ankles have been a wee bit swollen at the end of the day. I thought it was just the heat, to be honest, but maybe it's connected. I haven't told the other doctors about the ankles, I thought they were just a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness and ankle swelling... Those could be connected to heart failure, yes. Okay, let’s get a bit more detail. Can you describe the breathlessness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m gaspin’ for air, Doctor. It's just… I get a bit winded quicker than I used to. Like I have to pause for a breath after a few steps. It’s not constant, mind you, it comes and goes. And it's worse if I'm lyin’ flat. I’ve started sleepin’ with an extra pillow, which helps a bit. It just feels like there’s a weight on my chest, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathlessness with exertion, worse when lying flat, relieved by extra pillows, and a feeling of weight on the chest. Do you notice any palpitations – any fluttering or racing of your heart?
PATIENT: Palpitations… hmm. Not really racing, no. But sometimes, when I'm lyin' down, I can feel a thumpin' in my chest. Like a heavy beat, slow and strong. It doesn’t happen all the time, maybe once or twice a week. It's not painful, just… noticeable. It makes me a bit uneasy, if I’m honest. I always check my pulse after, and it seems alright, just a bit strong.
DOCTOR: A strong, noticeable heartbeat sometimes, when lying down. Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Aye, well, I was diagnosed with heart failure about five years ago now. That's why I see the specialists, you see. I'm on some tablets for it, keeps it mostly under control, usually. And I had high blood pressure for a bit, but the tablets seem to be managin' that too. I don't have diabetes, as far as I know. I get checked regularly, they tell me.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart failure diagnosed five years ago, currently managed with medication, and a history of hypertension also controlled with medication. Do you know what medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Aye, let me think. I have… um, there's ramipril, for the blood pressure and the heart. And then there’s furosemide, a water tablet they call it, for gettin' rid of fluid. And I think there’s bisoprolol, for slowin' the heart down. I have a list at home, but I didn’t bring it with me, sorry. I can usually remember them, but the names are a bit of a mouthful.
DOCTOR: Alright, ramipril, furosemide, and bisoprolol. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to any of the tablets I’ve taken, thankfully. I’m usually pretty careful with what I take. My wife always double-checks, too, she’s a bit of a worrier.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. Can you step up onto the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Aye, no problem. Just be warned, I'm a bit of a long fella. Careful now, this thing feels a wee bit wobbly.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathe deeply for me, Mr. Benic... Good. I'm hearing some congestion in your lungs, a little crackling sound. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, and I can feel a slight swelling in your ankles. I’m also noticing some fluid retention in your lower legs.
PATIENT: Aye, that doesn't surprise me about the ankles. They've been botherin' me, like I said. And the breathlessness... So, what does that all mean, Doctor? Is the heart failure gettin' worse, then?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Benic. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it does seem your heart failure is currently experiencing a bit of a flare-up. The congestion in your lungs and the fluid retention are signs of that. The nausea could be related, sometimes decreased blood flow to the digestive system can cause that. However, it's important to rule out other causes. We need to do some blood work to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and an ECG to look at your heart’s electrical activity. We should also get a chest X-ray to assess the amount of fluid in your lungs. I'm going to order those tests now.
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible enough, Doctor. Kidney function and such… alright. It's a bit frightenin', hearin' it like that, but I suppose it's best to know for sure. I trust your judgement. How long will these tests take, and will I need to come back again?
DOCTOR: The blood work and ECG shouldn’t take more than an hour or so, the nurse will get you set up right away. The chest X-ray can usually be done within the next few hours. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them, likely within a couple of days. Depending on the results, we may need to adjust your medication dosage, or add something new. In the meantime, it’s important to monitor your weight daily, and let us know if you experience any sudden weight gain or worsening shortness of breath. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Aye, that makes sense. Daily weight, weight gain… I can manage that, no problem. Um... would cutting down on salt help any? My wife's always on at me about that, she makes a lovely soup, but it's a bit salty for my liking, if I’m honest. It might be a good excuse to get her to use less, ha!
DOCTOR: Yes, reducing your salt intake absolutely can help manage fluid retention. It’s a good idea. And that’s a perfectly legitimate excuse to ask your wife to use a bit less! We’ll also talk about fluid restriction at your follow-up appointment, but for now, focus on the salt intake. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and do the ECG. Do you have any other questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly, I appreciate that. I'll get this done, and see what the results say. I'll tell my wife about the salt, too, she'll be pleased. Thank you for lookin' after me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. I'm glad I could help. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And don't hesitate to call if anything changes before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be right with you. .
