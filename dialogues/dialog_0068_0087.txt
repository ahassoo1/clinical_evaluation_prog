DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Or… is it Early?
PATIENT: Early, please. Just Early is fine. Look, I just need the lab work done, if that’s alright. I haven't got all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Early. Yes, I see you're here for some lab work. Just to confirm, your primary care physician requested these tests?
PATIENT: Primary… oh, um. You know, things are a bit fuzzy. Did someone request them? Maybe? I just… the clinic sent a notice. That’s all I remember, really. Medicare covers it, right? I wouldn’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover it, yes, as long as it’s deemed medically necessary. Let me pull up your record… hmm. It seems there’s a note from Dr. Evans requesting a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Is that… does that sound right to you, Early?
PATIENT: Evans… that name is familiar. Blood… and… panels? Honestly, it all sounds like a lot of… stuff. I suppose if a doctor wrote it down, it must be important. Look, I trust you folks know what you’re doing. Just get it done, please. Is there a form I need to sign?
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a standard consent form, and a Medicare form to verify your information. We just need your signature there and here. It's mostly routine. While you’re signing, can you tell me – have you been feeling any different lately?
PATIENT: Different… well, I’m 73, everything feels different these days! No, nothing specific. A bit tired, maybe. But that’s just getting old, right? Is this form asking if I've been abducted by aliens? Because that would explain a lot.
DOCTOR: No, sir, it doesn’t ask about aliens. Just standard medical questions. Tired… okay. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or your weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. I eat when I’m hungry, I suppose. Weight… probably lost a bit, but I haven't been keeping track. I’m a tall fella, always been thin. It’s hard to say. Look, can we just get to the blood work? I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. We'll get that done shortly. Just a few more quick questions, if you don't mind. Are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Nothing regularly. Maybe some aspirin now and then for a headache. Allergies? Dust, I think. And… hospitals. I’m allergic to hospitals. Does that count? Honestly, I try to stay away from them as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Aspirin occasionally, dust, and… a dislike of hospitals. Noted. And do you have any family history of any significant medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… that’s a tough one. My parents are… were… gone a long time ago. I wasn’t close to many relatives. I vaguely remember an aunt with… something. Maybe heart trouble? Or cancer? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t paying much attention. Honestly, I don’t remember details well.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's… understandable. Okay, Mr. Croonquist, let’s just proceed with the blood work then. We'll draw a few vials, and the lab will send the results to Dr. Evans. I’ll have the phlebotomist come in shortly. It should only take a few minutes. Are you comfortable sitting, or would you prefer to lie down?
PATIENT: Sitting is fine. Just… please be quick. And try not to bruise me too badly. I have things to do, you know? I'm not one for lingering in medical facilities.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll let Fatima know to be as gentle as possible. She’ll be right in. Fatima?
PATIENT: Good. Thank you. Honestly, all this fuss over a little blood work… I just hope it gets done quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist, I'll just need to verify your name and date of birth. Then we’ll get started. I’ll explain everything as I go, and it shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Early Croonquist. Date of birth… um… August 14th, 1952. Though, honestly, sometimes I question even that. Just… hurry, please. The quicker it’s over, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. Just relax your arm for me… We’ll start with the complete blood count. It will give Dr. Evans a good overview of your general health. You might feel a slight pinch.
PATIENT: A slight pinch? That’s what they always say. Just… get it over with. I really don’t like this part.
DOCTOR: Alright, we’re all done. Just keep pressure on this for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. And avoid lifting anything heavy with this arm for a little while. I'll send these to the lab right away. The results should be available to Dr. Evans within a few days. Any discomfort, sir?
PATIENT: A little sore, but I've survived worse. Honestly, I just want to get out of here. Will I need to come back for anything else?
DOCTOR: Dr. Evans hasn’t requested any follow-up tests at this time, but he may want to discuss the results with you once they’re available. We’ll call you to schedule an appointment if that’s the case. Here, put this over it for extra protection. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Croonquist?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Just… please don't call me unless it's absolutely necessary. I appreciate you getting it done quickly. Honestly, I'm not one for doctors. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. We understand. Have a good day, and try not to strain that arm. .
