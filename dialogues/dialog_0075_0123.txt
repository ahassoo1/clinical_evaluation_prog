DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it's my skin... it's been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy, really. It started a few weeks ago, I think, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cassimatis, itchy skin. That certainly can be very bothersome. A few weeks, you said. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. It's... all over, really. My arms, my legs, my back… not on my face, thankfully. And it's not like a rash, exactly. It doesn't look different, just… feels like I need to scratch all the time. Especially at night, that's the worst. It keeps me up.
DOCTOR: I understand. Itching all over, worse at night… and no visible rash, just the sensation of needing to scratch. Alright. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… Not really. I haven’t changed my soap, haven't started using any new lotions or anything. I’ve been eating pretty much the same things. Oh! Actually… my grandson, Miguel, he came to visit for a week. He brought some new laundry detergent he likes, and he did a load of my towels and washcloths for me. Could it be that? I don’t usually let anyone else do my laundry.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Cassimatis. A change in laundry detergent is definitely something we should consider. So it was about three weeks ago when Miguel did your laundry?
PATIENT: Yes, around three weeks ago, give or take a few days. He left on the 20th of July, I believe. And it started getting itchy shortly after that. He means well, Miguel, a good boy, but he does like trying out new things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the itching?
PATIENT: No, no other symptoms. No fever, no tiredness, no bumps, nothing like that. Just… the itch. And it's not like a sunburn itch, either. It's… deeper, if that makes sense. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, a deeper itch, I understand. Have you tried anything to relieve it so far?
PATIENT: Oh, you know, the usual things. Lotion, mostly. Doesn't really help for long. I tried some calamine lotion once, but it just felt sticky. And I’ve been taking benadryl at night to try and get some sleep, but it makes me so drowsy the next day. I don’t like feeling like I’m walking in a fog all day.
DOCTOR: Okay. Calamine lotion and Benadryl without much relief, and you dislike the drowsiness from the Benadryl. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve had a few medications over the years, for my blood pressure mostly, but the doctors never said anything about allergies. I haven't had any bad reactions, to my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And I also take a water pill, hydrochlorothiazide, 25 milligrams, also once a day.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. And you’ve been taking these for how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… it must be… about ten years now? Maybe a little longer. The doctor put me on them after a check-up and said I needed to keep my blood pressure down. I usually see Dr. Ramirez for that, but he’s on vacation right now.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for about ten years. Now, Ms. Cassimatis, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to take a look at your skin and see if there are any visible clues. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your skin looks normal on visual inspection, no obvious rash or lesions. I’m not feeling any warmth or swelling either. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs just to get a baseline. Heart and lungs sound good. Now, a few more quick questions. Do you have a family history of skin problems like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had a little bit of eczema when she was a child, I think. Just on her elbows, nothing too bad. And my aunt, on my father’s side, she had really bad dry skin all her life. She used a lot of lotions. But no one ever had anything really bad, like… all over itching like this.
DOCTOR: Alright, some history of eczema and dry skin in the family. And finally, Ms. Cassimatis, could you describe your typical diet for me?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. Lots of rice and beans, fish a couple of times a week, chicken sometimes. I like my vegetables, especially plátanos, and I have some fruit every day. I drink a lot of water. I do like a little bit of chocolate now and then, but nothing too excessive. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, Ms. Cassimatis, and the physical exam, it sounds most likely that this is a case of contact dermatitis from the new laundry detergent your grandson used. The timing fits, and there’s no other clear indication of a more serious problem. The itching being worse at night could be because you’re warmer and more relaxed, which can exacerbate skin irritation. However, to be absolutely sure, I would like to order a complete blood count just to rule out any other potential causes, like an allergic reaction or underlying medical condition. It's a standard precaution.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. I’m just glad it doesn’t sound like anything too serious. I was getting a bit worried. Contact dermatitis… so it’s the detergent? Okay. A blood test sounds fine with me.
DOCTOR: Good. Let's get that blood test ordered. The lab is right down the hall, and they'll need my order. In the meantime, I recommend switching back to your usual detergent and avoiding contact with Miguel’s detergent. We can also try an over-the-counter anti-itch cream with 1% hydrocortisone for relief. Apply it sparingly to the itchy areas. I’ll also write you a prescription for a stronger antihistamine, like cetirizine, which may cause less drowsiness than the Benadryl. It's still important to be cautious when driving or operating machinery. We’ll check the results of the blood test and adjust the plan accordingly. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand everything, Doctor. Switch back to my detergent, the cream, and the new antihistamine… Got it. And wait for the blood test results. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm glad I could help. We'll get the ball rolling on the blood test. The nurse will be in shortly to draw it. Here's a copy of the lab order, and a prescription for the cetirizine. And just to reiterate, if the itching gets significantly worse, or you develop a fever, rash, or any other new symptoms, please call the clinic immediately. Do you have any work or school restrictions that I should note?
PATIENT: No restrictions, Doctor. I'm retired. I spend my time gardening and visiting with family. No heavy lifting or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Then I think we're all set for now. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw your blood and we’ll follow up once the results are available. It will likely be a few days. Here’s my card with the clinic’s number. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough and kind, Doctor. Thank you again. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. It was a pleasure meeting you. Get some rest, and hopefully the itching will start to subside soon. Have a good day.
