DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have all day. I want a baby. A healthy baby. I'm… not getting any younger, you understand. I want to make sure everything is… working correctly, before I even try. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Perfectly clear, Ms. Shteynberg. That's a very sensible approach, and I commend you for being proactive. We certainly want to ensure everything is in optimal condition before you begin trying to conceive. To get a better understanding of your situation, would you mind if I ask a few questions?
PATIENT: Fine. But keep it brief. I have… things to do. Ask away. But if it's about feelings, I'm warning you now, I'm not interested.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. My questions will be entirely medically focused. We'll concentrate on your health history and any factors that might influence conception. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, please. I'm perfectly healthy. I cycle every day, I eat… adequately. Divorced men always complain I was too… rigorous with my health. But no, no diagnoses. I don’t have problems. Though, I did have a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back. But that's hardly a "condition". Is that what you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Shteynberg. It's good to hear you’re generally healthy and active. The flu is worth noting, thank you. Moving on, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Good heavens, no. I’m not the type to fall apart. One time, when I was a teenager, I had my wisdom teeth out. Does that count? It was… unpleasant, but hardly a hospitalization. It was an outpatient procedure. Honestly, all this feels very… unnecessary. Are you sure we can’t just… check things? Run some tests? This questioning feels like a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. Gathering a thorough history is a vital step before proceeding with any tests, ensuring we interpret the results accurately and efficiently. Wisdom teeth removal is good to know, thank you. Now, let's talk about your family medical history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—for example, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, family. A disaster, frankly. My mother… obsessed with doctors. Always something. Heart problems, I think. And my aunt had… some kind of nerve issue. Always complaining. Honestly, I try not to think about them too much. A lot of… drama. Is it absolutely necessary to dredge all this up? It's unpleasant. I barely speak to them.
DOCTOR: I understand that it's not pleasant to recall, Ms. Shteynberg. Knowing even a general history of heart problems or a nerve issue is helpful, as these conditions can sometimes have a genetic component. Don’t feel pressured to provide extensive details if you're uncomfortable, but any information you can recall would be appreciated. Just to confirm, would you say that you yourself have any allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Absolutely not. I'm Hungarian, you know. We're… robust. I eat everything. Paprika, of course. Garlic. Everything. I might get a slight sniffle sometimes, but that's the dust. I live in the city. Honestly, you’re asking me about allergies when I want to discuss making a healthy baby? It’s… baffling. Is this how all doctors operate? Just endless, pointless questions?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. We ask these questions to rule out any potential factors that might affect conception or pregnancy. No allergies noted, thank you. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Vitamins? Perhaps. Sometimes. A multivitamin. When I remember. I used to take calcium, but… I stopped. And I occasionally take ibuprofen for… aches. Cycling, you know. It's… strenuous. Honestly, nothing regular. I don't need medication. I'm perfectly capable. Is this getting anywhere? Or are we just cataloging my entire life at this point? Because frankly, it's a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the length of the questions, Ms. Shteynberg. Knowing what you take, even occasionally, is important. So, a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed, thank you. Now, before we consider any tests, I’d like to get a better understanding of your menstrual cycle. Could you tell me about its regularity?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're getting to the sensitive part, are we? Look, it’s… usually regular. Give or take a few days. Sometimes it’s a little early, sometimes a little late. It depends. I don't keep a detailed chart, if that's what you're expecting. I have a life! Honestly, it's not a scientific process. It just… happens. And frankly, it's been perfectly functional for decades. Are you implying there's something wrong with it? This is insulting.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Ms. Shteynberg. I'm simply gathering information to ensure we can provide you with the best possible care. Irregularity can sometimes indicate underlying issues, but "give or take a few days" is a common pattern. Given your age and desire to conceive, would you be open to a basic physical exam, including blood pressure, weight, and a general assessment?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Are you serious? I told you, I cycle every day. I am perfectly healthy. My weight is… acceptable. I don't need to be poked and prodded like some… invalid. I came here to discuss making a baby, not to have a general check-up. Honestly, this is a complete waste of my time. I think I've had enough. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg, and I apologize that the consultation hasn’t met your expectations. However, a basic physical exam is a standard part of a preconception assessment to ensure optimal health and safety. It allows me to get a baseline reading and identify any potential concerns that might affect your ability to conceive or carry a healthy pregnancy. While I respect your decision, I would strongly recommend reconsidering. Without a basic assessment, it's difficult to provide informed guidance. If you'd like to proceed with some initial blood work to assess hormone levels, that might be a good starting point. Alternatively, I can refer you to a specialist who can provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Regardless, I wish you the best in your journey to starting a family.
