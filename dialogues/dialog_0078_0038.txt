DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Buoniconti. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Honestly, it’s… a bit difficult to explain precisely. I understand I requested something regarding future care… an Advance Directive, perhaps? Or a POLST form? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was, and my office helped me schedule this appointment, but I don't recall all the details. It has to do with making sure my wishes are known, should… well, should something happen.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s very responsible of you to think ahead and plan for these things. Many people find it helpful to have these conversations and documents in place. It sounds like you're interested in discussing advance care planning – and you're right, that includes things like Advance Directives and POLST forms. To clarify, are you experiencing any current health concerns that prompted you to think about this now, or is this more of a proactive step?
PATIENT: Proactive, I believe. No… no specific concerns at the moment. It’s just… things happen, don’t they? And I want to ensure my… preferences are known. I was divorced some years ago, and my ex-husband isn’t… particularly close to me, so I don’t have anyone who automatically knows what I’d want. It’s probably best to be prepared, really. Though I confess, I’m not entirely sure what either of those forms entails.
DOCTOR: That's very sensible, Ms. Buoniconti. It's excellent that you're thinking about this while you're feeling well. And you're right to be prepared. Let’s break down those forms a bit. An Advance Directive is a general document outlining your wishes for healthcare if you’re unable to speak for yourself. It can include a Living Will, which specifies what treatments you want or don’t want, and a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, which names someone to make decisions on your behalf. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a more specific medical order, typically for people with serious illnesses, outlining what treatments you want right now. It's often used by emergency medical personnel. Before we get into the details of those forms, I’d like to understand a little bit about your overall health. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Please, proceed. My medical history… it’s fairly straightforward, I believe. I’ve always been… quite slender, as you can see. And generally healthy, though I haven’t seen a doctor regularly in… well, it’s been a few years. I work as an etcher, so I spend most of my time seated, which isn’t very active, I suppose. I do have private insurance, if that’s relevant. But beyond that… I don’t really have a long list of ailments to report. Perhaps I should mention I occasionally experience some… mild forgetfulness, as I alluded to earlier. But it's nothing debilitating.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Buoniconti. That’s helpful to know. It’s good you have private insurance; that will simplify things. And yes, it's relevant that you mentioned the occasional forgetfulness. We'll certainly keep that in mind. To get a clearer picture, let’s start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything… significant. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, of course – measles, mumps… but nothing lasting. I’ve never been hospitalized for anything major. I’ve had the occasional bout of the flu, naturally, and a sprained ankle once, but that was decades ago. I’ve always been… fortunate in that regard, I suppose. I really can’t recall any ongoing medical issues. Is it possible my previous physician sent records to you? It's been a while since I’ve seen a doctor, and I don't have easy access to those files.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Buoniconti. I'm checking the record now, and it appears we do have some information from your previous physician. Let me just pull it up… Okay, it looks like your last documented physical exam was approximately five years ago. The notes indicate generally good health, normal blood pressure and heart rate at that time. It does mention some mild seasonal allergies, and a note about occasional headaches, but nothing substantial. Now, just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason at all, even minor procedures?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see. No, I don’t believe so. No surgeries. I had my tonsils removed as a child, of course, but that was so long ago I barely remember it. And… no hospitalizations. Perhaps a brief overnight stay once when I was very young with a high fever, but it was nothing serious, and I was discharged the next morning. Truly, nothing significant. I’ve always been rather… robust, despite the occasional headache and allergy flare-up. And the forgetfulness, naturally. But nothing that required hospitalization or surgery. Is this a standard part of the process, Doctor? I just want to ensure I'm being thorough in my recollection.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Buoniconti, this is a standard part of the process. It’s important to have a complete picture of your medical history before discussing advance care planning. It helps us understand your overall health and any potential factors that might influence your wishes. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, or any other hereditary illnesses?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My parents… they both passed away some years ago. My mother, she died relatively young, I believe it was a heart condition, though I wasn’t particularly close to either of them, so I don’t have detailed information. My father… he suffered from what the doctors called “debility” in his later years, but I’m not certain what that entailed precisely. It wasn’t… Alzheimer’s, as far as I know, but he did become increasingly confused towards the end. And… there was an uncle, on my mother’s side, who died of cancer, lung cancer, I think. But beyond that… I don’t have a comprehensive knowledge of my family’s medical background. I’m afraid my family wasn’t… forthcoming with such details. Is it necessary to have a precise family history, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s common for people not to have a complete family history, especially if they weren't close to their relatives. Knowing what you do know is helpful, and we can work with that. The information about your mother's heart condition and your father's confusion are good to have. And it’s useful to know about your uncle’s lung cancer. Now, let’s talk a bit about your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on occasion, but that’s it. And recreational drugs… the very thought! No, I don’t engage in any such activities. I lead a rather quiet life, as I mentioned. I spend most of my time in my studio, etching and engraving. It’s a solitary pursuit, but I find it… fulfilling. I do enjoy the occasional social gathering with a few friends, but I’m not one for late nights or… excessive indulgence. Is that the sort of information you require, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Buoniconti, that is helpful to know. It gives me a better understanding of your lifestyle. And it's excellent that you lead a healthy and active life, even if it is a solitary one. Now, before we move on to discussing the Advance Directive and POLST form, let’s quickly review any allergies you may have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I do suffer from seasonal allergies, as I mentioned earlier. Pollen, primarily. It causes some… irritation, sneezing, a runny nose. Nothing debilitating, but certainly unpleasant. And… I believe I once had a reaction to penicillin, many years ago. It caused a rash, I think, but it was a mild reaction. Beyond that… no, I don’t believe I have any significant allergies. No food allergies, no insect allergies, no other medication allergies. I'm generally quite resilient, despite the seasonal sniffles and the long-ago rash. Is there anything else you need to know before we discuss those forms, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Buoniconti. Seasonal allergies and a past reaction to penicillin are helpful to document. Now that we've covered your medical, family, and social history, as well as any allergies, we can finally move on to discussing the Advance Directive and POLST form. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see. No, not currently. I haven’t taken any prescription medications in years. I occasionally take an over-the-counter antihistamine for my seasonal allergies, but that’s it. And no, I don’t take any supplements. I prefer to maintain my health through… a healthy lifestyle and a balanced diet. I believe in… natural remedies, as much as possible. I'm not one for relying on pills and potions. So, regarding those forms… perhaps you could explain them to me in a bit more detail? I'm still rather vague on the specifics.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s good that you’re asking questions – it’s important to fully understand these documents. As I mentioned earlier, an Advance Directive is a general document outlining your wishes for healthcare if you are unable to speak for yourself. It has two main parts. The first is a Living Will, which details what types of medical treatments you want or don’t want in specific situations – for example, whether you want life-sustaining treatment like a ventilator if you have a severe illness. The second part is a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, which names someone you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. A POLST form – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is different. It’s a medical order, usually for people with serious illnesses, outlining what treatments you want right now. It’s more specific and is often used by emergency medical personnel. Think of it as a set of instructions for your immediate care. Do you have any initial thoughts or preferences about either of these documents?
PATIENT: That… clarifies things somewhat, thank you, Doctor. The Advance Directive sounds… rather comprehensive. And the POLST form… more immediate, you said? I believe I would prefer the Advance Directive, at least initially. The thought of outlining specific treatments… it feels a bit premature, at this point. I'm relatively healthy, as we've established. The idea of naming someone to make decisions on my behalf… that is something I've been considering. I don’t have any close family members, as I mentioned. Perhaps a close friend… though I hesitate to burden them with such a responsibility. Would it be possible to amend the Advance Directive later, if my circumstances change? And what sort of legal requirements are involved in creating such a document?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ms. Buoniconti. It's very wise to think through these things carefully. Yes, absolutely, you can amend an Advance Directive at any time. It's not a static document. As your wishes or circumstances change, you can simply update it. Regarding legal requirements, the specifics vary slightly by state, but generally, an Advance Directive needs to be in writing, signed by you, and witnessed by at least two adults who are not your healthcare proxy or beneficiaries. It's also advisable to have it notarized, though that's not always required. The most important part is choosing a healthcare proxy – someone you trust completely to make decisions on your behalf and who understands your values and wishes. You can also include specific instructions about the types of treatment you want or don’t want. Would you like me to provide you with a copy of the Advance Directive form and a list of resources to help you choose a healthcare proxy and understand the legal requirements in our state?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be most helpful. A copy of the form and a list of resources… that sounds excellent. I suppose I should also consider who might be suitable as a healthcare proxy. A close friend, perhaps… though I worry about imposing such a burden on them. This is… a lot to think about. Before we proceed, Doctor, I must confess… I occasionally experience moments of… forgetfulness. Would it be helpful to have someone accompany me when I fill out the form, to ensure I’m fully understanding the implications? It’s just… I wouldn't want to make any rash decisions or overlook any important details. It's a rather crucial document, after all.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible idea, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s perfectly reasonable to have someone accompany you – especially given your occasional forgetfulness. It's always best to have a second set of eyes and ears to ensure you’re fully informed and comfortable with your decisions. I can absolutely provide you with the form and resources, and I would strongly recommend having someone with you when you complete it. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss it once it’s completed, if you’d like. Would you like me to print out the form and resources now, and we can also talk about some potential healthcare proxy candidates?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be most appreciated. Printing the form and resources… and discussing potential candidates… that sounds excellent. I do have a few friends who I believe might be suitable, though I haven’t spoken to them about this yet. Perhaps you could provide me with some guidelines for choosing a healthcare proxy? What qualities are most important? What questions should I ask them? I feel… somewhat overwhelmed, but I’m grateful for your assistance.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed – these are important decisions, and it’s good you’re taking the time to think them through carefully. Here are some guidelines for choosing a healthcare proxy. The most important qualities are trustworthiness, reliability, and a genuine understanding of your values and wishes. They should be able to advocate for your best interests, even if it means disagreeing with others. It’s also important that they are comfortable discussing healthcare issues and making difficult decisions. Here are some questions you can ask potential candidates: “Are you comfortable making healthcare decisions on my behalf if I’m unable to do so myself?
PATIENT: That… is helpful, thank you, Doctor. Trustworthiness and reliability… those are certainly paramount. And a genuine understanding of my values… That’s something I hadn’t fully considered. I suppose I should also ask them about their own healthcare preferences, to gauge their level of comfort with these types of issues. I believe I have a good candidate in mind – a friend named Elara. She is… quite sensible and has always been a good listener. I’ll need to speak to her first, of course, to ensure she’s willing and able to take on this responsibility. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I proceed, Doctor? Any potential pitfalls or challenges I should anticipate?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Buoniconti. Elara sounds like a promising candidate. It’s a very good idea to discuss her own healthcare preferences as well – that can give you a sense of her values and how she approaches these types of issues. Regarding potential pitfalls or challenges, one thing to be aware of is the possibility of disagreements among family members or friends. It’s important to have a clear and open conversation with your healthcare proxy about your wishes and to document them in the Advance Directive. Another challenge can be the difficulty of predicting future medical situations. It’s impossible to anticipate every scenario, so it’s important to choose a healthcare proxy who is able to think critically and make sound decisions in unpredictable circumstances. Finally, remember that you can change your healthcare proxy at any time. It’s not a permanent decision, and you should feel comfortable revisiting it if your circumstances change. Do you have any further questions at this point, Ms. Buoniconti?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers most of my immediate concerns, Doctor. You’ve been most helpful. I’ll speak to Elara and then review the form at my own pace. I think I’m ready to proceed on my own for now, but I appreciate your offer of a follow-up appointment. Perhaps I’ll schedule that once I’ve completed the form. Thank you again for your patience and assistance. I believe I’ll take my leave now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. And please, take your time with the form – there’s no rush. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a wonderful day, and please give Elara my best.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. And I shall certainly pass on your regards to Elara.
