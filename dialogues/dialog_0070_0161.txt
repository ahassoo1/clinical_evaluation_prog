DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Helaina. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I come talk to someone about…well, preventing HIV. She said there’s a pill you can take, and I figured it couldn’t hurt to learn more. It's… a bit of a sensitive topic, but I'm glad I’m here.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Helaina. It’s good of you to come in and discuss this. There’s absolutely no shame in being proactive about your health, and preventative measures are always a good idea. Your friend is correct – there is a medication called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, that’s very effective at preventing HIV. To make sure PrEP is right for you, and to determine the best course of action, I’m going to ask you a few questions, if that’s alright. We’ll cover some medical history, lifestyle factors, and things like that. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you need to know. I just want to get this sorted out, if it's possible. Ask away. I don’t have any secrets, really. Though… my memory isn’t what it used to be, so if I forget something, please just remind me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Helaina. That’s perfectly alright. I'm happy to repeat anything or prompt your memory if needed. We’ll take it at a comfortable pace. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, nothing major. I had a bit of arthritis in my knees a few years back, but that's managed with some cream and exercise. And… oh! I had a really bad bout of the flu last winter, but that cleared up on its own. Otherwise…no. I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. I try to walk every day. Does that count for something?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely counts for something, Helaina. Staying active is wonderful. The arthritis is good to know, and the flu last winter too. Just routine information. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That was… oh, goodness, almost sixty years ago! And… I had a small cyst removed from my arm a few years back. Nothing serious, just a little bump the doctor didn’t like the look of. Other than that…no, I think that’s it. I've been lucky, really. I mostly avoid doctors if I can.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Helaina. Avoiding major surgeries is certainly a blessing. And I understand not wanting to be in the doctor’s office any more than necessary. Now, thinking about your family…are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That's a bit complicated. My mother had… well, she had some heart trouble later in life. High blood pressure, too. And my father… he had diabetes. But honestly, we weren't very close, and I don't know much about the rest of the family history. My siblings… we lost touch a long time ago. So, not much to go on there, I'm afraid. Sorry. Is that helpful at all?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Helaina. Family history can be difficult to trace, and you’ve given me what you know, which is very helpful. Knowing about your mother’s heart trouble and your father’s diabetes is useful information. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even tried it, really. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and I just…never felt the need. Always hated the smell. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though. Just one. Maybe two if it's a special occasion. Is that…bad? I don’t drink every day.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Helaina. Occasional, moderate alcohol consumption is generally not a concern. Just good to know. And how about recreational drug use?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. Never have, never will. I... I've never been one for any of that. Not my cup of tea at all. I prefer a good book and a quiet evening. Honestly, Doctor, you're starting to make me feel like a terrible person with all these questions. I'm a perfectly respectable woman!
DOCTOR: Oh, not at all, Helaina! I apologize if my questions came across that way. These are simply standard inquiries to get a complete picture of your health. I assure you, I’m not making any judgments whatsoever. You sound like a very responsible and thoughtful person. Now, one final question in this section. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think… No, I don't think so. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes if I eat too many strawberries, but that's not a real allergy, is it? And I can't take penicillin—I had a really bad reaction to it as a child, years ago. I think I swelled up like a balloon! Other than that...no, I don't think so. I've been pretty lucky with allergies, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the penicillin allergy – that's important. And the strawberry sensitivity is good to be aware of, even if it's not a severe allergy. Now, Helaina, to assess if PrEP is the right option for you, I need to ask some questions about your sexual history. This is confidential, of course, and I understand it may be sensitive. Are you comfortable discussing this with me?
PATIENT: Well… that’s… that’s what my friend mentioned would be coming up. It’s… a bit embarrassing, to be honest. But… yes. I suppose I’m comfortable enough. Just… try to be gentle, please. It's not something I've talked about with anyone before. It’s just… complicated.
DOCTOR: Of course, Helaina. I completely understand. There’s absolutely no judgment here, and I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. You are in a safe and confidential setting. We only need to discuss what you are comfortable sharing. To start, are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes… I am. Though, it's… not regular, if that makes sense. I've been seeing someone… on and off… for a few months now. We don’t… well, we don't live together. It’s… complicated, as I said. Is that enough information? I feel a bit silly talking about this.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Helaina. It’s helpful to know that you're sexually active, and that it's not a consistent, long-term relationship. Knowing it's not a regular partnership is relevant information. What types of sexual activity do you engage in with your partner?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Well… mostly just… intimacy. Kissing, cuddling… that sort of thing. And… sometimes, sexual intercourse. But it’s always…protected. We use condoms, always. My partner… is also very careful. That’s… why I’m a bit confused about needing this pill, to be honest. I thought condoms were enough.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Helaina. And it's excellent that you and your partner are already using condoms—that's a very responsible practice and significantly reduces risk. However, condoms aren’t 100% effective, and they don’t protect against all sexually transmitted infections. PrEP provides an additional layer of protection, even when used correctly with condoms. It's a very effective way to prevent HIV, and it can give you peace of mind. Now, I'm going to ask a few more questions to assess your risk factors and determine if PrEP is right for you. Do you know your partner’s HIV status?
PATIENT: That's… a difficult question. We haven't… specifically discussed it, to be honest. It's… awkward. We both have been… with others, in the past, before we met. So… I don’t know. That’s why my friend suggested I come here. She said it's better to be safe than sorry, especially given… everything. Is it bad that we haven't talked about it? It just… never came up.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad that you haven't discussed it, Helaina, but it is a significant risk factor. It’s understandable that it's an awkward conversation, but knowing your partner's HIV status is very important. It’s good you’re recognizing that. To proceed, I recommend getting tested for HIV, if you haven’t been recently. And I strongly advise discussing HIV testing with your partner. I can provide resources and guidance on how to have that conversation, if you’d like. Now, let's move on to a physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. We'll also need to draw some blood to check your kidney function and screen for any other underlying health conditions. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…fine. Whatever needs to be done. I just want to get this sorted out. The testing sounds sensible. And honestly, if you have any advice on how to talk to him… I would be very grateful. He’s… a bit sensitive, to put it mildly. A delicate flower, you could say. A very handsome delicate flower, but… still. So yes, please. Blood tests and… talking tips. That would be wonderful.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Helaina. We can absolutely discuss strategies for talking to your partner. First, let's do the physical exam. It will just take a few moments. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is slightly elevated, but not concerning at this time. We'll keep an eye on it. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I just need to draw some blood. It will be a quick pinch. Alright, that's all done. The lab results should be available in a few days. Now, about talking to your partner… The key is to approach the conversation with honesty, openness, and empathy. Choose a private and relaxed setting where you both feel comfortable. Start by expressing your care for him and your desire to protect both of your health. Avoid accusatory language and focus on the importance of knowing each other’s status. Would you like me to provide you with some specific phrases or resources to help facilitate the conversation?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Specific phrases would be amazing. I… I'm terrible at this sort of thing. I tend to ramble and then say the wrong thing. Anything you can give me would be a lifesaver. And… maybe a gentle script? I’m honestly dreading it, but I know it’s the right thing to do. If you have any pamphlets, or website links… anything, really. I'm grasping at straws here.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Helaina. I completely understand your anxiety. It's perfectly normal to feel nervous about a conversation like this. Here are a few phrases you can use: “I was thinking about our sexual health and wanted to talk about getting tested for STIs. It's important to me that we both know our status so we can protect each other.” “I’ve been doing some research on HIV prevention and learned about PrEP. I wanted to discuss it with you and see what you think.” “I care about you a lot and want to make sure we’re both as safe as possible. Getting tested and talking openly about our health is a way to show that.” “It’s okay if you’re uncomfortable talking about this, but I think it’s important to have an open conversation. We can always take a break if you need to.” I'm also printing out a pamphlet from the CDC about talking to your partner about STIs. And here's a link to a website with more resources and tips: [https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/talking-partner.htm] Remember, it’s important to listen to his concerns and validate his feelings. If he’s hesitant, try to understand his reasons and address them with empathy. If he's resistant, you could suggest getting tested separately and sharing the results with each other. While we wait for your lab results, I can also write a referral for an HIV test at a local clinic if you’d like. And if you’d like, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your results and any further questions you may have. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That’s… wonderful. Thank you, Doctor. Truly. This is more help than I could have hoped for. The phrases are perfect – I might actually be able to say those without rambling. And the link is incredibly helpful. Yes, a referral for a test would be brilliant, thank you. And yes, a follow-up appointment… definitely. I… I feel a little bit better now, actually. A lot less panicked. Thank you. You’ve been very kind. And… patient. I think that’s everything for today, isn’t it? I should probably go… before I start crying. It’s been a long morning.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. I'm glad I could help, and it’s perfectly alright to feel emotional. It takes courage to address these concerns, and you’ve already taken a huge step forward. Here’s the referral information. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or need further assistance. And yes, I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week to discuss your results. It was a pleasure meeting you, Helaina. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all.
