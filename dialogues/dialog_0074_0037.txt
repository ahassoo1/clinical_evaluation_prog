DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um, I have been… how you say… making a whistling sound when I breathe. It worries me a little. It has been happening for… maybe a week now?
DOCTOR: Okay, a whistling sound when you breathe for about a week. I understand. That can be concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the whistling sound a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm. It is… not always there. When I walk quickly, it happens. And sometimes when I try to sleep, I hear it. It’s like… a small tea kettle, maybe? But inside my chest. It does not hurt, but it is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: A small tea kettle, inside your chest… That’s a very helpful description, thank you. So, it happens with exertion – when you walk quickly – and sometimes at night when you're trying to sleep. And you haven't experienced any pain with it, just the sound itself. Is it constant when you’re walking quickly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. When I stop walking, it usually stops. And if I sit for a little bit, it gets better. It doesn’t happen every time I walk, just… when I push myself a little too hard, maybe? I still like to go for walks, you see. I used to be an… athletic trainer. So I am used to being active.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Mrs. Kilton. So it seems to be linked to your activity level – occurring when you exert yourself and improving with rest. And your history as an athletic trainer is helpful to know – that suggests a good baseline level of fitness. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the whistling sound?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes, I feel a little… breathless. Not short of breath, exactly. Just… like I cannot get enough air. But it is not always. And it happens even when I am not walking quickly. Just… sometimes. And I cough a little bit more than usual, maybe? Not a bad cough, just… a tickle in my throat.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional breathlessness, even at rest, and a bit of a tickle in your throat with a slight increase in coughing. That’s good to know. Have you had a fever, chills, or any chest pain at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. And no chills. The chest does not hurt, no. It is just… uncomfortable sometimes, when the whistling is loud. Like something is tight. But not painful, you understand? I am just… a little worried. I do not want it to be something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mrs. Kilton. It's good that you're not experiencing fever or chest pain, and I appreciate you clarifying that the discomfort is more of a tightness rather than pain. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs with my stethoscope, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Please, go ahead. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Kilton. That’s very kind of you. Okay, take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… in… and out. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be due to talking, and your blood pressure is within a normal range. Your throat looks clear, no significant redness or swelling. When I listen to your lungs, I can hear some wheezing, particularly when you exhale. That aligns with the whistling sound you described. It doesn't sound severe, but it does suggest some narrowing of the airways. Do you have any history of asthma, bronchitis, or COPD?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never been told I have any of those things. I have always been… quite healthy, actually. Even now, I still try to stay active. I did have pneumonia when I was a young woman, a very long time ago. But that was many, many years ago. It was not serious, I do not think. I recovered fully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of asthma, bronchitis or COPD, but you did have pneumonia a long time ago. That's good information to have. Given your symptoms and what I heard during the exam, it’s possible this could be related to some mild airway inflammation or narrowing. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a simple blood test to check for any signs of infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you need to find out what is happening. An X-ray and a blood test, yes. Is there anything I should do… before the tests? Or after? Should I stop walking for a little while? I do not want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: That's a good question, Mrs. Kilton. No, there's nothing specific you need to do to prepare for the tests. And I wouldn’t necessarily advise stopping walking altogether, but I would recommend reducing the intensity of your activity for a few days, just until we have the results back. Listen to your body, and if you feel any breathlessness or discomfort, stop and rest. I’ll write the orders for the X-ray and blood test now. The receptionist will schedule the X-ray for you, and we can draw the blood here in the clinic today. It will only take a few minutes. Do you have any allergies to medications, or are you currently taking any prescriptions or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not have any allergies. And I do not take any medications. Not regularly, anyway. Sometimes, if my knees bother me, I take a little bit of ibuprofen. But that is all. Just when I need it. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I prefer to stay active and keep moving, that is better for me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mrs. Kilton. So, no regular medications, just ibuprofen occasionally for knee pain. We’ll avoid prescribing anything unless absolutely necessary. Okay, I’ve ordered the X-ray and blood tests. The results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. Once we have those results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, please just reduce your activity level, listen to your body, and let me know if your symptoms worsen. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly. I will try to rest a little more, and I will listen to my body. I trust you to take good care of me. Thank you for seeing me today.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. I’m glad I could help. I appreciate you coming in, and I’ll be in touch as soon as we have the test results. The receptionist will help you schedule the X-ray and draw your blood. If anything changes or if you feel significantly worse before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, and please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
