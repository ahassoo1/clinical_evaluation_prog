DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Stilaire. It's a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Stilaire. It is a pleasure to meet you also. I am here because… well, my ear. It is having… a liquid come out of it. For some time now, maybe two weeks. It is… not comfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. A liquid discharge from your ear for approximately two weeks, and it's causing you discomfort. That certainly warrants a closer look. Could you describe the liquid for me?
PATIENT: Yes, warrants a look. Good. The liquid… it is clear, mostly. Sometimes a little… yellowish, but not often. Not a lot comes out, usually just when I touch around my ear. And it does not smell, I think. I try to be careful. It is on this ear, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Radillo. Clear discharge, occasionally yellowish, minimal amount, and no noticeable odor – all helpful information. And you've indicated it's your left ear that's affected. To get a clearer picture, may I ask if you've experienced any other symptoms alongside the discharge?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Other… things. My ear feels… full, sometimes. Like water is inside, even when it is not. And a little… ringing. Not loud, but… it is there. Always a little bit. It does not stop. Also, maybe I do not hear as well on that ear. It is hard to say, but sounds are… softer. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Radillo. A feeling of fullness, constant ringing – tinnitus, as we call it – and a perceived decrease in hearing on the left side. These symptoms, combined with the discharge, are certainly giving us a clearer picture. Now, have you had any pain associated with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain. Not at all. That is good, yes? It is just… annoying. The ringing mostly. And not hearing well is… concerning. I need to hear well for my work. I am a teacher.
DOCTOR: That is good that you haven’t experienced any pain. And I completely understand your concern about the hearing, especially given your profession as a teacher. It’s vital you have optimal hearing for your work. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever had any ear infections, or any problems with your ears in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I had… an infection, when I was a young man. In Somalia. A long time ago. I was very sick. The doctor… gave me some medicine, and it got better. I do not remember much, to be honest. It was many years ago. Since then, no problems with ears until now.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Radillo. A childhood ear infection, treated successfully – good to know. And no other ear issues since then until now. Now, regarding your overall medical history, do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No diabetes. No problems with blood pressure. My heart is… okay, I think. The doctor checks it every year at the hospital. He says it is… strong, but I am not a doctor. I take one pill for my… cholesterol, but that is all. Otherwise, I am healthy, I believe.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Mr. Radillo. Annual check-ups and a healthy heart are excellent. Just the one medication for cholesterol, otherwise in good health. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Only the pill for cholesterol. I do not take vitamins. I eat fruit, I think that is enough. My wife used to make me take many pills, but… we are divorced now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Just the cholesterol medication then. Before we proceed with a physical examination of your ear, I’d like to quickly ask about any allergies you may have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I do not think so. I eat many things. I have never had a reaction. I am… careful with foods, but I do not have a list of things to avoid. No problems with pollen, or animals, or anything like that. I am very lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent news, Mr. Radillo. No known allergies are always helpful. Now, with your permission, I’d like to examine your ears. I will use an otoscope to look inside your ear canal and assess the condition of your eardrum. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Look at my ear. I want to know what is happening. Not painful is good. I trust you. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you for your trust, Mr. Radillo. Just relax and let me know if you feel any discomfort. Alright. What I’m seeing is some cerumen – that’s earwax – present, and a slight redness of the ear canal. The eardrum itself appears slightly inflamed, and I can see some fluid behind it. I cannot definitively diagnose anything at this point, but this presentation is consistent with a middle ear infection, also known as otitis media, or possibly, given the discharge, a perforated eardrum. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs briefly, and then we can discuss potential next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… okay. Middle ear… infection. And perforated… what did you say? Fluid, and redness. It all sounds… bad. But I trust you. What next steps? Do I need… more pills? I hope not too many. What does perforated mean? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be concerned, Mr. Radillo. "Perforated" simply means there is a small hole or tear in your eardrum. It isn’t necessarily serious, and often heals on its own, but it can increase the risk of infection. Before we discuss treatment options, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to rule out any other contributing factors. It will only take a minute. Alright, everything sounds clear there. Now, in your case, given the fluid behind the eardrum, the discharge, and the inflammation, I believe we need to order some further testing to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of action. I recommend a tympanometry and audiometry to assess your middle ear function and hearing levels. And I will also send a sample of the discharge to the lab for culture to identify if there is a bacterial infection present. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Testing sounds… good. I want to know what is happening. Tympanometry… and… audiometry. And the sample. Culture. I will do what you say. But… will it hurt? And how long will it take? And will I need… many visits to the hospital?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Radillo. I understand your concerns. Let me address those for you. The tympanometry and audiometry are both non-invasive tests and shouldn’t cause you any discomfort at all. Tympanometry involves a small probe being placed in your ear to measure the movement of your eardrum, and audiometry is a simple hearing test where you listen to tones through headphones. As for the sample, I will collect a small amount of the discharge from your ear. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it’s very quick and shouldn’t cause any lasting pain. The tests can be scheduled at the hospital's audiology department and should take approximately one hour to complete. I don’t anticipate you needing multiple visits to the hospital, unless the results require further investigation. We will review the results together once they are available, and I will formulate a treatment plan that is tailored to your needs. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid getting water in your ear, and refrain from using any ear drops or cleaning agents. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No water. No drops. I understand. One hour. That is… okay. But… what if it is bad? What if I need… surgery?
DOCTOR: That’s a valid concern, Mr. Radillo, and it’s important to address it. While surgery is possible in some cases of severe middle ear infection or perforated eardrum, it is not the typical course of action. The vast majority of cases resolve with antibiotics, or sometimes, simply with time and careful monitoring. We won’t discuss surgery until we have the results of the tests and a clearer understanding of the severity of your condition. Right now, it's important to focus on gathering information. I want to emphasize that we will proceed step-by-step, and I will explain all of your options to you thoroughly. Do you feel comfortable with that approach?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Step-by-step. That sounds… better. I trust you. I will do the tests. Can… someone help me schedule them? I am not good with computers. And the hospital is… very large.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Radillo. I completely understand. My nursing assistant, Sarah, will be happy to help you schedule the tests. She’s very familiar with the hospital system and can guide you through the process. She will also provide you with clear directions to the audiology department. Let me write a note for her now, and she will be in shortly to assist you. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all. Thank you for… explaining everything. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. It’s my pleasure to help. Remember, we will proceed step-by-step, and I will be here to answer any questions you may have along the way. Sarah will be with you shortly. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you need anything at all. .
