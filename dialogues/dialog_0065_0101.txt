DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Call me Aldine, please. Well, I’ve been havin’ this headache, right at the back o’ me head. Been botherin’ me for a few days now. Not a terrible pain, more like a… a dull ache, you know? It just sits there.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, you say. And for how many days exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe Tuesday? So, three days now, I reckon. Tuesday afternoon, I was workin’ on Mrs. Henderson’s nails – she likes a bright red, that one – and that’s when I first noticed it. Just a little niggle, at first. Now it’s… well, still just a niggle, but a constant one. It hasn’t gotten worse, exactly, just… there.
DOCTOR: And does anything make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Not that I’ve noticed, really. Lyin’ down doesn’t seem to do much. Havin’ a cup o’ tea helps with most things, but this headache… it’s just there whether I’m relaxin’ or workin’. I tried a little liniment on me neck, thought it might be muscle tension, but no luck. Workin’ doesn’t make it worse, thankfully, or I’d be in trouble! I gotta keep workin’, you know? Bills don’t pay themselves.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from this headache, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No fever, no dizziness. No blurry vision or nothin’ like that. I haven't felt nauseous, thankfully. I've been sleepin' alright, maybe a little restless, but nothin’ major. Just… tired, you know? Old age, probably. But the headache is new. I haven't bumped me head or anythin’ like that either, if that’s what you’re thinkin’. I’m pretty careful, always have been.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications for any other conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. I get a little arthritis in me hands sometimes, from all the nail work, but I just rub some cream on it. Nothing you need to write down. I try to stay healthy, eat me fruits and vegetables, get a good night’s sleep when I can. Don't like takin' pills if I can help it. They always have side effects, don't they?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, such as food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've eaten everything put in front of me, pretty much, and never had a reaction. I’m not one for fancy foods, mind you, mostly just Jamaican cooking. And I haven't got any allergies to dust or pollen or anythin’ like that. I spend most o’ me time indoors, so I don’t get much exposure, anyway. Never had a problem with bees or wasps, thankfully. They scare me silly!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. I’m going to need to do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I’ll do a neurological exam – that just means I’ll check your reflexes and see how you’re moving. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Go ahead. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if anythin’ feels… strange. I’m not a fan of needles, mind you, but I’ll manage. I've lived a long life, seen a few doctors!
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, if you could just follow my finger with your eyes… don’t strain yourself. Just look at my finger as I move it around. Good. No nystagmus. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Right, squeezin’ hands… There. Is that alright? I try to keep me hands strong for the nail work, you see. It’s important to have a good grip. But arthritis… it makes things difficult sometimes.
DOCTOR: Good strength in your hands, actually. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in... and out... again... and again. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion in your neck. Just turn your head slowly to the right… and to the left… good. Now, chin to chest… and look up to the ceiling. No significant pain with range of motion.
PATIENT: Alright, turnin’ me head… not bad for an old man, eh? I do get a bit of a crick in me neck sometimes, from bendin’ over the nail tables all day. But it usually works itself out. I haven't felt any sharp pain, thankfully. Just a stiffness, really. Is that all, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the physical exam and your history, it's likely this is a tension headache, possibly related to muscle strain in your neck and shoulders. However, given your age, and the fact that it’s a new symptom, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel just to rule out any underlying issues. We'll also do a TSH to check your thyroid function. I'll have the lab draw some blood now. I’ll need you to fast for eight hours before the test, so schedule it for tomorrow morning.
PATIENT: Fasting, eh? Eight hours… hmm. That’ll mean no breakfast. Alright, Doctor. If you think it’s best. A bit o’ blood never hurt anyone, I suppose. And you think it's just tension? That’s a relief, to be honest. I was worried it might be somethin’ serious. When can I get this blood work done? And where? I don’t drive anymore, so I’ll need to get a ride.
DOCTOR: The lab is located right across the hall, room 203. They take appointments, but walk-ins are usually accepted. I’ll print out a requisition form for you with the specific tests. I recommend scheduling an appointment to avoid a long wait. And I’m prescribing a mild muscle relaxant, cyclobenzaprine, to help with the tension. It's a low dose. Take one tablet at bedtime. If the headache doesn't improve within a week, or if it worsens, you’ll need to schedule a follow-up appointment. And if you develop any new symptoms – fever, vision changes, weakness – seek medical attention immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Right, room 203. Walk-in, but appointment better. Muscle relaxant… cyclobenzaprine. One at bedtime. Yes, Doctor, I understand. A week to see if it gets better. And if it gets worse, or new things happen… I come back. Or… go to the hospital? I understand. Thank you. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you takin’ the time to look at me. Old folks get overlooked sometimes, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Just remember to follow the instructions. And please, don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention if needed. That will be all. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Right, I will. Thank you again, Doctor. You too. And… thank you for not dismissin’ me. .
