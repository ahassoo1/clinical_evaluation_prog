DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Annesley. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Lason is fine. My wife, she insisted I come. Says I’ve been…forgetful. Though I don’t see it. It’s just…little things. Little moments where I…well, I don’t know. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like I’m losing my mind, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It's very common for changes to be subtle at first, and it's good your wife is looking out for you. It's also perfectly alright to feel frustrated when trying to pinpoint these things. "Little things" are often the most important clues. To help me get a better understanding, could you give me some examples of these “little things” you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Examples? Hmph. Well…last week, I went to get tile for Mrs. Kim’s bathroom, right? Been doing work for her for years. I always get the same kind, the speckled grey one. But I came home with…white. White, Doctor! Can you believe it? Mrs. Kim nearly had a fit. Said it would ruin the whole aesthetic. I just…don’t know how I picked the wrong one. And then…a few days ago, I was making my coffee, same as always, and I…I couldn’t remember where I put the cinnamon. Cinnamon, Doctor! It’s on the spice rack, where it always is. It was just…gone from my head.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason. Those are helpful examples, thank you. Getting the wrong tile and momentarily forgetting where the cinnamon is… those could be simple slips, but we need to explore this further. Just to clarify, have you noticed any other changes in your memory, besides these specific instances?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? You’re asking a lot of…vague questions, Doctor. Look, I’m a tile setter. I work with my hands. I don’t sit around thinking about…memory. But…now that you mention it… sometimes I struggle with names. Not people I see all the time, mind you. More…acquaintances. People I met at the temple, maybe. Or at the market. I know their face, I just…the name won’t come. It’s embarrassing, honestly. I just smile and nod and hope they don’t expect me to remember.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It is frustrating when things don't come as easily as they once did. And it's perfectly normal to feel embarrassed in those situations. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty recalling names, specifically with people you don't see frequently. That's a relevant detail. To get a broader picture, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? Well, I’m…sturdy. Always been a hard worker. Never been one for sitting still. I eat alright, mostly Cambodian food, my wife is a good cook. A little bit of sugar, I admit, but who doesn’t like something sweet? I haven't been to the doctor in…years, truthfully. Don't see much point, unless something’s broken. My wife makes me go for my blood pressure, every six months or so. It’s…fine. They say it’s a little high, but nothing to worry about, they say. I take a small pill for it. That’s it, really. No other illnesses.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason, that’s helpful. So, generally good health, Cambodian diet, a little bit of sugar, and you take medication for high blood pressure. And your blood pressure has been stable with medication?
PATIENT: Stable enough, I suppose. The doctor, the previous one, he always said “keep an eye on it.” Which I do. Sort of. My wife mostly keeps an eye on it. She’s very…diligent. She checks my numbers every morning, makes sure I take my pill. She fusses, you know? Always has. I just want to get this over with. I have a job to finish by the end of the week. Mrs. Kim is a good customer, and I don’t want to disappoint her.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Just a few more questions, if you don't mind. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife tried to get me to eat more vegetables when we were younger, said it would “build my immune system.” I didn’t like them then, and I don’t like them now. She tried a lot of things, bless her heart. I can eat anything. Except maybe those really spicy peppers. Those are just…unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, and a preference for less spicy peppers. Good to know. Now, have you had any significant medical procedures or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Hmm…let me think. When I was a boy, back in Cambodia, I had a bad infection in my leg. A cut from working in the rice fields, got infected. They had to…clean it out. It was a long time ago. I don't remember much. After that…no. Nothing major. Broken a few bones over the years, fixing tile is hard work, but nothing that required a hospital stay. Just a cast and a lot of complaining.
DOCTOR: Okay, a childhood infection that required cleaning, and some broken bones from work. Thank you for sharing that. Finally, is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – who has experienced memory problems, dementia, or any similar condition?
PATIENT: Hmm…family. My mother…she got a little confused towards the end. She lived a long life, back in Cambodia. She forgot things, mostly names and dates. My wife says it was just old age. My father was…strong. Always remembered everything. A very practical man. No one else, not that I know of. My siblings, they all died young. It was…a difficult time.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Lason. That’s helpful information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical and cognitive exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve some basic tests of your memory, attention, and other cognitive functions. It's nothing to be worried about, just a way to get a better understanding of what's going on. It will also include checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I really need to get back to work. But…yes. Do it. Just…try to be quick, Doctor. Mrs. Kim is expecting me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90 today. That's slightly elevated, but consistent with your usual readings. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Okay, now let’s move on to a few simple cognitive tests. I’m going to ask you to repeat three words. Please listen carefully: Apple, Table, Penny. Can you repeat them back to me?
PATIENT: Apple…Table…Penny. There. Done. What now? This feels…unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to ask you to count backwards from 100 by sevens.
PATIENT: One hundred… ninety-three… eighty-six… seventy-nine… seventy-two… sixty-five… sixty…wait. What was I doing? Oh. By sevens. Sixty…um…fifty-three? No. Fifty-four? This is… ridiculous. My brain isn't a calculator, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Lason. It's a challenging task, and many people find it difficult. Now, I’m going to ask you to draw a clock, showing the time at 2:30. Please include all the numbers. I’ll give you a piece of paper and a pen.
PATIENT: There. Happy? It's a clock. Shows the time. Sort of. I'm a tile setter, not an artist!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. That’s very helpful. Based on the information you’ve provided, the physical exam, and the cognitive assessment, it appears you’re experiencing some difficulties with recent memory, attention, and visuospatial skills. The challenges with recalling names, the mistakes with counting backwards, and the slightly distorted clock drawing are all suggestive of possible mild cognitive impairment. However, it’s important to remember that these tests are just a starting point. There are many potential causes for these symptoms, including normal aging, medication side effects, stress, or other underlying medical conditions. To get a more definitive diagnosis, I recommend we order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical causes, and consider a brain scan, like an MRI, to get a better look at your brain structure. Would you be open to those next steps?
PATIENT: Blood tests…a brain scan…more waiting…more poking and prodding… Honestly, Doctor, this is all very… unsettling. I just want to get back to work. But… my wife…she would insist. She's always worried. And I suppose if it puts her mind at ease… yes. Do the tests. But please, Doctor, try to be quick about it. I have tiles to lay.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Lason. I’ll expedite the orders as much as possible. I’ll also provide a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation after the tests are completed. Let’s start with the blood tests. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, vitamin B12 levels, and a thyroid panel. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to draw the blood right away. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a mild memory aid, donepezil. It can sometimes help improve cognitive function, but it's important to remember that it's not a cure, and it doesn’t work for everyone. We’ll see how you respond to it. I'll also give you some written instructions outlining the potential side effects and important precautions. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Donepezil…more pills… side effects… It's just…a lot to take in. No. No questions right now. Just…tell me when I can get the blood tests done. And please, make sure this neurologist… is someone quick. I really need to get back to my life, Doctor. I'm a working man.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Lason. I understand. The lab is right down the hall, room 102. They're expecting you. And I'll ensure the neurologist I refer you to is efficient and thorough. I'm providing you with a printed summary of today’s consultation, the prescription for donepezil, and the lab requisition. It also includes a list of resources for patients with memory concerns and their families. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss the lab results and your response to the medication. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms or have any questions, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just…thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I'll go get the blood tests done. And…I'll see you in two weeks. Tell your staff…thank you for being quick.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lason. We’ll do our best to take care of you. And I’ll be sure to pass on your thanks to the staff. Take care on your way out. If you think of anything, don't hesitate to call. .
