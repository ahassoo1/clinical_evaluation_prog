DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Popova, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Aldine Popova. But everyone just calls me Aldine. Good to meet you, Doctor… Dechêne, is it? I hope I’m pronouncing that right.
DOCTOR: It’s fine. Look, I have several patients waiting, so if we could get straight to the point, that would be appreciated. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Sorry, didn’t mean to ramble. It’s this headache, see? Right at the back of my head. Been bothering me for… well, a few days now, I suppose. Not constant, comes and goes. It's a dull ache, mostly. Nothing terrible, but enough to make me feel a bit off.
DOCTOR: A few days, you say. And you describe it as a dull ache at the back of the head. Any associated symptoms?
PATIENT: Associated symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No nausea, thankfully. No dizziness. And my vision seems alright, I can see just fine. Sometimes, when it’s really bad, my neck feels a little stiff, but that could just be from sleeping funny. I haven't noticed anything else, really. Just the headache. Though… now that you mention it, I have been a bit more tired than usual, but I figured that was just my age catching up with me!
DOCTOR: Tiredness is…common. And neck stiffness. Alright. Have you tried anything for it?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I did. My wife, bless her heart, she gave me some of those over-the-counter pain relievers, you know, the ones for headaches. Acetaminophen, I think it was called? Didn’t really do much, to be honest. Maybe took the edge off for a little while, but it always came back. I figured it was worth a try before bothering you, Doctor. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Acetaminophen, ineffective. Any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let's see... I’ve got a bit of arthritis in my hands, that's why I mostly do manicures and pedicures these days, easier on the joints. It flares up sometimes, but nothing serious. And my blood pressure’s usually a little high, but I try to watch my salt intake. My wife keeps a close eye on me for that one. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy for an old man, if I do say so myself!
DOCTOR: Arthritis and hypertension, managed. Any family history of headaches or neurological problems?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… My mother, she used to get terrible migraines, awful things. Spent days in bed with them. And my brother, he had something with his head a long time ago, a real bad one, needed some special tests… can’t recall exactly what it was though, it was many years ago. I don't think either of them ever really got a proper diagnosis, to be honest. We didn’t have the best doctors back then.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said you're 87?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Born in '38. Though I feel younger most days! Still working, still keeping busy. I don't believe in sitting around doing nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to do a quick neurological exam, just to get a baseline. Please try to relax and follow my instructions. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Oh, of course! Let me see... It's 2025, isn't it? August the 2nd, to be precise. My wife keeps track of all these things. I'm usually good with dates, but sometimes… they slip my mind.
DOCTOR: Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation. Now, I’m going to check your strength… Can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. Here. Is that alright, Doctor? I don't want to break your hand! I still have some strength in these old bones. I used to be a carpenter, you know, before I took up manicures. Needed strong hands for that!
DOCTOR: Strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Neck is supple, though some mild tenderness to palpation in the occipital region. So far, nothing alarming. But given your age and family history, I'd like to get a CT scan just to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: A CT scan, you say? That sounds… serious. Is it something you think is really necessary, Doctor? I don't like being exposed to all that radiation if it can be avoided. I’ve always been a bit worried about those things. Is it possible it's just a tension headache? I do get a bit stressed sometimes, running the business and all.
DOCTOR: Given your age and the persistence of the headache, and your mother's history of migraines, it’s a precaution. I understand your concerns about radiation, but the benefits outweigh the risks in this case. We can discuss alternative imaging if you prefer, but a CT scan provides the clearest picture. I'm not dismissing the possibility of a tension headache, but we need to rule out other causes first. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… let me think. I don't think so. My wife usually handles all the medical stuff, she'd know for sure. I've never had a scan before, so I've never been exposed to it. I'll have to ask her when I get home. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a bit nervous about all this. It’s just a headache, isn’t it? I’m not wanting to cause a fuss.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Popova, I understand your apprehension. But it’s my job to be thorough. We'll start with the CT scan, with and without contrast. I'll send the order to the radiology department, and they'll call you to schedule an appointment. If you develop any new symptoms—severe headache, fever, weakness, vision changes—go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. A CT scan, with and without… and if anything changes, emergency room. My wife will be glad to hear you're being so careful. She worries about me. Thank you, Doctor Dechêne. I appreciate you explaining everything, even if it is a bit frightening. Where will I get the order for the scan?
DOCTOR: The radiology department will have it electronically. They'll need your insurance information, though you mentioned you aren't insured… we can discuss options for financial assistance if needed. I have several other patients waiting, so I'll let you go. If you have any questions, you can leave a message with the receptionist. .
PATIENT: Right, insurance… that’s a problem. But we’ll manage. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll go and see what the radiology department says. And I’ll let my wife know. Have a good day. .
