DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, yes. Right. Just… lab work. The usual, I suppose. Doctor said something about it. Can’t rightly recall what exactly, though. Honestly, these old bones don’t hold information like they used to. Just want to get it done and be on my way, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: “The usual.” Right. And who was this doctor, Mr. Croonquist?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Name escapes me. I… I saw him a while back. Near the hospital, I think? A younger fellow. No, wait… older. No, younger! Ugh, it’s all a blur, really. Look, is it alright if we just… do the lab work? I trust you know what needs to be done. I've got Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Medicare is helpful, yes, but it doesn't tell me what lab work needs doing. I need to know what we're looking for, Mr. Croonquist. Are you following up on something specific?
PATIENT: Specific? No… not that I remember. It was… a check-up, I think? Maybe for my heart? Or… something with my blood? Honestly, I just get these reminders and show up. I don't keep good track of these things. It’s… frustrating, to be frank. Can’t you just look it up? With my name and insurance? Is that not possible?
DOCTOR: Let’s see… Croonquist, Early… Medicare… Hmm. Yes, alright. It appears you had some blood work done six months ago at St. Jude’s Hospital, ordered by Dr. Aris Thorne. Results indicated slightly elevated creatinine and a mildly low hemoglobin. He recommended follow-up to rule out possible kidney issues and investigate the anemia. Do you recall anything about that, Mr. Croonquist?
PATIENT: Aris… Thorne? That name… rings a bell. Kidney issues… anemia… Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? I honestly don't recall being told anything specific. I just remember feeling a bit tired, maybe. But who doesn’t feel tired at my age? So, you're saying I need more blood work to check those things? Is that right? Just to be sure? Because, honestly, I feel alright now. Mostly.
DOCTOR: "Mostly" isn't particularly reassuring, Mr. Croonquist. And yes, that’s correct. We need to repeat the blood work to see if those levels have changed. We need a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a GFR to assess your kidney function. It’s a standard follow-up. We can also check your iron levels since anemia can have many causes. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I get a bit sniffly in the spring, but that's just the pollen, I think. As for conditions… well, I’m 73! Everything aches. My knees are terrible, but that's just old age. Doctor said something about my blood pressure being a little high a few years back, but it usually comes down if I avoid salt. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Look, can we just get this done? I have an appointment later this afternoon, and I don't want to be late. Is there somewhere I can sit while I wait?
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Elevated blood pressure, managed with diet. We'll need to check your current blood pressure today as well, of course. And we will get the blood work done. It's a quick process, Mr. Croonquist. The phlebotomist is just down the hall; I’ll have her come get you when she's ready. Meanwhile, have a seat, and I’ll take your blood pressure. It’s important to have a baseline measurement, especially given your history. Please, try to relax. It'll be faster if you do.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Relax. Easier said than done at my age. I'll sit. Just… try to be quick about it, alright? And tell the phlebotomist to be gentle. I bruise easily. Let's just get this over with. .
DOCTOR: Very well. We will do our best. Now, please, extend your arm. And try not to tense up.
