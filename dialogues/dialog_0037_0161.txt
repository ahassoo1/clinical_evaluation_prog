DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. I'm Dr. AX. It's nice to meet you. Thanks for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I look into this… PrEP thing. She said it could be a good idea, and honestly, I don’t want to be foolish. I’m… getting older, you know? And single. So, yeah, that's why I’m here. I figured it's better to be safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Helaina, that’s very sensible of you to consider that. PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis – is a really good option for HIV prevention. It’s great that your friend brought it to your attention. To make sure it’s the right choice for you, and to see if you’re a good candidate, I’m going to ask you a few questions, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, that’s fine. Ask away. I don’t mind at all, as long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a parking shift later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, nothing major. I had a bit of trouble with my gallbladder years ago, but they took it out. And my knees ache sometimes, but that’s just old age, I think. Oh! And I wear glasses, as you can see. But other than that, I’m pretty healthy for my age, I’d say. Never been seriously ill. Do you need me to be more specific? I have a good memory, so I can try.
DOCTOR: No, that's a good start, Helaina. The gallbladder removal is helpful to know. And the knees – any formal diagnosis like osteoarthritis?
PATIENT: No, no formal diagnosis. Just… aches. The doctor said it was wear and tear. Said a lot of people my age get it, especially with standing all day at the parking lot. They told me to take some ibuprofen when it flares up. Nothing serious, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. That was… oh, goodness, almost twenty years ago now. Everything else has been… just doctor visits for check-ups and the occasional cold. I’ve always been lucky with my health, honestly. Well, I did break my wrist when I was a child, but that healed up perfectly. That doesn’t count, does it?
DOCTOR: No, a childhood wrist fracture doesn't really count for our purposes today. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen for my knees when they bother me, like I said. And… I take a multivitamin every morning. Nothing fancy, just a basic one from the drugstore. That’s it. I try to eat healthy, so I don’t really need much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and taken plenty of medications when I’ve been sick. Never a problem. I mean, I get hay fever in the spring, but that's just sneezing, not an allergy to a medicine or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, thinking about your family history – do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And her sister, my aunt, had diabetes. But other than that… not really. My father was healthy as a horse, lived to be almost ninety. There was a cousin who had cancer, but she smoked for fifty years, so I don’t know if that counts. It’s hard to keep track of everything, you know? Everyone’s got something.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Helaina. Family history can be tricky. We just want to get a general idea. Now, I'm going to ask a slightly more personal question. This information is confidential, of course. Have you ever been sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes… I have. A long time ago, and… not recently. It’s been… years. I’m single, as I said. It’s not something I talk about much. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Helaina. PrEP is for preventing sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, so understanding your sexual history helps me determine if it's the right option for you, and what kind of testing we'd need to do. Everything you tell me is completely confidential. To be clear, by “sexually active,” do you mean vaginal, anal, or oral sex with a partner?
PATIENT: Yes, all of those, over the years. Mostly vaginal, when I was younger. It’s been… a long time, like I said. And I haven’t been with anyone recently. Not for… well, a very long time. I’m just trying to be honest. It’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, frankly.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Helaina, and I understand it can be difficult to talk about. Now, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Not that I know of, anyway. I always used protection when I was younger. And I haven’t been… active enough to worry about it recently. I had some tests done a few years ago, just to be sure, when I started dating someone briefly. Everything came back clear. I don't remember exactly when, though. It was before I moved here.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's good to know. Now, one last question before we move on to a physical exam. Do you currently use intravenous drugs or share needles with anyone?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. Never in my life. I don’t even like needles. I barely let them give me a flu shot! I just… I don’t do anything like that. I’m a perfectly healthy, respectable woman. Honestly, Doctor, I just wanted to be careful. That’s all. Is this all the questions? I feel like I'm being interrogated!
DOCTOR: You’re not being interrogated, Helaina, I promise! Those were just standard questions to assess your risk factors and make sure PrEP is a safe and appropriate option for you. You’ve been very forthcoming, and I appreciate it. Now, if you're comfortable, I’d like to do a brief physical exam and some lab work. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and taking some blood samples to check your kidney function, liver function, and screen for any STIs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long, like I said, I have a shift to get to this afternoon. Okay, let’s get it over with. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Great. First, we'll check your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Alright, here you go. I hope it’s not too high. I get nervous at the doctor, you know?
DOCTOR: Just try to relax. Take a few deep breaths. 130 over 80. That's slightly elevated, but not concerning, especially given you mentioned being nervous. Now, I'll just listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath in, and out?
PATIENT: Okay… is that alright? I haven’t been sick in ages, like I said, so I’m not expecting anything bad.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds clear and normal. Your heart rate is regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, we just need to draw some blood. I'll call the lab technician, and they'll come in and take care of that. It’ll just be a few vials, and it will be quick. Are you alright with needles, or would you like to look away?
PATIENT: I don't love needles, to be honest. But I'll be alright. Just… quick is good. Very quick. And maybe don’t show me the needle? I’m a bit squeamish. Let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The technician is very experienced, and it will be as quick and painless as possible. I’ll look away too, and let you know when it’s done. “Technician, could you come in and draw blood from room two?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I’m… ready, I suppose. I really hope this PrEP thing works. It’s just… getting older is hard enough without worrying about all this.
DOCTOR: The technician will explain the process and take care of everything. Remember to relax your arm. I’ll be right here if you need anything.
PATIENT: Okay… I guess just… do it quickly. And gently, if possible.
DOCTOR: "All done! Just keep this bandage on for about fifteen minutes, and try not to bend your arm too much for a little while." "Everything went smoothly. The lab results should be available in a few days. I'll call you as soon as they're in. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… when will I know if this PrEP thing is right for me? And what happens then? I suppose I’ll just have to wait. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. I understand it can be a little nerve-wracking. Once the lab results are back, we’ll review them together. If everything looks good – that is, if your kidney function is normal and you don’t have any underlying health issues – we can discuss starting you on PrEP. PrEP is a daily medication, and it's very effective at preventing HIV transmission when taken consistently. We'll also discuss safe sex practices and schedule regular check-ups to monitor your health and ensure the medication is working properly. I’ll also give you information about potential side effects and answer any questions you may have. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. A little complicated, but good. I suppose I should expect side effects with any medication, right? It’s just… after all these years, it's strange to be thinking about all this. But I’m glad I came in. It feels better to be proactive. I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll wait for your call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. It’s always better to be proactive about your health, and I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are back. Have a good day, and please be careful.
