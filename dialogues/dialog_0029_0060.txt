DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… family history, mostly. My mother’s side, specifically. A lot of… problems, let's just say. Heart stuff, mainly. And her brother… well, it wasn’t pretty. I’m probably being overly cautious, but I just want to make sure I’m not heading down the same path. You know, peace of mind. I eat reasonably well and I try to get some exercise when I can, but… it’s always in the back of my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Family history is important, and it's good you're being proactive. “Heart stuff” is a little vague, though. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. Okay, fine. My mom had… a valve problem, I think. Something needed fixing, but she put it off. Then there was her brother, Uncle Raj… he had a really bad heart attack. Didn’t make it. And my grandmother… high blood pressure, always. She was on medication for it for years. Honestly, I don’t really remember all the details. They didn't really talk about it, you know? Just a lot of worried looks and hushed conversations. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. It sounds like there’s a definite pattern of cardiac issues and hypertension in your family. Okay, so valve problems, a heart attack, and high blood pressure. Let’s get a bit more information about you. Do you currently have any symptoms – any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Honestly, that’s why I feel a bit silly coming in. I feel… fine. Perfectly normal. Which is, I guess, what’s worrying me. It’s like, if I felt something, it would be easier to deal with. But just knowing it could happen… it’s unnerving. I haven’t noticed anything different, really. Maybe I get a little winded going up the stairs sometimes, but who doesn't? And I’ve been more stressed lately with work, so… I don’t know. Is there a test you can do to just… see? Just to make sure?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Theriot. It's not silly to want to be proactive, especially with your family history. Stress can certainly contribute to feeling winded, but it's good we’re talking about this. Yes, there are tests we can do. A basic EKG would give us a snapshot of your heart’s electrical activity. We can also do a blood test to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function, and get a baseline look at your overall health. Would you be comfortable with those?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. As long as it’ll give me some answers. I mean, I don’t want to waste your time, but honestly, just knowing everything is okay would be a huge relief. Cholesterol, blood sugar… whatever you think is necessary. I guess the sooner we get it done, the better, right? What's involved? Do I have to… you know… prepare or anything?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We’ll get those ordered right away. The EKG is quick and painless – we just put some sticky pads on your chest, arms and legs. As for the blood work, you'll need to fast for about 8-12 hours beforehand – so no food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. We'll get the lab order to you and you can go whenever is convenient for you. After we get the results, we can discuss them and figure out a plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable. Eight to twelve hours. I can do that. I usually skip breakfast anyway. So, just no eating. Okay. And the results will come back to you, and then we’ll talk about it? How long does that usually take, roughly? I have a conference next week, so I was hoping to have something figured out before then. Not that I expect miracles, obviously. Just trying to get an idea.
DOCTOR: Typically, the lab results take about 2-3 business days to come back. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss them. Since you have a conference next week, let's aim for Wednesday or Thursday of next week. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Wednesday would be better, I think. Gives me a little buffer. And… okay, good. Wednesday it is. So, no eating until after the bloodwork on… what day should I do it? Are there certain days that are better? I don’t want to go on a busy day and have to wait for hours. I'm sure you're busy enough as it is.
DOCTOR: That sounds good. Let’s schedule the bloodwork for tomorrow morning – Tuesday. The lab is usually less crowded earlier in the day. I’ll have my nurse schedule that for you now. She’ll also give you a list of instructions. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very… thorough. And patient, actually. I tend to ramble when I’m anxious. Hopefully, everything is just fine. And if it isn’t… well, at least we’ll know, right? Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Theriot. It’s my job. And it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about this. Don’t worry about rambling – it helps me understand your concerns. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule the bloodwork and give you those instructions. We’ll get everything sorted out. Have a good rest of your day.
