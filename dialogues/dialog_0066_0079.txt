DOCTOR: Hi Courtnye, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. Um, it’s about my bruising. It’s just… been getting worse, even though I’m on blood thinners already. It doesn’t make sense, does it?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't sound right at all that bruising would worsen with blood thinners. That's definitely something we need to look into. Okay, so you're already on a blood thinner… can you tell me which one you’re taking, and how long you’ve been on it?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s… Warfarin, I think. Yeah, Warfarin. And I’ve been on it… gosh, about eight months now? The cardiologist put me on it after the… well, after the little heart thing. Sorry, I don’t remember all the fancy names they used. But eight months, give or take. I try to take it at the same time every day, usually with dinner.
DOCTOR: Okay, eight months on Warfarin. Good that you’re trying to keep a consistent schedule with it – that’s important. And you said this was prescribed by a cardiologist after a “little heart thing”?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. It was… atrial fibrillation, I think? They said my heart was fluttering. It wasn’t too bad, mostly just felt tired, but they wanted to get it sorted before it became a bigger problem. They did some tests and decided Warfarin was the best way to go. It helped for a while, but now… well, now I'm bruising like crazy. Even from just bumping into things.
DOCTOR: Okay, atrial fibrillation, treated with Warfarin for eight months, and now increased bruising. Got it. To get a better picture, can you describe what the bruising looks like?
PATIENT: It's… just normal bruises, I guess? Like when you knock your arm or something. But they’re bigger than usual, and they last longer. And I seem to get them really easily now. Like, I’ll just lean against something and find a bruise there the next day. A couple of them are on my legs, and I got one on my arm just yesterday from… honestly, I don't even remember how I got it. They're not painful, just… there. And they’re making me worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, larger, more frequent bruising, easily occurring even with minor trauma, lasting longer than usual, and not particularly painful. That's helpful. Are the bruises generally symmetrical – meaning do you see them on both sides of your body equally, or are they more concentrated in one area?
PATIENT: Hmm, good question. No, they're not really symmetrical. I’d say most of them are on my legs, especially my shins, and then on my arms. I don’t really get them on my torso, and not really on my face. So, definitely not even. More on the limbs, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, limbs more affected, not symmetrical. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bruising?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. I've been a bit more tired than usual, maybe? But I always chalk that up to… well, to everything, really. I work long hours. No bleeding gums or anything like that. No nosebleeds. Just the bruising. And the worrying, of course. Does that count as a symptom?
DOCTOR: It absolutely counts as a symptom! Worry is a very valid symptom. Okay, so increased bruising, no other obvious signs of bleeding, and some increased fatigue. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed besides the atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: Not really. I had… pneumonia a couple of years ago, but that’s it. Nothing major. And I don’t take any other medication, just the Warfarin. Oh, wait… sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s not very often. Maybe once a month, if that.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia a couple of years ago, occasional ibuprofen for headaches, otherwise just Warfarin. And how about any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries. Never had any. I'm not a fan of hospitals, if you can't tell. I avoid them whenever possible.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Avoiding hospitals is a perfectly reasonable stance! Okay, no surgeries. Now, I like to get a sense of family history if you don't mind me asking. Has anyone in your family had problems with bleeding or bruising easily?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mum… she did bruise easily, now that I think about it. But she just said it was “part of being old”. She didn’t go to the doctor much, so I don’t know if it was anything serious. My dad was fine, always tough as nails. And I don’t really know much about my grandparents, they passed away when I was young. So, probably just my mum. But like I said, she didn't make a big deal of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal history of easy bruising, but no formal diagnosis. And finally, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just sometimes, Doctor. A glass of wine with dinner on the weekends, maybe? Nothing heavy. And I don't smoke, never have. I try to eat healthy, but it's hard with my job. Lots of takeout. Does that make a difference?
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional wine with dinner, no smoking, and trying to eat healthy. All good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at those bruises to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are. Just… try not to poke too much, okay? I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to needles.
DOCTOR: No needles today, I promise. Just a look and a listen. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. And the bruises… they are definitely more prominent than I would expect, and they do appear to be in various stages of healing. The distribution is also a little concerning. I'm going to document: "Multiple ecchymoses noted on bilateral lower extremities and upper extremities, varying in size and color. No palpable masses or signs of acute trauma. Patient reports no pain with palpation.” To help figure out what's going on, I'd like to order some blood work. It will help us check your Warfarin levels, see how your blood is clotting, and rule out any other potential causes for the bruising. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. Blood work is probably a good idea. Warfarin levels make sense, if it's not working right, that’d explain everything, wouldn’t it? As long as it doesn’t take too long… I have a pretty busy schedule. But yeah, go ahead with the blood work. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. I was starting to get really worried.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Courtnye. I'm glad you came in. We'll get to the bottom of this. I'll order the blood work now. It should take about 15-20 minutes to get the results. While we're waiting, I'll also have my nurse take your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, temperature. In the meantime, is there anything else you want to tell me or any other questions you have?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just… getting it sorted is the main thing. I need to be able to work, and worrying about bruising all the time is making it hard to concentrate. Hopefully, it’s just the Warfarin levels, like you said. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate you not dismissing it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I understand. It's important to address your concerns and get you back to feeling your best. And you're right, it's very possible it's just a Warfarin level adjustment. We'll know soon enough. Let me just explain what to expect while we're waiting for the results. The nurse will come in shortly to check your blood pressure, pulse and temperature. Once the blood work is back, I'll review it with you and we'll discuss the next steps. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other materials I should be aware of before the nurse takes your vital signs?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not to latex, not to anything. I’m pretty boring like that. Just… let me know if anything’s really wrong, okay? I get a bit anxious about medical stuff. But no allergies, everything’s fine. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Perfect, no allergies. And I absolutely will keep you informed every step of the way. We’ll go through everything together. “Nurse, could you please come in and take Courtnye Hainley’s vital signs?
