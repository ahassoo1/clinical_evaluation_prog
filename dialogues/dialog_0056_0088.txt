DOCTOR: Hi Jaylyne, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. Uh, it's my ears, really. They've been ringing. It's been going on for a bit now, and it's… annoying, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears. And how long is “a bit now”?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe like, three or four weeks? It started quietly, I thought it was just from being at a friend’s place – he likes his music loud. But it hasn’t really gone away, even when it’s quiet. It’s pretty constant now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant for three or four weeks. Is it in one ear, both ears, or does it feel like it’s inside your head?
PATIENT: It's... both, I think. It's hard to explain. Mostly I notice it in my left ear, but sometimes it feels like it’s just… everywhere, you know? Like a buzzing inside my head. It’s not painful, just… there.
DOCTOR: Right, okay, both ears, more noticeable on the left, and described as a buzzing. Has anything made it better or worse since it started?
PATIENT: Well, nothing really makes it better. If I’m busy, I don’t notice it as much, I guess. But quiet places? Forget about it. And loud noises definitely make it worse, obviously. It’s just… louder when there’s other noise. Does that make sense? I work as a waiter, so there’s always something going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, so distraction helps, and loud noises exacerbate it. Have you noticed any hearing loss, dizziness, or fullness in your ears along with the ringing?
PATIENT: Hearing loss… hmm. That’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed any, but I’m not usually listening for that, you know? I mean, I can still hear people fine. No dizziness, and my ears don't feel blocked or anything like that. Just the ringing. It's really just the ringing, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever been exposed to really loud noises at work or elsewhere – like machinery, concerts, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely at work sometimes. The kitchen gets pretty noisy with the pots and pans, and we have live music a couple of nights a week. Not every week, but… often enough. And, uh, when I was younger, I used to go to a lot of concerts. Not anymore though. It’s been years. I’m divorced now, so things are a bit quieter, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of noise exposure, both recent and in the past. Do you have any other medical problems, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, nothing major. I had a bad flu last year, but that’s about it. My doctor usually just checks me over when I go for my yearly check-up, and everything’s always been okay. I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I try to eat well. I have private insurance, so I get it checked out when I need to.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Any medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: No, none. Never been much of a pill-taker, if I can help it. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but that’s it. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. And are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat all sorts of things. My mum was a really good cook, so I was exposed to a lot growing up!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let’s do a quick exam of your ears. I’m just going to take a look inside with this light.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Sounds good. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get to the bottom of this ringing, you know? It’s really starting to get on my nerves.
DOCTOR: Okay, looking in your ears now… Both ear canals look clear. The eardrums themselves look normal – no redness, swelling, or fluid. I’m going to do a quick hearing test, just to get a baseline. It’s just a simple tone test.
PATIENT: Okay, a hearing test sounds good. Is it… complicated? I'm not very good with… machines.
DOCTOR: No, not at all! It's very straightforward. I'll have you wear headphones, and you just indicate when you hear a tone. We’ll test different frequencies and volumes in each ear. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Alright, good. That sounds… doable. Headphones, yeah? Okay. Let's get it over with then, eh? I’ve got a shift later, so the quicker the better, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, so I’m going to play some tones through these headphones at different volumes. Just press the button every time you hear a sound, even if it’s very faint. It’s okay if you miss some, just focus on responding when you do hear something. We'll start with your right ear. Ready?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, right ear. Press the button when I hear something. Got it. Let’s do it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. Now let's do the left ear. Okay, switching to your left ear now. Remember, just press the button whenever you hear a tone.
PATIENT: Okay, left ear now… button whenever I hear something. Right.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the results show some mild high-frequency hearing loss in both ears, but it’s more pronounced in your left ear. This is consistent with noise exposure. The ringing you’re experiencing – that’s called tinnitus – is often associated with hearing loss.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay… mild hearing loss… I figured something was up. So that’s what’s causing the ringing? The concerts and the work… is it… serious? Will it get worse?
DOCTOR: It’s good that we identified this. It's not necessarily “serious” in the sense of a sudden, life-threatening condition, but it’s something we need to manage. The hearing loss is likely contributing to the tinnitus. It can get worse with continued noise exposure, but we can take steps to prevent that. The tinnitus itself can also fluctuate – sometimes it’s louder, sometimes quieter. Essentially, your ears are a little sensitive because of the noise you’ve been exposed to. It’s like they’re working harder to hear, and that can sometimes create the ringing sensation. I recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible. If you can't avoid them—at work for example—wear earplugs. I can write you a prescription for custom-fitted earplugs if you’d like. We’ll also discuss strategies for managing the tinnitus itself.
PATIENT: Custom earplugs… okay, yeah, that sounds good. Definitely. I don’t want it to get any worse. And what about… managing the tinnitus? Is there anything I can do about the ringing itself? It's just… annoying.
DOCTOR: There are several strategies. For some people, sound therapy can help – things like white noise or background music can mask the ringing. There are also apps and devices designed for tinnitus management. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, can also be helpful in learning to cope with the annoyance and reduce the stress associated with it. It doesn’t make the ringing go away, but it can make it less bothersome. We can start with recommending earplugs and avoiding loud noises. If that’s not enough, we can explore those other options. I'm going to write you a referral to an audiologist. They can do a more comprehensive hearing evaluation and fit you with the custom earplugs. They are also specialized in tinnitus management. Do you have any questions about this so far?
PATIENT: An audiologist… okay, that makes sense. More specialized, yeah? Sounds good. No, I think I understand. Earplugs, avoid noise, see an audiologist… Is there anything I should be worried about? Like, is it a sign of something else?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question. While tinnitus is often related to hearing loss from noise exposure, it can sometimes be a symptom of other underlying conditions, though that’s less common. Things like Meniere’s disease, certain medications, or even a build-up of earwax can cause tinnitus. Because you have no other symptoms – no dizziness, no sudden hearing loss, no pain – and your exam was normal, it’s most likely related to the noise exposure. But the audiologist will do a more thorough evaluation to rule out any other potential causes and confirm the diagnosis. If anything concerning is found, they’ll refer you to the appropriate specialist. For now, focus on protecting your hearing and we'll follow up with the audiologist. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that sounds… reassuring, I guess. Protecting my hearing… that’s the main thing, right? And see the audiologist. Alright. I think that's all my questions, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything. I really appreciate it. I guess I’d better get a move on then. I’ve got a shift starting soon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I'm glad I could help. I'll print out the referral for you, and a summary of our discussion. Here's a prescription for the earplugs as well. Just remember to protect your ears, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Hopefully, the audiologist can get you some relief. Have a good shift, and try not to let the ringing get you down too much. .
PATIENT: Thanks, Doctor. I really appreciate it. I will. Bye.
