DOCTOR: Good morning, Betty. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Glazewski. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well now… it's my ears, I think. They just… don't work like they used to. Things are a bit muffled, you see? Hard to hear folks sometimes. It's been gettin' worse, I reckon. Not sure when it started, exactly. Just… slowly, like.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing that’s been gradually worsening. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it's not like I can't hear nothin’, you understand? It's just… like talkin' underwater, maybe? Especially women's voices. They get lost on me quicker than a man's, for some reason. And the telly… I have to have it up pretty loud, and even then I miss bits. My neighbors probably hate me!
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's more difficulty understanding sounds, particularly higher-pitched voices, and you’re finding you need to increase the volume on the television. Is this difficulty constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, good question, Doctor. It's... mostly constant, I'd say. But some days are worse than others, definitely. When I'm tired, it's awful. Like everything's just… faraway. And if there's a lot of noise, like at the grocery store… forget about it. Just a jumble. It's gettin’ harder to keep up, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's constant with fluctuations, worse with fatigue and background noise. Have you noticed any ringing, buzzing, or any other sounds in your ears, like a constant tone?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Now that you mention it… sometimes. It’s not always there, but every now and then, yeah. A high-pitched… well, like a kettle, maybe? Not a loud one, just a faint whistle. I usually don't pay it much mind, to be honest. It comes and goes so quick. I figured it was just… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. A faint, intermittent high-pitched ringing. Thank you for sharing that, Betty. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever had any ear infections, or any problems with your ears in the past?
PATIENT: Ear infections… oh dear. That's a long time ago, Doctor. When I was a little girl, I had a bad one, I think. Real bad pain, I remember that. They took me to the doctor, of course. I don't recall much else about it, just the pain. And… maybe another one when I was older? But honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. I worked in the shoe factory for so long, the noise was always so loud, I probably blocked a lot of things out. I’m sorry I can’t be more help.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Betty. Don’t worry about it at all. We’ll do the best we can with what we have. So, a history of at least one ear infection in childhood. Have you ever had any surgery, or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: Surgery… hmm. Let me think… No, not that I recall. No surgery. I broke my arm when I was a young woman, fell off a ladder pickin’ apples, but that wasn’t surgery. Just a cast. Hospital… maybe when I had my tonsils out? A long, long time ago. Everything’s a bit fuzzy, you see. I don’t remember much detail about any of it. It was a different time back then. They didn’t explain things like they do now, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant surgical history besides a broken arm and possibly tonsillectomy. Now, are there any medical conditions that you're currently being treated for, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I get a little arthritis in my hands, mostly. It bothers me when it’s cold. And the doctor told me my blood pressure's a bit high, so I take a little pill for that every day. Can’t remember the name of it, though. Small white one, I think. And… oh, yes! My neighbor reminds me to take it. She’s a good woman. I see the doctor every six months for checkups, but he mostly just tells me to watch my salt. That's about it, really. Nothing too serious, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis and hypertension. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had a bad reaction to a medicine. I've never been one for takin' a lot of pills, so I don’t have much experience with ‘em, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. She was a good woman, my mother. But no, no allergies. Not that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a quick examination, let me ask about your family history. Do you know of anyone in your family who has had problems with their hearing, or any other medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… Family history… Now that's a tricky one. My mother had a bit of trouble hearin’ towards the end, I think. But she didn’t go to the doctor much. She just… got quieter, you see? And my father… he worked on the railroad, very loud job. I don't recall him complainin' about his ears, but he wasn't one to talk about his health. My brother… he had high blood pressure, I think. But honestly, Doctor, we weren’t a family that talked a lot about these things. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Betty. You’ve told me what you remember, and that's very helpful. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to do a quick examination of your ears to get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable. I don't like surprises, you see. But yes, go ahead. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. I'm just going to look inside your ears with this little instrument. It might be a bit cool, but I'll be gentle. Okay… I see some cerumen – that’s earwax – in both ears. There’s a slight dullness to the tympanic membranes, which are the eardrums. They don’t appear to be perforated, and I don’t see any fluid behind them. The ear canals themselves appear normal. Now, I’m going to perform a quick hearing test, just to get a basic assessment of your hearing levels. I’ll use this tuning fork. I’m going to place it on your forehead, and you tell me when you can no longer hear the sound in either ear. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… alright, I suppose. I don't think I've ever had one of those things done before. A tuning fork… fancy. Just tell me what to do, and I'll try my best. Don't be shy to tell me if I’m doin’ it wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, Betty. Just focus on the sound. When you can no longer hear it in either ear, let me know. It’s okay if it’s not a precise moment; just tell me when it fades away. Okay… and?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s makin’ a vibratin’ sound. Still hearin’ it… in both ears, I think. Oh… wait. I think… it’s fainter now in my left ear. Yes… definitely fainter. I can still hear it, but it's… quiet. Is that right? It's gone now in my left ear, but still goin’ in the right.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful, Betty. That suggests there may be some hearing loss in your left ear, compared to your right. It's not a definitive diagnosis, but it gives us a starting point. Based on what you've told me, and the quick examination, it sounds like you likely have age-related hearing loss, also known as presbycusis. The cerumen buildup could also be contributing to the difficulty, and the intermittent tinnitus is not uncommon. It's important to rule out other possible causes, though. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Presby… what now? Oh dear. That's a mouthful. Age-related, you say? Well, that doesn't surprise me. Everything's gettin' older, I reckon, including me! But what does that mean, exactly? Will I go completely deaf? And what about the earwax? Can you get rid of that? Is there anything you can do about it?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Betty. Presbycusis is a gradual hearing loss that typically occurs with age. It's very common, and it doesn’t usually mean you’ll go completely deaf. It often affects higher-pitched sounds first, which is why you mentioned difficulty hearing women's voices. As for the earwax, yes, we can certainly remove it. It’s a simple procedure. We can either use ear drops to soften it, or I can gently remove it with a small instrument. Now, as for what we can do about the hearing loss itself, there are several options. Hearing aids are the most common solution, and they can significantly improve your hearing. We could also consider referral to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing test and evaluation, which would give us a more detailed understanding of your hearing levels and recommend the best course of action. Would you be interested in a referral to an audiologist?
PATIENT: Oh, hearing aids… I’ve heard about those. Do they… are they noticeable? I don't want everyone knowin’ I’m hard of hearin’. And an audiolo… what was that? Another doctor? It all sounds a bit complicated, Doctor. Maybe we should just try the earwax thing first? See if that helps a bit before we go to another doctor and gettin’ fitted for… things. I'm an old woman, you see. I don't like too much fuss.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Betty. We can definitely start with the earwax removal. Modern hearing aids are very discreet; many are quite small and fit comfortably inside the ear. We wouldn't need to jump into anything until we have a more complete picture of your hearing, and you’re in control of the decision-making process. An audiologist is a specialist in hearing, and they can perform a more detailed hearing test and recommend the best course of action if needed. They’re not necessarily a medical doctor, but they have specialized training in hearing health. So, let's start with the earwax removal. I can prescribe some ear drops for you. Use them as directed for a week, and then come back in, and we’ll see if that improves your hearing. If not, we can discuss the possibility of a referral to an audiologist at that time. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds… much better. Just the ear drops for now. That's a good start. And thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very nicely. I feel a bit better now, knowin' what's goin' on. And if the ear drops don’t work, I suppose I can think about seein’ that… audiolo… that ear doctor. Thank you again. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Betty. I’m glad I could help. Here’s a prescription for ear drops. Use these twice a day for one week. Avoid getting water in your ears during that time. If you don’t notice any improvement after a week, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can discuss further options. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that’s all. Just the ear drops. Thank you so much, Doctor Glazewski. You’ve been very kind. I reckon I’ll be seein’ you again, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Betty. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
