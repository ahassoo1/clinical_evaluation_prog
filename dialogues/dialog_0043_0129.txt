DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't got all day. It's my stool. It's black. Like… tar. And I take those pills, you know, for the arthritis. The red ones. Been taking them for years. Is that what this is about? I just want to know if it's serious, or if I need to stop the pills.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hatchard, and I appreciate you being direct. It’s good you mentioned the red pills for your arthritis. Black, tarry stools are something we definitely need to investigate. It could be related to the medication, but there are other possibilities we need to rule out. To start, could you describe how long you’ve been noticing this change in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started, oh, maybe a week ago? Something like that. It wasn't every day at first, just… sometimes. Now it’s been a few days running. Look, I eat pretty regular, you know. Meat and potatoes mostly. Nothing fancy. I don’t go looking for trouble with my stomach. Is it… is it cancer? My sister Millie had something awful, and it started with her stomach. Don't tell me it's that.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Hatchard, especially with your sister Millie’s experience. It's natural to be concerned. We’ll take all necessary steps to figure out what’s going on. It’s good you mentioned the timing – a week ago is helpful. Just to clarify, when you say "meat and potatoes mostly," have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Changes? No, not really. I eat the same amount as always. My husband, Frank, he’s always telling me I eat too much, actually! But no, nothing different there. I still enjoy my food, thank you very much. And I haven’t had any stomach pain, if that’s what you're going to ask. Just… the stool. Black. It’s unsettling, you know? I don’t like it one bit. Are you going to send me for tests right away? Because I have a bingo night on Thursday.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hatchard, I completely understand your concern, and I assure you we’ll get this investigated promptly. And bingo night is important! Before we discuss tests, let me ask a few more questions to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits besides the color?
PATIENT: Like what kind of changes? Honestly, Doctor, it goes in, it comes out. What more is there to say? It's not different different, if you understand me. Maybe a little… looser than usual, now that you mention it. But I chalked that up to the heat. It's been sweltering, you know? And I drink plenty of water. I'm not dehydrated, if that's what you're thinking. Look, I’m a practical woman. Just tell me if it’s the pills and if I need to stop taking them. This is all rather… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hatchard, and I appreciate you being so straightforward. “Looser than usual” is helpful information, thank you. We want to be thorough. Now, have you experienced any fatigue or weakness recently?
PATIENT: Weakness? Goodness, no. I still manage the garden, you know. Tomatoes, peppers, everything. And I bake a pie every week for Frank. I'm not sitting around feeling sorry for myself, if that's what you're implying. Tired? Sometimes, after a long day, but who isn't? I'm 73 years old, Doctor, not a spring chicken. Honestly, I think you're asking a lot of questions about nothing. Can we just get to the bottom of this and be done with it? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask me to get to the point, Ms. Hatchard. I apologize if my questions seem excessive, but it’s important for me to gather as much information as possible to ensure I provide the best care. I want to rule out anything serious. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis is enough, thank you very much. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was… oh, goodness, must be 30 years now. And I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure once, but it’s been fine for years. Doctor, I’m a healthy woman for my age! I don’t go to doctors unless I have to. And frankly, this whole thing is probably just a side effect of those pills. Can we just… try stopping them and see what happens? I’d rather not have a bunch of tests if it’s something simple like that.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Ms. Hatchard – the gallbladder removal and the history of blood pressure are important to know. It’s good that your blood pressure has been stable. While stopping the medication could be a reasonable approach, I would feel more comfortable performing a quick physical exam and ordering a simple blood test first, just to be certain. The blood test will check your iron levels and rule out any signs of bleeding. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Fine. Do what you have to do. But I’m warning you, if it’s just a side effect, I’m holding you responsible for wasting my time. And please, be quick about it. I have bingo night. And Frank will be wondering where I am. Honestly, doctors these days… all tests and no common sense. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your frustration and I assure you, I'll be as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within a normal range. Your pulse is 72 and regular, and your lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender, but I do note a slight fullness in the lower abdomen. I don’t feel any masses or abnormalities. Now, I’m going to order a complete blood count and a stool occult blood test. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn’t take long. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Just get it done. And tell the lab to be quick about it, will you? I don’t want to spend the whole afternoon in that waiting room. Honestly, this is ridiculous. A little black stool and suddenly it’s a whole ordeal. I’m starting to think I should have just ignored it. It’ll probably go away on its own. But fine, do your tests. Just… hurry. And don’t forget to tell me when the results are back. I expect a phone call. Not an email. A phone call. Frank helps me with the computer, and it takes forever. Alright? A phone call. Now, if you'll excuse me… I think I’ll go sit in the waiting room and try not to worry. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Hatchard. A phone call it will be. I'll make sure the lab knows to prioritize your results and I’ll contact you as soon as they are available. Please let the lab technician know if you have any questions. I appreciate your patience, and I'll be in touch soon. .
