DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Gentz. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, it's… well, it’s blood. Coming from where the food goes, if you catch my drift. Not a little bit, either. Enough to worry me, which isn’t easy, believe me. I haven’t been feeling right for a few days now. Just… weak, and then this started.
DOCTOR: Blood, you say. From… the digestive tract. Right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Three, maybe four days now. Started kinda small, thought it was just something I ate, you know? But it's gotten worse each day. Definitely not something I ate. I eat pretty plain, honestly. Don’t go for fancy stuff. And I'm telling you, Doc, I know my body. Something's off.
DOCTOR: “Plain,” you say. What exactly does “plain” consist of?
PATIENT: Well, mostly rice. And chicken, usually boiled. Sometimes lamb if I'm feeling… up to it. Bread, of course. Flatbread, mostly. I don’t… I don't do a lot of spices. Give me a stomach ache. Not one of those fellas who likes things hot, if you know what I mean. Keeps it simple, keeps it… predictable. And usually, usually, my stomach agrees.
DOCTOR: Right, right. So, a relatively bland diet. And this blood… is it bright red, dark, mixed with… anything?
PATIENT: Look, I'm not a doctor, okay? I just see blood. It's… darker than fresh, I guess. Not like, bright cherry red. More… brownish. And yeah, sometimes there’s… stuff in it. Bits and pieces. Sorry to be graphic, Doc, but you asked. It’s definitely not just pure blood. It looks… digested, I guess. Like what you'd expect, coming from… down there.
DOCTOR: “Digested,” you say. Hmm. And have you experienced any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain, Doc. More like… cramping. A dull ache, low down. Comes and goes. It's not sharp, it's not like a stabbing thing. More… uncomfortable. And tired. I’m always tired now, even before this whole blood thing started. But the cramping’s gotten worse the last day or so, along with… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, cramping and fatigue. And no fever, nausea, vomiting?
PATIENT: No fever. No throwing up. Not nauseous, either. Just… weak. Really weak. And thirsty. All the time thirsty, even after I drink a lot of water. That’s new, the constant thirst. And the… the cramping makes it hard to sleep. I toss and turn, you know? Not a good sleep at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever had anything like this before?
PATIENT: Never. And I've lived a long life, Doc. Seen a lot, been through a lot. This… this is new. I've had the usual aches and pains, a cold now and then, but never… this. Never blood coming from that place. And I haven’t been anywhere, haven’t eaten anything strange. It just… started. And it’s worrying me, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. Well, it could be a number of things. Sometimes it's just a minor irritation. But given your… description, we'll need to rule some more serious possibilities out. Let's have a quick look at you, shall we?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I appreciate you saying it could be nothing, but frankly, I don’t like the sound of “ruling serious possibilities out.” What kind of serious possibilities are we talking about here? And honestly, poking and prodding isn’t my favorite pastime, if you catch my drift. I’m a practical man, I’d rather know what we’re dealing with than just have you… investigate.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Gentz, I understand your apprehension. But I'm a doctor, and I need to assess the situation properly. It could be something simple, like a small ulcer or hemorrhoids. However, given the blood and your fatigue, we need to rule out anything more significant. I'm not trying to alarm you, but we need to be thorough. Now, if you'll allow me to do a quick abdominal exam… it's quite painless, I assure you. We’ll start there. Then perhaps a stool sample. It's standard procedure, Mr. Gentz. Standard.
PATIENT: Hemorrhoids? Hemorrhoids? With the amount of blood I’m losing, you think it's just… hemorrhoids? Look, Doc, with all due respect, that sounds… insulting. And stool sample? Really? You’re going to have me… do that? I came here for help, not a lecture and a… a collection assignment. I'm not comfortable with this. I think I need a second opinion. A doctor who understands I'm a grown man, not a child needing a… sampling.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I assure you, I am a qualified physician. Hemorrhoids can cause significant bleeding. And a stool sample is essential to rule out… other possibilities. I understand your discomfort, but frankly, it's a simple test. If you insist on a second opinion, you are, of course, free to seek one. But I can't provide a diagnosis without proper investigation. And I do not have the time to argue about this. I have other patients waiting. Do you want me to order the stool sample, or shall we consider this consultation concluded?
PATIENT: Concluded, Doc. Very concluded. I came here for help, not condescension and… and indignity. I'll find someone who actually listens, instead of talking down to me. Don’t bother with any tests, and don’t bother calling. I think I’ve made my feelings perfectly clear.
DOCTOR: .
