DOCTOR: Hi Tammie, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… it’s my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a little while now, I think. Not a good hurt, if you know what I mean. Just… bothersome. I’d like to get it over with, if possible. I don't have much time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Bothersome” is a good way to put it. Let’s try to get a better idea of what’s going on. When did you first notice the throat pain?
PATIENT: Honestly? I can’t rightly say. Dates… never been my strong suit. Sometime last week, maybe? Or the week before? It all blurs together, you know. Everything does. It’s… not important when exactly, is it? As long as it gets fixed.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have a timeframe, even a rough one, but we can work with “a couple of weeks.” Has it been getting worse, staying the same, or getting better at all since it started?
PATIENT: Worse, I suppose. Definitely worse. At first it was just a tickle, a little scratchy. Now… now it feels like swallowing glass. And it's… embarrassing. I haven’t been eating much. Not a lady-like thing, throat pain.
DOCTOR: I understand. Swallowing feeling like glass sounds very uncomfortable. And not being able to eat is definitely concerning. Are you having any trouble breathing at all, or is it just painful to swallow?
PATIENT: Breathing? No, Doctor, I can breathe. Perfectly fine. It's just… when I swallow. Like you said, painful. A very unpleasant sensation. Honestly, I don't understand why I have to explain this in such detail. It hurts when I swallow! Is that not enough?
DOCTOR: You're right to be frustrated, Tammie. I apologize if I'm asking too many questions. It’s just important for me to get a clear picture of what's going on so I can help you feel better. Okay, so it's just pain with swallowing. Do you have any fever, chills, cough, runny nose, or body aches accompanying the sore throat?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking about everything. I haven’t taken my temperature, Doctor. I don't do thermometers. And no, I don't have… whatever you just listed. Just the throat. The painful, awful throat. I don’t usually get sick, you know. I keep myself… presentable. This is… inconvenient. And I really must be going soon.
DOCTOR: I understand you're feeling rushed and inconvenienced, Tammie. I'll try to be as quick as possible while still making sure we cover everything important. Okay, no fever, chills, cough, or body aches. Have you noticed any white spots or pus on the back of your throat, or any swelling in your neck?
PATIENT: Pus? Doctor, really! I haven't… inspected the back of my throat, if that’s what you’re asking. And I certainly don’t go around looking for pus. What sort of question is that? Swelling… I don't know. I wear a necklace. Always. It wouldn't notice swelling, would it? I just want something for the pain, if that’s possible. This is… undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you haven’t specifically noticed any white spots or swelling. Let’s take a quick look. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But be quick about it, Doctor. I have… arrangements. And please, don't make a spectacle of it. Some things are… private.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tammie, just open your mouth and say “Ah.” Alright. Your throat is a bit red, and your tonsils are a little swollen, but there’s no sign of pus or anything else alarming. It looks like a viral pharyngitis, likely causing the pain. But, because you've had it for a couple of weeks, and I always prefer to be thorough, I'd like to do a quick strep test just to rule that out. Is that okay?
PATIENT: A… test? What sort of test? And what’s a “strep”? Honestly, Doctor, you're speaking a different language. I just want something to make it stop hurting. If this test is going to take long, I'm afraid I’ll have to reschedule. I simply don’t have the time for… procedures. This is all rather… upsetting.
DOCTOR: It’s a very quick swab of the back of your throat to check for a bacteria called streptococcus, which causes strep throat. It doesn’t hurt much, just a little tickle. It takes less than a minute. It's important to rule it out, because strep throat needs antibiotics to prevent complications. If it is strep, we'll need to get you on medication. If it's not, then we can focus on managing the symptoms with something to relieve the pain and inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. Get it over with quickly. But if it involves anything… unpleasant, I’m leaving. Immediately. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. This is… frankly, an indignity. A swift swab, you say? And nothing… messy? Do hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tammie, I'm just going to gently swab the back of your throat for a few seconds. It might tickle a little. Alright. It's negative for strep. So, that’s good news. It means this is most likely a viral infection. There's no need for antibiotics. We’ll focus on relieving your symptoms. I’m going to recommend some over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, and lots of fluids. Gargling with warm salt water can also help soothe your throat. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I’m perfectly healthy, usually. Just… this throat. And I take offense to the implication that I don’t know how to care for myself. Warm salt water? I’ve heard of such things. Really, Doctor, is that the best you can offer? I was hoping for something… stronger. But fine. Pain relievers and salt water. Let’s get this over with. Is there anything else? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie. Sometimes viral infections just need time and supportive care to resolve. Unfortunately, there's no "quick fix" for a virus. I'm going to recommend you get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and avoid irritants like smoking or exposure to fumes. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… this information. And hopefully, it will resolve itself quickly. I have… commitments. And I strongly advise you to be more efficient with your patients’ time in the future, Doctor. A luncheon awaits. Thank you.
