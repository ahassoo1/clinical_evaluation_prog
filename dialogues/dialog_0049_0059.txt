DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh… well, it’s my speech, I think. It’s been… a bit off. Hard to explain, really. It feels…slurred, sometimes. I don't quite remember when it started, to be honest. It just…is.
DOCTOR: Slurred speech…right. And you say you can’t pinpoint when it began?
PATIENT: No, not really. It's… fuzzy. Things haven’t been the clearest lately, if I’m being honest. It just sort of… gradually became noticeable, I suppose. My husband mentioned it, and then I started paying attention… and yes, it does seem a bit harder to say things clearly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Vague recollections are…unhelpful, but not entirely uncommon. So, it's a gradual onset of slurred speech. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think it comes and goes, yes. Some days I don’t even notice it, and others… well, others it's definitely more pronounced. Like this morning, I felt like I was trying to say things through… something thick, you know? But yesterday, I didn’t feel it at all. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Intermittent slurring… alright. And has anything specific seemed to trigger it?
PATIENT: Oh dear… trigger it? Let me think… Not that I recall, specifically. I haven’t been doing anything… strenuous, or different, really. Work’s been the same, home life is… peaceful. I haven't been overly stressed, either. I really can’t pinpoint anything that makes it worse, or better. Sorry I’m not much help with that, Doctor.
DOCTOR: “Not much help.” It’s… challenging when the onset is so unclear. Let's move on. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the speech difficulties?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see. I… well, sometimes I feel a little clumsy, maybe? Like I almost stumble, but I catch myself. It’s not frequent, but it’s happened a couple of times in the last week or so. And… now that you mention it, I’ve been feeling a bit more tired than usual, but I thought that was just from work. Does clumsiness count as a symptom? I’m not sure.
DOCTOR: Clumsiness and fatigue… alright. We're building a picture, however incomplete. Now, do you have any family history of neurological issues?
PATIENT: Neurological issues… Oh, goodness. That’s… a tough one. My mother… she had some problems with her balance when she got older, but I don’t know if that counts. It was just… old age, I think. And my grandfather… he had some memory issues, but again, that was later in life. Nothing… dramatic, if that makes sense. We weren't really a family that talked about illnesses much. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: "Not helpful" is becoming a theme. Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh… well, I'm married, as you can see on the chart. I don't drink or smoke. I don't really go out much, mostly just work and home. It's a quiet life. Nothing… exciting, really. I don't use any recreational drugs, either. Is that what you mean by social history?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is sufficient. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had any reactions to anything. My husband always double-checks when I take something new, just in case, but I’ve never had an allergy. I'm pretty good, thankfully. Is that… good? I sometimes feel like I should have some allergies, but I don't. Is that strange?
DOCTOR: No, it is not strange to not have allergies. Finally, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Just… the usual over-the-counter things if I get a headache, but that’s it. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I believe in letting things… run their course, naturally. Is that… foolish? I sometimes wonder if I should be more proactive, but… well.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's proceed with a brief neurological examination. I'd like to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Please follow my instructions carefully.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A neurological examination. That sounds… serious. Very well, Doctor. I will do my best to follow your instructions. Please, just let me know if I'm doing something wrong. I don't want to… hinder anything.
DOCTOR: Please, lie down on the table. I'll start with your reflexes. Now, relax your legs. I’m going to tap on your knees. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful.
PATIENT: Alright, here I am. Relax my legs… yes, I can do that. It’s just… I don't like surprises, if you know what I mean. But I will try to relax. Please, just tell me what you need me to do. And… maybe warn me before you tap? It’s the unexpectedness that bothers me.
DOCTOR: Right. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, stand up, please. I want to check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger with your index finger?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Touch my nose… and then your finger. Is… is that alright? It feels a bit… off. Like I'm not quite in control of my hand. I'm trying, Doctor, I really am. But it feels… wobbly.
DOCTOR: Coordination appears slightly impaired. Finger-to-nose test is mildly dysmetric. Now, let's check your gait. Please walk a few steps forward, and then a few steps backward. I need to see how you walk.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. My gait… you want to see how I walk. One step… two steps… Oh… that was… a bit precarious. It doesn’t feel very natural, Doctor. It feels like I'm… floating a little. I usually walk much more steadily than this. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Gait is mildly ataxic, with a tendency to lose balance. Alright, Adyn. Based on this brief examination, and given your vague recollection of symptoms, I am concerned about possible cerebellar dysfunction. It's too early to say definitively, but we need to rule out several possibilities. I'm ordering an MRI of the brain to assess for any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: An MRI… and cerebellar… dysfunction? Oh dear. That sounds… very serious. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… is it something terrible? I just came in because my speech was a bit slurred, and now you're talking about MRIs and… and something about my brain. Is it… is it something I should be worried about? Please, tell me… what is going on?
DOCTOR: Adyn, please try to remain calm. “Dysfunction” simply means something is not working as optimally as it should. It does not automatically equate to something “terrible.” The MRI will give us a clearer picture of what, if anything, is going on. Several things could be causing your symptoms – a minor stroke, a transient ischemic attack, even a vitamin deficiency. We need to rule those out first. It's highly unlikely to be anything catastrophic, but it's better to be thorough. I will also order some blood work to check your vitamin levels and rule out any underlying infections. We need to gather more information before we can determine a course of action. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A stroke… you said a stroke? Even a… a minor one? Oh dear. That sounds… frightening. And vitamin deficiency… is that… is that serious too? I… I don’t understand. If it's just a vitamin deficiency, why do I need an MRI? That sounds… awfully drastic for a vitamin deficiency. And what does “transient ischemic attack” mean? I feel… very confused, Doctor. And a little… scared. Please, explain it to me… in a way I can understand.
DOCTOR: Adyn, a transient ischemic attack, often called a “TIA,” is essentially a mini-stroke. It’s a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain. We need to rule it out because it’s a warning sign of a potential future stroke. The MRI helps us visualize the brain and identify any areas of damage. As for the vitamin deficiency, it’s simply to cover all bases. Vitamin B12 deficiency, for example, can cause neurological symptoms similar to yours. It's a simple test, but it's important to rule it out. I understand you're feeling anxious, but we need to be methodical. I've ordered the necessary tests. The lab will call you to schedule an appointment, and the radiology department will contact you regarding the MRI. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: The lab will call… and the radiology department… So… I just wait for them to call? What if… what if it is something serious, Doctor? What if it's a stroke? What happens then? Will… will I be okay? And… how long will it take to get the results? I… I don't like being in the dark. It makes me… very anxious.
DOCTOR: Adyn, let's not jump to conclusions. The vast majority of these symptoms are caused by benign, treatable conditions. If, by chance, it is a stroke, there are treatments available to minimize damage and prevent future occurrences. The lab results should be available within a few days. The MRI will take longer to interpret, perhaps a week or so. We will schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as the results are available. For now, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding any strenuous activity. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Rest… and hydration… and… avoid strenuous activity. Yes, I understand. A week… it feels like a very long time to wait. But… I suppose I have no choice. Thank you, Doctor. For… for explaining everything. And for… for ordering the tests. I… I hope it's nothing serious. I think… I think that's all. For now.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll have the nurse provide you with the lab requisition and the MRI order. Please, don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. Good day, Adyn.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I… I will. Good day.
