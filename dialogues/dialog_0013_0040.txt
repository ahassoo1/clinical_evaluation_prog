DOCTOR: Hi Clearance, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, and I'm one of the family medicine doctors here. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor Morenomartinez. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, my flank – that’s the side of my body, just below my ribs – has been giving me quite a bit of trouble lately. And I keep getting water infections, you see. They tell me it’s because of my kidneys. They're… not quite right, the doctors have said. Polycystic kidney disease, that’s the name of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Clearance. Polycystic kidney disease, right. And you're experiencing pain in your flank and recurrent urinary tract infections. Just to clarify, when did you first start noticing the flank pain?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it’s been coming and going for a while now, honestly. But it feels like it’s been more frequent these last six months or so. Before that, it was just every now and then. Hard to pinpoint an exact date, you understand. It just… gradually got worse. I’d say maybe around December it really started to bother me regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increasing flank pain since around December. And can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a sharp pain, Doctor. It's more of a… a dull ache, really. A heavy feeling, if that makes sense. Sometimes it’s just a constant discomfort, and other times it comes in waves. It mostly stays on my left side, though sometimes it seems to radiate around to my back a little. It doesn’t take my breath away, but it’s… persistent, you see. And it’s enough to keep me from a good night’s sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache, mostly on the left side, radiating to the back, and impacting your sleep. And you mentioned recurrent UTIs… how often have you been getting those in the past year, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I’d say at least four times in the last year. Maybe five. It’s becoming rather… regular, which is what worries me. I always have to go to the doctor for antibiotics, and then it feels better for a little while, but then it comes back. It's a nuisance, really. And uncomfortable, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, four to five UTIs in the last year requiring antibiotics. I’m going to ask a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, smell, amount, or anything like blood in it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. As for my urine… now that you mention it, yes, there has been a change. It’s often cloudy, not clear like it used to be. And sometimes, I notice a stronger smell than usual. A bit… fishy, perhaps? And on a couple of occasions, I have seen a little bit of blood, just a tinge of pink, you understand. Not a lot, but enough to notice. I suppose that's why I keep coming back, isn’t it? It’s all connected, I expect.
DOCTOR: Okay, cloudy urine, a stronger, fishy smell, and occasional pink tinge. Thank you for sharing that, Clearance. Now, thinking a bit broader, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the flank pain and UTIs?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I do feel rather tired these days. More tired than I used to, that is. I just haven’t been feeling my usual self, full of energy. And I suppose my ankles have been a little bit swollen from time to time. Not terribly swollen, just a bit puffy. And, oh! My blood pressure has been a bit high lately, the nurse told me when she took it. Other than that… I can’t really think of anything specific, Doctor. I’m an old man, you know, things ache all over now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, some ankle swelling, and elevated blood pressure. Let’s take a look at your chart to see what the readings have been. So, your blood pressure has been running a bit high recently. I’m going to listen to your abdomen and back, and then check your legs for swelling. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you need me to. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clearance. Your abdomen sounds normal, and I do feel some mild tenderness in your left flank. Your back is also tender in that same area. And I'm noticing some mild swelling in both of your legs. I don’t feel any masses. Your vital signs today are blood pressure 146/92, pulse 78, respiratory rate 16, and temperature 98.6. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. I haven’t had much need for medication in my life, thankfully. Just the antibiotics for the water infections, as we discussed. Everything else has been fine, up until recently, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you've mentioned the antibiotics for UTIs. Can you tell me what medications you're currently taking, even over-the-counter ones or vitamins?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I take a multivitamin every morning, just a standard one from the chemist. And I take a little bit of paracetamol sometimes, when my joints are particularly sore. Perhaps two or three times a week, but not regularly. Apart from that, nothing at all. I try to keep things simple, you understand. I don’t like taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and paracetamol as needed. Thank you, Clearance. Based on what you've told me – the recurrent UTIs, flank pain, fatigue, ankle swelling, and elevated blood pressure – and my exam findings, it does sound like your polycystic kidney disease is progressing and contributing to these symptoms. Your kidneys are likely not functioning as efficiently as they once were. The swelling in your legs could be a sign of fluid retention due to kidney issues, and the elevated blood pressure is often seen in patients with kidney disease. The recurrent UTIs are common as well, as damaged kidneys are more susceptible to infection. I want to order some blood tests to assess your kidney function more accurately – things like creatinine, BUN, and electrolytes. I’d also like to order a urine analysis to check for infection and protein levels. And I think a kidney ultrasound would be helpful to get a better look at the size and structure of your kidneys. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that all sounds very sensible to me. If that's what you think is best, then please go right ahead. I trust your professional opinion. I just want to know what's going on, you see, and what we can do about it. Kidney ultrasound, blood tests, and a look at my urine… yes, that sounds perfect.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'll get those orders entered now. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood tests, and we’ll schedule the ultrasound at the radiology department. It's usually a quick, painless procedure. In the meantime, it’s important to stay well-hydrated – aim for at least eight glasses of water a day. Also, try to limit your salt intake, as that can contribute to fluid retention. And please, if you notice any fever, worsening flank pain, or decreased urine output, contact the clinic immediately. Those could be signs of a kidney infection that needs prompt treatment. I'm going to write you a prescription for a short course of antibiotics, just as a preventative measure, given your history of frequent UTIs. We’ll adjust the treatment plan based on the results of the tests. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Preventative antibiotics, drink plenty of water, reduce salt… and contact you if things get worse. Yes, I understand. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and for making me feel so comfortable. It’s a weight off my mind, knowing we’re finally getting to the bottom of this. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Clearance. You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could help. And don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any concerns. We’ll get these test results back as quickly as possible and discuss them with you then. I’ll have the nurse come in and give you the prescription and go over some written instructions with you. Have a good day, and please take care.
