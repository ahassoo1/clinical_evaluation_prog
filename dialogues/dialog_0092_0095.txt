DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I’d rather not tell you. It’s…obvious. I can’t hear on this side, and half my face feels like it’s going to fall off. Is this really necessary? I mean, couldn’t someone just…look at it? It’s not exactly a subtle problem.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I apologize if this feels unnecessary. However, even when a problem is visually apparent, a thorough assessment is crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment. It allows me to understand the full extent of the issue, consider potential underlying causes, and ensure we’re providing the best possible care. Could you clarify when you first noticed the hearing loss and facial discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, now we’re getting to it, aren’t we? Fine. It started…yesterday afternoon, I think. I was at the market, buying plantains – very important, you understand – and I just…didn’t hear someone call my name. I thought they were mumbling. Then, later, when I was washing my face, I noticed this…droop. It’s gotten worse since then, naturally. Honestly, it’s quite distressing. But I doubt it’s anything serious. Probably just…old age catching up.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Nissenbaum, and it's good you're paying attention to these changes. Yesterday afternoon is relatively recent, and the progression you describe is important information. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about the hearing loss?
PATIENT: More? What more is there to tell? It’s in one ear. I can’t hear out of it. It’s not like it’s fluctuating, or buzzing, or…whatever else people complain about. It just…stopped working. And, as I said, my face feels…weak. Like I'm trying to smile, and it won’t cooperate. Is that sufficient detail for you, Doctor? I have other things I need to do today.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Ms. Nissenbaum. Thank you. Just to clarify, is there any pain associated with the hearing loss or facial weakness?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Absolutely not. It’s…uncomfortable, unsettling, but not painful. Are you suggesting I’m making this up? Because I assure you, I have better things to do than sit here describing the nuances of a failing ear and cheek. Honestly, the entire situation is rather…inconvenient.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Nissenbaum, absolutely not. I am not suggesting that at all. I simply ask to rule out any contributing factors. The sudden onset of hearing loss and facial weakness warrants a thorough examination. I'd like to perform a brief neurological exam, just to assess the function of the nerves in your face and head. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I’m a rational woman. I understand you need to…do your job. But frankly, I find this whole process rather…degrading. A neurological exam? Must we? It sounds…invasive. But fine. Get it over with. Just…try to be quick about it, please. And explain what you’re doing as you go, I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your concerns and will explain each step as I go. It’s a relatively quick exam, and my goal is simply to assess the function of the nerves controlling facial movement and sensation. First, I’m going to check your facial symmetry. I’ll ask you to smile, raise your eyebrows, and close your eyes tightly. This helps me identify any weakness on one side of your face. Could you please smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It feels…wrong. Like I'm trying to move muscles I didn't even know I had. This is ridiculous. I can clearly see it's not working properly. Do you need a magnifying glass, Doctor? It's quite obvious.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Nissenbaum. You are right, there is noticeable weakness on the left side of your face. Now, could you please close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that satisfactory? It won’t close all the way, if you hadn’t noticed. Honestly, this is humiliating. I’ve never felt so…off-balance. Are you sure this isn't just a stroke? Because my sister…well, never mind. Just tell me what you think is going on, Doctor. And quickly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Nissenbaum. You’re right to be concerned, and it’s good you mentioned your sister. Based on what you’ve described and what I’m observing, the sudden onset of hearing loss and facial weakness on one side is concerning for Bell’s palsy. However, to rule out other possibilities, such as a stroke or other neurological conditions, I would like to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly assess your cranial nerves. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: More tests? Cranial nerves now? Honestly, Doctor, are you trying to prolong this? Fine. Do whatever you need to do. But I’m telling you, it’s Bell’s palsy. I read about it once, in a magazine. My face just…gave up. But if you need to listen to my heart and lungs for…reassurance, be my guest. Just get it over with. I have a very important appointment later. Plantains don’t buy themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I appreciate your patience. While your self-diagnosis is possible, it’s important to rule out other potential causes before confirming a diagnosis of Bell’s palsy. It’s a quick exam, and will help me gather more information. I'm listening to your heart and lungs now. Take some deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: There. Done. Perfectly normal, I assure you. I’ve always had a strong heart. Very resilient. My mother always said so. Now, can we please get to the end of this? I’m starting to feel quite lightheaded. And I really need to get to the market before they run out of the good ones.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound clear, Ms. Nissenbaum. Your vital signs are stable. Now, I’d like to briefly check a few other cranial nerve functions, just to complete the assessment. This involves things like checking your taste, gag reflex, and tongue movement. It’s a quick process, and will help me determine the extent of the nerve involvement. Are you ready to proceed?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I am not ready. But I suppose I have no choice. You’ve already subjected me to enough indignities. Just…get it over with. Quickly. And explain everything. I don’t want any surprises. And please, don’t ask me to stick out my tongue. That’s just…unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Understood, Ms. Nissenbaum. I will proceed as quickly and respectfully as possible, and explain each step. I will avoid asking you to stick out your tongue if you prefer. First, I'm going to check your taste on both sides of your tongue. I'll use a cotton swab with a very mild, slightly sweet solution. Please tell me if you can taste anything, and where you taste it. Could you please tell me if you can taste anything on this side?
PATIENT: Hmmm…yes. Faintly. Sweet. Very faint, but…yes. On this side. It’s…unremarkable, really. I have a perfectly good sense of taste. I enjoy plantains, you know. A very discerning palate, I assure you. Get on with it. Is that sufficient detail for your chart?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Nissenbaum. Now, let's check the other side. And on this side?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Blank. Like…a void. See? I told you. One side works perfectly, the other…doesn't. This is getting ridiculous. Can we please get a diagnosis now? I'm wasting valuable plantain-buying time.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Nissenbaum. Based on your symptoms – the sudden onset of hearing loss on one side, facial weakness, and the difference in taste sensation – I am highly suspecting Bell’s palsy, also known as facial paralysis. Bell’s palsy is thought to be caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, which controls movement of the muscles in your face. It often resolves on its own within a few weeks to months, but treatment can help speed recovery and reduce symptoms. To confirm the diagnosis, an MRI would be beneficial to rule out other potential causes, but given your description and the lack of other neurological symptoms, I feel reasonably confident in this assessment. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Finally. Bell’s palsy. I knew it. But an MRI? Honestly, Doctor, are you trying to bankrupt me? I don’t have insurance, you know. And what kind of treatment are you talking about? Steroids? More indignities? Look, I just want this to…go away. Can you just give me something to make it better? And quickly? I need to get back to the market. And frankly, I don’t have time for a lengthy discussion about the nuances of facial nerve inflammation.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Nissenbaum. An MRI is ideal for a definitive diagnosis, but it is not always necessary, especially given your clinical presentation. Given your lack of insurance and the acute nature of your symptoms, we can proceed with a treatment plan without it, but I will need to document the risks and benefits of this approach. The standard treatment for Bell’s palsy is a course of oral corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to reduce inflammation. These can help improve the chances of a full recovery and minimize the risk of complications. We may also consider lubricating eye drops to protect your eye, as you may not be able to close it completely. Would you be comfortable starting a course of corticosteroids?
PATIENT: Steroids…great. More pills. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like a guinea pig. But…fine. Do whatever you think is best. I just want this to be over. What’s the dosage? And are there any…side effects? I have a very important social calendar, you know. I can’t afford to be…indisposed. And please, don’t tell me I need to avoid salt. I love plantain chips.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Nissenbaum. I assure you, we will do everything we can to minimize any side effects. The typical dosage for prednisone is 60mg daily for five days, then gradually tapered off over the next five days. Common side effects can include temporary increase in appetite, mood swings, and difficulty sleeping. Less common side effects can include increased blood sugar and blood pressure, but these are usually mild and temporary. We will monitor you closely during the course of treatment. While avoiding excessive salt is generally recommended, it's not a strict requirement. Please just be mindful of your overall diet and let me know if you experience any concerning symptoms. Here is a prescription for prednisone. I’ll also provide you with information about lubricating eye drops to protect your eye. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe pain, vision changes, or difficulty breathing, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Just…get me out of here. I need to get to the market before everything good is gone. Honestly, this has been…a waste of my valuable time. And make sure someone tells me where the nearest pharmacy is. Don't expect a thank you note. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. Here is the address of a pharmacy just a few blocks away. I understand your frustration, and I hope you feel better soon. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I hope you find all the good plantains! .
