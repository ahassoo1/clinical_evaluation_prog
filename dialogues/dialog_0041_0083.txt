DOCTOR: Hi Early, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, hello Doctor. It’s… Kammer, Early Kammer. I got a note from my, uh, the people at the… the place. Said I should get a card. A “get well” card, they said. From you. Is that right? Seems silly, but… well, they said.
DOCTOR: Right, Early Kammer. Yes… the "get well" card. That's… hmm. It sounds like you might have had some recent testing or a check-up arranged through the clinic?
PATIENT: Testing? Oh. Maybe. I go to a lot of places. Medicare sends me here, there, everywhere. Old age, you know. Boilers, that's what I do. Stationary Engineer. Important work, keeps the heat on. But… testing. I don’t rightly recall a test. What kind of test are we talkin’ about?
DOCTOR: Okay… let's see… Early Kammer, born… August 12th, 1969. Alright. It looks like you had some blood work and a chest x-ray done about a week ago, August 26th. The results flagged a few things, which is why we wanted to get you in for a chat. Do you recall going to the lab and getting blood drawn, and having an x-ray?
PATIENT: August 26th… Hmm. That… that might be the day I went with Maria. My niece. She drives me. But… what’d we do again? Blood… oh, yeah. Prickin’ and pokin’. Didn’t like that part. X-ray… somethin’ with a big machine. But flagged? What does flagged mean, Doctor? Is somethin’ wrong? I don't understand all these fancy words.
DOCTOR: “Flagged” just means the results weren’t quite normal, Early. It doesn’t automatically mean something is seriously wrong, okay?
PATIENT: Not normal… Well, I ain’t normal, never was. Spent thirty years around hot metal and steam. Probably messed me up a little. But… what kinda not normal? Is it… bad? Tell me straight, Doctor. I don’t need sugar-coating. And don't use them big words.
DOCTOR: Okay, straight, no fancy words. Your blood work showed your white blood cell count was a little high, and the x-ray showed a small spot on your lung. That spot could be a lot of things, Early. It could be old scarring, or it could be something new. The high white blood cell count often means your body is fighting something off - like an infection. We need to figure out what’s going on. Do you have any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kinda symptoms? I get tired easy, that's for sure. Old age, like I said. And my cough… it’s always been a little rough. Boilers, Doctor, the dust… But I ain’t been sick, nothin’ you could put your finger on. Just… worn down. Is that what you mean? And this spot… on my lung? Is it… is it cancer? Just tell me, Doctor. Don’t beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: Okay, Early. It's good you're being upfront with me. It’s completely understandable to be worried about cancer, and it is something we need to rule out. The spot on your lung could be cancerous, but it also could be something else – like an old infection or even just a bit of scarring. Because of the spot and your slightly elevated white blood cell count, I want to get a better look. I’m going to recommend a CT scan of your chest. It's a more detailed x-ray, and it will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… more pokin’ and proddin’, huh? I swear, they just like to make old people miserable. But… if you say so. If it'll tell you what's goin' on… alright. But I want it quick. I got things to do, you know. Boilers don't run themselves. And… what if it is bad? What then, Doctor? Don’t leave me hangin'.
DOCTOR: I understand, Early. We’ll get the CT scan scheduled as quickly as possible - I’ll have the scheduler call you this afternoon with some times. And you're right to ask about what if. If it is something serious, there are a lot of options. Depending on what we find, it could be anything from medication to more involved treatments. We would discuss all of that, step-by-step, and I would refer you to a specialist – a pulmonologist – who would guide you through it all. They’re the experts in lung conditions. Before we schedule, do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… Never heard of it. Allergies… not that I know of. I eat everything Maria puts in front of me. She's a good cook, but sometimes gets fancy. But no, no allergies. I’ve been livin’ a long time, I'd know if I was allergic to somethin’. So… this scan… it won’t hurt, will it? And how long will it take to get the results? I ain’t got all day to sit around waitin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies is helpful. The CT scan itself doesn’t usually hurt, Early. You'll lie on a table that slides into a big machine. You'll need to lie very still for a few minutes while the pictures are taken. Sometimes they give you a drink with contrast dye before the scan to help the pictures be clearer. As for results… typically, it takes a couple of days for the radiologist to read the scan and send the report. I'll call you as soon as I have it, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss everything. Now, before we get you scheduled, let's quickly go over your medical history. Do you have any other health problems, like diabetes, heart trouble, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yeah. Doctor gave me pills for it, years ago. Still take ‘em. Other than that… just old age, like I said. Maria worries about my cholesterol, makes me eat oatmeal. But I ain’t got no fancy diseases. Just a tired, old boiler operator. Now, about this scan… is it expensive? Medicare coverin’ it? I don’t want no big bills showin’ up.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, that’s good to know. Let me check... Yes, Medicare should cover the CT scan, Early. There might be a small co-pay, depending on your plan, but we’ll have the billing department confirm everything before you go for the scan. They can answer all your questions about costs. Do you take any other medications besides the pills for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the pills, Doctor. Little white ones. Take ‘em every mornin’ with my coffee. Maria makes sure I don’t forget. She’s good that way. Now, can we just get this scan scheduled? I got work to do, you know. Boilers don't run themselves, and old man Hernandez is always lookin' for a reason to complain.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s get this scheduled. I’ll have the scheduler give you a call this afternoon. They can work around your schedule as much as possible. They’re usually pretty good about that. Is there a good number to reach you at?
PATIENT: Maria’s number is best. She answers it right away. It's 718-555-1212. Tell her it's about the scan. She’ll get it all sorted out. Now… can I get that card from you? The “get well” one? The people at the… place… said I needed it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Early. 718-555-1212. Perfect. I'll make a note for the scheduler. And yes, the card. It seems like it was just a formality, part of the follow-up process after the testing. Here you go. It has my contact information on it, so don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your scan. Now, let’s get you scheduled and hopefully get some answers. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s good. Maria will like this. She worries about me. Alright, I think that’s all for now. Just get this scan done quickly, and tell me what's goin' on. Boilers are waitin'. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Early. We will. I’ll make sure of it. Take care, and I’ll talk to you soon. And don’t worry too much – we’ll figure this out. .
