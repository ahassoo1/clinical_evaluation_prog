DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Honestly, I don’t quite know where to begin. Everything just feels…heavy. I suppose that’s why I’m here. My daughter insisted on it, you see. She said I haven’t been myself lately.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your daughter looking out for you, Ms. Derasmo. It’s often helpful to have a loved one’s perspective. When you say “heavy,” could you elaborate on that for me?
PATIENT: Elaborate… yes. It’s difficult to put into words. Just… a lack of joy, I suppose. Things I used to enjoy – my garden, seeing my grandchildren – they don’t bring the same…spark. I find myself wanting to be alone more and more. And I sleep…too much, or not at all. It’s a bit of a mess, really.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly difficult, Ms. Derasmo, and it’s perfectly valid to feel overwhelmed when things shift like that. It’s good you’re acknowledging these changes. To help me understand the situation a little better, how long have you been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. I… I think it started maybe six months ago? Around the time of my birthday, perhaps. It’s all a bit blurry, to be frank. It wasn’t sudden, you understand. It crept up on me slowly. I initially just thought it was…age.
DOCTOR: It’s common to attribute changes to age, Ms. Derasmo. Six months is a significant amount of time, though. Has anything specific happened in the last six months that might have contributed to these feelings?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific? Let me think. My divorce was finalized about a year ago, but that was… expected. We hadn't been happy for a long time. My son moved to California for a new job, which I was very proud of, but I miss him terribly. And…oh dear. Old Mrs. Abernathy passed away last month. She was my best friend. Perhaps…perhaps that’s it. The loneliness has been particularly acute since then.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Derasmo. Those are all significant life changes, and it's completely understandable that they would be affecting you. Losing a friend, especially a close one, can be incredibly difficult. And moving away from family is often hard on everyone. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Let me see. I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, no complications. High blood pressure, controlled with medication. Otherwise… fairly healthy for my age, I believe. I used to be very active, you know? Lifeguarding, ski patrol… but I haven't been doing much of that lately. Not the energy.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or any other conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And…oh, and a Vitamin D supplement. My daughter keeps telling me I need more Vitamin D. She worries about me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I used to eat anything and everything, you know? But truthfully, my appetite hasn’t been very good lately. I mostly just pick at my food.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. And finally, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother had arthritis, quite severe. My father… he had heart problems. He passed away when I was quite young. And my sister… she’s healthy as a horse, thankfully. No history of… what do you call it? Mental illness? Depression? No, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…fine. Though I must say, I’ve always been rather particular about my personal space. No offense, Doctor.
DOCTOR: None taken at all, Ms. Derasmo. I completely understand. I will explain everything as I go and be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated today, but that can be common in a clinical setting. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, but I'm noticing your breathing sounds a little quieter than usual in the lower parts of your lungs. It might not be anything significant, but we'll keep it in mind. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes… Oh dear. I always felt a bit silly when people tapped my knees with that little hammer. Are you sure it’s necessary? I have a rather sensitive system, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask, Ms. Derasmo. We can certainly skip the reflexes if you’re uncomfortable. It’s more important that you feel at ease. I’m going to do a quick assessment of your mood and cognitive function with a few simple questions, if that's alright. It's just a way to get a broader picture of how you’re doing. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, questions are fine. Much better than that hammer. As long as it doesn’t involve too much…remembering things. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll keep it simple. First, can you tell me what today’s date is, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s August… the 2nd? Yes, the 2nd of August. 2025, isn’t it? I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Very good. And can you tell me where we are today?
PATIENT: Where we are… Oh dear. Is this a trick question? We are… at the doctor’s office. Dr. Glowka’s office, in… the suburbs, I believe. My daughter chose it. She said it was “convenient.”
DOCTOR: That's right. And finally, can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? Oh, alright. Let me hear them.
DOCTOR: Apple, table, penny. Please try to remember those words, and I'll ask you to recall them later. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your sleep. You mentioned sleeping too much or not at all. Can you describe what a typical night looks like for you?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s a disaster, truly. Some nights I’ll be awake for hours, just staring at the ceiling. My mind races, you see. Then, other nights I’ll sleep… and sleep… and sleep. Until noon, sometimes. It’s very disruptive. I try to get up and do something, but I just… lack the energy. It’s a vicious cycle.
DOCTOR: That sounds very challenging, Ms. Derasmo. Do you have any difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early?
PATIENT: All of the above, Doctor, truly. It takes me ages to fall asleep, then I wake up several times during the night. And even when I do manage to get a few hours, I wake up feeling… exhausted. As if I haven’t slept at all. It's most peculiar.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any changes in your appetite or weight, beyond what you already mentioned?
PATIENT: Well, as I said, my appetite isn’t what it used to be. Everything just tastes… bland. And yes, I’ve lost a little bit of weight, I think. My clothes are a bit looser, but I haven’t actually weighed myself recently. I just haven't felt inclined to bother.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in things you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That’s… that’s the core of it, really. Everything feels… pointless. The garden doesn’t hold the same appeal, my grandchildren… well, I still love them, but I don’t feel the same…spark. And there’s a constant feeling of… emptiness. It’s difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly difficult, Ms. Derasmo, and it’s good you’re able to articulate that. Based on what you’ve told me – the low mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep and appetite, fatigue, feelings of emptiness – it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes first. I’d like to order a few blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t particularly like needles, but I suppose it’s better to be thorough. Is it going to be much blood?
DOCTOR: Just a standard amount, Ms. Derasmo. A couple of vials. The lab technician is very skilled, and it should be relatively quick and painless. We’ll also check your Vitamin D levels, as you mentioned your daughter is concerned about that. In the meantime, I’d like to discuss some options for managing your symptoms. We could consider starting a low dose antidepressant medication, or we could explore therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, which can be very effective in treating depression. Would you be open to discussing either of those options?
PATIENT: Medication… Oh dear. I’ve always been wary of medication. My mother had a bad experience with something years ago. Therapy… I suppose I could consider it. But I’m not sure. I’m a rather private person, you see. It feels difficult to talk about these things, even with a doctor.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly valid, Ms. Derasmo. It takes courage to even consider therapy, and it's completely understandable that you'd feel hesitant. It's important to find a therapist you feel comfortable with, someone you can trust. I can provide you with a list of therapists in the area who specialize in geriatric depression. For now, let’s focus on the blood tests. We'll get those results back within a few days, and then we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I would encourage you to try to maintain a regular sleep schedule, eat nutritious meals when you can, and engage in gentle exercise, even if it’s just a short walk. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… the blood tests. And… thank you, Doctor. For listening, at least. It’s…helpful to have someone take me seriously. My son sometimes dismisses it as “getting old.”
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Derasmo. It's my job to listen and take your concerns seriously. And I'm sorry to hear your son isn't as supportive as he could be. It’s important to remember that these feelings are valid, and seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Alright, I’m going to print out these orders for you, and the lab technician will be right in to draw your blood. They'll explain the process to you. Once you've had the blood tests done, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss the results and create a plan that's right for you. Would that work?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…fine. A follow-up appointment. Very well. I suppose I should get this done then, shouldn’t I? The blood tests, I mean. Thank you again, Doctor Glowka. You’ve been… very kind. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Derasmo. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, Ms. Derasmo. And remember, you’re not alone in this. .
