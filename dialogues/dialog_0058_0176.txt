DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been… oh, let me think… more than two days now, I think. It's really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, huh?
PATIENT: Yes! It sounds silly, I know. But it's not just a few little ones. It’s… constant. Like this. hic See? And it’s tiring! I manage a small entertainment venue, you know, a little place with belly dancing and music. It’s hard to talk to people when I keep… hic …doing that.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, hiccups are usually self-limiting. Have you tried anything to get rid of them?
PATIENT: Oh, lots of things! My niece, she told me to hold my breath. I did that, a lot. And drink water upside down. That just made a mess. Someone at work suggested a spoonful of sugar. Didn’t work either. Honestly, I’m running out of ideas. I just thought… well, after two days, shouldn’t they have stopped by now? hic It feels like something more than just… hiccups.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you said two days… any other symptoms accompanying these hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… the hiccups. hic I haven’t felt sick or anything. No fever, no stomach pain, nothing like that. I’ve been a little… tired, maybe. But that’s probably just from being up late at the venue, you know? And the hiccups keeping me awake! It’s just… frustrating. hic I’m usually very good at managing things, and this is… well, it’s throwing me off.
DOCTOR: And your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Nothing major, I don't think. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. And I had a bad bout of the flu a few years ago, but that was it. I don’t really go to the doctor much, if I can help it. hic I generally just try to rest and get over things myself. I’m divorced, if that matters… and I don’t have any insurance, which is why I waited this long to come in, to be honest. hic It’s just getting worse, and I was worried something serious was going on.
DOCTOR: Any family history of… anything like this?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she had terrible indigestion sometimes. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had a lot of trouble swallowing as he got older, but I don't know if it was anything like hiccups. He just… had difficulty with food. And my sister, she gets migraines… but no, I don’t think anyone in my family has ever had hiccups that lasted this long. hic It really is strange. It’s not like me to be bothered by something like this. I usually just… hic …push through.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a listen to your lungs and abdomen, just to rule things out. Then we’ll see.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. hic I just want this to stop! I have a show tonight, and I really don’t want to be hiccuping through the whole thing. hic It’s embarrassing, you know?
DOCTOR: If you could just lie back for me, please. Take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Okay, here we go. hic Deep breath… hic This is a bit awkward, isn’t it? hic Trying to take a deep breath while hiccuping… it’s not very effective.
DOCTOR: Lungs sound clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. A little…distended, but not significantly. hic You're right, it is difficult to examine you while you’re… occupied. I’m going to need you to sit up now.
PATIENT: Okay. Distended? What does that mean? hic Is that bad? And is it…related to the hiccups? hic I haven’t been eating much lately, because I’ve been so busy with the venue, maybe that’s it? hic I just feel a bit…lost, you know? I usually handle everything myself.
DOCTOR: It just means your stomach is a little full. It could be related to the hiccups, it could not be. We'll need to rule out some other possibilities. I want to check your blood pressure and pulse. It's routine.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. Blood pressure and pulse… yes. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. hic I just… I really hope you can figure out what's going on. hic It’s just so… persistent. hic Is there anything I should be worried about? Like, is this something serious? hic I try not to worry, but… two days is a long time for hiccups, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Pulse is normal. As for being worried… it’s unlikely to be anything serious, but prolonged hiccups can be a symptom of various underlying conditions. We need to investigate.
PATIENT: Investigate? hic What kind of conditions? hic Oh dear. hic That doesn’t sound good. hic Are you talking about… something I should be really worried about? hic I’m starting to feel a bit anxious now, to be honest. hic Maybe it’s just stress from the venue… but two days… it feels like something more. hic What kind of tests do you want to do? hic And will they be expensive? hic I really don’t have a lot of money, Doctor. hic
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions. It could be something simple. First, I want to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. That will give us a baseline. We’ll also do a chest x-ray just to rule out anything in your lungs. As for the cost… I’ll have the billing department give you a breakdown. I can’t give you an exact figure right now. But we'll see what the results say first. We’re just being thorough.
PATIENT: Okay… hic A blood test and an x-ray… hic That sounds… a lot. hic But I suppose you’re right, it’s best to be thorough. hic Will I need a referral for the x-ray? hic And how long will it take to get the results? hic I have a show tonight, and… well, I really need to know if I’ll be able to perform. hic Is there anything I can do in the meantime? hic Any home remedies that might actually work? hic Or something to calm me down, maybe? hic This is really stressing me out. hic
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll need a referral for the x-ray. I’ll write that now. As for home remedies... honestly, most are anecdotal. Try sipping ice water slowly, or holding your breath again, but don't strain yourself. And as for calming down… I can prescribe a mild anti-anxiety medication if you think that would help. It won’t cure the hiccups, but it might take the edge off. The results will likely be back tomorrow. Until then… try to rest, and avoid anything that might exacerbate the issue. Let’s just see what the tests reveal. I'll print out the referral and the lab orders for you.
PATIENT: Okay… a referral and lab orders. hic And maybe the anti-anxiety medication… yes, that might help. hic I’m just so tired of hiccuping! hic It’s exhausting. hic Thank you, Doctor. hic I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. hic I really hope it’s nothing serious. hic Two days… it just feels like forever. hic Is there anything else I should be doing? hic Anything at all? hic I feel like I’m missing something… hic Oh, and will the anti-anxiety medication make me drowsy? hic I need to be alert for the show tonight. hic
DOCTOR: The anti-anxiety medication is a low dose, so drowsiness should be minimal, but it's a possibility. Avoid alcohol while taking it. As for anything else… keep a log of when the hiccups occur. Note anything you were doing or eating beforehand. It might help us identify a trigger. Honestly, I doubt it will be anything significant, but it’s worth a try. I've also included a list of potential side effects for the medication. Read it carefully. And try to relax. I'll call you tomorrow with the results. If anything changes, or if you develop any other symptoms, call the office immediately. .
PATIENT: Okay… a log, read the side effects, and try to relax. hic Easier said than done, I think. hic Thank you again, Doctor Todorovich. hic I’ll try to keep a log and I’ll read everything carefully. hic I really appreciate your help. hic I guess I’ll just… go get the tests done and see what happens. hic Thank you. hic Goodbye.
