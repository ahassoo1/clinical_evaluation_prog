DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hello Doctor. My heart… it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s beating too fast, but not… regular fast. More like flapping, maybe? It started a few weeks ago, I think. August 1st, maybe? Or was it July 31st? I remember I was making tea… strong tea.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Funny” isn’t a very specific symptom, but I understand you’re feeling palpitations – that feeling of a rapid or irregular heartbeat. And you're saying this started around the end of July, beginning of August?
PATIENT: Yes, palpitations. That’s… that’s a good word. Yes. It’s not every day, you know? Sometimes it happens when I’m just sitting. Sometimes when I walk up the stairs. It doesn’t hurt, just… worrying. And yes, end of July, beginning of August. Maybe a little more than two weeks ago? I make a lot of tea, strong tea, like my father used to. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it's intermittent - not happening constantly. And it seems to be brought on by… everyday activities, like sitting or climbing stairs. And you mentioned your father also drank strong tea. Yes, that could matter. Caffeine is a stimulant. But we need to rule out other things first. Can you describe exactly what you feel when this happens?
PATIENT: Okay, intermittent. Yes, that’s a good word for it. It's like… a fluttering in my chest. Not a hard beat, like thump-thump. More like… a bird flapping its wings inside. Fast, but not strong. And it makes me a little… dizzy, sometimes. Just for a few seconds. Not fall-down dizzy, just… light. Like when you stand up too fast. And yes, my father, he drank maybe five cups a day. Very strong. I drink… maybe three, usually. Sometimes four. Is four too much?
DOCTOR: Okay, “fluttering” and dizziness. That’s helpful. And you only experience the dizziness during these episodes?
PATIENT: Yes, only during. When the heart… flutters. It starts with the flutter, then I feel a little light. It doesn't last long, maybe ten or fifteen seconds. Then it goes away. I sit down, take a breath, and I’m okay. It just… scares me a little, because I don’t know what it is. And my wife… she worries. She says I should come to the doctor. That's why I'm here. August 2nd, today. I remember. She drove me.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s good you came in. We’ll figure this out. Let’s start with a listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your blood pressure. Just relax and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay, yes. Relax. I can relax. Is this cold? It feels… cold. And I try to breathe, yes. Slow and steady. August 2nd is a hot day, you know? Very hot.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little elevated, 98 beats per minute, and I’m hearing a slight irregularity. Blood pressure is 130/80. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart again, but this time I want you to stand up slowly. We’ll check for postural changes.
PATIENT: Okay, 98. Is that bad? I usually… I don’t know what my usual is. I don't often check. It’s okay… I’m standing. A little dizzy again, maybe. August 2nd is a strange day. Is it okay to sit back down?
DOCTOR: Yes, please sit. That’s good information. Your blood pressure dropped slightly when you stood up, which could explain the dizziness. We need to do some further testing to figure out what’s going on. I want to order an EKG, which will record your heart’s electrical activity, and some blood work – a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Those will give us a better idea of what’s happening. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, EKG and blood work. Yes, that sounds… good. If it will help. A complete… what was it? Blood count? And something panel? Will it take long? My wife… she’s waiting. August 2nd is a long day already. And will it cost much? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: A complete blood count checks your red and white blood cell levels, and the basic metabolic panel checks your kidney function and electrolyte balance. It shouldn't take long – about 15-20 minutes for the blood draw and EKG. As for the cost… I understand you don’t have insurance. Let me see what the cash price will be. It'll be approximately $150 for the blood work and $100 for the EKG. We can also look at some resources for assistance programs if that’s too much. While we’re waiting for the results, I want you to cut back on caffeine significantly – no more than one cup of tea a day. And stay well-hydrated.
PATIENT: Okay, $250. That’s… a lot. But maybe we can manage. And yes, one cup of tea. I can do that. It will be hard, but… I can do it. August 2nd is testing me. And stay… hydrated. Water? Yes, I can drink water. Is there anything else I should do? My wife… she makes very strong tea. Should I ask her to stop completely?
DOCTOR: Yes, it would be best if your wife also reduced her tea consumption. We need to eliminate caffeine as a contributing factor as much as possible. For now, focus on the hydration and the one cup of tea. And try to get some rest. Are you experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness outside of these episodes?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. And no shortness of breath. And lightheadedness… just during the flutter. When the heart… flutters. When I stand up sometimes, maybe. A little wobbly. But not outside of that. August 2nd… it’s a strange feeling. Like something is wrong, even when nothing is happening. Is that normal? And will the test… will it tell me what is wrong? My wife… she worries a lot.
DOCTOR: It’s normal to feel anxious when you’re experiencing unexplained symptoms. The EKG and blood work will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. If those come back normal, we can consider other possibilities, such as anxiety or a benign arrhythmia. The test won't necessarily tell us exactly what’s wrong, but it will give us valuable information. For now, let's focus on getting the tests done, reducing caffeine, and staying hydrated. We’ll go from there. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Maybe… will I feel worse before I feel better? From the tests, I mean. August 2nd is a confusing day. And thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for not laughing about the tea.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Puder. And no, the tests themselves shouldn’t make you feel worse. A little pinch with the blood draw, that’s all. Okay, let's get you over to the lab. The technician will take care of you. And don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns after the tests. We'll review the results as soon as they come back.
PATIENT: Okay, yes. Thank you, Doctor. August 2nd… maybe it won’t be so bad after all. .
