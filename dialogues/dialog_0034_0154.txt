DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Claudene. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, well, it’s… the water. It keeps bothering me. It’s happened a few times now, I think. I don’t really… remember exactly when, but it’s not nice. A bother, really. Is that enough? I don’t like being here, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating to have something bothering you, especially if it's difficult to pinpoint. "The water" – could you tell me more about that, Claudene?
PATIENT: Well… it feels like when you need to… go. But it hurts, you see? And it feels like it doesn’t finish. Does that make sense? It’s a burning feeling, mostly. And I have to go often. I don't know why. Old age, I suppose. Is there a test for this? I'd like to be quick, if possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. It sounds like you’re experiencing some discomfort with urination – a burning sensation and a frequent urge to go, even when you don't feel completely empty. That's definitely something we should investigate. Old age can certainly bring about changes, but these symptoms aren’t necessarily just a part of getting older, and it's important to rule out other possibilities. Yes, there are tests we can do. First, let's gather some more information. When did you first notice this happening?
PATIENT: Oh dear. When… hmm. That’s difficult. It was… warmer weather, I think? Maybe spring? Or was it last summer? I really can’t be sure. It comes and goes, you see. Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's… worse. I don't keep track of these things. Is it important to know exactly when? Because I simply don't recall. I have a daughter, but she doesn’t call much. She wouldn't know either.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Claudene. It’s not always easy to remember exact dates, and it’s more important to get a general sense of the timing. So, roughly speaking, it's been happening for several months, maybe since spring or last summer?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. Several months. And… it feels worse when I forget to drink enough. I get very busy, you see. I work on the campers. Recreational Vehicles. It’s a lot of bending and lifting, and I don’t always remember to take a break for water. Does that… matter? Is that causing it? I’d rather not stop working.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful to know, Claudene. Dehydration can certainly irritate the bladder and contribute to these symptoms. It’s good you’ve noticed that connection. The bending and lifting can also put pressure on your bladder. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I'd like to ask you a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Oh! Blood? Goodness. I… I don't think so. I haven’t really… looked. I try not to. It’s… unpleasant. But I don’t recall seeing anything. Not that I’ve noticed. I’m sorry, that’s probably not a helpful answer. I'm a bit squeamish, you see. Can we just get this over with? I have a camper to fix before the weekend.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Claudene. It’s perfectly alright. We don't need to dwell on anything unpleasant. Okay. Have you experienced any pain in your lower back or side?
PATIENT: Lower back… hmm. Sometimes. I do a lot of bending, like I said, and my back aches. But I just assumed it was from the work. Old age, again, probably. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache. Does that count? I have a heating pad I use. That helps a bit. I really need to get back, if you don’t mind. This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, thank you. A dull ache in your lower back is certainly relevant. One more question, Claudene, and then we can move onto a quick examination if you're comfortable with that. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or nausea?
PATIENT: Fever? No. No fever. And no chills, and no… what was that other word? Nausea? No, I haven't been sick to my stomach. I eat regularly, mostly sandwiches and coffee. I'm very regular that way. Honestly, Doctor, I think it’s just the water. And the work. And getting older. Can we please just be done? I have a Mr. Henderson waiting on a repair. He’s not a patient man.
DOCTOR: Alright, Claudene. I understand. Let’s proceed with a quick examination. It will just involve listening to your abdomen and a simple urine test. The urine test will help us rule out an infection. If you’re comfortable, please have a seat on the table, and we’ll get started. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Fine. Just get it over with quickly, please. I do not like hospitals. Or doctors. This is very… undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright, Claudene. Just relax as best you can. I’m just going to press gently here, and listen with this. Your abdomen is soft, with no obvious tenderness to the touch. I don't feel any masses or enlarged organs. Your bowel sounds are normal. Now, I'd like to collect a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup, and I’ll step out of the room to give you some privacy. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, and then collect a small amount in the cup mid-way through. Are you able to do that?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… easy enough. I do that all the time. Just give me the cup, and let me get it over with. I really must get back to work. Mr. Henderson is… particular. And I do not want to keep him waiting any longer. Honestly, this whole thing is rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you go. I’ll just step outside, and I’ll be right back when you’re finished. Please just let me know when you’ve collected the sample.
