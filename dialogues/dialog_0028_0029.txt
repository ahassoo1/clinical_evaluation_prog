DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Obarr, is it?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s me. Norval Obarr. Though most folks just call me Norval. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Memmolo, is it? I saw your name on the door.
DOCTOR: Yes, Memmolo. Doctor Memmolo. And… you’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Well, it’s a funny thing, really. I just… don’t seem to be able to eat much anymore. I get full awful quick. It's been going on for a couple months now, maybe three. Doesn’t hurt, just… stops being appealing after just a few bites. My wife, Elsie, she’s been worried about me.
DOCTOR: A few bites… and this is… everything you eat?
PATIENT: Not everything, no. I still try to have three meals a day. But, say, a bowl of oatmeal? I used to polish off a big one. Now, half a bowl and I’m done. Same with a sandwich. A couple of bites and… that’s enough. It’s just… strange. I ain't changed what I eat, not really.
DOCTOR: And you say this started… three months ago?
PATIENT: Roughly, yeah. It didn’t happen overnight, more like it crept up on me. At first, I just figured I wasn’t as hungry as usual. Old age, you know? But it’s… persistent. Elsie keeps making me these smaller and smaller plates, which is sweet, but… it feels wrong, somehow. Not eating a proper meal.
DOCTOR: “Proper meal.” Right. And have you noticed any… other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I can think of. I sleep alright, maybe a little more than I used to, but that could be the weather. No stomach pain, no… well, no nothing, really. Just the early fullness. I haven’t lost any weight, Elsie checks, but I’m already pretty thin, so I don’t know if that means anything. I feel okay, just… not very hungry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been much of a pill-taker. Elsie tries to get me to take something for my joints sometimes, but I usually just rub some cream on them instead. I try to stay away from the doctor as much as possible, to be honest. That’s why I waited so long to come in about this. Didn't think it was anything serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s have a quick look. Just a basic exam, to… rule things out. If you'll just hop up there for me.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. No problem. Though I don't know what you're expectin' to find. I feel pretty good, all things considered. Just this… fullness, you know? Elsie always said I was a stubborn old man. Maybe she's right.
DOCTOR: Alright. No tenderness here… bowel sounds are present, though a little… diminished. No distension. Your weight is… consistent with your chart, 54 kilograms. And your height is 165 centimeters. Skin turgor is… acceptable, but you are quite thin.
PATIENT: That's what Elsie says too, about bein' thin. I used to be a bit heavier, workin' on the boats. But that was a long time ago. Boats don’t need much of a fella these days, all machines and computers. Diminished… what was that word? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: "Diminished" just means… quieter. The sounds of your stomach aren’t as… robust as they could be. It's not necessarily bad, but it could indicate something. I’d like to order some blood work. Just to check your levels, rule out anything obvious. And perhaps a stool sample. To check for… other issues.
PATIENT: Blood work and… a stool sample? Oh dear. Elsie is gonna be thrilled about that one. I suppose if it'll help figure out what's goin' on… alright. What do I need to do? And how long will this take? I got a fishin' trip planned with Old Man Hemlock next week, wouldn’t want to miss that.
DOCTOR: The blood work is standard. You'll need to fast for eight hours beforehand. The stool sample… the lab will give you instructions. It's… not pleasant, but necessary. As for your fishing trip… we should have results back within a week, possibly sooner. If anything significant comes up, we’ll need to discuss further testing. But for now, let’s just get these tests done. The lab is down the hall, second door on the left. Elsie can help you with the instructions, I presume?
PATIENT: Yes, Elsie can handle the instructions, no problem. She's good at all that. Alright. Down the hall, second door on the left. Eight hours fastin'… and a stool sample. This is turnin' into a whole ordeal. Well, I suppose it's better to know than not know. Thanks, Doctor Memmolo. I appreciate you lookin' into this. Tell you what, if Old Man Hemlock catches anything bigger than me next week, I'm blamin' you.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. We’ll see. The lab will contact you to schedule the tests. And if you experience any… worsening symptoms – nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain – come back immediately. Otherwise, I’ll review the results when they come in. Good day, Mr. Obarr. .
PATIENT: Right. Well, thank you again. I’ll let you get back to your work. And, uh… good day to you too, Doctor. Elsie will be happy to hear we have a plan.
