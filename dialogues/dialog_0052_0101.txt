DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor Shely. A pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back of my head, you know? Been botherin’ me for a little while now. Not constantly, mind you, but when it comes on, it really comes on.
DOCTOR: I understand. A headache at the back of your head that comes and goes, and is quite bothersome when it does occur. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It doesn’t feel like a throbbing pain, exactly. More like…a tight band, squeezin’ the back of my skull. And sometimes it goes down my neck a bit. It’s worse when I’m stressed, I’ve noticed. And if I’m lookin’ down for too long – like when I’m doin’ someone’s toes – it really flares up. I do nails, you see. Manicures and pedicures. Been doin’ it for…well, a long time now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that's helpful. A tight, band-like sensation at the back of your head, radiating down the neck, worsened by stress and prolonged looking downwards – particularly while you're doing nails. I appreciate you describing it so clearly. To get a better understanding, could you tell me about how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see…it started, I’d say, maybe…six months ago? At first, it wasn’t too bad, just a little niggle now and then. I figured it was just from bein’ on my feet all day. But it’s been gettin’ worse lately. More frequent, and lasts longer each time. And it’s startin’ to interfere with my work, if I’m honest. Can't always concentrate when my head's achin'. It’s not every day, but…enough to be a bother.
DOCTOR: So, it began approximately six months ago, initially mild and infrequent, but has gradually worsened in both frequency and duration, and is now impacting your ability to work. I understand that must be frustrating. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the headache at its worst?
PATIENT: Hmm, zero to ten, you say? Well, I’ve had headaches in my life, proper migraines, you know? This isn’t that bad. Never gone above a…seven, I reckon. Maybe an eight once or twice, when I'm particularly stressed and tired at the same time. Most of the time, it’s a four or a five. Still bothersome, mind you. Makes it hard to focus. I’m a bit of a worrier, you see. My wife always tells me to calm down.
DOCTOR: A seven to eight at its worst, usually a four or five, and impacting your concentration. And I understand you sometimes experience stress. Thank you for clarifying that. Now, I’d like to ask about other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your vision – blurred vision, spots, or any loss of vision?
PATIENT: Vision, you say? No, not really. My eyesight ain’t the best – need glasses for reading, as you can see – but that’s been the same for years. No blurriness or spots, thankfully. No loss of vision at all. I can see just fine. Except for up close, of course. That’s why I wear these. No, no changes in my vision at all, other than what I usually experience.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or sound when you have these headaches?
PATIENT: No, no nausea or vomitin’ at all. Thankfully. And no sensitivity to light or sound either. I can handle bright lights just fine. And loud noises don’t bother me any more than usual. My wife likes her music a bit loud sometimes, and it doesn't make the headaches worse. Just annoys me, that's all. No, doctor, no nausea, no vomitin', and no sensitivity to light or sound.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. No nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or sound. Now, have you had any fever, neck stiffness, or weakness in your arms or legs recently?
PATIENT: No fever, no neck stiffness, and no weakness in my arms or legs. I still manage to get around just fine, thank you very much! Keep busy with the nails, you see. It keeps me young. No, nothing like that. I’ve been feelin’ alright, other than the head pain, of course. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn’t at my age?
DOCTOR: Good. And just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your sleep pattern recently?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, now that you mention it, I haven’t been sleepin’ as soundly lately. Not keepin’ regular hours, you see. My wife and I like to watch a little television before bed, and sometimes we stay up a bit later than we should. And I tend to wake up a couple of times during the night, have to get up and use the restroom. But nothing major, really. Just not as restful as it used to be. I used to be able to sleep like a log!
DOCTOR: Okay. So, slightly disrupted sleep, not as restful as before. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor told me years ago my blood pressure was a little high. Put me on some pills for a while, but I stopped takin’ them after a bit. Felt better without them, to be honest. No diabetes, thankfully. And no arthritis either. I do get a little stiffness in my back sometimes, but that’s just from bein’ on my feet all day with the nails, I reckon. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. My wife keeps tellin’ me I’m too stubborn to get sick!
DOCTOR: Okay, history of mildly elevated blood pressure, managed previously with medication but discontinued, and no history of diabetes or arthritis. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had the need for any, thankfully. A few stitches here and there when I was a boy, climbin’ trees and such, but nothing major. Never been under the knife. Never had to be. No, no surgeries, doctor. All natural, you could say. Though my wife might disagree!
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother, she had heart trouble when she got older. Had to go to the hospital a few times. And my father, he had a stroke, I believe. That was a long time ago, though. My sister, she had some sort of cancer, but I don’t remember exactly what kind. It was a while ago now. As for me…knock on wood, I haven't had any of those troubles myself. That's about all I can recall, doctor. We didn't talk about medical history much back in my day.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. History of heart trouble in your mother, stroke in your father, and cancer in your sister. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No medications. Stopped takin’ the blood pressure pills years ago, as I said. And no vitamins or supplements either. My wife tries to get me to take somethin’ for my joints, but I don't like takin’ pills. I prefer to just keep busy and stay active. The best medicine is exercise, that's what I always say! No, doctor, nothin' at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova, thank you for providing me with such a detailed history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be causing your headaches. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is currently 142/88, your pulse is 76 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6, which are all within acceptable ranges, though your blood pressure is a little elevated. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Next, I'm going to check your range of motion in your neck and shoulders. You have some slight tightness in your neck muscles, particularly on the left side, and your range of motion is a little limited, but nothing significant. Finally, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam, checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength and coordination are good. Overall, the physical exam is largely normal, with some mild neck muscle tightness. Based on your history and the physical exam, it seems likely you are experiencing tension headaches, possibly exacerbated by stress and prolonged forward head posture related to your work. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the ongoing nature of the headaches, I would like to order some blood work just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable, doctor. Blood work can't hurt, I suppose. I wouldn't want nothin' serious bein' missed. Yeah, go ahead and order the blood work. And thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease a bit, knowin’ what’s goin’ on. Tension headaches, you say? That sounds about right. Workin’ over nails all day is stressful, and I probably do hunch over a bit. But better safe than sorry, as they say. Let’s get those tests done.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll write an order for a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. These tests will give us a good overview of your overall health and help rule out any other potential causes for your headaches. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend a few things. Firstly, try to manage your stress levels. Perhaps some relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises or meditation. Secondly, make sure you're maintaining good posture while you're working, and take frequent breaks to stretch your neck and shoulders. Finally, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help relieve the pain, but don't take them for more than a few days at a time without talking to me. I also want to emphasize the importance of keeping an eye on your blood pressure. If you have access to a home blood pressure monitor, I recommend checking it regularly and keeping a log of your readings. If it consistently remains elevated, we may need to discuss medication options. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That all makes sense, doctor. I can try to manage the stress a bit better – my wife’s been tellin’ me that for years! And I’ll definitely try to remember to stretch more while I’m workin’. Good posture…that'll be the hardest part, I reckon. No home blood pressure monitor, unfortunately. We're not really the type for all that fancy equipment. I guess…what kind of results should I be lookin’ for if somethin' is wrong? I don't know much about blood work, to be honest. Should I be worried if somethin’ shows up?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mr. Popova. We're looking for a few key things. Primarily, we're checking your blood cell counts to rule out anemia or infection. The metabolic panel will give us information about your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolytes, which can sometimes contribute to headaches. And the thyroid test will assess your thyroid hormone levels, as an underactive thyroid can also cause headaches and fatigue. If something does show up, it doesn't necessarily mean you should be worried. Many abnormalities can be easily treated. We’ll discuss the results in detail, and I'll explain what they mean and what the next steps are. If further testing is needed, we’ll do it. If medication is required, we'll discuss your options. The goal is simply to get a clear picture of your overall health and ensure we're not missing anything. I'll give you a copy of the lab order and instructions on where to go to have the blood work done. It should only take a few minutes, and the results should be back within a few days. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, doctor. You've explained it all very clearly. I appreciate your patience with an old man like me! I’ll go get the blood work done as soon as I can, and I'll try to relax a bit more and stretch my neck while I'm workin'. Thank you for takin' the time to listen and figure things out. I feel much better just havin' a plan of action.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Popova. It was my pleasure. Remember, if your headaches worsen or you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, stiff neck, vision changes, or weakness, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here's the lab order and a summary of the recommendations we discussed. I'll see you back in a few days to review the results. Have a good day, and try to take care of yourself. .
PATIENT: Thank you kindly, doctor. You too. I will. And I'll try to be a good patient.
