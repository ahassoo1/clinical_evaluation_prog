DOCTOR: Hi Delron, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, the army, see? They want me to take this... test. Before they let me sign up, proper. Gotta make sure I'm fit enough, I suppose. Though, frankly, I'm in better shape than half the lads I work with. Not that they could handle this work, mind you. It's precise stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a medical evaluation for army enlistment. I understand. And you're feeling generally healthy, just needing to fulfill the requirements?
PATIENT: Generally healthy? Of course I am! Look at me. Six foot two, and… well, I don't carry extra weight, do I? I work with engines all day, it keeps a man strong. It's not like I'm sitting behind a desk pushing papers. Though, my wife, bless her heart, she worries about my back sometimes. It's just a little ache after a long day, nothing a good lie-down can't fix. Are we nearly done here? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. So, six foot two, and you mentioned you’re at a healthy weight. You work with engines, which is physically demanding. And a bit of back discomfort after work, which you attribute to the job. That's helpful. Just to clarify, when did you first notice the back discomfort?
PATIENT: First notice? Goodness. That’s a question. Probably… oh, I don't know, ten years ago, maybe? It comes and goes. Like I said, nothing serious. Just… old age creeping in, I suppose. It’s not like a sudden injury or anything. More like… wear and tear. You know, like a machine. Needs a bit of oiling now and then. Is this really important? It doesn’t stop me lifting anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, ten years of intermittent back discomfort, related to your work. No specific injury. I just want to rule out anything serious before signing off on the paperwork for the army. Could you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Describe the pain... well, it’s not sharp, if that makes sense. More of a… dull ache, really. Across my lower back. Sometimes it goes down my legs a little, but not always. It's worse when I’ve been bending a lot, or lifting something heavy, obviously. And after a long day standing. It eases off when I sit down, or lie flat. Like I said, it’s not debilitating. I can manage. And honestly, I don't see what this has got to do with joining the army. Are they trying to get out of taking anyone? Because it sounds like a good way to do it.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache in the lower back, sometimes radiating down the legs, worse with bending, lifting, and prolonged standing, relieved by sitting or lying down. I understand your frustration, and I assure you I'm not trying to prevent you from enlisting. The army has specific physical requirements, and we need to document your medical history thoroughly. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness, tingling, weakness? No. Not at all. Look, I can walk perfectly fine. Run, even. I walk all over that workshop floor, no problem. Honestly, you're asking a lot of questions about a bit of backache. It’s not like I’ve broken anything or something. Are you a proper doctor? My father always said you get doctors who listen, and doctors who ask a lot of questions. You seem to be more of the question-asking type. Perhaps you should just check my blood pressure and be done with it?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Delron, and I apologize if I’m asking a lot of questions. I am a doctor, and my priority is to ensure your health and safety, and to accurately document everything for the army's requirements. Even a seemingly minor backache can be important. To be thorough, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and range of motion. Then we can check your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I got things waiting for me. And I'm telling you now, it’s a waste of time. But if you must, get on with it. But be quick about it. I don't want to be here all day. And don't go poking around too much, alright? Just do what you have to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just step over here and lie down on the table, that would be great. We'll start with your reflexes. I'll need you to relax your legs.
PATIENT: Relax? Easier said than done when someone’s about to poke at your legs. Get on with it then. The sooner this is over, the better. And try not to take too long, alright? My back is already starting to ache just lying here. Honestly, this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, good reflexes bilaterally. Now, I'm just going to ask you to lift each leg, one at a time, against my resistance. Just a gentle lift. Can you tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort with that?
PATIENT: No, no pain exactly. It’s just… a bit stiff. Like I said, it hasn’t been oiled properly. And you’re pushing against me, aren’t you? That's hardly fair, is it? You’re making it harder than it needs to be. Honestly, a bit of discomfort is to be expected. I work with machines all day. My muscles aren’t exactly soft and pliable, you know. Are we nearly done now? I'm starting to feel a bit awkward lying here.
DOCTOR: Okay. Some stiffness noted, but no significant weakness. Now, I’m just going to gently feel along your spine. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Does this feel painful anywhere?
PATIENT: Ooh! Careful there! Yes, that spot. That's where it always bothers me. Not excruciating pain, but… yeah, that’s tender. See? I told you something was there. It’s always been a bit sensitive. Probably pulled something years ago. It never really healed properly. Honestly, you’re poking around now. Leave it alone. It’s just a bit of discomfort. It doesn’t mean anything. Can we be finished now? I’m feeling quite uncomfortable. And I’m starting to suspect you’re deliberately trying to find something wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I'm just trying to pinpoint the source of the discomfort. It sounds like there's some tenderness in your lower lumbar spine. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it seems like you have some chronic lower back pain, likely related to muscle strain. It doesn’t appear to be anything acutely serious. However, I do recommend some preventative measures and further evaluation. I'm going to recommend a course of physical therapy to strengthen your core muscles and improve your posture. It could also be beneficial to see a chiropractor for some spinal adjustments. Would you be open to those options?
PATIENT: Physical therapy? A chiropractor? Honestly. You’re going to send me to someone to rub my back? I’ve managed perfectly well for years without all that nonsense. And the army wants someone who can lift things, not someone who's had their back pampered by a… a back-rubber. No, thank you. I’ll manage. I always do. It’s just a bit of wear and tear. Like I said. Just… can I get a letter saying I’ve been examined? And that I’m… fit enough? I need to get this over with so I can get on with my life. Honestly, this whole thing has been a waste of time. Are you sure you're a doctor? Because my grandfather always said… never mind. Just the letter, please.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Delron. I respect your decision to decline the physical therapy and chiropractic referral. However, I strongly advise you to consider them if your pain worsens. Here's a summary of our examination, documenting your chronic lower back pain and the absence of any acute neurological deficits. It states you are generally fit for duty, but recommends avoiding heavy lifting and repetitive strain. I’ve also included some basic exercises for strengthening your core muscles that you can do at home. Please, listen to your body, and don't hesitate to seek medical attention if your pain increases or you experience any new symptoms. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. That’s it. Just… no. Thank you for your time. Though, frankly, it was a bit of a… fuss over nothing. I'll be going now. A bit of backache. Honestly. Some doctors just want to find something wrong.
