DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Geho, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Chelise Geho. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Dechêne, isn’t it? I saw your name on the door.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dechêne. And you can skip the pleasantries, if you don’t mind. I have a rather full schedule. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, of course. Sorry. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a bit high. Hyperlipidemia, it called it. I don’t really understand all those big words, to be honest. That's why I'm here. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia… yes, well, it can be. Depends on the numbers, of course. Do you have that letter with you, Mrs. Geho?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here you are. It was tucked way down at the bottom. I tend to put everything in here!
DOCTOR: Hmm. Total cholesterol 240… LDL 160… Yes, alright. Not catastrophic, but certainly warrants attention. Have you been previously diagnosed with high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, never. This is the first time anything like this has come up. I feel pretty good, actually. I walk every day, I eat… well, I try to eat healthy. Mostly vegetables and fish, not a lot of red meat. I bake a lot, though... does that count against me?
DOCTOR: Baking… yes, that likely contributes. It's the saturated fats, you understand. Have you noticed any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? And my ankles have been a bit puffy lately, but I thought that was just the heat. We had a really warm spell last month. I don't have any pain or anything like that. Is high cholesterol supposed to feel like something?
DOCTOR: Not usually, in the early stages. That's precisely why it's important to monitor it. Now, let's run through some basics. Any family history of heart disease, high cholesterol, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father… he had a heart attack when he was in his sixties. And my mother’s brother… he had a stroke. Both sides of the family, I guess. They didn’t really talk about cholesterol back then, though. It was more just “heart trouble.” Is that… important? Should I have mentioned that earlier?
DOCTOR: It’s… relevant. Family history is always important. Alright. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, like I said, I walk a lot. About three miles most days. I live alone, so I mostly keep to myself. I read, I do a little gardening… I don’t smoke, never have. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes… maybe three or four times a week? Is that bad? I didn't think it was that much.
DOCTOR: Three to four glasses of wine daily is… significant. Alcohol consumption affects lipid levels. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. Just standard things. Blood pressure, pulse… I'll listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I always feel a little silly when people listen to my heart. It usually sounds perfectly normal to me. But I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse 72, regular. Heart sounds… normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No edema in extremities, though ankles did appear slightly puffy. Alright. Given your family history and lifestyle, along with these results, we’ll need to address this hyperlipidemia. I'm going to order some further blood work - a complete lipid panel, and a fasting glucose.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. A complete lipid panel… is that different from the first test? And what’s a fasting glucose? Do I have to do anything special for those tests? Like, not eat breakfast? I'm not very good with medical stuff.
DOCTOR: A complete lipid panel gives us a more detailed breakdown of your cholesterol levels, including different types of HDL and LDL. And yes, a fasting glucose requires you to abstain from food for at least eight hours before the test. No food, no sugary drinks… water is fine. The lab will give you specific instructions. I'll also recommend a low-cholesterol diet and increased physical activity. Start by cutting back on the wine. Significantly. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No food for eight hours, cut back on the wine… and more exercise. It’s just… hard sometimes, you know? Especially living alone. But I’ll try. Can you give me a list of foods I should avoid? Or a website I can look at? And… is the wine really that bad? My mother always said a little bit was good for the heart.
DOCTOR: Your mother’s advice is… outdated. A little alcohol might have some benefits, but three to four glasses daily negates them. I'll print out a handout on a heart-healthy diet. It will outline foods to limit - saturated and trans fats, cholesterol-rich foods, processed meats. There are numerous websites as well, but frankly, I recommend you focus on the handout. And if you are unable to adhere to the diet and lifestyle changes, we may need to discuss medication. Here. Schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks after your blood work. We'll review the results. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Thank you, Doctor Dechêne. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything… even if I’m a bit overwhelmed. I’ll try my best to follow your advice. And I’ll schedule that follow-up appointment. .
DOCTOR: Very well. That will be all. The nurse will see you out. .
