DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Reflux, Doctor. Just… reflux. It’s what happens when you get old, you know? Food comes up. Not pleasant. I’ve had it for… well, a while now. Let's just get this over with, alright? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Reflux… yes, quite common. "A while now," you say?
PATIENT: Months, maybe? I don’t keep track of these things. It’s not like it’s a new development, Doctor. It happens after I eat, mostly. Big meals. Spicy things. Though honestly, sometimes it happens with just… anything. It’s just annoying, really. I took some of those antacids, the pink ones, but they barely do anything anymore.
DOCTOR: Months… after meals, especially larger or spicier ones. And the antacids aren't providing much relief now. Do you find it happens with all foods, or are there certain things that are worse than others?
PATIENT: Well, obviously spicy things are worse. And fatty things. Look, Doctor, I’m not a complete idiot. It’s common sense. But yeah, lately even… toast bothers me. It's getting ridiculous. I used to be able to eat anything. This whole thing is a waste of time, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, even bland foods like toast are now causing some trouble. And it sounds like it’s been gradually worsening, even with the antacids. Just to be thorough, Mr. Altine, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the reflux?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I get a little heartburn, if that's what you mean. And sometimes… sometimes it feels like something’s stuck in my throat. But it's probably just… old age again. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t have time for a full inventory of my ailments. Are we getting anywhere with this or not?
DOCTOR: Heartburn and a sensation of something stuck in your throat. Okay. And have you experienced any difficulty swallowing – like food taking longer to go down, or needing to take extra sips of water with meals?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I eat. It goes down. Sometimes it feels a little… slower, alright? And yeah, I might have a drink of water with my meal, like a normal person. What is this, an interrogation? I’m telling you, it’s just reflux. I don’t need a detailed examination of my swallowing technique. It’s common sense! People get older, things slow down. It's not rocket science. Are you going to give me something for this or not? I have a garden to tend.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. And I appreciate you explaining things. I just want to be thorough. Difficulty swallowing, even mild, can sometimes indicate more than just typical reflux. Let’s do a quick exam, just to rule things out. It won’t take long. Could you open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: An exam? Absolutely not. I didn’t come here for a poking and prodding session. I told you what’s wrong. It’s reflux! Give me a prescription and let me get on with my day. I haven't got all day to sit here while you examine my throat like I'm some sort of… animal. Honestly, I expected better. Just write the prescription, Doctor. I think I’ll be finding another doctor if this is how you treat patients. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. I understand your wishes. However, given your reported difficulty swallowing, and the fact that the antacids aren't helping, I'm concerned about the possibility of something more serious. I’m going to recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist. They can perform a proper evaluation, including an endoscopy, to determine the cause of your symptoms. I can provide you with a list of specialists in the area. Is that acceptable?
