DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lennie Tkac, as you know. I am here today to get myself cleared for a senior living facility. I believe my daughter arranged this visit. She is a very thoughtful woman.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that here. Your daughter, Bethany Tkac, scheduled this comprehensive assessment. A senior living facility, right. Well, let's get some information down. Do you have any specific concerns about your health that the facility might need to be aware of?
PATIENT: That is correct, Bethany is her name. A good girl, always looking out for me. As for concerns… well, I am eighty-one years young, Doctor. Things aren’t quite what they used to be. My knees ache when the weather changes, and I sometimes forget where I put my spectacles. But nothing major, mind you. I still bake a good loaf of bread, and that requires some strength and memory!
DOCTOR: Right. “Not quite what they used to be.” I understand. We’ll need to be more specific than that, Mr. Tkac, for the facility’s records and to ensure your safety. Let's start with these aches. When did you first notice them, and how would you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. Specifics. Yes. Let me think… the aches, well, they’ve been coming and going for a few years now, I suppose. Maybe five years? They started gradually, a little stiffness after a long walk. Now, they’re mostly in my knees, and they really flare up when it rains or gets very cold. The pain… it’s not sharp, not like a sudden injury. It’s more of a dull ache, a deep discomfort. Makes getting up and down a bit difficult, especially first thing in the morning. I mostly just work through it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned forgetting where you put things – your spectacles, specifically. Has this forgetfulness been getting worse?
PATIENT: Yes, it has, a little bit. It’s not that I can’t remember things, Doctor. It’s more that they… slip my mind temporarily. Like, I’ll set my spectacles down, go to get something else, and then… poof! Gone from my memory where I put them. It usually comes back to me eventually, though. Sometimes it takes a few minutes, sometimes a bit longer. It’s mostly small things like that, keys, where I left the newspaper… nothing important, mind you.
DOCTOR: “Nothing important.” Right. We'll need to assess your cognitive function a little more thoroughly to determine the extent of this "slipping of mind," as you put it. Before we do that, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, medical history. A long one, I’m afraid. Let me see… I had a bout of pneumonia when I was sixty-five, but recovered fully. And the doctor told me years ago I have a touch of arthritis, that’s why my knees bother me. He gave me some cream for it, and I use that when they’re particularly sore. Otherwise, I’ve been fairly healthy, all things considered. I’ve always been a worker – baking keeps me moving. And I’ve never had any trouble with my heart, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia, arthritis… and any surgeries, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes, as a young man, I had my appendix removed. That was a long time ago, maybe sixty years ago? Everything went well, no complications. And… oh! I had a cataract removed from my left eye about ten years ago. That improved my vision greatly. Other than those two things, I haven’t been under the knife, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Appendix, cataract… Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Ah, family history. That’s a bit… complicated. My mother lived to be ninety-two, a strong woman. She had a bit of trouble with her joints later in life, much like myself. My father, he passed away when I was young, from a heart ailment. And my sister… well, she had some memory troubles as she got older, but I don’t know the specifics. It was a long time ago, and we weren’t very close. Mostly, it seems we just age… and things happen.
DOCTOR: Right. “Things happen.” Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, vitamins, or over-the-counter supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see… I take a small pill for my blood pressure, Doctor. The doctor prescribed it a few years back. And I take a daily vitamin, just a standard multivitamin. Helps keep me going, or so I’m told. Other than that, I don't take much. Sometimes I’ll take some ibuprofen for my knees when they’re really bothering me, but that’s about it. I prefer to rely on good, hard work and a healthy diet whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had any allergic reactions that I’m aware of. I’ve always been able to eat anything and everything. And I’ve never had any trouble with medications, as far as I remember. I’ve been fortunate in that regard, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Tkac, to complete this assessment for the facility, I need to perform a brief physical exam. This will include checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a few simple neurological tests to assess your memory and reflexes. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly agreeable. I understand the need for a thorough examination. I have nothing to hide, and I want to make sure the facility is well-informed. Please, proceed as you see fit. I trust your professional judgment.
DOCTOR: Good. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is elevated, 150/90. Heart sounds are normal, but slightly distant. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions, Mr. Tkac. Please answer to the best of your ability. Do you know what year it is?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I do. The year is 2025. August the second, to be precise. A warm day, isn’t it? I always pay attention to the date. It’s important to know these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me the name of the current President?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… The President… now, I believe it is… Mr. Biden. Joseph Biden, yes. That is correct, isn't it? I follow the news when I can, though it isn't always very cheerful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words after me. Remember them, as I’ll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Go ahead.
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny. Yes, I have them. Apple, table, penny. A simple enough task. I pride myself on my memory. Baking requires remembering many ingredients and timings, you see.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head. Reflexes are diminished. Balance is slightly unsteady. Alright. Now, can you please tell me those three words I asked you to remember?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… Apple, table… and… oh dear. It’s right on the tip of my tongue. Apple, table… you see, I knew I had it. It was something… small. Shiny. A coin, perhaps? It’s… frustrating. It will come to me, I’m sure. It was apple, table… and…
DOCTOR: Penny. Mr. Tkac, while you eventually recalled the word, the delay is concerning. Your reflexes are diminished, your balance is unsteady, and your cognitive recall is…suboptimal. I’m concerned about your ability to safely reside in an independent living facility without increased risk of falls or cognitive decline. We need to discuss a more thorough neurological evaluation and potentially a referral to a geriatric specialist.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Well, that is…disappointing. I was hoping to simply settle in and enjoy my later years. I still feel… capable, you see. Baking is a demanding task, requires focus and coordination. But I trust your professional judgment, Doctor. If a more thorough evaluation is needed, then so be it. Perhaps it is simply a matter of age…and I do not notice the decline myself. Whatever is best for my safety…that is what I want.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will write a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a geriatric specialist in the city. She can conduct a more comprehensive assessment and make recommendations for your care. In the meantime, I strongly advise against moving into the facility until we have a clearer understanding of your condition. It is better to be safe than sorry. Do you have any questions for me, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe I do. You have been very thorough, and I appreciate your honesty. I understand the need for caution. Perhaps…perhaps my daughter was a bit too eager. As for questions… I suppose I will simply wait for Dr. Vance’s assessment. Thank you for your time, Doctor. And please, extend your thanks to your staff. They were very kind as well.
DOCTOR: Very well. My staff will be in touch to schedule your appointment with Dr. Vance. I'm providing you with a printed summary of our discussion and the referral information. Take care, Mr. Tkac. And do be careful.
