DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudeney. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don’t really do doctors. It’s probably just stress. My husband keeps telling me to come in, but… well. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to feel hesitant about coming to the doctor, and it sounds like you're here primarily to reassure your husband, which is very considerate of you. We’ll try to make this as straightforward as possible. “High blood pressure” is a good starting point. Do you know what your blood pressure reading was, or when it was taken?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. He had the machine. One of those things you strap on your arm. He was fussing over it all last week, writing numbers down. Said it was… high. That’s all I know. I don't pay attention to numbers, honestly. They just give me a headache.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can certainly check it here today to get a baseline. It’s good that your husband was monitoring it. Do you know if he took multiple readings over several days, or was it just a one-time thing?
PATIENT: Several days. Every morning, I think. He's… particular. He likes things done right. He was muttering about averages and stuff. Look, is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you letting me know that you're short on time. We’ll try to be efficient. Knowing he took multiple readings and was calculating averages is helpful. It gives us a better idea of what’s going on. Before we take your blood pressure, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General health? What does that mean? I work. I'm married. I don't… sit around. Is that what you want to know? I eat normal food. Nothing fancy. I don't have any… problems, as far as I know. He would complain if I did.
DOCTOR: That’s a good start. When you say “normal food,” could you describe a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Okay, fine. Breakfast is usually toast. Sometimes with eggs if I have time. Lunch is a sandwich. Usually ham and cheese. And dinner… whatever my husband makes. He likes to cook. Mostly meat and potatoes, I guess. And vegetables sometimes. He tries to make me eat healthy. It's… a lot of beans. I don't really like beans.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. Thank you. And do you drink a lot of caffeine – coffee, tea, soda?
PATIENT: Just coffee. One cup in the morning. Sometimes two if I'm really tired. My husband drinks, like, a whole pot, but I can't stand it. Makes my heart race. He says I'm too sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, or use any other tobacco products?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. My grandmother smoked and it was… awful. I wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole. My husband tried it once, years ago, but he quit after a week. Said it wasn't for him.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, grandparents, siblings – has high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She was always tired. She died when I was young, so I don’t really remember. And my father… he worked hard. He didn’t really have time for doctors. He just… wore out, I guess. No one really talked about health stuff. It wasn’t something we did. Does that answer your question? I really don't know much about my family's health. It's all kind of… hazy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s common for families not to discuss these things. Knowing your mother had some heart issue is helpful. It’s good you shared that. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions yourself?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've been healthy my whole life. A little tired sometimes, but who isn’t? I don’t go to the doctor, remember? What would I be diagnosed with? I just need you to tell my husband I’m okay, so he’ll stop worrying. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I assure you, we’ll get to the bottom of this. Even if everything is okay, it’s good to have a baseline for your health. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but they just put a cast on it. That's it. No big deal. Honestly, I think my husband is making a mountain out of a molehill. He always worries too much. It's exhausting. Can we just get this over with? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: I hear you. We'll try to make this as quick as possible. Just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. I can eat anything. He's always asking if I'm allergic to something, but… I'm not. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. He worries about that too. It's ridiculous, honestly. Just… no allergies. Can we please move on? I'm starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t do medication. I believe in letting my body heal itself. He tries to get me to take vitamins, but I refuse. He says I'm stubborn. He's probably right, but I don’t want to be dependent on pills. I just want to feel normal. Are we almost done? I have a list of things to do, and this is taking way too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. That's helpful. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure. Then we'll get a better idea of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Quickly, please. I really don't like being touched by strangers. It makes me… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please have a seat and relax. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Your heart rate is a little fast, 88 beats per minute, and rhythm is regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. And your blood pressure is 148 over 92. That is elevated. Your pulse is 76. I’m noting these down. Elevated blood pressure is what your husband observed, and confirms his concern.
PATIENT: Elevated? What does that mean? Is it bad? I knew I shouldn't have come here. This is exactly what I was afraid of. Now I'm going to have to take pills or something, aren't I? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I feel perfectly fine. I just… get stressed sometimes. That's all. Can we just write a prescription for something and get this over with? I don't want to sit here and talk about numbers all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Elevated blood pressure means your blood is pushing harder against your artery walls than it should be. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need medication immediately, but it does need to be addressed. It’s good we’re getting this checked out now. Before we talk about treatment options, I'd like to order some basic blood work and a urine test. These will help us rule out any underlying causes for the elevated blood pressure, and give us a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Urine test? Blood work? Seriously? Now you're just trying to scare me. I told you I'm fine. It’s probably just stress. I work hard, I have a lot on my plate, and sometimes I get a little worked up. That’s all. I don’t need a bunch of tests. I just want a note saying I'm okay, so my husband will leave me alone. Can you please just write something? Anything? I really don't want to do all this. This is… exhausting. Just let me go home.
DOCTOR: I understand you're feeling overwhelmed, and I apologize if I'm adding to your stress. I truly want to help, and the reason I’m recommending these tests isn’t to scare you, but to get a complete picture of your health and rule out anything serious. High blood pressure, even if it’s stress-related, can lead to more significant problems down the road if left unchecked. However, I hear you saying you don’t want a lot of tests right now. We can take a different approach. I can write a note stating you’ve been evaluated, and your blood pressure is elevated, but that we’re starting with lifestyle modifications – reducing stress, diet changes, and regular exercise – and will recheck it in a month. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. Just write the note. Tell him I'm doing those things. Tell him whatever you need to tell him, just so he’ll stop fussing. And make it quick. I have things to do. Honestly, this whole thing has been a waste of my time. Just… write the note, and let me go home. And no urine tests. Definitely no urine tests.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm writing a note for your husband stating that you were evaluated today, your blood pressure was elevated, and we are recommending lifestyle modifications including stress reduction techniques, dietary changes, and regular exercise. We will recheck your blood pressure in one month to assess progress. I'm also going to give you a handout with some information about healthy eating and stress management. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one month, same time, same place, to review your progress. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. One month. Just… please don’t make me come back here if I don’t want to. I'll… I'll try the things on the paper. Happy now? Can I go now? Seriously. I have errands to run. And I really don't like hospitals. Or clinics. Or doctors. This whole experience has been incredibly unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are free to go. I understand this wasn't a pleasant experience, but I'm glad we were able to address your concerns, and I hope the lifestyle changes will be helpful. If you do decide you want to come back for a follow-up, or if you experience any concerning symptoms before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. Take care, Ms. Dudeney. And I hope you have a good rest of your day. .
