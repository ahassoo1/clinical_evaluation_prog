DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor… Smetak, was it? Yes, yes. Well, frankly, I don't much feel like being poked and prodded. I've lived a long life, you know. A long life. And I think I've had enough of doctors telling me what I need. It’s just… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Wynell. It sounds like you've had quite a bit of experience with healthcare already. And I assure you, I'm not here to tell you what you need, but to listen to what's bothering you and see if there’s anything I can help with. It's perfectly alright if you don't want a lot of poking and prodding. Perhaps you could just tell me what’s been on your mind lately?
PATIENT: Oh, it's just… my feet, really. They ache. Dreadfully ache. But honestly, aches and pains come with age, don’t they? My mother used to say… something about it. Something about being old being a privilege. I can’t quite remember. But they’re just… there. And I don’t want anyone messing with them, giving me injections or… whatever it is doctors do. It never helps, you know. Never. I had a bunion once. Terrible thing. They wanted to operate. I said no. And it went away on its own. Eventually.
DOCTOR: Yes, aches and pains often do come with age, you’re absolutely right. And it's good you listen to your body. Your mother sounded like a wise woman. So, these aches... are they in both feet, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, dear. Both of them. Though… the left one is worse. It feels… swollen, sometimes. Not terribly, but enough to notice. I mostly just wear comfortable shoes. Wide ones. Used to wear heels, you know. Back in the day. But those days are long gone. And even with the comfortable shoes, it hurts to stand for long. Though, what's the point of standing for long these days, anyway? I mostly sit.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, the pain is in both feet, but more noticeable in the left, and you've noticed some swelling there as well. And it's worse when you're standing for a while. When did you first start noticing this swelling, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… Dates are just a blur. It must have been… last spring, maybe? Or was it the spring before? It comes and goes, you see. Some days it's barely there, and other days… well, other days I have to put my feet up. I can't say for sure when it started. I just remember thinking, “Oh, my foot feels a bit puffy.” And then it went away, and then it came back. It’s just… an annoyance, really. Not a crisis.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it comes and goes, started sometime last spring or the spring before, and is more noticeable in the left foot. And you’ve been managing it mostly by resting and wearing comfortable shoes. To help me get a better idea of what might be going on, could you tell me if anything specific seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm. Well, if I'm on my feet all day – like, visiting my niece, she lives a ways away, and we go walking around town – it gets much worse. And if it’s a hot day, too. Heat makes everything swell, you know. It always has. My grandmother used to say… something about the heat. But I can’t recall what. Honestly, doctor, I just try not to overdo it. That's what my late husband always said. "Don't overdo it, Wynell." He was a sensible man. A very sensible man.
DOCTOR: It sounds like walking and hot weather tend to aggravate it. And it’s good you listen to your husband's advice. To get a clearer picture, Wynell, would you mind if I just took a quick look at your feet?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to look at them. After all that talk about not poking and prodding? I suppose… I suppose a quick look wouldn't hurt. But don't go rummaging around in there! Just a glance, you hear? A quick glance. And no needles, doctor. Absolutely no needles. I’m very firm on that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Wynell. A quick look is all I’m suggesting, and no needles, I promise. I just want to see what’s going on. I'll explain everything as I go. Alright, let's take a look. I see some slight swelling on the left foot, as you mentioned, and a little bit of redness. It doesn’t seem terribly inflamed. Feeling along here… there’s some tenderness on the top of the foot, and along the side as well. It doesn't seem to be acutely painful when I touch it, though. I'm also checking the circulation in your feet. Your pulses feel good, strong and regular. It looks like your skin is warm to the touch, which is good as well.
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, that doesn’t sound too bad, does it? Not terribly inflamed… strong pulses… I suppose that's good. I’ve always had good circulation. My mother always said I had a robust constitution. She was very proud of that. Though, I always suspected she exaggerated. She was a bit of a… storyteller, you see. So, what does all this mean, doctor? Am I going to need one of those fancy machines? I don’t want to be stuck in a hospital. I’ve had quite enough of hospitals in my life.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound too bad at all, and you’re right, your pulses are very strong. We don’t need any fancy machines at this point. Based on what you've told me and what I've seen, it sounds like you might have some mild arthritis in your feet, possibly aggravated by the walking and the heat. Arthritis is very common, especially with age. And it's definitely manageable. To be sure, we could get an X-ray to see exactly what's going on in the bones, but if it’s causing you significant discomfort, and it sounds like it's not, we can try some simpler things first. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Arthritis, you say? Figures. Everything goes eventually, doesn’t it? I suppose that makes sense. My sister had it in her hands. Terrible thing. Couldn’t knit anymore. But I don’t want to go around thinking I'm falling apart! As for the X-ray… honestly, I don't see the point. If it's just arthritis, what good will a picture do? I’d rather just try those “simpler things” first. If you think that’s best. But no needles, doctor. I can’t stress that enough. No needles, whatsoever.
DOCTOR: Alright, no needles, I promise. And you’re right, an X-ray isn’t essential at this point. We can definitely try some simpler things first. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help with the pain and inflammation. We can also try some home remedies, like icing your feet for 15-20 minutes several times a day and elevating them when you’re resting. Wearing supportive shoes, as you’re already doing, is excellent. The most important thing is to listen to your body and not overdo it. If the pain gets worse, or if you develop any new symptoms, like numbness or tingling in your feet, we'll need to take another look. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible enough. Pain relievers, ice, supportive shoes… things I can manage myself. And listening to my body. My late husband always said, “Pace yourself, Wynell.” He was a very practical man. Yes, I suppose that will do. Though, I do worry about the swelling. It comes and goes, you see. Is that something to be concerned about? Is it a sign of something worse? I don’t want to end up stuck in bed!
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Wynell. Intermittent swelling can be a sign of something more serious, which is why it's important to keep an eye on it. If the swelling is accompanied by pain, redness, warmth, or difficulty moving your foot, we'll need to investigate further. However, given your history and what I've seen today, it's likely that it's related to the arthritis and the increased activity and heat. If the swelling is mild and goes down with rest and elevation, that's generally okay. But if it persists for more than a few days, or if it gets significantly worse, please don't hesitate to call the office. We can then consider further testing, such as an ultrasound, to rule out any other issues. We’ll take things one step at a time, alright?
PATIENT: One step at a time… yes. That sounds… reasonable. I suppose that’s all one can do, really. So, you’re not going to give me any of those strong pills, are you? The ones my niece takes? She’s always complaining about side effects. I don’t want to be dizzy or forgetful. I already have trouble remembering things as it is! I’d rather just stick to the ice and the pain relievers. And maybe a little less walking.
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not, Wynell. We’re going to start with the mildest options first – the ice and over-the-counter pain relievers. Those stronger pills have a lot of potential side effects, and we definitely don't want to add to any of your existing difficulties with memory. We'll see how those work for you, and if they're not enough, we can always revisit other options. I want you to feel comfortable and in control, and we’ll go at your pace. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything, dear. You’ve been very… patient with an old woman like me. I appreciate you not pushing any of those strong pills on me. And for listening to my rambling about my mother and my husband. They were both… characters, you know. I suppose I should go home now and put my feet up. Thank you, doctor. You have a good day now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Wynell. It was my pleasure. And don’t apologize for rambling – I’m happy to listen. It’s important to me that I understand everything about your health and your life. Remember, if anything changes or you're concerned, please don’t hesitate to call the office. And please do put your feet up and take it easy. Have a wonderful day, Wynell. And take care of yourself. .
