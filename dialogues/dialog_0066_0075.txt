DOCTOR: Hi Moshe, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I’m here because… honestly, I’ve been feeling awfully tired during the day, even though I’m using one of those machines at night for my sleep apnea. I’ve had it for a while now, and it should be helping, but it doesn’t seem to be, and it’s just… tiring, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It's frustrating when something isn't working as expected, especially when it comes to sleep. So, you’ve been using a CPAP machine for your sleep apnea, and you’re still experiencing daytime fatigue. Okay, let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not like I’m falling asleep standing up or anything, but I just… lack energy. Mostly in the afternoons, really. I’ll sit down to read, or watch a little television, and before I know it, I’m dozing off in my chair. It's happened a couple of times when I'm driving too, which worries me, of course. I have to really concentrate to stay awake. And it's not just feeling sleepy, it's hard to focus even when I’m awake. It's like my brain is a little foggy. I used to be a very sharp man, taught college for years, but these days… it’s not the same.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds concerning, especially the episodes while driving. It’s good you’re aware of that and taking it seriously. So, it’s daytime fatigue, mainly in the afternoons, with some difficulty focusing and a feeling of mental fogginess. You've noticed a change from your previous level of alertness, being a former college professor. Let's talk a bit more about the sleep apnea machine. How often do you use it?
PATIENT: Every night, Doctor. Well, almost every night. If I’m traveling, sometimes it’s a bit of a hassle to bring it, but 95% of the time, I’m using it. I make sure the mask is fitted properly, and I clean it regularly, like the instructions say. It's one of those newer models, pretty quiet, thankfully. My wife… well, my ex-wife, she used to complain about the old one. She had a very sensitive ear. But this one… she wouldn't even know I was using it. I’ve had it for about… oh, four years now, I think. Maybe five. Time just slips away these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so consistent use, proper cleaning, and a newer, quieter model. Four or five years of use. That's good to know. Do you know what your pressure setting is on the machine?
PATIENT: You know, that’s a good question. I… honestly, I don’t. I just turn it on, put the mask on, and it does its thing. The technician who set it up initially explained it, but I’m not very good with those numbers. I think he said something about it being adjusted for my weight, but I couldn’t tell you the exact number. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I just assumed it was set correctly and haven't messed with it. Is that bad? Should I have been keeping track of that?
DOCTOR: It's not bad you haven't kept track, but it is definitely something we should look into. It's possible the setting needs adjusting over time, especially with changes in weight or other factors. Let me take a look at your chart… Ah, here we go. It looks like your initial sleep study was done in 2021, and your CPAP was set to 12 centimeters of water pressure. Now, before we jump to conclusions about the machine, let's get a broader picture. Have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Twelve… okay. Well, that's good to know, at least. As for other changes… hmm. My weight has fluctuated a bit, I’ll admit. I’ve put on a few pounds since I retired, not as active as I used to be. And my knees… they bother me more these days, especially in the cold weather. I take some over-the-counter pain relievers for that. Nothing else major, really. Oh! And I’ve been a little more… forgetful lately, even for an old man. Not like serious memory loss, but I misplace things more often, and sometimes struggle to find the right word. I thought it was just getting old, but maybe it’s related to this tiredness?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some weight gain, worsening knee pain managed with over-the-counter medication, and increased forgetfulness. The forgetfulness could be related, or it could be something separate. We’ll need to explore that further. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let’s see… I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but recovered fully. My blood pressure is usually a little high, but I don't take anything for it. The doctor said to watch my salt intake, which I try to do. And I was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea, of course, that’s why I’m here! No diabetes, no heart problems. My father had a bit of a weak heart, but I seem to have dodged that bullet, thankfully. Otherwise, just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. I had my gallbladder removed years ago, but that was a one-time thing. Oh, and I had a bit of skin cancer removed from my face a while back, but that was all taken care of too. Nothing ongoing from that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of pneumonia, mild hypertension managed with diet, sleep apnea, past gallbladder removal, and a history of skin cancer that's been treated. That’s helpful. Do you take any medications regularly, besides the over-the-counter pain relievers for your knees?
PATIENT: Just the pain relievers, Doctor. Ibuprofen, usually. And sometimes I’ll take a little something for indigestion after a big meal. But that’s it. No regular prescriptions, nothing like that. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. My mother always said they were the devil’s work, and I suppose I inherited a bit of that skepticism. I prefer a good cup of chamomile tea, if I can get away with it. It doesn't always work, but it's worth a try.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain and occasional medication for indigestion. No regular prescriptions. Alright, Moshe, that gives me a good overview. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I don’t mind at all. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. It’s good to know you’re being thorough. I always appreciate a good, careful examination.
DOCTOR: Okay, Moshe, take a deep breath for me… and exhale… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There, is that alright? I sometimes have a little trouble with my balance, especially when I get up quickly, but I’m managing. I try to get up slowly, just in case. Old age, you know. It’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Eye movements are smooth, and your balance is stable, though as you mentioned, a little cautious. No obvious deficits there. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Okay, Moshe. Everything seems within normal limits, but your blood pressure is a bit elevated, and the fatigue is concerning, especially given your continued symptoms despite CPAP use. Given your history and exam findings, I think it's important to do some further testing. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone level, and a vitamin D level. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue. What do you think?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. A thorough investigation is always a good idea. I trust your judgment. I’m happy to get those tests done. I’d rather be safe than sorry, you know? I just want to feel like myself again. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Should I be keeping a sleep diary, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a great idea, Moshe. A sleep diary would be very helpful. Please track the time you go to bed, the time you wake up, how many times you wake up during the night, and how rested you feel in the morning. Also, note any factors that might be affecting your sleep, such as caffeine intake, alcohol consumption, or stress levels. In the meantime, continue using your CPAP machine as prescribed. Try to maintain a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends. And I recommend avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bedtime. We’ll get the lab results back in a few days, and then we can discuss them and formulate a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A sleep diary… I can do that. It might be a bit of a chore, but if it helps, I’m happy to do it. I'll try my best to be diligent. And I'll keep using the machine and avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed. You’ve given me a lot to think about, and I appreciate your thoroughness. I feel a little more hopeful now, knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. When should I expect to hear back about the lab results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you're feeling a little more hopeful, Moshe. The lab should take about three to five business days to process the results. My office will call you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment. I usually like to discuss these things in person, so we can go over everything together and answer any questions you might have. Do you have any questions for me right now, before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing we’re taking a proactive approach to this. I’ll start the sleep diary tonight and make sure to avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed. Thank you again for your help. I’ll wait for your office to call with the lab results.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Moshe. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get some rest, and we’ll see you soon. Have a good day.
