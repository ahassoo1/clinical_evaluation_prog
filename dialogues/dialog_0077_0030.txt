DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Pirl. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, honestly. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor, and it's… different. It’s not worse, exactly, just different than it usually is. I wanted to get it checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s always best to address these things, Ms. Purtee. There’s no need to be embarrassed at all. Changes in body odor can sometimes indicate an underlying issue, though often it’s nothing serious. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe this “different” odor a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. It’s hard to describe… it's not the usual… you know, just sweat smell. It’s almost… sweeter? And a little bit musky, maybe? I've been using the same deodorant for years, and it hasn’t stopped it completely, but usually it keeps it pretty manageable. This is… more noticeable, even after I’ve showered.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sweeter, musky odor… and noticeable even with deodorant use. Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Purtee. And when did you first notice this change?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started maybe a month ago? Around the beginning of July, I’d say. It was gradual at first, I thought it was just the heat, you know? But it hasn’t gone away, even with the cooler weather we’ve been having lately. It’s been pretty consistent for the last few weeks, definitely.
DOCTOR: A month ago, consistent for the last few weeks… Alright. Now, have you noticed any other changes alongside this change in odor?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I mean, I’m 49, things are changing all the time, aren't they? But no, I haven’t been feeling sick, no fever, no weight loss or gain, nothing like that. My appetite is normal, and I'm sleeping okay. I've been a little more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn't these days? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make perfect sense, Ms. Purtee. And it's good that you haven’t noticed any other concerning symptoms. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, maybe ten years ago, but it went away on its own with diet and exercise. Other than that, nothing major. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, but I’ve never been seriously ill. I'm on Medicare, if that's helpful. They have all my records, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Medicare… yes, I see your history here. High blood pressure, resolved with lifestyle changes, excellent. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that’s it. And no hospitalizations, thankfully. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I work as a floor layer, so it’s pretty physical work, but I enjoy it. Keeps me moving, you know?
DOCTOR: No surgeries, tonsillectomy as a child… good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, take any medication, no problems at all. I've never had a reaction to anything, not even poison ivy! My mother always said I had a strong stomach.
DOCTOR: No allergies… excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. Just a multivitamin every now and then, but I haven't taken one in a while, honestly. I figure I get enough from my diet. I eat pretty well, lots of vegetables and fruit. I try to, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee. That's very helpful. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Okay, family history… let me think. My mother had diabetes, type 2. She passed away a few years ago. My father had heart problems, high cholesterol, and he had a stroke. He’s still alive, but he's not doing very well. And my brother is healthy, as far as I know. He lives in Ethiopia, so I don’t see him very often. Does that help? It’s hard to remember everything sometimes.
DOCTOR: Diabetes in your mother, heart problems in your father… alright. Now, one last thing, Ms. Purtee, and please don’t feel uncomfortable answering this. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never smoked a day in my life. I don’t drink alcohol, either. And definitely no drugs. I’m a pretty healthy person, as you can tell. I take care of myself. I’m a floor layer, I need to be sharp!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee. Thank you for that thorough information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take a look at your skin. It’s just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. I'm a little curious what you think it could be, honestly. But I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee. If you could please sit back and relax. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look at your skin. Skin appears normal, no rashes or lesions noted. I don’t detect any unusual odor at this time. There’s no excessive sweating.
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, that doesn’t tell us much, does it? I thought you might be able to smell something. It’s just… I notice it, especially at the end of the day. Maybe it’s just me? But it’s definitely different than it used to be. What do you think the next step should be? I’m a little worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Ms. Purtee, it’s understandable to be worried, and I appreciate you voicing that. While the physical exam didn’t reveal anything obvious, that doesn’t mean we’ve ruled everything out. Changes in body odor can be caused by a variety of factors, some simple, some requiring further investigation. Given your history and the fact that you haven’t noticed any other symptoms, I’d like to order some blood work. We’ll check your thyroid function, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. Those tests can help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to this change. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. I mean, I trust you, Doctor. Blood work is better than nothing, I suppose. Will it take long to get the results? And will Medicare cover it? I always worry about those things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Purtee. Medicare should cover it, but we'll double-check that when we schedule the tests. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for the lab to process them and send them to us. Once we have them, we’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if you notice any other symptoms – fever, weight loss, excessive sweating, any new rashes – please don't hesitate to call the office immediately. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing it as just… old age. I'll try not to worry too much until we get the results. I’ll keep an eye out for any other symptoms, like you said. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Purtee. It’s always best to address your concerns, no matter how small they may seem. We’ll get to the bottom of this. The lab results will give us a clearer picture. We'll be in touch soon. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions before your follow-up.
