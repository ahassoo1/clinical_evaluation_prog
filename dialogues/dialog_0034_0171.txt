DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Antonis Seil. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Doctor… Seil, right? Yes. My nails. They just… look funny. Not good funny. They been like this a while now, I guess. I don't really keep track of things like that. They just… changed.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Seil is correct. And thank you for coming in to have them checked out. "Not good funny" is a perfectly valid description. Could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this change?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When? Um… a long time. Maybe… last fall? Or was it the winter? Everything kinda blurs together, you know? It wasn't sudden, not like bam overnight. Just… slower. They got… ridges, I think. And the color… not right. Not a nice pink, like they used to be. I don't paint 'em or anything, just… normal nails. Or were normal.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you don't have an exact date. “Slower” is helpful. Ridges and a color change… alright. Are the changes happening on all of your nails, or just some of them?
PATIENT: Oh, all of 'em, I think. Yeah, all ten. Maybe some worse than others, but… all of 'em. I don't go lookin' at my hands that close, usually. Unless I need to, you know? For things. But yeah, all of 'em look kinda… off. Not smooth. Like they've been used for… diggin'. But I haven't been diggin'!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. That gives me a better idea. And no, you haven’t been digging, I believe you. Would you mind if I take a closer look at your hands and nails?
PATIENT: Oh, go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I don't mind. Just… be gentle, okay? My hands are… sensitive. Always have been. Not that I do anything fancy with 'em. Just… sensitive. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Thut. I will be very gentle. Okay. I'm noticing some longitudinal ridges, as you mentioned, on several nails. The color is a bit pale, and I see some slight thickening. I don't see any active inflammation or bleeding under the nails at the moment. Do you experience any pain or discomfort in your nails or surrounding skin?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. Maybe a little… achey sometimes? But not like a sharp pain, just… dull. And it comes and goes. It's not constant. I just figured it was my age, you know? Things start achin' when you get older. I don’t pay it much mind, honestly. Is that… bad? Should I be payin' mind to it?
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned the acheiness, Ms. Thut. It's always helpful to have a complete picture. And no, it’s not “bad” that you weren’t concerned, but it’s good we’re talking about it now. Have you noticed any changes in the shape of your nails?
PATIENT: Shape? Hmm. That's a good question. I don't really look at the shape. They're… nails. Roundish, I guess? Like most people's. Maybe a little… wider than they used to be? But I don't know if that's just me thinkin' things. I haven't been payin' attention to my nails, Doctor. You gotta understand. They just are. Is there somethin' wrong with the shape? Are they supposed to be a certain shape? I get so confused by all this.
DOCTOR: You’re not confused, Ms. Thut, and there's nothing wrong with not paying close attention to your nails. It’s perfectly normal. It’s my job to ask these questions to get a complete understanding. I do notice a slight widening, as you mentioned, and a bit of flattening of the nail curve. This, along with the ridges, paleness and acheiness, makes me consider a few possibilities. To help narrow things down, could you tell me if you’ve had any recent illnesses, like a fever or a cold?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had a little… sniffle, maybe a month ago? It wasn't nothin' serious, just a tickle in my throat. Didn't even bother with a doctor, just drank some tea and rested. And… oh! My arthritis has been acting up a bit lately, in my hands. That's why they ache, probably. It flares up sometimes, you know? Especially when the weather changes. Does that matter? Is that what's wrong with my nails? The arthritis?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful to know, Ms. Thut. The recent sniffle and the arthritis flare-ups are important pieces of the puzzle. Arthritis can sometimes affect the nails, but the changes we're seeing could also be related to other things. Do you have any family history of nail problems or skin conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family... hmm. My mother had… rough skin on her hands, I think. Always dry. She used a lot of lotion. But I don’t think she had anything wrong with her nails, exactly. Just dry skin. And my grandmother… she had some kinda rash on her legs when she got older. But that was different. I don't think anyone in my family had… funny nails like mine. No. Not that I remember, anyway. It's been a long time. People don’t really talk about these things, do they? It's not polite.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Ms. Thut, sometimes these things aren’t discussed. But it’s good you’re sharing this with me. Okay. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... I take somethin' for my arthritis, yeah. It's a little white pill. Can't remember the name of it. And sometimes I take somethin' for my blood pressure, when it gets high. But not every day. Just when it’s… you know. High. And I take a vitamin D supplement, 'cause the doctor said I was low. That's about it, I think. Nothing fancy. I don’t like takin' a lot of pills, makes me feel… funny. Does that matter? Are those pills messin' with my nails?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. It’s good to know what you’re taking. Some medications can affect nail health, so it’s important to consider. Based on what you've told me, Ms. Thut, and the exam findings, it sounds like we're dealing with a combination of factors. It's likely your arthritis and the medication you’re taking for it are playing a role, and possibly a vitamin deficiency. The recent sniffle could have also contributed. To get a clearer picture and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few blood tests. These will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and look for any signs of inflammation or infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh… goodness. I don't like needles. But… if you think it's important, okay. If it'll help figure out what's wrong with my nails, okay. But… be gentle, alright? And… how long will it take? And will it hurt? I just… don’t like needles. Is there any other way?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Thut. Needles aren't pleasant for anyone. We’ll do everything we can to make it as comfortable as possible. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and we can use a smaller needle if you prefer. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes. We'll just need a small sample. Then, the lab results usually take about a week to come back. We can call you with the results as soon as we have them. There isn't really another way to get this information reliably, unfortunately. The blood tests will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on and help us determine the best course of action. Would you like me to go ahead and order the blood tests for you?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it's the only way. Okay. Go ahead. But… please tell the person doing it to be gentle. And… can I lie down? Does that help? I just… get faint sometimes. And… can you tell me what you're lookin' for, exactly? So I know what's goin' on? I just… like to know things. It makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Thut. We can absolutely have you lie down during the blood draw – that’s a very good idea, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable. And I’m happy to explain what we’re looking for. We’re going to check your vitamin D levels, as you mentioned you’re taking a supplement. We'll also check your thyroid function, because thyroid problems can sometimes affect nails. Then, we’ll look at your complete blood count to see if there are any signs of inflammation or infection. And finally, we'll check your iron levels, as iron deficiency can also cause nail changes. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, that makes sense. A little. All those things… I just… hope it's not somethin' serious. I just want my nails to look normal again. They're not pretty, but… they're my nails, you know? Okay. So… you'll call me when you get the results? And… how long will it take to get 'em back? A week, you said? I hope it's not a long week. I just… worry sometimes. And… what if it is somethin' serious? What then? Do I need more tests? Or… pills? I don’t like pills.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Thut. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious when you're waiting for test results. We'll do everything we can to get them back to you as quickly as possible – usually within a week, but sometimes it can take a little longer. Most likely, we’re dealing with something manageable. It could be a vitamin deficiency, a side effect of your medication, or simply a manifestation of your arthritis. If we do find something that requires further investigation, we'll discuss all of your options thoroughly. We’ll start with the blood tests, and once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. The plan might involve adjusting your medication, taking supplements, or simply monitoring your condition. We will figure this out together, Ms. Thut. And we'll take it one step at a time. I'll write you a lab order now, and the nurse will explain the process to you. She’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… no. I think that's all. Just… please tell the nurse to be gentle. And… thank you, Doctor. For explainin' everything. And… for not laughin' at my funny nails. Okay. I guess… I'll go talk to the nurse now. Thank you again. And… I hope it's not too bad.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Thut. And I assure you, I wasn't laughing at your nails. They're just a part of what makes you, you. The nurse will be right with you. Please don’t hesitate to let us know if you have any further questions or concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Thut, and we’ll see you soon.
