DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Fabing, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Memmolo. Just need to get some forms filled out, really. Medicare sent me a bunch and I figured it's easier to do it here if I have any questions.
DOCTOR: Forms. Of course. It’s always forms. Well, I suppose I can take a quick look at them with you. Which ones are you having trouble with, specifically?
PATIENT: Um, let me see… this one here, about my history. It asks about… well, a lot. And some of it feels kinda repetitive with the other forms. Is it okay if we just go through it together? I don’t want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: Repetitive is… typical. Bureaucracy. Alright, let’s see… “History.” Yes. Well, we need to be thorough, despite the… redundancies. Start with the basics. Do you have any significant past medical problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not that I can think of. I had a pretty bad case of pneumonia when I was a kid, maybe eight or nine? But that was a long time ago, and I recovered completely. Nothing since then, knock on wood. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia as a child. Alright. And have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries. Never needed any, thankfully. Just the usual things, you know? Broken bones when I was little, but they all healed up fine. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Good. No surgical history. Now, family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a tough one. My grandma, on my mom’s side, had diabetes. And my uncle… he had some heart trouble, I think. But other than that, not really that I know of. My mom always said our side of the family was pretty hardy. It's hard to keep track, you know? Lots of relatives scattered around.
DOCTOR: “Diabetes, possible cardiac history.” Adequate, I suppose. And do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. My grandpa smoked for a long time, but I always thought it was a terrible habit. My husband quit years ago too. We both try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker. Good. Any alcohol use?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe on the weekends. Nothing regular or anything. My husband might have a beer now and then, but we don’t drink much at all, really.
DOCTOR: Minimal alcohol use. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope, not taking anything regularly. Sometimes I’ll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s about it. Nothing prescribed, just over-the-counter stuff when I need it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. Blood pressure, pulse… routine. Roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I was hoping to just get the forms done, honestly. Is the exam really necessary for this?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Fabing. A brief examination ensures accuracy and completeness. It won’t take long. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Let’s listen to your lungs, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, if you say so. Just let me know if it’s going to be cold or anything. I always get a little jumpy when something touches my chest.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Within normal limits. Now, let me just check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Okay. Are we almost done? I'm not a big fan of hospitals, to be honest. It just... reminds me of bad things.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, can you tell me if you’ve been experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe a little ache in my lower back sometimes, but that's just from gardening, I think. Nothing serious, comes and goes. I've been spending a lot of time out in the yard lately, getting things ready for winter.
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything appears within normal limits. We'll submit these forms with your medical record. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Dr. Memmolo. I appreciate you taking the time. Hopefully, Medicare will have everything they need now.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Fabing. And try not to overdo it with the gardening. .
