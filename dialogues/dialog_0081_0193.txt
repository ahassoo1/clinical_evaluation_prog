DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paulino. It is… a little embarrassing, but I have been having a lot of gas. More than usual, you understand. It’s… quite frequent, and sometimes… loud. It started maybe a week ago, I think. Yes, exactly one week, on July 26th. I keep myself very regular, so this is unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Frequent flatulence, you say. Began approximately one week ago. And you normally maintain a…consistent bowel habit?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Very consistent. Every morning, same time. Like clockwork. Always. But now… it’s not just when I go, it’s… all day. And the… the noises. It is quite disruptive. I do not wish to cause a disturbance. It makes me a little anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Anxious about…gas?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Perhaps it is foolish to be anxious, but when one works with the public, you understand… It is not ideal. I work at the hot dog stand on Elm Street. People are eating! And… well, a loud noise can be…unpleasant for them, and embarrassing for me. I try to be discreet, but it is… difficult. I am a very polite man.
DOCTOR: Right. So, this is causing you social distress due to the…auditory consequences of your flatulence. Have you noticed anything else accompanying this?
PATIENT: Accompanying it? Let me think… Yes, actually. My stomach feels a little… bloated. Not painful, exactly, just… full of air, even when I haven't eaten much. And sometimes, a little cramping, but it passes quickly. It's not a strong pain, more of a… discomfort. I also feel a little… tired, but I thought that was just the summer heat. It has been very warm, you see.
DOCTOR: Bloating, mild cramping, fatigue… and this began one week ago, concurrent with the increased flatulence. Have there been any changes to your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? No, not really. I eat the same things almost every day. A little sausage for breakfast, a small sandwich for lunch, maybe some yogurt in the evening. I drink mostly water. Oh! Except… last week, my neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, she brought me a casserole. A bean casserole. It was very kind of her, but… I do not usually eat many beans. Perhaps that is it? I ate a large portion, because she made so much.
DOCTOR: A bean casserole. Well, that would certainly explain a great deal. Beans contain… complex carbohydrates that your digestive system may not be accustomed to processing in such quantity. It’s a common cause of increased gas production.
PATIENT: Ah, I see. Complex carbohydrates… That sounds… scientific. So, the beans caused this trouble? It is just the beans, then? I should avoid the bean casserole in the future? I did enjoy it very much, but if it causes such… discomfort, it is best to avoid it, I suppose. Is there anything I can take to… settle my stomach? Something to help with the… noises?
DOCTOR: While eliminating the offensive food source is the primary step, there are over-the-counter remedies that may offer some symptomatic relief. Simethicone, for example, can help reduce gas bubbles. However, these are merely palliative; they do not address the underlying cause. I would also recommend a probiotic to help restore the balance of your gut flora. Now, let’s review your medical history. Have you had any previous gastrointestinal issues?
PATIENT: Probiotic… Simethicone… I will try to remember those names. I do not think I have had any previous… gastrointestinal issues. Never, really. Just the usual, occasional upset stomach, but nothing serious. I had a little heartburn once, after eating too much spicy sausage, but that was years ago. I have a very strong stomach, normally. I do not take any medications, and I have no allergies. I am generally a very healthy man. Medicare covers me, if that is important.
DOCTOR: Allergies, medications… Good. And you state you’re generally healthy. Medicare is noted. Now, family history. Are there any instances of gastrointestinal disorders – irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis – in your family?
PATIENT: That is a difficult question, Doctor. My family… we do not discuss such things much. My mother, she always complained of a little stomach trouble, but she called it “indigestion.” She ate a lot of rich foods. My father, he was a very stoic man. He never complained of anything. I do not believe either of them had any serious illnesses, to be honest. We are Hungarian, you see, and we tend to… keep things private. I do not know if that answers your question. Perhaps there was something, but I am not aware of it.
DOCTOR: Vague family history of possible indigestion. Alright. Now, let's move on to your social habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, Doctor. Never have. It is very bad for the health, you understand. My mother always told me, "Smoking will ruin your lungs." I have always avoided it. I do enjoy a small glass of wine with my dinner sometimes, but only a small glass. It helps me relax, after a long day at the hot dog stand. But I do not smoke. Never have, never will.
DOCTOR: Alcohol consumption – occasional small glass of wine. Noted. Now, physical activity?
PATIENT: Physical activity… Well, I walk to work every day. It is about fifteen minutes each way. And I am on my feet all day at the stand, you understand. Serving customers. Lifting hot dogs. It is… quite active, actually. But I do not… exercise, per se. I do not go to a gym, or anything like that. Just the walking, and the work. Is that enough? I am not a young man anymore, you see. Seventy-two steps to my apartment, and no elevator. It keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: Fifteen minutes of walking and standing… Adequate, but not strenuous. Let’s do a quick examination, just to rule out anything obvious. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I hope you do not mind, but I had a rather large lunch. Perhaps it will make things a little… noisy. I apologize in advance. I try to be discreet, but… it is difficult to control, you understand.
DOCTOR: Normal bowel sounds, slightly hyperactive, as expected given your symptoms. No tenderness to palpation. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. No masses palpable. Tympanic to percussion. Reflexes are normal. No signs of acute distress. Based on the history and examination, this appears to be a case of benign flatulence, likely exacerbated by the bean casserole and possibly some mild gut dysbiosis. It’s highly unlikely to be anything serious.
PATIENT: Benign flatulence… That is a relief to hear, Doctor. Very good. I was worried it might be something… serious. So, the beans were the culprit? And the casserole… I should avoid it in the future, then? Is there anything I can do to… speed up the recovery? Perhaps a special tea? Or a particular food I should eat? I am very grateful for your diagnosis, Doctor. It has put my mind at ease. And the noises… will they subside?
DOCTOR: The bean casserole is the likely culprit, yes. Avoid it. As for speeding up recovery, there’s no miracle cure. Focus on a bland diet – avoid highly processed foods, carbonated beverages, and excessive dairy. Probiotics, as we discussed, may help restore gut flora. No special tea is necessary. The noises should subside as your digestive system returns to normal. It may take a few days. If your symptoms worsen, or you develop any additional symptoms – fever, severe abdominal pain, blood in your stool – then contact me immediately. I'm prescribing a probiotic. I will also provide a handout detailing a low-FODMAP diet. It might be helpful. Any questions?
PATIENT: Low-FODMAP diet… Another scientific term. I will try to remember that. And I will avoid the beans, and focus on… bland food. Probiotics, and the… low-FODMAP diet. Yes, I think I understand. A handout, you say? That would be very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. No, I do not think I have any further questions at the moment. You have been very thorough, and I am very grateful for your time and expertise. I apologize again for the… disturbance. Is there anything I need to do before I leave? A follow-up appointment, perhaps?
DOCTOR: A follow-up appointment isn't necessary unless your symptoms persist or worsen. If they subside within a week, consider the matter resolved. Here's the handout on the low-FODMAP diet. It explains which foods to avoid and which are safe. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Feel free to contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Goodstein. .
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. Thank you for everything. I will be sure to follow your instructions carefully. And I will contact the office if I have any problems. Have a good day to you as well, Doctor Paulino. Goodbye. .
