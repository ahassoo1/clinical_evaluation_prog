DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Beinborn, huh? Well, look, it ain't exactly nice meeting doctors, but here we are. It's my stomach. Been bleedin', they tell me. Not a pretty sight, let me tell ya.
DOCTOR: Okay, bleeding in the stomach. I understand. That doesn’t sound pleasant. Just to clarify, Mr. Gentz, “they” meaning who told you this?
PATIENT: Well, my neighbor, Agnes. She's a retired nurse, a sensible woman. Saw it in the, uh, the bowl, you know? And then there was…well, I felt weak, lightheaded. Just not right. Thought I should get it checked, though honestly, I don't see what good poking and prodding will do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Agnes sounds like a good resource. And you're right to get it checked. Weakness and lightheadedness can be serious when there's bleeding involved. We’ll need to figure out where the bleeding is coming from and why. Before we do anything, can you describe the bleeding for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean? It was…red. Obviously. And it was…coming from down there. Look, I’m not one for details, alright? It wasn’t a little drip, if that’s what you’re askin’. Enough to make a fella worry. It happened…oh, a couple of times now over the last week or so. Not every day, but enough to make me lose my appetite, I tell you what.
DOCTOR: I understand. You don’t have to go into a lot of detail if you’re uncomfortable. “Red” is helpful. Was it bright red, or darker, more like coffee grounds?
PATIENT: Coffee grounds… now that I can tell ya. Sometimes it looked like… well, used coffee grounds, yeah. Other times it was more…just red. Like I said, not a pretty sight. And it ain't gettin' better, that's for sure. Makes a man feel…old, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s definitely something we need to investigate. The coffee grounds appearance is particularly important. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bleeding?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Aside from feelin' like death warmed over? Nah, not really. Little tired, maybe. Can't sleep as well as I used to, but that's just gettin' old, I reckon. And my stomach's been…grumbling. A lot. Like it's empty, even after I eat. Agnes said somethin’ about heartburn, but I don’t get burnin’, just… discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, grumbling and discomfort are good to know. No heartburn is also helpful. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything significant?
PATIENT: Significant? I had the flu once, back in '88. Bad one. Nearly died, Agnes said. Aside from that…nope. Nothin' much. I’m a sturdy fella. Always been able to shrug things off. My wife… well, she had problems. Heart trouble. That’s why I don’t bother much with doctors. They couldn’t help her.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. It’s understandable that experience would make you hesitant. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Nope. Nothin’. Never had a reason to. Broke my arm when I was a kid, fallin' out of a tree, but they just put it in a cast. That's it. Always been lucky, I guess. Until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Never been allergic to a thing. I can eat anything. Drink anything. Agnes gave me some pills for my indigestion a few years back, but they didn’t do much. Can’t remember what they were called. Probably somethin’ weak.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just those pills Agnes gave me, when I can remember to take 'em. Don’t really bother much with them. And sometimes a little… somethin’ for sleep. Helps me get a few hours, but it's nothin' regular. Just when I really can’t stand it. Old man’s remedy, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask some questions about your family history, if that's alright. Has anyone in your family had any serious medical problems, like heart disease, cancer, or stomach problems?
PATIENT: Family history... hmm. My father, he died young. Stroke, I think it was. And my mother... she had the arthritis something awful towards the end. A lot of pain, poor woman. As for stomach problems, not that I recall. Nobody ever talked much about it. We weren't one for sharing our troubles.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What's that mean? I live alone. Been widowed five years now. I keep to myself mostly. Used to work construction, but I'm retired now. Don't do much travelin'. What kinda information you needin'?
DOCTOR: It’s alright. I just need to know a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife hated 'em. Drink... I used to have a beer now and then with the fellas, but not much anymore. Makes me feel sluggish. And drugs? Don't be ridiculous. I'm a sensible man. Never had any use for that nonsense.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It’ll just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and looking at your stool. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Stool? You want to look at my... Now hold on a minute. You expect me to show you...? Look, I don’t like this one bit. This is gettin' personal. I came in here 'cause I'm bleedin', not for a… a stool inspection!
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your hesitation. I apologize if that came across poorly. I didn’t mean you had to show me anything at this moment. I simply meant I’d like to look at a sample of your stool – if you are able to provide one. It helps us determine the source of the bleeding and rule out any infections. It’s a standard procedure, and we can do it privately. If you’re not comfortable, we can discuss other options, but it would make it harder to figure out what's going on. Would you be open to collecting a small sample?
PATIENT: A small sample… Hmph. Fine. Fine. But I want a promise – you're not tellin' Agnes about this. She'd never let me hear the end of it. And I want it kept private. This is embarrassing enough as it is. Just… get it over with, alright? But don't expect me to be happy about it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Gentz. Your privacy is my utmost priority. I promise I won't discuss this with Agnes or anyone else. We'll handle everything discreetly. I’ll have a nurse bring you a collection container and instructions. After that, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and gently examine your abdomen. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Alright. Heart and lungs and… proddin’. Just get it over with, then. And hurry it up, alright? I got things to do. Even an old man has things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. Let’s get started then. Please lie down on the table, and I’ll begin with your heart and lungs. It won’t take long. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. There's some tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no guarding or rebound tenderness noted. I don’t feel any masses. Now, I'm going to listen to your bowel sounds. Bowel sounds are normoactive. Okay. While we're waiting for the collection container, can you describe any recent changes in your bowel habits – constipation, diarrhea, or changes in stool color?
PATIENT: Changes in color… well, besides the red bit, it’s been… dark, I guess. Dark and… sticky. Like tar. It ain't been normal, that's for sure. And I haven’t been goin’ as regular as I used to. It’s… difficult. Gotta strain a bit. Not somethin’ I like talkin' about.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. Dark, sticky stool and difficulty with bowel movements are important observations. This, along with the bleeding and tenderness, gives us a clearer picture. The nurse should be bringing the collection container momentarily. While we wait, I’m going to ask you a little about your diet. Have you noticed any undigested food in your stool?
PATIENT: Undigested food… Hmph. Now that's a question. Well, now that you mention it… yeah. A couple of times, I’ve seen bits of… corn. I had some corn yesterday, and I saw some in the bowl this mornin'. And a few times I've noticed bits of… vegetables. Shouldn't happen, should it? I chew my food alright, I always have.
DOCTOR: No, that's not typical, Mr. Gentz. It suggests your body isn’t breaking down food properly. The nurse is here with the collection container and instructions. Please take these instructions with you, and let me know if you have any questions. Once you’ve collected a sample, we’ll send it to the lab for analysis. Based on what you’ve told me, and my initial examination, I’m concerned about the possibility of a gastrointestinal bleed, and the potential for malabsorption. We need to determine the source and cause of the bleeding, and rule out any serious underlying conditions. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool analysis, and possibly a colonoscopy depending on the results. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Colonoscopy...? Now hold on a minute. What kinda tests are you talkin’ about? And what’s a colonoscopy even mean? Look, I don’t like the sound of this one bit. Sounds… invasive. And expensive. I ain't got insurance, you know. This is gettin’ outta hand. Just fix my bleedin’, alright? That’s all I want. No fancy tests.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your concerns. A colonoscopy is a procedure where we examine the entire length of your colon with a flexible camera. It’s the most accurate way to identify the source of bleeding and rule out serious conditions like polyps or cancer. I know it sounds invasive, and you’re right to be concerned about cost. However, based on the dark, sticky stool, undigested food, and the bleeding, it’s important to investigate thoroughly. We can discuss payment options and potentially find a facility that offers financial assistance. Before we commit to a colonoscopy, we'll start with the blood tests and stool analysis. These initial tests will give us more information and help determine the next steps. If the results are concerning, I strongly recommend a colonoscopy for a definitive diagnosis. Would you be open to at least considering a colonoscopy if the initial tests indicate a need for it?
PATIENT: Hmph. Considering it, maybe. But only maybe. And I want a clear explanation of everything. What does it involve? How long does it take? What are the risks? And how much is it gonna cost? Don't give me any fancy medical jargon, alright? I want it in plain English. And if it's gonna cost me an arm and a leg, I want to know upfront. I’m not makin’ any promises, alright? Just get those tests done first. And then we’ll see. But don’t expect me to jump at anything. This is my body, and I get to decide what happens to it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Gentz. That’s perfectly reasonable, and you have every right to be informed and make your own decisions. This brochure explains the colonoscopy procedure in detail, in plain English. It covers what's involved, how long it takes, the potential risks, and what to expect afterward. I’ll also write down the contact information for the financial assistance department at the hospital, so you can inquire about the costs and potential payment options. I'll order the blood tests and stool analysis right away. The nurse will draw your blood before you leave. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the next steps together. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids and eat a bland diet. Do you have any questions for me right now, before we finish?
PATIENT: Nah, not right now. Just… get it over with. And try not to worry me too much, alright? I’ve lived a long life. I don’t need any surprises now. Just fix my bleedin’, and let me get back to my life.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. We’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and help you feel better. We will take things one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Gentz. I hope you have a good day, despite everything.
