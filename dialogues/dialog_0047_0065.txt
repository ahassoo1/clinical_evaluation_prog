DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my weight. I’ve gained quite a bit recently, and I haven’t changed anything about my eating or exercise. It’s rather worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Worrying is understandable. And you say this weight gain has been…recent?
PATIENT: Yes, quite recent. Perhaps…the last four or five months? It was gradual at first, but it seems to be speeding up now. I’ve tried to ignore it, hoping it was just…water retention, perhaps, but it’s becoming quite noticeable in my clothes.
DOCTOR: Right. And has anything else changed in those four or five months?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not that I can recall, Doctor. My husband and I have kept to our usual routine. No new medications, no big stresses…everything is as it has been. It’s just…the weight. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the weight gain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, now that you mention it, I have been feeling rather…tired lately. More tired than usual, I suppose. And…sometimes a little breathless, even with just gentle activity. But I attributed that to being…out of shape, perhaps, with the weight gain. Is that…relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Relevant, yes, potentially very. Let's get some more details. How would you describe this tiredness?
PATIENT: It’s…a sort of dragging feeling. Not like I can’t get out of bed, necessarily, but I feel very depleted by even simple tasks. Like washing the dishes leaves me needing to sit down for a while. It’s not a constant thing, but it’s happening more and more frequently. And it doesn’t seem to improve with rest, not really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And this breathlessness… when does it occur?
PATIENT: It’s…not a sharp shortness of breath, Doctor. More like…I notice it when I walk upstairs, or even if I’m walking a little quickly to catch a bus. Just a little winded, needing to pause and catch my breath. It’s never been like this before. It wasn’t a problem before the weight started to come on, that much I know.
DOCTOR: Right. And just to confirm, you haven't experienced any swelling in your ankles or feet, chest pain, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no swelling. And thankfully, no chest pain or…what did you say? Palpitations? No, none of that. Just the tiredness and the breathlessness, along with the weight gain, of course. It’s all rather unsettling. I’m a practical woman, but this is…difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Selbitschka, unexplained weight gain, coupled with fatigue and breathlessness...it’s good we’re discussing this. Let’s do a quick physical examination. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, and take your blood pressure. After that, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out a few things. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Anything to find out what’s going on. I appreciate your thoroughness. Please, proceed as you see fit. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, please. I'll start with your blood pressure. 140/90. A bit elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply for me… Lungs are clear, but I detect a slightly rapid heartbeat. Now, the thyroid… Thyroid feels normal. No obvious enlargement or nodules. Now, let’s just check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Everything appears unremarkable, but the elevated blood pressure and slightly rapid heartbeat, coupled with your symptoms… I'm going to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. We also need to check your blood sugar and cholesterol levels. The lab will draw blood. Do you have any known allergies to latex or any other materials used in blood draws?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve had blood work done before with no problems. Latex, no, I don’t think so. I’ve always been rather fortunate with allergies, thankfully. So, a complete blood count, thyroid panel, metabolic panel… and blood sugar and cholesterol. Yes, that sounds… comprehensive. When should I expect the results, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Good. The lab should be able to get these results back to me within 3-5 business days, usually sooner. My assistant will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, significant shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. Chest pain, significant shortness of breath, or dizziness – go to the emergency room. I shall remember that. Three to five business days… I appreciate you being so thorough, and explaining everything so clearly. It’s put my mind at ease, at least a little. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just a quick note about your weight… while we await these results, I'd suggest focusing on a balanced diet and gentle exercise, if you're able. Nothing strenuous, just walking or light activity. We'll discuss this further once we have the blood work results. Are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications at all. I’ve always been quite healthy, to be honest. My husband likes to say I’m stubborn as a mule, and that includes refusing to get sick! No other medical conditions, no. Just…this weight. It’s rather frustrating, because I feel well otherwise. It’s just…unexpected.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have a family history of thyroid problems, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Let me think… My mother had some issues with her blood pressure in her later years, but nothing else that I recall. My father was very healthy, lived to be eighty-five. No diabetes or heart disease on either side of the family, as far as I know. We weren’t a particularly medical family, if that makes sense. We just…didn't talk about those things much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I'm a homemaker, mostly. I keep the house tidy, cook for my husband, and tend to our small garden. We don’t smoke, and we rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. We don’t have any pets, and we live a fairly quiet life. I suppose it's…sedentary, to a degree, but I’m always moving about. It's hard to explain, it's just…a regular life. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is, thank you. And, just a final question, Ms. Selbitschka, do you have any concerns about being able to afford any potential further testing or treatment?
PATIENT: That…is a very thoughtful question, Doctor. To be honest…no, we do not have insurance. My husband and I…we’ve always managed. We’ve always been careful. But, if further testing is needed, it would…cause a financial strain. We would have to…consider our options carefully. It’s a concern, yes. Thank you for asking. It’s…good to know you’re thinking about that.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will keep that in mind when I review your results and discuss options with you. We can discuss more affordable testing alternatives, if necessary. For now, let’s focus on getting those initial blood tests completed. My assistant will come in shortly to draw your blood. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is everything. You've been very thorough and reassuring. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns, and for being so considerate of my financial situation. I’ll just…wait for your assistant, then. Thank you again, Doctor Press. I feel…better prepared now, at least.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. I will see you in a few days to discuss the results. Let's hope it's nothing too serious. .
