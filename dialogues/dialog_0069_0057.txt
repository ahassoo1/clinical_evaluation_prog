DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s about the cancer. I… I was told to come see you about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see here you were recently diagnosed with cancer. That must be a lot to process. Could you tell me a little more about what you were told?
PATIENT: It is a lot. They… the other doctors, they said it’s in my… my lung. And that it’s… spread a little. I don’t… I don't really understand all of it. They talked about stages, but it didn’t… stick.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed with a new diagnosis and a lot of medical terminology. Don't worry about remembering everything. We'll take things slowly. So, just to clarify, you were diagnosed with lung cancer that has spread a bit. Do you know what type of lung cancer they said you have – for example, small cell or non-small cell?
PATIENT: Um… I think they said… non-small cell. But honestly, it was a lot of information and I was… upset. I don't know if I heard right. I was mostly just listening for… for how bad it was. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s absolutely okay, Chellsea. It's perfectly normal to focus on the big picture when you're receiving difficult news. Don’t worry about the specifics. We can go over everything again. So, non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type. Do you know what stage they told you it was?
PATIENT: They said… stage three. But… there were a lot of numbers and letters. And they talked about… nodes. Lymph nodes, I think? It’s all very confusing. I’m sorry. I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Chellsea. It is confusing, and you shouldn’t apologize at all. Stage three means the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other tissues in your chest, but hasn't spread to distant parts of your body. We’ll talk more about what that means for your specific case. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me about any symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Well… I've been coughing a lot. It started a few months ago, just a little tickle. But now… it’s almost constant. And I get short of breath, especially when I try to do anything. Even walking to the mailbox. I’ve also… lost some weight, even though I haven’t been trying to. And I feel… tired. Very tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a persistent cough, shortness of breath, weight loss, and fatigue. Those are all symptoms we'd expect with lung cancer. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Sometimes… my chest hurts. Not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. And… this might sound silly… but my fingers feel… numb sometimes. Especially on my left hand. I don’t know if that’s related. It just started recently.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not silly at all. We need to consider everything. Chest pain and numbness in your fingers are important things to note. The numbness could be related, or it could be something else entirely. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you had any other serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Um… I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. And… I had a heart condition when I was a little girl, but they said I outgrew it. It wasn't… serious. They monitored it for a while, but then… they said I didn’t need to worry about it anymore. Oh, and my husband… he passed away last year. It was… sudden. A car accident.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been incredibly difficult. So, you had your appendix removed as a teenager, and you were treated for a heart condition as a child, but it resolved. Did that heart condition require any ongoing medication or follow-up after it resolved?
PATIENT: No, they did some tests and said I was fine. They told my parents I didn’t need to worry about it anymore. I haven’t seen a cardiologist since I was a little girl. It was just… a thing they checked when I was small. I don’t remember much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had cancer, particularly lung cancer?
PATIENT: My grandmother… on my mother’s side, she had cancer. I think it was… breast cancer. But that was a long time ago. And my uncle… he smoked his whole life and… he got sick. I don’t know if it was cancer, but he had trouble breathing. That’s all I remember. No one else, really. We didn’t… talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of breast cancer in your grandmother and breathing problems in an uncle who smoked. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me a bit about your own smoking history?
PATIENT: I… I used to smoke. I started when I was in high school, and… I quit about five years ago. It was… hard. But I did it. I’m proud of that. I smoked… about a pack a day, for about fifteen years.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Chellsea. It’s important information. And quitting is a huge accomplishment, so you should definitely be proud of that. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: I… occasionally. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, or a beer with friends. But not very often. Maybe once or twice a month. I don't really drink much. It makes me feel… unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol use. And do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I haven’t… I don’t… I’ve never used any drugs.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that question was insensitive, Chellsea. I just need to ask about all lifestyle factors. It’s part of a thorough medical evaluation. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything. I’ve taken antibiotics before, and some pain relievers… and I’ve never had a problem. Oh, I am allergic to poison ivy. But that’s it. A rash, mostly. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug allergies, except for a rash from poison ivy. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: I take a vitamin D supplement, sometimes. But that’s it. I don't really take any other medications. I try to stay healthy. I used to take something for my anxiety, but I stopped a few years ago. I'm trying to manage it on my own now.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D supplement occasionally, and you previously took medication for anxiety. Alright, Chellsea, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I'd like to do a physical exam. I'll listen to your lungs, check your lymph nodes, and do a general assessment. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… okay. Whatever you need to do. I just… I want to know what’s going on. And what we can do about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please sit up comfortably. I'm going to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope. Try to breathe deeply through your mouth. I'm hearing some diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs, and some crackles, which could indicate fluid in the lungs. And I’m feeling some enlargement in the lymph nodes in your neck and collarbone area. They feel… firm. Your heart rate and blood pressure are normal, and your temperature is stable. You appear slightly fatigued, but otherwise your general appearance is within normal limits. Based on your history and this initial exam, it appears your symptoms are consistent with lung cancer, as previously diagnosed. However, we need further testing to determine the extent of the disease and to guide treatment decisions.
PATIENT: So… it is cancer? Really? What… what kind of testing do you need to do? And… what are my options? I’m… scared, Doctor. Very scared.
DOCTOR: It is cancer, Chellsea, as previously diagnosed, and it’s completely understandable that you’re scared. It’s a lot to process. We'll take things one step at a time. We need to do some further imaging – a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis – to see if the cancer has spread beyond your lungs. We’ll also need a biopsy of the lymph nodes to confirm the type of cancer cells and to help determine the best course of treatment. Based on the results of those tests, we can discuss your options, which may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, or a combination of these. We’ll also consider clinical trials, if appropriate. I want you to know you’re not alone in this. We have a wonderful team of oncologists, nurses, and support staff here to help you through every step of the way. Do you have any questions right now?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and a biopsy? Will those be… painful? And what if it’s… spread a lot? What does that mean? What are the… side effects of… of all of that? I… I don’t even know where to start. It’s just… so much.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Chellsea, and it’s good that you’re asking them. Let’s take them one at a time. The CT scan is non-invasive and doesn’t involve any pain. You’ll lie on a table while a machine takes pictures of your internal organs. The biopsy will involve taking a small sample of the lymph node tissue for examination. It may cause some minor discomfort or bruising, but we’ll do everything we can to minimize your pain. We can offer local anesthesia, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable. As for what it means if it has spread, that affects the treatment options and prognosis. But it doesn't necessarily mean there’s no hope. We have many effective treatments available, even for advanced-stage cancer. The side effects of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other treatments vary depending on the specific regimen. Common side effects can include fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and decreased blood counts. We’ll discuss these in detail before starting any treatment and provide medications and support to manage them. Right now, let’s focus on getting those initial tests done – the CT scan and biopsy. I’ll write you an order for those, and we can schedule them for as soon as possible. I'll also have my nurse, Sarah, come in and talk to you about the logistics and answer any further questions you may have. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that would be… alright. Scheduling the tests… and talking to the nurse. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate it. It’s just… hard to think straight.
