DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 56 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 56... or thereabouts. It feels like it, at least. I've been… well, going to the bathroom rather frequently, you see. More than usual. That’s what prompted the visit, I believe. It’s a bit bothersome, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, you say. Alright. Could you elaborate on “rather frequently”?
PATIENT: Elaborate… hmm. Let me see. It used to be… normal, I suppose. A few times a day. Now… it feels like every couple of hours. Perhaps even less. It’s difficult to say precisely, to be honest. I don’t keep a strict log, you understand. And at night… I find myself getting up once, sometimes twice. It’s… disrupting my sleep a little.
DOCTOR: Disrupting your sleep. I see. And is there any… discomfort associated with this?
PATIENT: Discomfort… not exactly pain, no. It's more… a sense of urgency, perhaps? A strong feeling that I need to go. And it can be a bit… forceful, if you understand. Not always, but sometimes. And no burning or anything like that. Just… a need to go, quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Color… hmm. That’s a good question. I can't say I’ve specifically been observing the color, Doctor. I suppose it looks… normal? Pale yellow, as one would expect. I haven't noticed anything unusual. Though, I must confess, my eyesight isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Verbos, I need to ask about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Past medical history… that’s… a bit hazy, truthfully, Doctor. I seem to recall a bout of… something with my kidneys, many years ago. But it was quite mild, and I don’t recall the specifics. Perhaps a small infection? It was treated, and I haven't had any trouble since. As for anything else… I believe I’ve been generally healthy. Or, at least, I thought I was.
DOCTOR: “Mild” is rather imprecise, Mr. Verbos. Do you recall when this kidney issue occurred?
PATIENT: When… that's a difficult question, Doctor. Perhaps… in my thirties? Or maybe early forties? It was a long time ago, and my memory isn't what it once was, I'm afraid. I would have to think on it. It wasn't a serious thing, as I recall. Just a few visits to a doctor, some medication… and it went away. I can't even recall which doctor I saw.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgical procedures?
PATIENT: Surgical procedures… let me see. No, I don’t believe so. Not that I recall, at least. Nothing major, certainly. Perhaps a minor… growth removed from my arm when I was a child? But that was a very long time ago, and hardly a procedure, as such. Nothing that would be relevant now, I shouldn't think.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Verbos, let's discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That's… a tricky one. My mother had… something with her heart, I believe. But I don’t recall the specifics. She passed away some years ago. And my father… he was generally healthy, as far as I know. Perhaps a bit of high blood pressure in his later years? It's all rather vague, I'm afraid. We weren't a family who discussed such matters openly.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. No, not regularly, Doctor. I take a small pill for my… joints, from time to time. Just when they’re feeling particularly stiff. But it's not a daily thing, and it's a relatively minor medication, I believe. Something over the counter, I think. I don't have it with me at the moment.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I'm aware of, Doctor. I've always considered myself quite fortunate in that regard. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. Though, I did have a bit of… irritation from a bee sting when I was a child, but that was hardly an allergy, as such.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Verbos, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. Specifically, I’d like to check your abdomen and perform a digital rectal exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A… a physical examination? And a… digital rectal exam? Well, Doctor, I must admit, that sounds… rather intrusive. Is it absolutely necessary? I’m not sure I feel entirely comfortable with that. Perhaps there are other ways to determine the cause of my… issue?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbos, with all due respect, a thorough examination is essential for proper diagnosis. The digital rectal exam will allow me to assess the prostate, which can contribute to urinary frequency. While I understand your discomfort, it is a standard procedure and will provide valuable information. Refusal will hinder my ability to provide you with an accurate assessment. Do you consent to proceed?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If it is absolutely necessary… and you insist. I suppose I have no choice. But please be… gentle. And I would appreciate a clear explanation of what you are doing, as you proceed. I'm… not a fan of surprises, you understand.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will explain everything as I proceed. Please lie on your side with your knees drawn up. We will begin with the abdominal exam. I will be palpating your abdomen to assess for any tenderness or abnormalities. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Now, we will proceed with the digital rectal exam. Please inform me if you experience any discomfort. Prostate is mildly enlarged, symmetrical. No nodules palpated. Mild tenderness on the left side. Alright. That concludes the examination. Now, while we await potential lab results, I’m leaning towards a diagnosis of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’ll order a urinalysis and a PSA blood test. We’ll discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any immediate questions?
PATIENT: BPH… That sounds… concerning. And the tenderness? Is that… serious? And a PSA test? What exactly does that look for? I must admit, Doctor, I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with all of this information. Perhaps you could explain it a little more… simply?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbos, I understand your anxiety. BPH simply means your prostate is enlarged, which is common as men age. It can cause the urinary symptoms you’ve been experiencing. The tenderness is mild, and could be due to inflammation or, less likely, infection. The PSA test measures a protein produced by the prostate. Elevated levels can indicate BPH, but also other issues, including prostate cancer. Hence the need for testing. It is not a definitive diagnosis, simply a screening tool. We will review the results and proceed accordingly. Do you understand?
PATIENT: So… it doesn’t necessarily mean I have cancer? The tenderness could be from something minor? And the testing will tell us more… I think I understand. It’s just… a lot to take in. When will I hear about the results, Doctor? And is there anything I can do in the meantime? Anything to… ease the discomfort?
DOCTOR: The lab results should be available within 3-5 business days. We will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, to alleviate the discomfort, I recommend limiting your fluid intake before bedtime, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and practicing pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises. These can help strengthen the muscles that support your bladder and prostate. I can provide you with a handout detailing these exercises. Additionally, over-the-counter medications like alpha-blockers may provide some relief, but I recommend discussing these with a pharmacist before use, as they can have side effects. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: I don’t think so, Doctor. Just… thank you. For explaining everything, and for not dismissing my concerns. The handout would be most helpful. And I shall try the exercises. It's a bit daunting, but I suppose it's worth a try. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is the handout on pelvic floor exercises. I trust you’ll adhere to the instructions. We will be in contact to schedule your follow-up appointment. Do not hesitate to contact the clinic if your symptoms worsen significantly, such as experiencing fever, chills, or inability to urinate. Otherwise, I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Verbos.
