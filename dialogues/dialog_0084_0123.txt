DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, it’s my skin. It’s been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy, really. It started a few weeks ago, I think? It’s hard to say exactly when, but it’s getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Itchy skin can be really bothersome. A few weeks ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Maybe… four or five? It comes and goes, but lately it’s been pretty constant. Mostly on my arms and back, but it seems to be spreading a little bit now. It’s not… painful, exactly, just incredibly irritating. Like I need to scratch all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Not really, not that I can think of. I haven’t changed my soap, I haven’t been traveling… Oh! Well, I did start using a new laundry detergent. A different brand, just trying to save a little money. Could that be it? I don’t know anything about those things, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Ms. Cassimatis. A new laundry detergent is definitely something that could be causing a reaction. Okay, let’s talk a little more about the itch itself. Is it worse at any particular time of day, or after certain activities?
PATIENT: You know, that’s funny you ask. It is worse at night, definitely. Keeps me up sometimes. And… when I get warm, like after I’ve been doing a little bit in the garden, or even just walking around. When I start to sweat, it gets much, much worse. It’s a relief when I cool down.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And is the itch all over, or just in specific spots?
PATIENT: Mostly on my arms and back, like I said, but it’s starting to be on my legs a little bit too. Not my face, thankfully. And… it doesn’t look like anything, really. No rash, no bumps, no redness. That’s what’s so strange about it! Just… itchy skin. It’s very frustrating. I keep thinking I’m imagining it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No visible rash, just the itch itself. Let’s do a quick exam. Could you please turn around for me so I can take a look at your back and arms?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Go ahead, Doctor. I hope you see something! It feels like I’m going crazy, telling you about something you can’t even see.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm looking now. Your skin does look normal in terms of color and texture. I don't see any visible rash, welts, or obvious signs of irritation. It's dry to the touch. I'm going to gently scratch a small area on your back – tell me if that feels different than your normal itch.
PATIENT: Okay. Oh, yes! That feels… just like the regular itch. It’s not more or less intense, just… the same annoying feeling. It's just... everywhere. And it's so hard to ignore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given the timing with the new detergent, the worsening with warmth and sweating, and the lack of visible rash, my initial thought is it could be a mild irritant contact dermatitis, or even just dry skin exacerbated by the change in detergent. However, to be sure, and because it's persistent, I’d like to rule out other possibilities. Have you had any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. No fever, no tiredness, no… anything else. Just the itch. Maybe… I have been feeling a little bit more tired lately, now that you mention it. But I just thought that was because of my age! I’m seventy, you know. Things start to slow down. But no, nothing else, really. No bumps, no swelling, no pain… just itchiness.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me see… I take something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes I take Tylenol for aches and pains, but that's about it. Nothing regularly. No creams, no lotions, no anything else. I usually try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional Tylenol. No known allergies, correct?
PATIENT: That’s right, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty lucky that way, actually. My mother, she was allergic to everything! But me, I've always been pretty sturdy. It's just this itch… it's driving me nuts.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your history, the lack of rash, and the timing with the new detergent, I'm leaning towards irritant contact dermatitis, possibly worsened by dry skin. However, to be on the safe side, and since it’s persistent, I'd like to do a quick blood test to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing the itching. It's a simple test, just to get a baseline. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, a blood test? Well… I don't love needles, but if it will help figure out what's wrong, then yes, okay. I'd rather know than just keep scratching! Is it going to be expensive? I don't have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. We can discuss the cost with the lab, and I'll do my best to keep it as affordable as possible. We can also explore some over-the-counter options in the meantime. Let’s go ahead with the blood draw, and I’ll also recommend a hypoallergenic, fragrance-free moisturizer. I’ll write you a prescription for that just in case. In the meantime, could you please discontinue using the new laundry detergent?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. No more new detergent. And I appreciate you looking into keeping the blood test affordable. That's a big help. A cream sounds good too, I'm willing to try anything at this point. Just to get some relief. So, where do we go for the blood test?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We have a lab right across the hall. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, escort you over there. She'll take care of the paperwork. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if the itching gets significantly worse, or you develop any other symptoms like fever, swelling, or difficulty breathing, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and trying to figure this out. It’s just… it’s frustrating when it’s something you can’t even see. I’ll go with Maria, then. Thank you again.
