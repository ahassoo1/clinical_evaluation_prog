DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for, oh… maybe three days now? Not all the time, but comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache, you know?
DOCTOR: A dull ache in the back of your head, starting about three days ago. Can you describe exactly where in the back of your head it hurts?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Right here, Doctor. Feels like… inside my skull, kinda. And sometimes it goes up a little, on the sides, but mostly right here. Like someone is… squeezing, but not hard. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: So, localized to the base of your skull, potentially radiating slightly to the sides. And you describe it as a squeezing, uncomfortable ache. Has anything specific brought this on, or made it worse?
PATIENT: I don't think so, Doctor. Nothing I can remember. I been… well, just doing my usual. Work at the yard, come home, eat, watch a little TV. Maybe a little more lifting than usual, but I always lift. I don’t know. It just… started. It’s not the worst pain, but it bothers me when I try to sleep.
DOCTOR: You mentioned lifting. Can you tell me more about the work you do in the yard?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I work with the trains, Doctor. Been doing it a long time. I… well, we move the little trains, the dinkeys, you know? And help get the big ones ready to go. Lots of pulling levers, checking things. Sometimes I have to… hostle them, move them around with a little engine. It's… hard work, but I'm used to it. Been doing it since I was a young man. Mostly lifting and checking, you know? And making sure everything is safe.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a physically demanding job involving lifting, pulling, and repetitive movements. And this pain started three days ago… Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me think. No fever, I don’t think. No blurry vision. Maybe a little tired, but I’m always a little tired. No… dizziness, no. Oh! Sometimes my neck feels stiff, on the same side as the headache. But that could be from sleeping funny, you know? It’s not always there. That happen sometimes. Not sure if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Neck stiffness on the same side as the headache, intermittent. I see. Now, let's go over some basics. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I haven’t taken much medicine in… a long time. Maybe some aspirin for a cold, but that’s about it. Never had a bad reaction to anything. No, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. I try to just… rest when I need to. Old man stuff, you know? Rest and a little patience.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, do you have any significant medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, when I was younger, maybe sixty years ago, I broke my arm falling from a tree. But that healed fine. And I had the flu a couple of times, like everyone else. Nothing serious, Doctor. No heart trouble, no… nothing like that. Just getting old, I guess. I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time. My wife… she always took care of those things.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. I’m a simple man, you know? I’ve been lucky so far. Just the broken arm when I was young. Never needed anything else. Is this headache something serious, Doctor? I just want to get back to work.
DOCTOR: We'll determine that. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother, she lived to be eighty-five. She had… well, just old age things, you know? Arthritis, mostly. My father… he passed away when I was young. Heart trouble, I think. But that was a long time ago. My sister… she's still alive, but we don’t see each other much. She's healthy, as far as I know. No one else… that I can remember… had headaches like this. No migraines, no… nothing. Just normal old age stuff, like my mother. Does that help, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's noted. Now, before we proceed, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I haven’t had a drink in… well, maybe twenty years. Too expensive, you know? And no… nothing like that. Never touched those things. A simple life, Doctor. That’s all I ever wanted.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. Let’s have a look at your neck. And then we’ll do a quick neurological exam. Please sit up straight.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just tell me what to do. I’m ready when you are. Hope it’s not too bad, Doctor. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: There’s some tenderness here, on the right side. And some mild muscle spasm. Can you tell me if this is painful?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… that’s where it hurts. Not a sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a… a knot, you know? It feels tight. Ouch, yes! That’s it. Right there. That’s the spot.
DOCTOR: Range of motion is slightly limited, particularly with extension. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Cranial nerves are intact. No obvious focal neurological deficits.
PATIENT: That’s good, right Doctor? No… no bad things? What does all that mean? I just want to know if I can go back to work. This headache… it’s just a headache, right?
DOCTOR: Mr. Brum, based on the examination, it appears you're experiencing a muscle strain in your neck, likely exacerbated by your physically demanding work. However, given your age, and the possibility of underlying issues, I want to be cautious. I'm going to order some X-rays of your cervical spine to rule out any bony abnormalities or arthritis. Also, a basic blood panel to check for inflammation. We need to rule out anything more serious. Don't go back to heavy lifting until we have those results. In the meantime, I'm prescribing you a muscle relaxant and some over-the-counter pain relief.
PATIENT: Oh. X-rays? Blood tests? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Okay. If that’s what you think is best. But… how long will it take? And can I at least do some light work? I got bills to pay, you know? A little lifting… just the easy stuff… I don't want to lose my job.
DOCTOR: The results will take a few days, Mr. Brum. And no, you are not to do any heavy lifting. Light work only, and I mean light. No straining, no awkward movements. And if the pain worsens, you are to come back immediately. I’m writing a note for your employer explaining the restrictions. Don’t push yourself. I understand your concerns about finances, but your health is more important. Here are your prescription and your note. Schedule a follow-up appointment with my office in one week to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: One week? That’s a long time. Okay. I guess. No, I… I don’t think so. Just… can I ask what exactly you’re looking for with the X-rays? Arthritis, you said? Is that bad? And… what if it is arthritis? Can I still work? I just… I need to know. It’s my livelihood, you know? Everything depends on it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Brum, I understand your anxiety, but you’re starting to repeat yourself. The X-rays are to assess the bony structures of your neck, rule out any degenerative changes, and ensure there isn’t anything more serious contributing to your pain. Arthritis, or spondylosis as we call it, is a common age-related condition. It doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t work, but it might require modifications to your activities. It depends on the severity. We need to see the results before we can discuss specific options. I’m not going to speculate at this point. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. No speculating. Just… wait for the results. Okay. I’ll… I’ll try not to worry. Thank you, Doctor. I… I guess I’ll go home now and try to rest. And… I’ll schedule the follow-up. Thank you again, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Get some rest, Mr. Brum. And remember, no heavy lifting. Next!
