DOCTOR: Bula and hello! I'm Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you, Kerriann. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello to you too, Doctor Kimm. It's nice to meet you as well. Um, it's a bit embarrassing, honestly, but I've noticed a change in my body odor. It’s… different than usual, and I wanted to get it checked out, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to be embarrassed at all, Kerriann. It's good you're getting it checked out – that’s very proactive of you. Changes like that can sometimes point to something simple, and sometimes it's worth looking into a bit further. Can you tell me a little more about what you mean by “different”?
PATIENT: Hmm. It's hard to explain. I always sweat a little, you know, normal sweating. But this… it’s not just sweat. It’s like a… musty smell, maybe? Not a strong, unpleasant smell, but noticeable. And it seems to be happening more often, even when I haven't been doing anything strenuous. I used to just smell… clean, or like my soap, but now… not so much. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense. A musty smell is helpful to know. And the fact that it's happening more frequently even without exertion is also good information. Okay. And how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Let me think… It started maybe a month or so ago? It was very subtle at first, I almost didn't notice it. But over the last couple of weeks it’s definitely become more consistent. I’d say… probably three weeks, at least, that I've been aware of it regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, about three weeks. Have you noticed it all over your body, or is it localized to certain areas – like your armpits, feet, or groin?
PATIENT: Mostly my armpits, I think. And… maybe a little bit in my groin area, but not as strong. Definitely not my feet, thankfully! I always make sure to keep those clean. It's really just those two spots, and it feels like it's getting a little worse each day, even with showering regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily armpits and some groin, and it’s progressively worsening despite regular showering. Have you changed anything recently?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… Hmm. Not really. I haven’t switched soaps or deodorants. I’m using the same laundry detergent as always. I did start taking a new vitamin a couple of months ago, a multi-vitamin, but that’s the only change I can think of. It’s one of those ones for people our age, you know, with extra D and B12. I started it around the same time as the vitamin, actually. Could that be it? I really hadn’t thought about it before.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful to know about the new multi-vitamin! It could be a factor, though it's not common. Some vitamins can affect body odor in rare cases. To get a better idea of what's going on, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your overall health. Have you experienced any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Let me see… No fever, no chills. No weight loss or gain, thankfully. I've been feeling a little more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn't these days? My appetite is normal, and I’ve been sleeping okay, I guess. No night sweats or anything like that. Oh! I have been a little constipated lately, if that matters. It’s been a little tricky, but nothing major. Does any of that sound relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, weight changes, or night sweats, some fatigue and constipation. That’s good information. Fatigue and constipation could be related, or unrelated. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let's see… I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about ten years ago, but it’s well-controlled with medication. I take a small dose of lisinopril every day. Other than that, not much. I had my gallbladder removed a long time ago, maybe twenty years now, but that’s been fine. No diabetes, no asthma, nothing like that. Oh, and I have some arthritis in my knees, but that's just normal wear and tear, I think. I don’t take anything special for it, just over-the-counter pain relievers when it flares up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so well-controlled hypertension managed with lisinopril, history of gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and some arthritis in the knees. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the lisinopril and that new multi-vitamin?
PATIENT: No, just the lisinopril and the multi-vitamin. I take an occasional ibuprofen for my knees when they bother me, but that's it. I try not to take too many pills if I can help it. I don’t have any allergies to medications that I know of, either. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No other medications, supplements, or allergies. Now, a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… My mother had high blood pressure too, and she had diabetes later in life. My father was healthy as a horse, actually, lived to be 92. My brother has high cholesterol, and my sister has some thyroid problems. Other than that, not much that I can think of. No history of any unusual skin conditions or anything like that in the family. It's pretty standard stuff, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. That's helpful. And finally, a few quick questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke, never have. I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I haven’t had a drink in about six months. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. I don’t have any interest in that sort of thing. I try to stay pretty healthy, all things considered. I walk a little bit most days and try to eat a balanced diet. I’m a retired floor layer, so it’s nice to have a little more time to focus on taking care of myself these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, no recreational drugs, and a history of being a floor layer. That's all very helpful information, Kerriann. Alright, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like we have a reasonable starting point. It could be something as simple as a reaction to the multi-vitamin, though we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s okay with you. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your armpits and groin area to see if there are any visible changes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Please have a seat on the exam table and lean forward. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Now, if you could just lift your arms for me… Let’s take a look at your armpits. I don’t see any rash, lesions, or significant discoloration. There is a mild odor present, as you mentioned. And if you don't mind, I'll just take a quick look at your groin area… Similar findings in your groin area – no visible abnormalities. Just a mild odor. Everything appears normal visually, which is good. Based on the physical exam and your history, it's unlikely to be anything serious. However, to rule out any underlying medical causes, I’d like to order a few simple blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Blood tests are fine. Anything to make sure everything is okay. What kind of tests are we talking about? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm thinking a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or inflammation, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, just to rule out any thyroid issues. We can also check your vitamin D levels, since you mentioned starting a multi-vitamin. These tests will give us a good baseline and help us identify if there's anything going on internally that could be contributing to the change in body odor. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very thorough, Doctor. All of those sound fine. I appreciate you being so careful. So, how do we do those tests? Do I need to come back another day, or can we do them right now? And will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Great! I’m glad you feel comfortable with that plan. We can do the blood draw right here in the clinic today, if that works for you. It shouldn’t take long at all. And yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand, so no food or sugary drinks. You can still drink water. Ideally, we’d want you to fast overnight, so if you had a meal before coming in, we may need to reschedule for tomorrow morning. Would that be a problem?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I had a small breakfast this morning… toast and a banana. So, I guess tomorrow morning would be best. No problem at all. I can easily work that into my schedule. Should I still drink water tonight and tomorrow morning? Just trying to get all the details right.
DOCTOR: Okay, tomorrow morning it is! And yes, please continue to drink plenty of water tonight and tomorrow morning. Staying hydrated will make the blood draw much easier. We'll get the results back within a few days. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if the odor gets significantly worse or you develop any other symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've been very thorough and explained everything clearly. I feel much better knowing we're getting this checked out. Thank you, Doctor Kimm. I’ll see you tomorrow morning then.
DOCTOR: Wonderful! You're very welcome, Kerriann. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. We'll get you scheduled for tomorrow morning and I'll see you then. If you have any questions before then, just give the clinic a call. Have a good rest of your day, and I'll see you tomorrow!
