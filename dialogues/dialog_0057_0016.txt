DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…Farson, actually. Nicky Farson. And honestly? It’s about my wife’s medication. She’s been on that blood thinner for…well, a while now, and she’s bruising like a peach these days. It’s getting ridiculous, frankly. I’m not a doctor, but it doesn’t seem right.
DOCTOR: Thank you for bringing that to my attention, Mr. Farson. It’s good you’re keeping an eye on things. It's always concerning when there’s a change in how someone responds to a medication. So, your wife has been on a blood thinner for some time, and you’ve noticed an increase in bruising recently. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, she’s been on it since…let’s see…the stroke, about three years ago now. And for the longest time, it was fine. A little bump here or there, normal stuff. But the last month or so… it's different. Even gentle touches leave marks. She’s practically covered in them, Doctor. And she worries, naturally. I worry. It just seems…excessive. I mean, she’s careful, but it’s like paper skin now. Honestly, it’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson. That does sound unsettling, especially with the sudden increase in bruising. It's good you've noticed this change. To get a better understanding, could you tell me what medication specifically she's taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Names… I always let my wife handle that part. Let me think… It's a little orange pill. No, wait… it’s… Warfarin, I think? Yes, Warfarin. That's it. She takes… five milligrams, daily. She’s very strict about it, I assure you. She sets an alarm and everything. But still… these bruises. It’s as if it’s not working correctly, if you understand what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin, five milligrams daily. Thank you. And it’s good to know she’s diligent about taking it. It's a medication that requires consistent dosing. To help me assess the situation, could you tell me if she's had any recent illnesses, infections, or changes in her diet?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… No, no recent illnesses, not really. She had a bit of a cold last winter, but nothing major. As for diet…well, she’s always been a bit of a picky eater, truthfully. Mostly salads and soups, a bit of chicken. Nothing drastically different, I wouldn’t say. She likes her cranberry juice, though. She drinks a fair amount of that, actually. Does that matter? I always thought it was good for her.
DOCTOR: That's good information, thank you. Cranberry juice can interact with Warfarin, so that's helpful to know. It can sometimes affect how the medication works. Now, has she had any recent falls or injuries that you're aware of, even minor ones?
PATIENT: No, no falls. She’s remarkably steady for her age, actually. A bit slow getting around sometimes, but very careful. She uses a cane, just as a precaution, but she hasn’t tripped or anything. These bruises… they appear spontaneously, it seems. A light touch, a gentle bump, and poof, a mark. It’s quite concerning, Doctor. It's not normal, is it? I mean, a person shouldn't bruise like this.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, Mr. Farson. It's definitely not typical for someone to bruise so easily without a clear cause. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check her blood pressure, pulse, and look at the bruising to get a better sense of its severity and distribution. Then, I’ll need to order a blood test to check her INR level—that’s how we monitor the effectiveness of Warfarin. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. A blood test… of course. Whatever you think is best. She’s… she’s a bit of a worrier, my wife. So, knowing you’re looking into it properly will put her mind at ease, I suppose. And frankly, it will put mine at ease too. The bruising… it’s unsettling. Just get to the bottom of it, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Farson. I understand. We’ll get to the bottom of this. If you could have your wife sit up on the table, that would be great. I’ll start by checking her blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'll take a look at the bruising. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Alright. She’s… she's a bit self-conscious about her weight, so, be gentle, if you would. She’s not as spry as she used to be. Let’s get this over with, then. She's been looking forward to getting this sorted.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I will be as gentle as possible, and I understand her concerns. We’ll take our time. Alright, Mrs. Farson, I'm just going to wrap this cuff around your arm. It will tighten for a moment, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Just relax your arm. Okay, your blood pressure is 130 over 80. That’s within a normal range. Now, let's check your pulse. Your pulse is 72, which is also normal. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to take a look at the bruising. Could you point out the areas where you've noticed the most bruising?
PATIENT: There, Doctor. And on my legs, too. It's gotten progressively worse, you see? Just a little bump… and poof. I haven't been falling or anything. It's very distressing. And it aches, sometimes. Not terribly, but… a dull ache. I’m usually very careful. Always have been. Honestly, Doctor, it’s like she’s made of glass these days.
DOCTOR: I see. There is significant bruising present on both your forearms and shins. The marks vary in size and color, which suggests they occurred at different times. I'm gently pressing here… does that cause any pain, Mrs. Farson?
PATIENT: Ouch. That one stings a bit. Not terribly, but…yes, that one is tender. The others aren't so bad, just…discolored. But that one…feels a bit like a bruise under the skin, if you understand what I mean. It’s not just surface bruising. It feels…deeper. And it’s been there for about a week now, I think. It’s not getting better, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: I understand. It does sound like this bruise is more substantial and deeper than some of the others. That's concerning. Okay, Mrs. Farson, thank you for showing me the areas of concern. Based on what I’ve seen and heard, I'm concerned about the extent of the bruising and the fact that it's appearing with minimal trauma. The deeper bruise on your shin is particularly concerning. As I mentioned earlier, I'd like to order a blood test to check her INR level, as well as a complete blood count to rule out any other underlying causes for the bruising. It's also possible we’ll need to consider other tests if the initial results are inconclusive. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is necessary. We just want to know what’s going on. It’s unsettling, as you can imagine. My wife… she’s not one to complain, you see? So, if she’s worried, it must be serious. We trust your judgment, Doctor. Just…please, find out what’s causing this. It's been a worrying few weeks. And… how long will it take to get the results? Elena has a book club meeting next week, and she’d hate to miss it. Not that it’s important, but… she looks forward to those things.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Farson. It's good that she has things she looks forward to. I'll do my best to get the results back as quickly as possible. Typically, the results take 24 to 48 hours. I'll call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I want to advise Mrs. Farson to avoid any activities that could cause injury. And please, let me know immediately if she experiences any new symptoms, such as bleeding, severe pain, or dizziness. I’m going to write a brief note to the lab to flag these results as urgent. And I'll also prepare a list of instructions to take home, outlining the precautions she should take and the symptoms to watch for. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds excellent, Doctor. Flagging the results as urgent… that's very thoughtful. And the list of instructions… that will put my wife’s mind at ease, I think. She likes to be prepared. She worries about everything, you see. A bit of a hypochondriac, if I’m honest. But she’s a good woman, my Elena. And we just want to get to the bottom of this. Thank you, Doctor. Truly. You've been very kind and reassuring.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Farson. It’s my pleasure. And it’s perfectly okay for your wife to be proactive about her health. It's always better to be safe than sorry. Here are the instructions, Mrs. Farson. Please read them carefully. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, please try not to worry too much. We’ll figure this out together. Is there anything else I can do for you both today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. We just appreciate your attention to this matter. Let’s get you home, then, dear. Thank you again, Doctor Sieh. We’ll await your call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll be in touch soon. .
