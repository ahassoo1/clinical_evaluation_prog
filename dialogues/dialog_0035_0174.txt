DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I’ve not been myself lately. A bit… down, you could say. Honestly, I’m hoping we can get this sorted quickly, if you don’t mind. I have things to do, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Derasmo. I understand you'd like to get this resolved as efficiently as possible. We’ll do our best. When you say "down," can you tell me a little more about what that feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s… difficult to explain. Not exactly sadness, though there’s some of that. More like a heaviness, a lack of… purpose, perhaps? Everything feels like a chore. Even getting out of bed. I used to be so active, always busy with something – the beach, the slopes… now? I just… sit. It’s been going on for a few months now, I suppose. I haven’t kept strict track. I just know it's not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heaviness, lack of purpose, and things feeling like a chore, even getting out of bed. And this has been going on for several months. That helps. Has anything specific happened around the time you started feeling this way?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… Well, my divorce was finalized about six months ago. It wasn't… amicable. A lot of back and forth, unpleasantness. He… well, let's just say he wasn't a good man. We were married a long time, though. Forty years. So, perhaps that has something to do with it? I hadn't really thought about it being connected until you asked. It just… sort of crept up on me.
DOCTOR: Forty years is a long time, Ms. Derasmo. A difficult divorce after that long is certainly a significant life event. It's very common to experience emotional distress after something like that. Besides the heaviness and lack of purpose, have you noticed any changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My sleep is… fitful. I wake up several times a night. And I've lost my appetite, definitely. Food just doesn’t taste the same. Everything feels bland. As for energy... well, you already know about that. Barely enough to get through the day, let alone do anything enjoyable. I used to swim every morning, now… I haven't been in the water in weeks. It’s a shame, really. I’m usually a very strong swimmer.
DOCTOR: Okay, fitful sleep, loss of appetite, and decreased energy, along with the loss of interest in swimming. Have you been experiencing any trouble with your concentration, or finding it difficult to focus on things?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. That’s a good observation. I used to be able to read a book easily, follow a storyline. Now? My mind wanders constantly. I find myself re-reading the same page several times, and still not remembering what I’ve read. It's quite frustrating. And I've been… forgetful, I suppose. Small things, mostly. Where I put my keys, appointments… nothing serious, but enough to be annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty concentrating and some forgetfulness. Ms. Derasmo, have you been experiencing any feelings of hopelessness or thoughts of harming yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not at all. Hopelessness… perhaps a little. It feels like things will never be quite the same, but I wouldn't say I’m hopeless. And harming myself? Absolutely not. I’m a strong woman, I’ve always been resilient. I just… want to feel like myself again. I want my energy back, my joy back. That's all. I assure you, Doctor, I would never do anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to hear, Ms. Derasmo. That’s very reassuring. It sounds like you're experiencing several symptoms that could be consistent with depression, potentially related to the stress of your recent divorce. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I recall, no. I’ve always been quite healthy, really. A little arthritis in my knees, the usual aches and pains of getting older, but nothing serious. I've had the regular check-ups, vaccinations, that sort of thing. My doctor, Dr. Adebayo, always said I had a strong constitution. I haven’t been hospitalized for anything significant in my adult life, thankfully. Do you need details on any particular vaccinations? I can try to recall, though my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: No, details on vaccinations aren’t necessary at this time. Just confirming no significant past medical history or hospitalizations is helpful. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes, actually. I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago. And a hysterectomy around the same time, I believe. Both went smoothly, no complications. It was all quite routine, as far as surgeries go. Other than that, just the usual minor things – wisdom teeth removed when I was young, a few stitches here and there. Nothing major. I believe Dr. Adebayo has all the records, of course. He’s a very thorough doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal and hysterectomy fifteen years ago. Good to know. Now, is there any family history of mental health conditions, like depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult question. My mother… she was a quiet woman, always seemed… sad. But people didn't talk about things like depression back then. They just said she was “melancholy” or “a worrier.” My brother, he was… complicated. He had some issues, let’s just say, but I don’t know if it was depression or something else entirely. He passed away a few years ago, so I can’t ask him. And my father was stoic, never showed much emotion at all. So, perhaps there's a tendency, but it wasn't something openly discussed. It's hard to say for certain. I hope that’s a helpful answer, even if it’s not very specific.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly helpful, Ms. Derasmo. It sounds like there may be a family predisposition, even if it wasn’t explicitly diagnosed. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, just a few. I take a daily multivitamin, for general health. And ibuprofen occasionally for my arthritis, when it flares up. Nothing prescribed, just the usual over-the-counter things. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but Dr. Adebayo took me off of it a few years ago, said my numbers were good. That’s it, really. I’m not one for taking a lot of pills, if I can help it. I prefer a natural approach to health, if possible. Now, are we nearly finished? I do have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Good to know. We are nearly finished with the initial questioning, Ms. Derasmo. I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long, please. I truly appreciate you trying to be efficient. I have a luncheon to get to after my appointment, you see. Please, go ahead. I’ll do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Very well. First, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll take a quick look in your ears and throat. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Ears appear normal, no signs of infection. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Everything appears physically normal at this time. Given your symptoms and our conversation, it’s likely you are experiencing symptoms of depression, possibly related to the stress of your recent divorce. However, to rule out any other underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, I’d like to order some blood work. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood work is fine. As long as it doesn’t involve a terribly long wait time. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel like myself again. It’s exhausting being like this. When can I expect the results? And then, what happens? I'm hoping for a straightforward solution, if that's possible.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Derasmo. We’ll get this moving as quickly as we can. The lab results typically take 24-48 hours. The nurse will contact you with the results. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a low dose antidepressant to see if it helps alleviate your symptoms. It's a common and effective treatment. We'll start with a low dose and adjust as needed, if any. It may take a few weeks to feel the full effect, so it's important to be patient. I’m also going to give you a referral to a therapist. Talking to a professional can be incredibly helpful in processing your emotions and developing coping strategies. Here are the prescription and the referral information. I want you to know that you’re not alone in this, and we'll work together to get you feeling better. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: Right. Antidepressants and therapy. I suppose that’s what I expected. I must admit, I'm not thrilled about the medication. I've always preferred natural remedies, but… if it will help. And a therapist… well, I’ve never spoken to one before. It feels a bit… strange. Do they take insurance? I have private coverage, thankfully. And… will this medication interfere with anything? I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I don't want to have to give that up entirely. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel like myself again, and I want to get back to my life. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any side effects I should watch out for? I do have an appointment to keep this afternoon, so if you could be concise, I’d appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Derasmo. The therapist I’m referring you to, Dr. Elkins, does accept your insurance. The prescription is for Sertraline, a common antidepressant. It’s generally well-tolerated, but some common side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, and insomnia. These usually subside within a week or two. Regarding alcohol, it’s best to avoid it while starting this medication, as it can worsen the side effects. Once you’ve been on it for a few weeks and are feeling stable, you can discuss with me whether you can resume drinking in moderation. It's important to take the medication as prescribed and to attend your therapy appointments regularly. If you experience any severe side effects, such as suicidal thoughts or a severe allergic reaction, contact me immediately. We'll monitor your progress closely. I’m confident we can get you feeling better, Ms. Derasmo. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and… well, your patience with an older woman who doesn’t quite understand all of this modern medicine. I’ll get the blood work done and schedule an appointment with Dr. Elkins. I do hope this works. I just want to feel like myself again. I have a luncheon to attend and frankly, I need to be on my best form. Thank you again, Doctor Alzoubi. Good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Derasmo. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best at your luncheon, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. Have a good day.
