DOCTOR: Hi Liza, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor. Well, I’ve been thinking lately… I’m interested in learning about mindfulness or meditation, if that’s something you can help with? I just feel like… things are a bit much sometimes, and I’ve heard it can help calm things down.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So you're interested in exploring mindfulness or meditation as a way to manage stress and feel more calm. That’s a great idea – it can be very helpful. Just to be clear, are you experiencing anything specific that's causing you stress right now, or is it more of a general feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not really one thing, you know? It’s more… a buildup. Work is okay, I like what I do, fixing the signals and switches, it keeps me busy. But it’s demanding, being on call and making sure everything runs smoothly. And then… well, being single for so long… it adds up. I don't have anyone to really… share things with, if that makes sense. So it's not a crisis, just… a general feeling of being a bit overwhelmed, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Work stress, on-call responsibilities, and feeling socially isolated can definitely contribute to feeling overwhelmed. And it sounds like you’re recognizing that it’s a buildup, rather than a specific event. That's good self-awareness. Have you ever tried any stress-reduction techniques before – like deep breathing exercises, yoga, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I try to get enough sleep when I can, which isn't always easy with the on-call schedule. And I walk a bit, when the weather is nice, but nothing… structured. I've always thought about yoga, but I’ve never actually taken a class. Honestly, I don’t even really know where to start, or what kind of mindfulness even is beyond, you know, just… being calm. Is it like… emptying your head? Because that sounds really hard.
DOCTOR: It is hard, and you’re right to question what it is – it's often misunderstood. It’s not about emptying your head, it’s more about observing your thoughts and feelings without judgment. It's about being present in the moment. We can certainly talk about some resources to get you started, but first, just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any physical symptoms along with this feeling of being overwhelmed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Physical symptoms… Well, sometimes my shoulders are really tense, like I’m carrying a weight. And I think I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, even when I do get enough sleep. It’s hard to explain. Not like sick tired, just… heavy. Oh! And sometimes my stomach feels… off. Not pain, exactly, more like… butterflies, or a knot. Does that make any sense? It usually happens when I’m thinking about work, or… well, when I’m alone for too long, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes perfect sense. Tension in your shoulders, fatigue, and stomach upset – those are all very common physical responses to stress. It sounds like your body is definitely telling you something. Do you have any history of anxiety or depression, or have you ever spoken to a therapist about similar feelings in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been… pretty stoic, I suppose. My mum always said I was a strong one. I handle things, you know? I just… haven’t been handling things as well lately, I guess. And I feel a bit silly coming to the doctor for… feeling a bit overwhelmed. It feels like there are people with real problems. I don't want to take up your time with… this. Is this even something a doctor deals with? I mean, I don’t need a prescription, do I?
DOCTOR: Liza, it’s absolutely something a doctor deals with. Your mental and emotional wellbeing are just as important as your physical health. And you’re not taking up my time at all. It takes courage to come in and talk about these things, and I’m glad you did. It's very common to feel this way, and many people come to us seeking support for stress and overwhelm. And no, you don’t necessarily need a prescription. We can explore different strategies to help you manage these feelings. Just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, I have… high blood pressure, but it's controlled with medication. I take lisinopril, 20 milligrams daily. Otherwise… nothing much. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, and I broke my wrist a few years ago, but that healed fine. I've had Medicare for a few years now, since turning 65. No allergies that I know of. And I haven't had any major surgeries other than the appendix. I try to eat healthy, mostly, but I do enjoy a good pastry now and then!
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, controlled hypertension with lisinopril, appendectomy as a teen, wrist fracture, and no known allergies. Now, just to rule out anything else going on, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not at all. That sounds… sensible. I suppose it’s good to make sure nothing else is causing it. What will you be doing? Nothing… embarrassing, I hope?
DOCTOR: Definitely nothing embarrassing! I just want to listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, and briefly examine your abdomen. Just a quick check to make sure everything looks okay physically. We can start with your heart and lungs. If you could please sit up here, that would be great.
PATIENT: Okay. It’s a bit cold, isn't it? But I suppose that’s normal. Go ahead. I’ll try to be still. I always feel a bit awkward during these exams, but I understand it's necessary. Just… try to be gentle?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. And you're right, the room is a bit chilly. I'll make a note to have maintenance adjust the temperature. Okay, deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Everything sounds clear, which is good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be related to the stress you've been experiencing. Now, I'm just going to check your thyroid.
PATIENT: Okay. It is a bit hard to relax, if you don't mind me saying. It feels like… I’m being inspected. But I understand you need to do what you need to do. My mum always said I was a bit of a worrier, you know? It probably doesn’t help. Go ahead with the thyroid, then. I'll try to keep still.
DOCTOR: Everything feels normal here. No tenderness or lumps. Now, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen. Okay… and just one more… deep breath in… and out… Your abdomen sounds normal as well. I don't feel any masses or tenderness. Okay, everything sounds and feels good physically. Given your history and what you’ve described, it sounds like you’re experiencing stress and some anxiety-related symptoms. We've ruled out any obvious physical causes.
PATIENT: That's… good to hear, I suppose. I was worried it was something serious. So… it’s just… my nerves then? Is there… anything I can do? Besides taking deep breaths, that is. I’ve tried that, and it doesn’t seem to help much. I feel like… a bit of a mess, if I’m honest. A strong one, but still… a mess.
DOCTOR: It’s absolutely not just “your nerves”, and you’re not a mess at all. It's very common to feel overwhelmed, especially with the stressors you've described. And it takes strength to acknowledge how you’re feeling and seek help, so you are strong. There are several things we can try. Mindfulness and meditation are a good starting point, and there are some excellent resources I can recommend. We can also explore cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, which can help you identify and manage negative thought patterns. Lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and a healthy diet, can also make a big difference. Would you be interested in a referral to a therapist who specializes in anxiety and stress management?
PATIENT: A therapist… hmm. I don’t know. I’ve never really… talked to anyone about these things before. It feels a bit strange, if I’m honest. But… if you think it would help… I suppose I could try. What would it involve? And… is it expensive? I’m on Medicare, so I’m not sure what it would cover.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel hesitant, especially if you've never done therapy before. It takes courage to open up to someone, and it’s okay to be unsure. Therapy typically involves talking to a trained professional about your thoughts, feelings, and experiences in a safe and confidential setting. The therapist will work with you to develop strategies to manage your stress and improve your overall wellbeing. As for cost, Medicare does cover therapy, but the coverage can vary depending on the specific plan and the therapist. I can provide you with a list of therapists in the area who accept Medicare, and their office can verify your coverage and explain any out-of-pocket costs. We can also start with some self-help resources in the meantime. Would you like me to print out a handout with some relaxation techniques and websites with information on mindfulness and stress management?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be lovely. A handout sounds… less intimidating, I suppose. And a list of therapists… I can look into it. No promises, mind you. I need to think about it. But… thank you. You’ve been very… kind. And patient. It's nice to know… someone understands.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Liza. It’s my job to listen and help in any way I can. And you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with stress and anxiety, and there’s no shame in seeking help. Here are some relaxation techniques, information on mindfulness, and a list of therapists who accept Medicare in the area. I recommend starting with the relaxation techniques and exploring the websites. If you decide therapy is right for you, you can call the therapists on the list to see if they’re a good fit. I also want to reiterate that if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as panic attacks or thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out to a crisis hotline or emergency services immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Amussen. You've given me a lot to think about. And... a bit of hope, perhaps. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Liza. I'm glad I could help. Remember, taking care of your mental and emotional wellbeing is just as important as taking care of your physical health. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Have a good day!
