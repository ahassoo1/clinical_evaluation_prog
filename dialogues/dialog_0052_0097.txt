DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 44 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 44, though I maintain a very active lifestyle. It’s…well, my husband suggested I look into some paperwork. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should…things happen. He's been rather insistent lately. I believe he mentioned an “Advance Directive” or a “POLST” form? Frankly, I haven’t the faintest idea what either of those are, but he seemed quite serious about it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Chilla. It’s very responsible of both of you to be thinking about these things. It's always best to be prepared, and it’s wonderful that your husband is encouraging this. An Advance Directive, sometimes called a living will, outlines your wishes for medical care should you become unable to speak for yourself. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a medical order that specifies which life-sustaining treatments you want or don’t want. Before we get into those forms specifically, I'd like to understand your overall health and your general views on medical care. It’s important to have a conversation about what matters most to you before completing any paperwork. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been quite healthy. I eat a balanced diet – mostly Mediterranean, you know – and I exercise regularly. I don’t typically go to doctors unless absolutely necessary. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, and a rather unpleasant bout of the flu a few years back, but nothing…serious. My husband insists on annual check-ups for both of us, which I tolerate. He worries excessively, you see. Is this truly necessary? Discussing my…preferences for hypothetical illnesses seems rather morbid, frankly.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Chilla. And I understand your reluctance – it can feel morbid to discuss these things when you’re feeling well. However, having these conversations now ensures your wishes are respected, regardless of what might happen. It's about empowering you and your husband, not anticipating illness. Since you say you generally enjoy good health and only see the doctor for check-ups, could you tell me what your husband has discussed with you regarding these forms specifically?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, he rambles. It’s always a rather long-winded explanation involving his aunt Mildred and a very unfortunate incident in a hospital. He spoke something about…tubes and machines and not wanting me to be “kept alive artificially.” He’s very emphatic about quality of life, which is admirable, I suppose. He also mentioned…a DNR. Do Not Resuscitate, I think he called it. It all sounds rather…extreme. He keeps saying he wants to “respect my autonomy,” but frankly, it feels like he’s the one imposing his views on me. Is this something I have to do? Because if it’s simply his anxiety talking, I’m not sure I see the point.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Chilla, and it sounds like your husband is motivated by a strong desire to ensure your well-being. It’s good that he’s thinking about these things, but you are absolutely right – ultimately, the decision is yours, and it must reflect your values and wishes. You are not required to complete any of these documents if you don’t feel comfortable doing so. Let’s break down these terms. A DNR – Do Not Resuscitate – is an order that tells healthcare providers not to perform CPR if your heart stops or you stop breathing. It’s often discussed in the context of serious, life-limiting illnesses. A POLST, as we discussed, details your preferences for life-sustaining treatments. And an Advance Directive encompasses a wider range of wishes, including things like your preferences for pain management and end-of-life care. To help me understand where you stand, could you tell me a little bit about your overall views on medical interventions?
PATIENT: Interventions… Well, I believe in modern medicine, of course. I’m not against treatment if it’s going to help. But I also believe in a certain…dignity. I don’t want to be kept alive hooked up to machines if there’s truly no hope of recovery. And I certainly don’t want to be a burden on anyone. My husband…he tends to be overly optimistic about these things. He believes every illness is curable with enough effort. I’m more…realistic. I’ve lived a full life, Doctor. I don’t need…miracles. I simply want to be comfortable, should the need arise. Is that so much to ask? And frankly, I would prefer not to prolong the inevitable if it’s…well, inevitable.
DOCTOR: That is not too much to ask at all, Ms. Chilla. In fact, it’s a very reasonable and thoughtful perspective. You’ve articulated your wishes beautifully. It sounds like you value quality of life and dignity, and you’re comfortable accepting the natural course of events. Knowing this, we can certainly discuss an Advance Directive and possibly a POLST form, focusing on your preferences for comfort and avoiding prolonged suffering. Before we do that, though, I'd like to briefly review your medical history, just to ensure I have a complete picture. You mentioned annual check-ups with your husband. Do you happen to know if any significant medical issues have been identified during those visits?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, they are routine check-ups. Blood pressure, cholesterol, the usual. He obsesses over those numbers, you see. I believe last year he was concerned about a slightly elevated…something. I can’t recall the specifics. He started me on a new supplement, some kind of berry extract, and insisted I reduce my salt intake. It was rather tedious. Honestly, I doubt anything truly significant has ever been identified. I feel perfectly healthy. Is it truly necessary to delve into such minutiae? It feels like you’re searching for a problem where none exists. I came here about these forms, not a detailed review of my husband's anxieties.
DOCTOR: You are right to point that out, Ms. Chilla, and I apologize for the perceived focus on detail. It is simply my standard practice to have a complete medical history, but it sounds like those check-ups have been quite thorough, and you feel well. We can certainly focus on the Advance Directive and POLST forms as you wish. To clarify, are you familiar with the concept of a healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: A healthcare…proxy? No, I don't believe so. My husband handles all the…practical matters, you see. I leave the paperwork to him. Is that someone who…makes decisions for me? If I am unable to…speak for myself? He’s always talking about appointing someone. Is that what this is about? Because I trust his judgement implicitly, naturally. But I would prefer to be the one to make my own decisions, as long as I am capable. Is it necessary to have a proxy if he is already so involved? It sounds rather complicated.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Ms. Chilla. A healthcare proxy, also known as a durable power of attorney for healthcare, is someone you appoint to make medical decisions on your behalf if you become unable to do so yourself. It is often the spouse or a trusted family member, and it sounds like your husband would be an excellent choice, given your trust in him. Having a healthcare proxy is a very good idea, even if your husband is already involved in your care. It legally designates him as the person authorized to make decisions, ensuring your wishes are respected. It simplifies things significantly if a situation arises where you cannot communicate. We can discuss the paperwork for both an Advance Directive outlining your overall wishes and a POLST form detailing specific treatment preferences, and also the appointment of your husband as your healthcare proxy. Before we begin, would you like me to explain the specific sections of each form, or would you prefer to go through them together, and I can answer any questions as we go?
PATIENT: I suppose going through them together would be best. I’m not particularly fond of reading legal documents, you see. All the jargon…it’s quite overwhelming. And I’m sure my husband has already simplified everything as much as possible. But it’s always good to have a second opinion, naturally. Though I must reiterate, I trust his judgement implicitly. Let’s start with the Advance Directive, I suppose. What exactly does that entail? And how long will this process take? I have a luncheon engagement this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. We’ll take it at your pace, and I’ll do my best to explain everything in plain language. It shouldn’t take too long, perhaps 30-45 minutes for both forms. The Advance Directive, as we mentioned, outlines your overall wishes for medical care should you become unable to communicate. It covers things like your preferences for life-sustaining treatment – such as ventilation or feeding tubes – and pain management. It also allows you to express your values and beliefs regarding end-of-life care. This first section is about your general wishes for medical care. It asks about your beliefs regarding the quality of life, and what is important to you. It asks if you would want all possible life-sustaining treatment, or if you have specific limitations. Do you feel comfortable reading this section, or would you prefer me to read it aloud?
PATIENT: I suppose I can manage. Though I must say, this is rather morbid. All this talk of tubes and…limitations. It’s quite depressing, actually. Let me see… “My wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment…” Yes, well, I suppose I would want everything done, within reason, if there’s a chance of recovery. But absolutely no prolonged suffering. I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially if there’s truly no hope. That much is certain. Is there an option for “quality of life over quantity”? That seems rather important. And what exactly constitutes “artificial” life support? It’s all so vague.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable view, Ms. Chilla. And you’re right to question the wording – it can be vague. This section here allows you to specify your preferences for various treatments. You can check boxes indicating whether you want or do not want things like mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, CPR, and dialysis. And yes, there is space to express your values regarding quality of life. You can write a statement indicating that you prioritize quality of life over quantity, and that you do not want prolonged suffering. We can also add a note specifying that you define “artificial” life support as any treatment that does not offer a reasonable chance of recovery. Would you like me to write that note for you, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, you’re very patient. It’s quite admirable. You write it, please. My handwriting is atrocious, and I’m sure my phrasing would be…less precise. Something along the lines of “I prioritize quality of life and do not wish to be kept alive artificially if there is no reasonable prospect of recovery.” Yes, that sounds about right. Though perhaps add “comfort is paramount.” Is that too dramatic? I don’t want to sound…melodramatic. Just make it clear that I don’t want to be subjected to prolonged suffering, and that my comfort is the primary concern. Thank you. What’s next? Is this POLST form as…depressing?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. "I prioritize quality of life and do not wish to be kept alive artificially if there is no reasonable prospect of recovery. Comfort is paramount." Excellent phrasing. Here you are. Now, the POLST form – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a bit different. It's a medical order, signed by a physician, that specifies which life-sustaining treatments you want or don’t want. It’s more concrete than the Advance Directive. It’s often used for patients with serious illnesses, but it can be completed by anyone who wants to clearly define their wishes. It has sections on things like CPR, ventilation, feeding tubes, and antibiotics. The questions are more direct, asking whether you want or do not want specific treatments. It's less about values and more about actionable orders. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Actionable orders…so it’s actually something the doctors will do or not do based on this document? Rather than just…suggestions? Yes, that makes a bit more sense. So, if I check “do not want” for CPR, they simply…won't perform it? Even if my husband thinks they should? That seems rather…final. Is there room for nuance? Because I wouldn't want them to automatically withhold treatment in every situation. What if it’s a simple…misunderstanding? This is all rather alarming, actually. Perhaps I shouldn't fill this one out after all. It seems too…absolute.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask those questions, Ms. Chilla. It is a serious document, and it's important to understand the implications. And yes, if you check "do not want" for CPR, it means that healthcare providers will not perform CPR if your heart stops or you stop breathing. However, it’s not automatic or inflexible. There is always room for clinical judgment. If there’s a question about your wishes, or if the situation is unclear, healthcare providers will consult with your healthcare proxy – in this case, your husband – and make a decision based on what they believe is in your best interests. And you are not obligated to complete this form if you’re not comfortable doing so. It’s perfectly acceptable to leave it blank. We can focus on the Advance Directive, which outlines your overall wishes, and that may be sufficient. Would you like me to explain the specific sections of the POLST form, or would you prefer to set it aside for now?
PATIENT: Set it aside, please. Honestly, it’s all rather overwhelming. The Advance Directive seems…sufficient. It captures my overall wishes, and my husband is quite capable of interpreting them. I don’t need a detailed medical order dictating every possible scenario. It’s all a bit too…clinical for my taste. Let’s just finish the Advance Directive, and I can be on my way. I have a luncheon engagement, you know. And frankly, I need a glass of wine. This has been…stressful. Thank you for your patience, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Is there anything else I need to do? Or can we just…sign this and be finished?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. I completely understand. The Advance Directive is a very good starting point, and it sounds like your husband will be an excellent advocate for your wishes. Everything looks excellent. You've clearly articulated your preferences, and I've made a note of your desire for quality of life and comfort. If you're comfortable, you can sign here, and we'll make a copy for your records. I'll also send a copy to your primary care physician. And yes, I completely agree – a glass of wine sounds like an excellent idea after all this. Please, take your time. I'll be right here if you have any questions.
PATIENT: There. Done. Honestly, it’s a relief to have that finished. I feel much better knowing my wishes are documented, even if I find the whole process rather…depressing. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with my…reservations. And please, don't hesitate to send a copy to my husband. He worries excessively, you know. He'll be thrilled. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I have a luncheon to attend. Good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Chilla. I'm glad I could help. And yes, I’ll be sure to send a copy to your husband. I suspect he will be very pleased as well. Enjoy your luncheon. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any further questions or concerns. Have a wonderful day.
