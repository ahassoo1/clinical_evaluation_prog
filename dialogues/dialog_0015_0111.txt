DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s…a matter of my complexion. It’s darkening. And I tire easily. Frankly, it’s quite bothersome. I haven’t much time for these things, you understand.
DOCTOR: Darkening complexion and fatigue. I see. Can you describe the darkening?
PATIENT: Describe it? It’s…darker. Than it used to be. It’s on my skin, naturally. All over, I suppose. I don’t examine myself closely. Really, I expect a diagnosis, not a request for artistry in description. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, a proper assessment requires details. "Darkening" could mean a great many things. Is it uniform, patchy?
PATIENT: Patchy… uniform… Honestly, doctor, I work with iron and rebar. My hands are calloused, my skin is exposed to the elements. It’s probably just… dirt. And old age. Though I assure you, I keep myself presentable. It’s not as if it’s suddenly appeared overnight. It's been…gradual. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Gradual darkening, all over. And you attribute it to your work and age. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Let me think… my wife complains I nap more easily. And I seem to lose my train of thought. Small things, really. I'm eighty-five years old, doctor. What doesn’t change? I'm a practical man, not one for dwelling on every little ache and symptom. Is there a solution, or are we simply cataloging the decline?
DOCTOR: Fatigue and difficulty with concentration. Alright. And has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: My diet? No. My wife prepares the meals. Rice, vegetables, some fish when available. The usual. I don't fuss over such things. And frankly, I don't recall any alterations. I trust her judgment implicitly. Can we move on? I have appointments to keep.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let me just check your EHR to see what's been documented previously… I see no recent comprehensive blood work. And your last physical was…three years ago. We'll need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I’d like to start with a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. That will give us a baseline.
PATIENT: Tests? Blood work? Doctor, I came in with a simple complaint, not for a full medical overhaul. I assure you, I’m quite capable of discerning my own limitations. Is this absolutely necessary? I dislike needles. And the waiting… simply dreadful.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, fatigue and skin changes can be indicative of a number of things, some of which are quite serious. While I respect your self-assessment, a proper diagnosis requires objective data. A complete blood count will help rule out anemia, infection, or other blood disorders. The metabolic panel assesses organ function, and the thyroid test will check for hormonal imbalances. It's a standard procedure, and frankly, irresponsible to proceed without it. It’s not optional. I’ll have the nurse draw the samples now. It will take only a few minutes.
PATIENT: Fine. Do what you must. But I expect a swift conclusion to this ordeal. And I trust your nurse is… proficient. I haven't the patience for multiple attempts. Honestly, the inefficiency of modern healthcare… .
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll inform the nurse immediately. In the meantime, let's perform a brief physical exam. I’ll check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. This will help me gather more information while we await the lab results. Nurse Chen, could you please come in and draw blood from Mr. Drahota?
