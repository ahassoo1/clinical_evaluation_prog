DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… complicated. I’m seeing someone, and I thought it prudent to get a check-up beforehand. One simply doesn’t enter into these things unprepared, you understand. It’s about being responsible.
DOCTOR: Responsible, yes, very good. And… is there anything specific you're concerned about?
PATIENT: Concerned? Oh, goodness, where to begin. I’m a woman of a certain age, Doctor. Things… shift. I want to ensure I'm presenting the best version of myself, naturally. And to be perfectly frank, I need to be certain there aren’t any… surprises. He’s a very discerning man.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you're looking for a general health assessment… to ensure everything is as it should be?
PATIENT: Precisely. A complete overview. I want to know what’s… functioning, and what might require… attention. And please, Doctor, don't gloss over anything. I’m not interested in being told everything is “fine” if it isn’t. I want details. Thorough details.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can certainly do that. To start, let’s go through some of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. There was… a bout of shingles a few years back. Dreadful business, that. And I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be fifteen years ago now? Beyond that… I’ve always been remarkably healthy, thank goodness. A good constitution, you see. My mother always said so. Although, I do have a slight sensitivity to dairy. Nothing serious, just… discomfort.
DOCTOR: Shingles, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, and a dairy sensitivity. Okay. Any family history of significant medical problems – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, my mother’s sister, Aunt Beatrice, passed away from breast cancer, I believe. And my father… he had high blood pressure, though he wasn’t very good about taking care of himself. Smoked like a chimney, that man. A terrible habit. Beyond that… honestly, it's a bit of a blur. They weren’t the type to discuss such things openly, you understand. Very stoic people.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescriptions or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Heavens, no. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. A good night’s sleep, a healthy diet, a little bit of lavender oil… that sorts most things out. I really don't believe in filling my body with unnecessary chemicals. Though I do take a multivitamin, just to be on the safe side, of course. Nothing extravagant.
DOCTOR: Multivitamin only. Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: I’m mildly allergic to penicillin, I discovered that as a child. A rather unpleasant rash, I recall. And… dust mites, I suppose. Though it’s more of an irritation than a true allergy. Just a bit of sneezing and a stuffy nose. Nothing debilitating. I manage it with a good air purifier and frequent cleaning. One has to maintain standards, you see.
DOCTOR: Penicillin and mild dust mite sensitivity. Alright. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really. Do I look like the type? I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. I wouldn’t dream of smoking. A small glass of wine with dinner on occasion, perhaps. But nothing excessive. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. That’s simply… vulgar. I do enjoy a brisk walk every morning, and I’m quite diligent about my skincare routine. That’s quite enough exertion for me, thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, very good. And… are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Doctor… is that really necessary? I came here for a general check-up, not… a personal interrogation. However, given the…circumstances, I suppose it’s relevant. Yes, I am. But I assure you, I am a discreet and responsible individual. Is this a standard question? It feels… rather intrusive.
DOCTOR: It is a standard question, Ms. Pandolfi, to assess your overall health and risk factors. It allows me to provide you with the most appropriate care. We’re just establishing a baseline. I apologize if it feels intrusive. Now, to move forward, are you currently using any form of contraception?
PATIENT: Well. Since you insist on such… personal inquiries. No, I am not. I assure you, Doctor, I’m perfectly capable of managing such matters. And frankly, I find this line of questioning rather…impertinent. I came here seeking medical advice, not a lecture on… reproductive health. Do we have to continue down this path? I’m beginning to question my choice of physician.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Pandolfi. It seems I’ve inadvertently made you uncomfortable. Perhaps we should move on to a physical examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That would be preferable, Doctor. Yes, a physical examination. Let's simply get on with it. I do have other engagements, you understand. And I'd prefer to be swift, if possible. I trust you'll be… thorough?
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's start with your blood pressure. If you could just extend your arm, please.
PATIENT: Very well. But do be gentle, Doctor. I have sensitive skin. And please, try not to make it too uncomfortable. Honestly, this entire process has been rather… jarring.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm. Taking your blood pressure now. 138 over 82. Slightly elevated, but not significantly. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, breath sounds are normal. Anything bothering you in the chest?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I do occasionally get a bit of indigestion, but that's likely the wine with dinner. As I said, I maintain a very healthy lifestyle otherwise. Are you quite finished with the… auscultation, as I believe it’s called? It’s rather cold, you know. Is there a blanket available?
DOCTOR: Just a moment. We'll just check your abdomen now. Lie back, please. I'll palpate your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or masses. Soft, non-tender. No masses detected. Any abdominal pain or discomfort you experience regularly?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, must you press so firmly? It’s rather… intrusive. And no, I do not experience “regular” abdominal pain. Perhaps a bit of bloating after dinner, but that's hardly significant. Do you always employ such… vigorous techniques? It’s quite unsettling, frankly.
DOCTOR: My apologies. Just checking for any abnormalities. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. And let's just examine your thyroid. Thyroid is normal size and smooth, no nodules detected. Any history of thyroid problems in your family?
PATIENT: Thyroid problems? Not that I’m aware of. My mother was quite stoic, as I mentioned. They didn’t discuss such things. And frankly, Doctor, I’m beginning to feel like a specimen under a microscope. Are you quite finished with this… physical prodding? It’s all rather… undignified. I assure you, I’m a perfectly healthy woman.
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Ms. Pandolfi. Just a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears appear normal. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Alright. That completes the physical examination. Now, based on what we’ve discussed, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. That will give us a better baseline understanding of your overall health. Do you agree?
PATIENT: Blood work, you say? Very well. If you insist. But I trust the laboratory is reputable? I wouldn’t want any… inaccuracies. And I expect the results to be delivered promptly. I have a rather busy schedule, you understand. And please, Doctor, assure me this isn’t simply a ploy to inflate your billing. I’ve heard stories, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Pandolfi. We use a certified laboratory, and I assure you, all tests are necessary for a comprehensive assessment. I'll have the results sent to you within five to seven business days. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable, I suppose. Five to seven business days. And I expect a thorough explanation of the results, Doctor. No jargon, if you please. I’m not a medical professional. I simply want to be certain I’m in optimal condition. And please, send the results via secure email. I do not trust paper documents. Very well. Let us conclude this… ordeal. I have other engagements, you understand. .
