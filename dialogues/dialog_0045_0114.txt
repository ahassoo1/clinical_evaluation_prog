DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Vanderwiele, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Billman, it’s this… breathing. It’s been getting worse, especially when I try to lie down flat. Feels like something is… pressing on me. Not a pain, exactly, just… difficult. I don’t know if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Difficult breathing, worse when lying flat… Yes, that does make sense. Okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… maybe three months ago? It was just a little bit at first, I thought it was the pillow. But it's gotten steadily worse since then. I hadn’t said anything because I thought it would just go away. But now… well, now it's keeping me up at night.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months, progressively worsening, worse at night… And is this difficulty breathing constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. During the day, if I’m sitting up or walking around, I’m usually alright. But as soon as I lie down, especially trying to get comfortable for sleep… that’s when it’s the worst. And sometimes, even sitting for too long will start it. It’s… inconvenient, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Right, so positional, and with prolonged sitting. Okay. Any coughing along with this?
PATIENT: Coughing? Not really. A little bit in the mornings, just a tickle in my throat, but nothing major. Nothing like a cold or anything. I haven’t been sick. It’s just… the breathing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant cough. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me see… … A little, maybe. I thought it was just from being on my feet too long at the library. I do a lot of shelving. But it doesn’t hurt. It's not bad, just… puffy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Puffy ankles… Alright. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with things like high blood pressure, heart problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… yes, Doctor. Years ago. I took pills for it for a long time, but the doctor said I could stop when I lost some weight. That was… oh, goodness, maybe ten years ago? No heart problems, not that I know of. And no diabetes. I don't think so. I try to eat pretty healthy. Oatmeal for breakfast most days.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, history of hypertension, managed with weight loss. Good. Any family history of heart disease, lung problems, or blood clots?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother… she had something with her heart, I think. She was always tired. She had a doctor, of course, but I was young then. I don’t really remember what he said. My father was healthy as a horse, though. Never a sick day in his life. And my brother… well, he’s still living, but we don't talk much. I don't know anything about his health. Does that help? I’m sorry I don’t know more.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mrs. Vanderwiele, you've told me a lot. Okay, let's talk about what you do day-to-day. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never have. Not even tried it. I work at the library, you see. We have rules. And it’s just… bad for you. Plus, my mother always said it smelled awful. I spend most of my time on my feet, shelving books and helping people find things. It's a quiet job, mostly.
DOCTOR: Right, a quiet job. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little bit. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe two, on a special occasion. Nothing more. I don’t need it. It doesn’t… agree with me very well. Makes me sleepy. And I need my wits about me at work, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just the vitamins. A multi-vitamin, every morning. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis in my hands, but only when it's really bothering me. It's just an over-the-counter cream, mostly. I don’t take anything regularly. Not since I stopped the blood pressure pills, like I said. Is something wrong, Doctor? You seem very serious.
DOCTOR: No, no, just gathering information, Mrs. Vanderwiele. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I want to listen to your lungs and heart, and just check your legs for any swelling. Can you sit up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. I hope it’s not anything serious. It’s just this breathing… it’s getting harder and harder to ignore.
DOCTOR: Okay. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… again… Alright. Sounds a little diminished on both sides, especially at the bases. Heart sounds… slightly muffled, but regular rhythm. No murmurs that I can detect. Okay, and just as you mentioned, some mild swelling in your ankles and feet. Let's check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation, just to get some baseline numbers. Blood pressure is 148/92. Oxygen saturation is 94%.
PATIENT: Oh. Those numbers… are those bad? I don’t understand what any of that means. Is my breathing really that bad? I just want to be able to sleep again. It's making me so tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Vanderwiele, let's not jump to conclusions. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your oxygen saturation is on the lower end of normal. The diminished lung sounds and swelling in your ankles suggest there may be some fluid buildup. It’s likely contributing to your difficulty breathing. Now, I want to be thorough, so I'm going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better look at your lungs and heart. We’ll also do some blood work to check your kidney function and rule out any other potential causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Blood work? Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. But yes, I suppose so. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. And what I can do about it. I don’t like being out of breath all the time. When will I get the results? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: The X-ray is just a picture, Mrs. Vanderwiele, it won't hurt at all. The blood work will just be a small sample taken from your arm. It'll sting for a moment, but it's quick. As for the results, it usually takes a day or two for the lab to get everything back to us. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a diuretic—a water pill—to help get rid of some of that extra fluid. It may help relieve some of your breathing difficulties. I also want you to limit your salt intake, as salt causes you to retain water. Now, before we get to the medication, let's talk about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Oh, a water pill. That sounds… strong. Well, my diet… I try to eat healthy, like I said. Oatmeal for breakfast, usually with some fruit. For lunch, maybe a sandwich or a salad. And dinner… it varies. Sometimes fish, sometimes chicken, sometimes soup. I like soup. But I do add a little salt, I’ll admit. It just tastes better. And I do enjoy a good snack now and then. A cookie with my tea, sometimes. But I really do try to watch what I eat. I don't want to get sick. Do you think that's… bad? The salt, I mean? Will that mess up the water pill?
DOCTOR: It’s not about "bad," Mrs. Vanderwiele, it's about finding a balance. Salt will counteract the effects of the diuretic, so limiting your intake is crucial. Think of it like this: the pill helps your body get rid of excess water, but if you keep adding more salt, you're just making the pill work harder. Now, about the pill itself. I’m going to start you on 20 milligrams of furosemide once daily in the morning. It’s important to take it with food to avoid getting dizzy. And be sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day, as the pill makes you urinate more often. It’s also important to monitor your weight daily. If you notice a sudden weight gain, call my office immediately. Do you have any questions about the medication before we continue?
PATIENT: Oh, 20 milligrams… that sounds like a lot. Drink plenty of water… monitor my weight… dizzy… It sounds… complicated. And what if I forget? I’m getting older, you know. My memory isn't what it used to be. And what should I eat then? If I can’t have much salt? What about soup? I love soup. And what are the symptoms to watch out for? You said to call if I gain weight, but what else?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Vanderwiele, it’s not a large dose, and many people take it without issue. We’ll go over everything slowly. Yes, you can still have soup, but it needs to be low-sodium. Look for “low sodium” or “reduced sodium” on the can, and even then, use it sparingly. As for forgetting, set an alarm on your phone, or ask a friend or family member to remind you. Anything to help you remember. Now, as for symptoms to watch out for, be alert for excessive thirst or dry mouth, confusion, muscle cramps, weakness, or dizziness, especially when you stand up. If you experience any of those, call the office immediately. Also, watch for a rapid heart rate, or any swelling in your legs and feet that gets worse despite taking the pill. And if you have any chest pain or shortness of breath, go to the emergency room immediately. We'll get you a printed list of all these things before you leave. I’m also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to check your blood pressure and kidney function, and see how you’re tolerating the medication. Any other questions?
PATIENT: One week? That's a lot to remember… soup, salt, dizziness, weight, thirst, confusion, muscles, heart, legs… and I have to watch for all of those things? I’m not sure I can… What if I don't understand something? Who do I call then? Not just for emergencies, but if I’m confused about the pill or something? Is there a nurse I can speak to? This is… a lot.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Vanderwiele, it seems like a lot, but it's manageable. We'll make sure you have all the information you need. My nurse, Sarah, is excellent. You can call her office directly at 555-1212 during regular business hours with any questions, concerns, or if you’re simply confused about something. She’s very patient and will be happy to walk you through everything again. And if it's a true emergency, of course, call 911. I'm going to print out a medication list, a symptom checklist, and Sarah's contact information for you now. We’ll also go over your diet again before you leave. Don't worry, we’ll get you sorted out. We’re here to help. Now, about your diet… what’s a typical breakfast for you?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. Sarah sounds very helpful. A typical breakfast… well, usually oatmeal. Just plain oatmeal, most days. Sometimes I add a little bit of fruit, like blueberries or strawberries. And a cup of tea. Nothing fancy. Is oatmeal… okay? Or is that too much salt, somehow? I just don’t want to do anything wrong.
DOCTOR: Oatmeal is perfectly fine, Mrs. Vanderwiele. Plain oatmeal is excellent. It’s the added ingredients you need to be mindful of. No salt added, of course. And be careful with pre-packaged fruit—sometimes they add salt as a preservative. Read the label. You're being very thorough, which is good. I’m going to have Sarah call you tomorrow to check in and answer any questions that come up. Do you have any further questions right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. And thank you for Sarah’s number. I’m sure I’ll be calling. I suppose I should be going then. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll do our best to get you there, Mrs. Vanderwiele. Remember, stick to the plan, monitor your symptoms, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Sarah will be in touch tomorrow. Here’s a printed copy of your discharge instructions and medication list. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. .
