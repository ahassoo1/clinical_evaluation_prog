DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's this… tingling. It’s mostly in my hands and feet, you see? It's been going on for a little while now, and it's just… annoying, really. I'm Teretha, by the way. Just Teretha is fine.
DOCTOR: Yes, Teretha. Annoying is a good way to put it – we want to get to the bottom of it. And thank you for coming in. So, this tingling… can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not constant. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s just a little pins and needles, other times it feels… numb, almost. It’s worse at night, I think. And it’s both hands and both feet, pretty much the same. I don’t know if that makes a difference. I just… want it to stop, you know? I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make a difference. Bilateral – both sides – is helpful to know. And worse at night… that’s a good observation. How long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started… maybe six months ago? Hard to say exactly. It was very mild at first, I barely noticed it. Just a little funny feeling. But it’s gotten… more noticeable lately, especially the last month or so. I thought maybe it was just from working, being on my feet all day. But it doesn't seem to get better with rest, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, six months… and it’s not improving with rest. That’s good information to have. You mentioned being on your feet all day – what kind of work do you do, Teretha?
PATIENT: I’m a mail carrier. Been doing it for… oh, goodness, nearly 30 years now. A lot of walking, a lot of carrying things. It’s good exercise, normally, but lately… well, this tingling is making it harder. I'm starting to worry about dropping things, you know? It's a responsibility.
DOCTOR: That is a lot of walking and carrying. And a very responsible job – I understand your concern about dropping things. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet at all, besides the tingling and numbness?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. Not really weakness, exactly. It's just… sometimes my fingers feel clumsy, like I can't quite grip things as firmly as I used to. And my feet… they feel a little heavy sometimes, especially at the end of the day. But I just figured that was from being tired. I don't know. It's hard to explain. It's not like I can't walk or anything, it’s just… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No significant weakness, but clumsiness and a heavy feeling. Have you noticed any pain associated with the tingling or numbness?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It’s not painful, thankfully. It's more… irritating, like a constant buzzing under the skin. And sometimes it feels cold, even when my hands and feet aren't actually cold. It's just… uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. I just want to know what’s causing it, you know? And if there's anything I can do to make it stop. I don't have time for this, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Teretha. It's good to know it's not painful, but the buzzing and cold sensation are important details. Now, have you had any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No, not really. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, I suppose. But I figured that was just from work and getting older. Oh! My balance has been a little off a couple of times, but nothing major. I just brushed it off as being clumsy. I don't know… is that important? I don't go to the doctor much, so I don't know what is important.
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned the fatigue and balance issues, and don’t worry about knowing what’s important – that’s what I’m here for. I'd like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to know. I don’t have a lot of history, really. Never been much of a sick person. Just… this tingling. I just wish it would go away. Ask away, Doctor. Let's get this over with, if you don't mind. I have a route to finish today.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, never. I've had my blood pressure checked at the pharmacy a couple of times, and it was always fine. My mother had high blood pressure, but I don't think I've inherited it. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Not a lot of sweets, you know? Just normal food. I don't know much about cholesterol. Never had it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never been in the hospital. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, but that was it. Just a simple fracture. It healed up fine. I've been very lucky, really. I don't like doctors or hospitals. Too much poking and prodding. I just want this tingling to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills. Never been a fan. Just… normal food. Sometimes I drink chamomile tea to help me sleep, but that’s it. Not a medical thing, just… tea. I'm a simple woman, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, I suppose. I've never had to worry about allergies. I'm pretty… boring, medically speaking. Honestly. Just this tingling. Is it something serious, Doctor? I need to get back to my route. I have a lot of mail to deliver.
DOCTOR: Okay. No allergies. That's good. It's unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening, but we need to figure out what's causing it. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just checking your reflexes, some sensation testing, and looking at your feet and hands. It shouldn't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright. If it doesn't take too long. I really need to get back. My route is getting long. Just… quick, please? I don't want to be out here all day. Just get it over with. What will you be doing, exactly? I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll start by checking your reflexes with this hammer. It's just a gentle tap on your knee and ankles. Then, I’ll use this tuning fork to test your sensation – feeling vibrations. And finally, I’ll take a look at your feet and hands for any changes in skin or swelling. It will be quick, I promise. Let’s start with your right knee. Could you sit comfortably with your leg dangling?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it over with, please. I've got a lot of mail to deliver. Don't poke too hard, alright? And be careful with my shoes. They're comfortable shoes. A mail carrier needs comfortable shoes. Just hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good response on the right. Now the left. And that’s good too. Now, I’m going to lightly touch your feet and hands with this. It’s just to see if you can feel it. It doesn't hurt. Can you tell me when you feel the touch?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, just get it over with. I can feel it. I can feel everything. Just hurry, please. My route is backing up. And be careful with my hands, I need them to deliver the mail. It's important work. Just tell me when you're done.
DOCTOR: Okay, good sensation throughout. I'm just taking a look at your hands and feet now... I notice a slight decrease in sensation in both of your feet, but it's subtle. Your skin looks normal, no swelling or visible deformities. Your pulses are good. Overall, the physical exam isn’t showing anything obvious, but the slight decrease in sensation combined with your tingling does suggest a possible issue with your nerves.
PATIENT: Nerves? What do you mean, nerves? Is it serious? Am I going to have to stop delivering the mail? I have a responsibility, you know. People are counting on me. I need to know what’s going on. What are you going to do about it? And how long is this going to take? Just tell me straight, Doctor. I don't have time for medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Teretha. It's not an immediate emergency, but it does sound like there might be some nerve involvement, possibly something called peripheral neuropathy. That means there's some irritation or damage to the nerves in your hands and feet. The slight decrease in sensation I found supports that. It could be caused by several things - vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, even just prolonged pressure on the nerves from being on your feet all day. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I'd like to order a couple of blood tests - a complete blood count to check for vitamin deficiencies and a blood sugar test to rule out diabetes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, goodness. I hate needles. And diabetes? My mother had that. Is that what this is? I do get tired easily. But I've been working hard! Fine, fine. Blood tests. But make it quick, alright? And can I still deliver the mail while I wait for the results? People are counting on me. Just tell me what I need to do, and let’s get this over with. I have a route to finish.
DOCTOR: Alright, Teretha. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes. And yes, you can continue to deliver the mail while we wait for the results. However, if the results show something concerning, like diabetes, we may need to discuss adjustments to your work routine. Here's the order for the blood tests. You can get them done at the lab across the street. Once you've had them done, they'll send the results directly to me. I'll call you as soon as I have them – usually within a few days. In the meantime, if the tingling gets significantly worse, or you develop any weakness in your hands or feet, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s it. Just… hurry up and get the results, alright? And please, don’t tell me I have to stop delivering the mail. It’s all I do. Alright. I guess I’ll go get these tests done. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teretha. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And I understand how important your work is. We’ll take it one step at a time. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. I'll be in touch soon.
