DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I wish I didn’t have to be here. It’s just… I’m tired. Really tired. And it’s not the normal kind of tired. It's been getting worse for months, and now… well, now I'm eating dirt. Literally. Don’t look at me like that, it’s not something I want to do. It just… tastes good, and then I feel a little better. For a bit, anyway. I don’t know why I’m doing it. Is that what you need to know? Because frankly, I don’t have time for a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Hardenburgh. And please, no apologies are needed. It takes courage to share something so personal. It’s certainly unusual to crave dirt, and the fact that it provides even temporary relief is important information. We will get to the bottom of this. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Tiredness? What more is there to say about being tired? I just… drag. Everything feels like it takes a huge effort. Getting out of bed, making a cup of tea, even just thinking sometimes. It’s not like I’m doing anything strenuous, you know? I work as a PT aide, helping people with their exercises. It's not exactly a demanding job. And it’s not like I’m not sleeping. I get a good eight hours most nights, but I still wake up feeling like I ran a marathon. And this craving… it’s worse when I’m really wiped out. It started with just a little bit, and now… well, I’m embarrassed to admit how much I’ve been eating. Do you really need to know all the details?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Hardenburgh, you don’t need to share details you’re uncomfortable with. But the timing – the craving worsening when you’re tired – is very helpful. It points us in a certain direction. You mentioned eight hours of sleep. Do you feel restful sleep?
PATIENT: Restful? Honestly, no. I toss and turn. I dream a lot, strange dreams. And I wake up several times during the night, even if I don't remember it. Sometimes I just lie there staring at the ceiling for an hour before I finally drift back off. It’s not like I’m constantly exhausted during the day, but I'm never truly refreshed when I wake up. And I wouldn't call it insomnia, exactly. It’s just… not good sleep. Is that good enough? I'm starting to feel a little dizzy now, actually. Maybe it's the dirt… or maybe it's just everything else.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Hardenburgh. The disrupted sleep, the strange dreams… and the feeling of not being refreshed despite the hours spent in bed. And you're right to mention the dizziness – we should address that immediately. Before we go further, let’s take a quick look at your vital signs. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature, and just listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just get on with it. I’ve got things to do, you know. I don’t understand why I have to come to a doctor for being tired and eating a little dirt. It's not like it's a life-threatening disease. And honestly, these questions are just… insulting. Do you think I'm stupid? I’ve lived a long life, I think I know when something’s not right with my body. But alright, check whatever you need to check. Just be quick about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh, and I sincerely apologize if my questions felt intrusive or disrespectful. That was not my intention. I assure you, I’m not questioning your intelligence or your ability to understand your own body. My goal is simply to gather all the necessary information to provide you with the best possible care. I want to assure you, we'll get to the root of this. Your blood pressure is 110/70, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear to auscultation. I'm also going to examine your oral mucosa, and check for any signs of pallor. I note some mild pallor of the oral mucosa. Now, I’m going to check your extremities for swelling or any other abnormalities.
PATIENT: Pallor? What does that even mean? I haven't been feeling sick, I just eat dirt when I'm tired. And swelling? I walk around all day at work! Of course my feet are a little swollen. Honestly, you’re just finding things to worry about now. I told you, I know my body. And I’m getting a headache. This whole thing is just making me feel worse. Can we just… stop? Is there anything you can prescribe me for being tired? Something to make me sleep, maybe? I don't need a lecture about eating dirt; I need to feel better. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I understand your frustration and desire for a quick solution. However, ignoring potential underlying causes could be detrimental to your health. The pallor I observed suggests a possible iron deficiency, which can certainly contribute to fatigue and, interestingly, pica – the craving for non-nutritive substances like dirt. While I appreciate your knowledge of your own body, the symptoms you describe – fatigue, disrupted sleep, and pica – require further investigation. I want to order some blood tests to check your iron levels, complete blood count, and thyroid function. These tests will help us determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. Regarding sleep, I can certainly discuss options to help improve your sleep quality, but addressing the root cause is paramount. Would you be willing to proceed with the blood tests?
