DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is nice to meet you. Um… well, it's a bit difficult to explain, to be honest. I've been… going to the bathroom rather frequently lately. More often than usual, certainly. I can't really pinpoint when it started, and I'm afraid my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if it's difficult to explain, and don't worry about pinpointing an exact date. We'll work through it together. “More frequent” – can you give me a sense of how much more frequent?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… before, I would go, you know, a normal amount, perhaps four or five times a day? Now… it feels like almost every hour or two. It’s… disruptive, to say the least. And sometimes, even when I don't feel the urge, I feel like I need to go, just in case. It's rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a significant increase from four or five times a day to potentially every couple of hours. And you mentioned feeling the need to go even when you don't have a strong urge – is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s exactly right. The feeling… it’s almost a phantom sensation, if that makes sense. Like my bladder is telling me something isn’t quite right, even when it doesn’t feel full. It’s… frustrating, and honestly a little embarrassing to talk about.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be embarrassing, Ms. MacVittie, but please don't hesitate to share anything that's concerning you. That’s what I’m here for. The phantom sensation is helpful information. Now, are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No pain or burning at all. It’s purely the frequency and this… unsettling feeling of needing to go constantly. It doesn't hurt, it’s just… inconvenient and a bit worrying, you know? I haven’t noticed any changes in the way I urinate, if that makes sense – the stream is normal, and it doesn’t feel incomplete. Is that… helpful? I’m not sure what details are important.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. MacVittie. The fact that there’s no pain or burning is good. And knowing the stream is normal and complete is also useful information. Let’s talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes in your body lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… I've been rather tired lately, more so than usual. I put it down to getting older, mostly. And I suppose I've been drinking more water, trying to… counteract this frequent urination. Is that a relevant detail? I really am trying to be helpful, it's just… things aren't always clear in my mind.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. MacVittie, and it's good you're mentioning these things. Increased fatigue and drinking more water are both relevant. Drinking more water could contribute to the frequency, but the fatigue is something we should consider as well. Now, have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. My appetite is about the same as always, maybe a little smaller, but I haven’t been eating much differently. And my weight… I haven’t weighed myself recently, but I don’t think it’s changed. I’ve been… rather preoccupied with this issue to pay much attention, truthfully. I'm sorry I can't be more precise.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. MacVittie. We can work with what you do remember. Now, let’s briefly discuss your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a bit difficult. I had a hysterectomy several years ago, I believe it was around 2018… or perhaps 2019. And I was briefly treated for high blood pressure a few years back, but it seemed to resolve itself with diet and exercise. Other than that… my memory is rather hazy. I’m divorced, if that’s relevant. I don't take any regular medication currently. Does that… help?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. MacVittie. The hysterectomy and the history of high blood pressure are important to know. And it's good to hear you aren't currently taking any medications. Before we proceed, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had any reactions to anything, as far as I recall. I used to be quite careful about checking ingredients, but… well, my memory isn’t what it once was. I haven’t been hospitalized in… many years, thankfully. I hope that’s… useful information. This is all rather stressful, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is understandable that this is stressful, Ms. MacVittie. You're providing me with very helpful information. No known allergies is good to know. Now, just a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had any medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney problems, or bladder issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… difficult. My mother had… I believe it was arthritis, quite severe. And my father… he had heart problems, I think. He passed away several years ago. I don’t recall anyone specifically having bladder issues, but my family isn’t terribly forthcoming with medical details, if I’m honest. It’s… a bit of a taboo subject, I suppose. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. MacVittie. Knowing your mother had arthritis and your father had heart problems is helpful. Now, to give me a better understanding of your situation, would you mind if I conducted a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That’s… perfectly alright. If you think it will help, please do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m just checking for any tenderness or masses. Your abdomen is soft to the touch, and I don’t detect any significant abnormalities at this time. I’m checking for any bladder distention. Your bladder doesn't feel overly full. I'm also going to check your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72. Temperature is normal. Everything appears within normal limits so far. Do you have any questions about what I’m doing?
PATIENT: No, not at the moment. You’re explaining everything very clearly. It doesn’t feel… intrusive, if that makes sense. I appreciate you telling me what you’re doing as you go. I suppose I'm just… anxious to find out what might be causing this. It’s rather disruptive to my daily life, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. MacVittie. It’s frustrating when something disrupts your daily life. Given your history and the physical exam findings, I suspect this could be a few different things. It could be related to the hysterectomy, potentially some bladder irritation or changes in pelvic floor function. It could also be related to diet or fluid intake, or even a urinary tract infection, though you don’t have any of the classic symptoms like burning or fever. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a urine analysis to rule out infection. I also recommend a post-void residual measurement to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you empty it. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A urine analysis and… the post-void residual measurement. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to find out what’s going on. I suppose… how long will it take to get the results? And how will I… do the post-void residual measurement? Is it… complicated?
DOCTOR: It's good you're willing to proceed with testing. The results for the urine analysis usually take about 24-48 hours. As for the post-void residual, it’s quite simple. After you urinate, we’ll use a small handheld device – a bladder scanner – to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It’s non-invasive and doesn't cause any discomfort. Our nursing staff can easily perform the scan for you right here in the office. I’ll have the nurse schedule you for the urine analysis and post-void residual measurement. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend keeping a fluid diary, noting how much you drink and when, and also a voiding diary, recording each time you urinate and the amount. This can help us identify any patterns or triggers. Do you have any questions about the fluid and voiding diaries or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds manageable. A fluid and voiding diary… yes, I can certainly do that. It sounds like a good idea to keep track of things. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. I feel… a little less anxious now, knowing what to expect. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. I'm glad I could ease your anxiety. Let's get the nurse in to schedule those tests and provide you with the diaries. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain, please call the office immediately. Nurse, could you please come in here for a moment?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I will. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel much better prepared now.
