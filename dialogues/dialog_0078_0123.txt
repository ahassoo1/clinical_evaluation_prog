DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this…itchiness. It’s been driving me a little crazy, to be honest. All over, really. Not just one spot.
DOCTOR: I see. Itchiness all over… that can certainly be bothersome. Could you tell me a little more about when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…oh, maybe a couple of weeks ago? It wasn't bad at first, just a little annoying. But it’s gotten worse each day, I think. It's hard to keep track sometimes, you know? Getting older!
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. It’s easy to lose track of time. A couple of weeks… and it’s been gradually worsening. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. It’s worse at night, I think. Keeps me up sometimes, scratching. During the day it's…manageable, but still there. A little nagging feeling, you know? Not always scratching, but aware of it. It's just…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse at night, and a nagging discomfort during the day. That gives us a good starting point. Have you noticed any rash accompanying the itchiness?
PATIENT: Rash? Let me see… No, not really a rash. Maybe a little redness in a couple of spots where I’ve been scratching a lot, but nothing raised or bubbly or anything like that. Just…red from the scratching, I guess. It's mostly just the itch.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, primarily itchiness, with some redness from scratching, but no significant rash. Have you tried anything to relieve the itchiness so far?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I’ve tried a few things. Lotion, mostly. The regular kind, nothing fancy. And I took a Benadryl a couple of nights ago when it was really bad, but it made me so sleepy! I don't like feeling like a zombie all day. It didn't even help that much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, lotion and Benadryl, with limited relief and some drowsiness. I appreciate you letting me know that. Now, to get a better picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No fever, no tiredness, nothing like that. I haven't noticed any changes in my weight, and I'm eating okay. My appetite's been normal. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it… my skin does feel a little dry overall, even the parts that aren’t itchy. But that could just be from my age, right?
DOCTOR: It certainly could be related to age, Ms. Cassimatis, but it's good to consider everything. So, no fever, no weight changes, normal appetite, and generalized dry skin along with the itchiness. Now, have you started any new medications or changed anything in your routine recently – new soaps, detergents, or anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me see… No new medications. And routine… well, not really. I’ve been doing the same things for years, pretty much. Same laundry detergent, same soap… oh! Wait. I did switch hand soaps about a month ago, maybe? It was a nice lavender scented one, from the drugstore. Could that be it? I hadn't really thought about it...
DOCTOR: That’s very possible, Ms. Cassimatis. New soaps can sometimes trigger reactions. Okay. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies that you know of – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never really had any bad reactions to anything. A little sniffles with the pollen sometimes, but that’s it. Nothing serious. I ate shellfish my whole life, no problem. No bee stings or anything like that either. I think I'd know if I was allergic to something, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: You likely would, Ms. Cassimatis. It's good to hear you haven't had any known allergic reactions. Now, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… that’s a long story. Let me see. I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe twenty years ago? And I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been controlled with medication for years. Other than that… mostly just aches and pains from getting old, you know? Nothing major. I haven't been to the hospital in ages. I did have a bad fall a few years back, but I didn't break anything, just a lot of bruising.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, controlled high blood pressure, and a fall with bruising a few years back. That’s helpful. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day, for the blood pressure. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take Ibuprofen. But not every day, just when I really need it. I try to take as little medication as possible, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I do, Ms. Cassimatis. It's good to be mindful of medication use. So, Lisinopril 20mg daily and Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. And just to round things out, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother had diabetes, I think. And my father… he had heart trouble, I believe. And my sister… she had asthma when she was a child. Other than that, not much that I can recall. A lot of us lived long lives, but mostly just… old age problems, you know? Not a lot of dramatic illnesses, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Cassimatis. Diabetes, heart trouble, and asthma in the family. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your skin to see if we can identify anything obvious causing the itchiness. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m sure you’ll find something. I’m just glad to finally be getting this checked out. It’s been driving me crazy!
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cassimatis. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. I’m not seeing a significant rash, but your skin is quite dry overall. There’s some mild redness in areas where you’ve been scratching, consistent with irritation. I don’t see anything that immediately jumps out as a clear cause for the itchiness, but the dryness is definitely contributing. I also notice some scattered small, flat, light-colored spots on your arms. Have you noticed these before?
PATIENT: Oh! Those spots… yes, actually. I think I have. I thought they were just age spots, you know? They’ve been there for a while, I think. They don't itch or anything, they're just…there. Flat, like you said, and light colored. I hadn't thought much of them. Could those be causing the itching? I thought it was just my skin being dry.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely those spots are the direct cause of the itching, Ms. Cassimatis, but they could be a clue. They could be solar lentigines – commonly known as age spots – which are harmless, but it's good to keep an eye on them. Given your history and the exam findings – the generalized dryness, the mild irritation from scratching, and those age spots – I suspect the itchiness is likely multifactorial. A combination of dry skin, potentially exacerbated by the new hand soap, and possibly some underlying mild skin sensitivity. To rule out other causes, and to get a better idea of the extent of the sensitivity, I’d like to order a few basic blood tests. A complete blood count to check for any underlying inflammation, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… alright. That sounds sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Anything to get this figured out. Yes, go ahead and order the tests. I don't mind a little prick if it means I can stop scratching! Where do I go to get those done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. You'll be able to get the blood tests done right here in the clinic lab. I’ll write you a requisition form. The lab technician will take a small sample of your blood, and it usually only takes a few minutes. We should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend switching back to your previous hand soap, and I’m going to recommend a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer to help restore your skin's barrier. Something like CeraVe or Cetaphil. Use it liberally, especially after washing your hands. And try to avoid scratching as much as possible, even though I know that's easier said than done. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that all makes sense, Doctor. Switching back to my old soap and using a better moisturizer… I can definitely do that. And I’ll try my best not to scratch, although I make no promises! So, the blood tests, and then wait for the results… alright. Thank you, Doctor Solero. I feel a little better just knowing we're doing something about it. I guess I'll go get those tests done then?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm glad you're feeling a little more reassured. Yes, please go to the lab, and they’ll take care of everything. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a more tailored treatment plan. Here's the requisition form and a pamphlet on managing dry, itchy skin. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. Thank you for coming in today. I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I will. And I will call if anything comes up. Have a good day!
