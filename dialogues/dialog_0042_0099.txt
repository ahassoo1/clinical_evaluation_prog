DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Vodzak. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Vodzak. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I received a letter regarding the results of a test… an examination of my insides, I believe they called it. The results were… abnormal, and I was advised to come in for a discussion. I must admit, I am a little anxious about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Minatra, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. Receiving any kind of abnormal test result can be concerning. We’ll go through everything together, step by step, and I’ll do my best to explain it all clearly. To start, do you recall what kind of examination it was?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. It was an endoscopy, I believe. They used a… a small camera on a tube, and sent it down my throat. It wasn’t particularly comfortable, but the nurse was very kind and explained everything beforehand. It was to look at my stomach and… and the beginning of my intestines, I think. They took some small pieces of tissue as well, is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right – an upper endoscopy. And you are correct, they likely took biopsies – small tissue samples – during the procedure. Those biopsies are what the letter refers to when they mention abnormal results. Let me pull up the report on my computer here… Okay, I have it now. The report indicates some inflammation and…pre-cancerous changes in the lining of your stomach. Now, before you get worried, it’s important to understand what that means. “Pre-cancerous” doesn’t mean you have cancer. It means there are changes that could potentially lead to cancer if left untreated. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me about any symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is… unsettling to hear, even with your reassurance. I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. Symptoms… well, for the past few months, I’ve had a rather persistent stomach ache. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull discomfort, usually after I eat. And I’ve been feeling quite bloated, and rather tired, though I assumed that was simply due to my age. Occasionally, I’ve noticed some…darkness in my stool, but I dismissed it as something I ate. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Minatra, all of that is relevant. The stomach ache, bloating, tiredness, and particularly the darkness in your stool are things we need to investigate further. The darkness in your stool could indicate bleeding in your digestive tract, which is something we want to understand the source of. Now, regarding the stomach ache - can you describe where exactly you feel the pain?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly in the upper part of my abdomen, right here, just below my breastbone. It doesn’t radiate anywhere, it’s just… localized in that area. And it seems to be worse after I eat heavier meals, or foods that are particularly spicy. I do enjoy a good chili, you see, but perhaps I should abstain for a while. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Minatra. The location and the connection to meals are helpful. It suggests it’s related to your stomach. And you’re right, perhaps a temporary break from the chili is a good idea. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, and I’ve always had rather high blood pressure, though it’s generally well-controlled with medication. I also had a bout of diverticulitis a few years back, but that resolved with antibiotics. Other than that, I’ve been quite fortunate, I believe. I’ve always tried to lead a healthy life, despite my fondness for a good meal now and then. Do you need to know about my family’s medical history as well? My mother had diabetes, and my sister… she had some problems with her colon, I believe.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Minatra. The gallbladder removal, high blood pressure, diverticulitis and family history of diabetes and colon issues are all important pieces of the puzzle. Regarding your medications, could you tell me what you're currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And occasionally, if my blood pressure gets particularly high, my doctor prescribes Hydrochlorothiazide as well, but I haven’t needed it in several months, thankfully. I always make sure to take my medication as prescribed, and I have it all written down in a notebook at home, just in case. Would you like me to bring the notebook with me next time I visit?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Minatra – being diligent about your medications is very important. And no need to bring the notebook next time unless you feel more comfortable doing so. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I've never had an allergic reaction to anything, thankfully. I am quite fortunate in that regard as well. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a problem with any medication I’ve been prescribed. My husband… he was terribly allergic to shellfish, but I inherited none of those sensitivities, thankfully. He used to carry an EpiPen with him everywhere, poor man.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Minatra. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I live alone now, as my husband passed away five years ago. I keep myself busy with gardening and volunteering at the local library. I try to eat a balanced diet, though, as I mentioned, I do enjoy my food. I don't smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to walk for at least thirty minutes most days, weather permitting. I believe keeping active is important for both my physical and mental health. I also enjoy spending time with my grandchildren, when they visit. They are a great source of joy, and keep me young at heart. Is there anything specific you would like to know?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very fulfilling life, Ms. Minatra. It's wonderful that you have so many activities and loved ones. Given your symptoms, medical history, and the results of the endoscopy, I'd like to discuss some possible next steps. The biopsies showed pre-cancerous changes, and given the stomach discomfort and darkness in your stool, it's important we investigate this further to determine the extent of the changes and rule out any more serious issues. I recommend a repeat endoscopy with a more thorough examination and possibly a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a better picture of your digestive system. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A repeat endoscopy and a CT scan… that sounds rather…extensive, Doctor. But if it's necessary to determine the extent of the problem, then yes, I suppose it is acceptable. I trust your judgment. I confess, I am a little anxious about undergoing another procedure, but I understand it's for my own good. Could you explain a little more about the CT scan? What does it involve, and is there anything I need to do to prepare for it?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Minatra. It's perfectly reasonable to feel that way. A CT scan is a non-invasive imaging test that uses X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of your abdomen and pelvis. It helps us see your organs in more detail and identify any abnormalities. The preparation for the CT scan typically involves drinking a special liquid contrast solution a few hours beforehand to help highlight your digestive tract. You’ll need to fast for a few hours before the scan as well. The scan itself is painless and takes only a few minutes to complete. You’ll lie on a table while a machine rotates around you, taking the images. We'll schedule both the repeat endoscopy and the CT scan, and my staff will provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for each. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. A contrast solution and fasting… I can manage that. And knowing it's painless is reassuring. I trust your staff will provide me with clear instructions. I suppose the next step is to schedule those appointments, then? And… how long will it take to get the results of the CT scan? Is it something I can expect within a few days, or will it be longer? I confess, waiting is the hardest part.
DOCTOR: Yes, the next step is to schedule those appointments. I'll have my staff contact you with available times, and they'll be able to answer any questions you have about the scheduling process. Regarding the CT scan results, it typically takes 1-3 business days for the radiologist to review the images and send the report to me. Once I have the report, I will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in detail. I understand that waiting is the hardest part, Ms. Minatra. I will do my best to expedite the process and get you the information as quickly as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or significant bleeding, please don't hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You have been very thorough and reassuring, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I will await a call from your staff regarding the scheduling of the appointments, and I will contact you if any new symptoms arise. Thank you again for your kindness and attention.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Minatra. I’m glad I could ease some of your concerns. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes to mind. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment once the results are available. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
