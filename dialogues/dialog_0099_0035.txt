DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I’m Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… well, it feels like forever, but my daughter says it’s only been a couple of days. They just won’t stop. It's quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: A couple of days, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s what Lani told me. She’s very good with remembering things like that. I lose track, you know? Not lost lost, just… details. But yes, a couple of days. It’s not painful, just… irritating. Like a little bird flapping inside. Do you get hiccups often, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I rarely experience hiccups myself, Ms. Sucich. It’s typically a temporary annoyance. Tell me, are they constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, they come and go. Not constant constant, but… frequently. Like, several times an hour, maybe? And they happen when I’m doing anything! Eating, sitting, just… thinking. It's very strange. I had a good, long drink of water earlier and that didn't even help. Usually, that does the trick.
DOCTOR: Several times an hour, even with water… Hmm. And have you noticed anything that specifically triggers them?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… Not really. I was gardening yesterday, but I garden all the time and haven’t had this problem before. I had a little bit of excitement, I suppose. My grandson called with good news about his studies... but that was hours ago, and they started before that. Honestly, I don’t know what sets them off. It’s just… random. A frustrating random, you understand.
DOCTOR: Random occurrences are rarely helpful, Ms. Sucich. Let's go through some other things. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying the hiccups?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… No, not really. I’m a little tired, perhaps, but I’m 86! I think a little tiredness is allowed at my age, don’t you? No pain, no trouble breathing, no funny tastes in my mouth… Nothing like that. Just… hiccups. And the irritation they cause! It's distracting, you know? Makes it hard to enjoy my tea.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think… I take something for my blood pressure – Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And a little something for my arthritis, Celebrex. Nothing else, regularly. Sometimes I take a pain reliever when my knees really bother me, but that’s just as needed. Lani makes sure I take everything correctly, she’s very good about that too.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril and Celebrex… alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing I know of. I used to be terribly allergic to bee stings when I was a little girl, but that was… oh, goodness, over seventy years ago! I haven’t had a reaction to anything in decades. Nothing at all. I eat everything, thankfully! Fijian food is lovely, you know. A lot of root vegetables and fresh fish.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, let's just do a quick physical exam, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to cooperate. Just tell me what you'd like me to do. Is it the ears and throat sort of thing? I always get a little nervous with those little lights, you know! But I'll try to be brave.
DOCTOR: It’s a fairly standard exam, Ms. Sucich. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and just a quick look in your ears and throat. Please just relax. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again. Good. Heart sounds are regular, rate is within normal limits. Lungs are clear bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles noted. Reflexes are… a little diminished, but not concerning for your age. Now, let's take a look at your throat… open wide, please.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Opens mouth wide, trying to hold it open for a good view. There you go, Doctor. I do try to be helpful! It doesn’t tickle, does it? I always worry about making the doctors uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Throat is clear, no significant inflammation or redness. Tonsils are normal in size. Ear canals are clear, tympanic membranes are normal. Everything appears normal on initial examination. A bit diminished but that’s normal for age. So, Ms. Sucich, the physical exam isn't revealing any obvious cause for your hiccups. It's likely a benign, self-limiting condition. It’s probably just an irritation of the phrenic nerve, or something similar. These things happen sometimes.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. So, it’s not… serious? That’s a relief! A nerve? I hadn’t thought of a nerve! It just feels… annoying. And embarrassing, a little, when I’m out with my friends. So, what do I do? Just… wait it out? Is there anything I can take? Perhaps something to calm the nerve? I do have a little chamomile tea before bed. Would that help?
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea is unlikely to have a significant effect, Ms. Sucich. Honestly, most remedies for hiccups are anecdotal. You can try over-the-counter antacids, in case it's related to mild acid reflux, but that’s unlikely. The best course of action, generally, is simply to wait it out. It should resolve on its own within a few days. If it persists for longer than a week, or if you develop any other symptoms – difficulty breathing, severe chest pain, or if you start vomiting – then you should seek further medical attention. But for now, I wouldn’t worry too much about it. It’s probably just… one of those things.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. A week, you say? I’ll try to be patient. And I’ll watch for those other things, you know, just in case. I’m a little disappointed there's nothing to do, but… I understand. Doctors can’t fix everything. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any foods to avoid, perhaps? Or anything that might trigger it? Just to be safe?
DOCTOR: There aren’t any specific foods to avoid, Ms. Sucich. As I said, it’s unlikely to be diet-related. Try to avoid carbonated beverages and large meals, as those can sometimes exacerbate hiccups. But honestly, it’s probably not necessary. The important thing is not to overthink it. Stress can sometimes worsen hiccups, so try to relax. If it continues to bother you significantly, you can return for a follow-up appointment, and we can consider a referral to a gastroenterologist, but at this point, I don't think that’s necessary. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh. No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. It’s just… frustrating. But I’ll try to relax and not worry. And I'll watch for those other symptoms, you know. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Thank you. I suppose I’ll just go home and have a nice cup of tea… chamomile, perhaps!
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Sucich. Have a good day. And try not to dwell on it. .
