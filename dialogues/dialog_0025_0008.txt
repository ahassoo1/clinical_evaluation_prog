DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… my ears. They feel blocked, you know? Full. It’s been… a while now, I think. Honestly, time gets away from me. It’s just… annoying, mostly.
DOCTOR: “A while now…” Right. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… Oh, dear. Let me think. It started… after the… the funeral, I believe. Yes, after my wife… passed. So, sometime after last November, then. It hasn’t gotten worse, exactly, just… always there. A sort of pressure.
DOCTOR: November… Okay. And has anything specifically made it better or worse since then?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, not that I recall. It’s just… consistent. Flying doesn’t help, I think. I do a bit of travel for work, checking on farms, you see. Though, to be honest, I can’t always say for sure if it's the flying… or just everything else.
DOCTOR: Right. Flying can certainly exacerbate things. And you said pressure… is it painful?
PATIENT: No, not really painful. More… uncomfortable. Like when you go up in a plane, you know? That feeling. It’s not sharp or anything. Just… full. And a little muffly. Like I’m talking through cotton, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, "muffly" is helpful. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Now that you mention it… maybe? It’s hard to say. I work around a lot of machinery, tractors and such. So there’s always some noise. I just figured it was that.
DOCTOR: I see. Alright. Have you experienced any dizziness, or any changes in your hearing, other than the muffling?
PATIENT: Dizziness… No, not really. I’m a bit clumsy, always have been, but that’s just me. And my hearing… well, it’s not what it used to be, but that’s just age, isn't it? It's just quiet sounds I have trouble with, maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any history of ear infections?
PATIENT: Ear infections… Oh, dear. When I was a boy, maybe? A long time ago. Nothing serious, I don't think. My mother handled it. I really couldn't say. It was a long time ago, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Not that I know of. I don’t take much, thankfully. Just a little something for my blood pressure, now and then. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medication is that, if you recall the name?
PATIENT: Uh… Oh, dear. It’s… a little white pill. I get it from the pharmacy, you see. I think it starts with an ‘A’… or maybe a ‘B’? Honestly, Doctor, I just ask them to refill it every few months.
DOCTOR: Right. We’ll need to get the exact name of that medication, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It's important. But let’s move on for now. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she didn’t approve. And I suppose it just never took.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Nothing heavy. I'm not much of a drinker, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, I'm going to take a look in your ears now. I'll need you to sit up and tilt your head to the side. It’s a quick exam, but let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds good. Just… get it over with quickly, if you could? I have a bit of a schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some cerumen buildup in both ears, which could be contributing to the feeling of fullness. The tympanic membranes look normal, but a little dull. No signs of infection. It could be Eustachian tube dysfunction, but we’ll need to rule other things out. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Alright. Eustachian… what now? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not much for all the medical terms. Just… tell me what it means, if you could? And quickly, please?
DOCTOR: It’s a small tube that connects your middle ear to the back of your throat. If it gets blocked, it can cause pressure and fullness in your ears. It's fairly common. Your heart and lungs sound clear. It's unlikely to be related to that, but it’s always best to check. I want to do a quick hearing test, just to see what’s going on with your sound sensitivity. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A quick test? Alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a farm to check on this afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s just a simple test where you’ll wear headphones and indicate when you hear a beep. It shouldn't take more than ten minutes. I'll have my assistant, Maria, guide you through it. Let me just quickly document all of this first. She's right outside.
PATIENT: Ten minutes, you say? Very well. Let’s get it over with, then. Just… tell Maria to be quick, alright?
DOCTOR: I will. Maria, could you please take Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez for a quick audiometry test?
PATIENT: Alright. Let’s go, then. I suppose.
