DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s this… discoloration. It’s really quite bothersome, frankly. Not something one expects at my age. It started a few weeks ago, and it’s just… not going away. I’ve always taken very good care of my skin, you understand.
DOCTOR: Discoloration… right. And where exactly is this discoloration, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: Well, it’s on my hands, mostly. And a little bit on my wrists. It’s not like a rash, it’s… more like patches. Uneven coloring, really. And it’s quite noticeable, especially when I’m dressed nicely. I do a lot of gardening, but I always wear gloves, so I don’t understand why it’s happening. It’s simply… unseemly.
DOCTOR: Gardening, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, gardening. A perfectly respectable hobby, I assure you. Though I suppose some people don't understand the delicate art of it. It’s not as if I’m out there digging in the dirt with my bare hands! I use all the proper tools, and I’m very careful about the plants I choose. It's not like I'm handling anything… dangerous. Though, now that I mention it, there was that new fertilizer I tried… a bit odd-looking, greenish-brown. But I followed the instructions exactly.
DOCTOR: Right, a new fertilizer. And how long ago did you start using this fertilizer, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it must have been about three weeks ago, perhaps a little more. Right around the time I started noticing… the issue. It’s a concentrated kind, you see, so I only used a small amount. It said it was very good for roses, specifically. I have quite a lovely rose garden, you know. Hybrid teas, mostly. Very demanding flowers, they are.
DOCTOR: And besides the discoloration, are you experiencing any itching, burning, or pain with these patches, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. It doesn't feel like anything, honestly. That’s what's so strange! It’s just… there. It’s purely a cosmetic concern, really. Though, I do get rather self-conscious when I’m out. People stare, you know. It's terribly rude. And I have a dinner party planned next month… I simply must have this sorted out before then.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's take a look. If you wouldn’t mind, please roll up your sleeves so I can get a better view of these patches. It’s important to rule out other possibilities, even if you say it doesn’t feel like anything. We can’t just assume it’s the fertilizer, now can we?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Though I still think it’s probably just the fertilizer. There. Do be gentle, Doctor. My skin is rather sensitive, you know. And I’ve just had a manicure.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. There's uneven pigmentation here, mostly on the dorsal surfaces of both hands and wrists. No obvious rash, no swelling, no blisters. The discoloration appears to be somewhat symmetrical. It’s not consistent with a typical contact dermatitis, but we can’t rule anything out without further investigation. Skin feels normal temperature and texture, otherwise. Have you noticed this discoloration anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: No, just my hands and wrists. Absolutely nowhere else. I’m very diligent about sunscreen, you know. I wouldn't dream of exposing my skin to the sun without protection. I use an SPF of 50, religiously. And I reapply every two hours. Really, Doctor, I take very good care of myself. It’s simply… baffling. Perhaps it’s a reaction to something in the moisturizer I use? Though I’ve been using the same one for years…
DOCTOR: Right. Well, sometimes reactions can develop after years of use. It’s not always immediate. Let's take a look at your medical history. I see you’ve had a tetanus booster… good. Any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. No, nothing major. I’m slightly sensitive to pollen in the spring, but it’s just a bit of sneezing, really. Nothing that requires medication. And I had a mild reaction to penicillin when I was a child, but that was years ago. It just gave me a bit of a rash, nothing serious. Really, Doctor, I’m quite a healthy person. I eat a balanced diet, I exercise regularly, and I get plenty of sleep. I simply don’t understand what could be causing this. It’s… unbecoming.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. We'll do a patch test to see if we can identify the cause. I’m going to order some blood work as well, just to rule out any underlying conditions. It’s better to be thorough. In the meantime, I recommend you discontinue use of the fertilizer and the moisturizer, just to be safe. I’ll have the lab send over the paperwork. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh, blood work… very well. Though I highly doubt it will reveal anything. Honestly, Doctor, this is rather inconvenient. I have a luncheon planned for Friday. Discontinuing the moisturizer… well, that will simply have to do, I suppose. But the fertilizer? It’s peak rose season! Will this patch test take long? And will it leave a mark? I do have a rather important event coming up, you know.
DOCTOR: The patch test will require a couple of visits, Ms. Bartock. It involves applying small amounts of various substances to your skin for a few days to see if there’s a reaction. And yes, there may be some slight redness or irritation, but it’s usually temporary. It’s a necessary step to determine the cause of this discoloration. As for the roses… well, sometimes we have to make sacrifices for the sake of our health. And frankly, a few weeks without fertilizer won’t ruin your entire rose garden. I’ll have the nurse schedule your appointments. It’s important to follow up as directed.
PATIENT: Oh. I suppose you’re right. Though this is… most inconvenient. Very well. Do let me know if there's a cancellation. And please, be very gentle with the application. I've always had rather sensitive skin. I believe that is all for now, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Bartock, that appears to be all. The nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork and to schedule your appointments. Please follow the instructions carefully, and discontinue use of the fertilizer and moisturizer as instructed. Have a good day.
