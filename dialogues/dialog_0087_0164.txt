DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit…strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and I’ve gotten quite yellow, especially in my eyes. And it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. I had some last week, and that’s when it really flared up. It’s worrying me a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Haggar, I understand. Tiredness and yellowing of the eyes—that's jaundice—and you've noticed a connection with eating fava beans. That is certainly something we need to investigate. To start, can you tell me a bit more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: It’s… just a deep exhaustion, you know? Not just feeling a little sleepy. It's like all my energy is gone, even after a full night’s sleep. It’s been getting worse over the past few months, slowly, but definitely noticeable now. I find it hard to even walk up the stairs without getting winded. And I just feel… weak, generally.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a progressive fatigue over several months, accompanied by weakness and shortness of breath, even with mild exertion. And this yellowing – you mentioned it flares up after fava beans. Has it happened with other foods, or is it specifically after eating fava beans?
PATIENT: No, it’s always after fava beans. I didn’t think anything of it at first, because, well, I don’t eat them very often. It was at a friend’s house, and she made a big salad with them. Then a few days later, I started feeling tired and noticed my eyes were yellow. And then it happened again last week when I tried them at a farmer's market. Nothing else seems to trigger it. It’s very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, very specific to fava beans. That’s helpful. Do you have any family history of anemia, jaundice, or any other blood disorders?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… Hmm. My mother… she was often tired, always complaining about feeling weak. But she just thought it was getting old. She never really went to the doctor much. And my father… he was a very healthy man, as far as I know. I don’t recall him ever having any serious health problems. As for anyone else in the family… I don't really know, to be honest. My parents weren't very close with their siblings, and I didn’t meet many relatives growing up. It’s probably not much help, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Haggar. Any information is helpful. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a teenager, and I broke my arm once, but that’s about it. I haven't been hospitalized for anything serious, and I don't take any regular medications. Just over-the-counter pain relievers when I have a headache. I try to stay healthy, eat well, and get enough sleep. Though, lately, the sleep isn't helping much with the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant past medical history, tonsillectomy in adolescence, and no current medications besides occasional pain relievers. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything – except, apparently, fava beans! I can wear any kind of jewelry, I haven’t had any skin reactions to bug bites… I’m pretty lucky in that regard, actually. No known allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s good to know. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. I was expecting that, to be honest. Please, go ahead. Is there anything special I need to do?
DOCTOR: Wonderful. No, nothing special. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take a look at your skin. We’ll also check the sclera of your eyes, as you mentioned the yellowing. If you could just sit up on the table, that would be great. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please.
PATIENT: Alright. Is everything okay so far? I always get a little nervous at the doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. It feels… normal, I guess. A little sensitive maybe, but not painful. Like a normal tummy, really. I do get a bit of indigestion sometimes, but it’s not bothering me right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No significant tenderness. Now, let’s take a look at your eyes. I do see some yellowing of the sclera, as you mentioned. It's more pronounced in both eyes, but it’s definitely present. And your skin does have a slightly yellowish tinge as well. This is called jaundice, and it suggests a build-up of bilirubin in your system. We need to investigate the cause of this jaundice. I suspect, based on your history and symptoms, that you may have a condition called Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency, which can cause hemolytic anemia and jaundice triggered by certain foods, like fava beans. However, we need to confirm this with some blood tests. Would you be willing to have some blood drawn?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Blood tests sound sensible. I trust your judgement, Doctor. If that's what we need to do to find out what’s going on, then please, go ahead. I’m just hoping it’s not something too serious. What exactly does that deficiency do, if you don't mind me asking? I like to understand things if I can.
DOCTOR: Of course. Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase, or G6PD, is an enzyme that helps protect your red blood cells from damage. If you have a deficiency, your red blood cells are more vulnerable to breaking down when exposed to certain triggers, like fava beans, certain medications, or infections. This breakdown releases bilirubin, which causes the jaundice and fatigue. It's often a genetic condition, and many people with a mild deficiency don’t even know they have it until they are exposed to a trigger. The good news is that it's usually manageable with lifestyle modifications – avoiding triggers – and rarely causes serious complications. I'll order a complete blood count , a reticulocyte count, a bilirubin level, and a G6PD enzyme assay. We'll also check your liver function tests to rule out any other potential causes of jaundice. I’ll also order a Coombs test to check for antibodies attacking the red blood cells. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment for blood draw. It typically takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding fava beans and any other foods you suspect might be triggering your symptoms. Do you have any questions about the tests or the recommendations?
PATIENT: No, that all makes sense. Thank you for explaining it so clearly, Doctor. Avoiding the fava beans sounds easy enough, and I haven’t eaten anything else that I suspect. A few days to wait for the results… okay. Just one question: will this show up on a regular blood test, or is it a special one they have to do? And… is it something I’d pass on to my children, if I have any in the future? I haven’t thought about having children yet, but I like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. A standard CBC might show anemia, but it won't tell us the underlying cause. The G6PD enzyme assay is a specific test that measures the level of the G6PD enzyme in your red blood cells. And yes, G6PD deficiency is an X-linked genetic condition. This means it’s carried on the X chromosome. If you carry the gene, there's a 50% chance you could pass it on to your children. Males who inherit the gene will be affected, while females need to inherit two copies of the gene to be affected. Genetic counseling is available if you are planning a family, to discuss the risks and options in more detail. I can provide you with a referral to a genetic counselor if you'd like. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that answers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and your explanations. You've put my mind at ease a little, and I feel much better knowing what we're looking for. I'll avoid the fava beans and wait for the lab to contact me. Thank you again. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Haggar. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before the lab results come back. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best. Have a good day as well. .
