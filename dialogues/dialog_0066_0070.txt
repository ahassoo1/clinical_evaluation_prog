DOCTOR: Hi Kile, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Hello. Doctor... Condray, yes? It's… a check-up, I think. New in town, you see. Medicare said I need to find a doctor. Old doctor... not so good anymore, far away. I do makeup, for the theater. Very important work, you know. Lots of faces.
DOCTOR: Okay, a new patient check-up, that makes sense. And welcome to the area, Kile! It's good you’re getting things established here. Theater makeup, that sounds fascinating! So, just to be thorough, even though it's a general check-up, can you tell me a bit about why you felt you needed to find a new doctor?
PATIENT: Felt? Well… he… the old one… always rushed. Never really looked at my work. Said I used too much powder. Too much! It’s for the stage, you see. Needs to be seen. And… he kept talking about… something with my… numbers? Blood, I think? Didn’t listen when I said it was just good Slavic bone structure. Honestly. I don’t remember exactly. Old age, you know. Everything gets… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, rushing and not listening is definitely not ideal. And we’ll definitely take the time to listen today. You mentioned “numbers” – that likely refers to your lab work. We'll repeat those tests today just to get a good baseline. Just to be sure we cover everything, can you recall if he ever mentioned what those numbers were, or what they were checking for?
PATIENT: Numbers… Ugh. So many numbers. No, no I don’t think so. He said something about… cholesterol? Or maybe… glucose? Something like that. All these things sound the same, honestly. He was always very… stern. Like I was doing something wrong by making beautiful people look even more beautiful. It’s art, you know! And a good artist needs… well, it’s complicated. Don’t think I remember the actual numbers. Just that he frowned. A lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, cholesterol and glucose, that gives us a starting point. No worries at all, we’ll get everything checked again today. And you're right, making people look beautiful is art. We’ll make sure to focus on your overall health and well-being today, and take things at your pace. To get a clearer picture, can you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Hmm… Well, my ex-wife said I had a condition. A “personality condition.” Said I was too… focused on details. Very rude, actually. She didn’t understand the importance of a perfectly blended contour. Besides that… nothing, I think. Maybe… high blood pressure? The old doctor mumbled something about that once, when I was explaining the lighting needed for a dramatic scene. But it was probably just excitement. Big scenes are stressful! I don’t feel sick. I’m very healthy for my age, you know. Lots of energy. Especially when I have a new project.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. We’ll check your blood pressure today to get an accurate reading. And we’ll definitely focus on what you're feeling, rather than relying on past opinions. To get a full picture, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No, no. Never. Too risky for the face, you see. Can’t risk a scar! Ruin everything. Hospital… hmm. Once, a long time ago. My ex-wife… she had a… situation. I drove her, yes. But I wasn't in the hospital. Just waiting. Very uncomfortable chairs, those hospital chairs. And terrible lighting. Not good for the complexion, at all. I don’t think I was treated for anything. Just… support. Very stressful time. Not important. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Now, sometimes medical conditions can run in families. Do you know of any significant illnesses that your parents or siblings have had?
PATIENT: Family… That’s… complicated. My mother… she liked to complain. A lot. Said she had… everything. Always something. Arthritis, I think. And… nerves. Very dramatic woman, my mother. My father… he was a stoic. Never said a word. Never complained. Maybe… heart problems? Vague recollection. He sat a lot. And smoked. Bad habit, smoking. My sister… she moved to America a long time ago. Haven’t heard from her in years. She always was… different. Not good with details, that one. Probably perfectly healthy, though. Doesn't like doctors, I think. Like me, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. We'll keep those potential issues in mind. Now, let's talk about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not! Ruins the skin, you see. And the breath. Alcohol… occasionally. A small glass of vodka, maybe, with dinner. Very good for calming the nerves after a difficult scene. But not every day. And… recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I am an artist! A professional! We need a clear mind. We need… focus. Occasionally, I might use a very special setting spray for the actors. Very high quality. But it’s not a… drug. It’s for the performance. Helps the makeup stay put.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being honest. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Once, I used a new brand of foundation. Terrible reaction! My face swelled up. Very embarrassing. Had to cancel the show. Turned out it had… something in it. Something floral, I think. Besides that… no. No allergies. I eat everything. Except maybe… beets. Don’t like beets. And my ex-wife’s cooking. That was an allergy, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Kile. That gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to check your vital signs and overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you need. But be gentle, please. This face is very important. And the lighting in here is terrible. Makes everything look… washed out. Are you sure you can’t adjust the lights?
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll be as gentle as possible. And I’ll see what I can do about the lighting. Let's start with your blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your ears, nose, and throat. If you're comfortable, I’d also like to check your reflexes and a few simple neurological functions. Okay, just relax your arm for me… Blood pressure is 142 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll want to monitor that over time. Now, let's listen to your heart… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Breathing is clear on both sides. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Ears look clear, nasal passages are normal. Throat is clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Reflexes? Oh dear. Please be careful! This is a very sensitive area. I need this face for my work, you know. Artists are… delicate. Just get it over with quickly, please. And try not to make a loud noise. It’s distracting when I’m concentrating. Very distracting. This lighting is truly awful.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your legs for me… I’m just going to tap on your knees lightly… Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal and symmetrical. That’s good. No issues there. Now, I’m just going to check your cranial nerves… just a quick assessment of your vision, facial movements, and balance. Cranial nerves are intact. Vision is normal, facial movements are symmetrical, and balance is stable. Overall, the neurological exam is within normal limits. Okay, Kile, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears to be generally normal, although your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which we'll monitor. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, I’d like to order some routine blood work to get a baseline and rule out any potential issues. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Finished? Finally! Blood work, you say? Hmm. More poking and prodding? I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And try to find a comfortable chair for me while I wait. These chairs are truly barbaric. Is there any chance of dimming the lights? It's making me look… pale. Really pale. And make sure the phlebotomist is gentle. Very gentle. This face is my livelihood, you know. My art.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll make sure to request a comfortable chair for you and speak to the phlebotomist beforehand to ensure a gentle blood draw. I’ll also see what I can do about the lighting. We’ll take things as slow as you need, and prioritize your comfort. The blood work will give us a good overview of your overall health, and we can discuss the results in a week or so. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on a healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress management techniques to help lower your blood pressure. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Stress management? Hmm. Difficult. Big scenes are very stressful, you know. Lots of pressure. And the actors… sometimes difficult to work with. Mostly the lighting, though. Truly dreadful. What about… can I get a referral for a good lighting technician? One who understands the importance of flattering angles? It would be very helpful for my work. And can you recommend a good moisturizer? This exam has left my skin feeling… dry. Really dry. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I can definitely provide you with a referral for a reputable lighting technician – I have a few contacts in the local theater community. And I can recommend a great dermatologist who specializes in skincare and would be happy to discuss moisturizer options with you. I’ll have my assistant print out those referrals and some information on stress management techniques for you before you leave. So, to recap, we've ordered routine blood work, I'm providing referrals for a lighting technician and dermatologist, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish?
