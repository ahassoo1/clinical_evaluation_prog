DOCTOR: Right. Mystery Kobler, age 25. Well, Ms. Kobler, please, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It's... it’s a bit difficult to explain, honestly. I’ve been feeling… short of breath, I suppose. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. It’s been going on for a little while now, but it feels worse lately. I don't... I don't really remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: "A little while." Right. Well, "a little while" isn't terribly helpful, is it?
PATIENT: I understand. I... I'm terribly sorry. Things haven't been very clear in my mind lately. Perhaps… a few months? It’s hard to say. It feels longer, sometimes, but then other times… not so long. It’s very strange. I truly don't mean to be difficult.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Kobler, I appreciate you coming in, but we need specifics if I’m going to figure out what’s going on. "Feels longer, sometimes" doesn’t give me much to work with. Let’s try this: Has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: Specific… Hmm. That’s a good question. No, not that I can recall. It doesn't seem to be connected to… activity, or anything like that. It’s just… there. Sometimes it’s a little better, sometimes a lot worse, but there’s no… trigger, as far as I know. I've been trying to pay attention, but... It just comes and goes. Perhaps if I drink more water it helps a little with the dryness? But the breathing… that doesn't really change.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is this shortness of breath constant, or does it come and go like the dryness?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Definitely. Sometimes I can breathe perfectly normally, and other times... it feels like I'm trying to breathe through a very small straw. It's not always bad, thankfully. But it’s been happening more often lately, and lasting longer, I think. It doesn’t come with… coughing, or wheezing, or anything like that, if that's helpful. It’s just… difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any chest pain with this shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Not really. Sometimes... a little discomfort, maybe? It's hard to describe. Not like a sharp pain, or anything. More like… a tightness? But it’s not consistent, and it doesn't really feel like pain, exactly. It comes and goes with the breathing, I suppose, but it's not… alarming. If that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… Hmm. I hadn't noticed, actually. Let me… …No, I don't think so. They seem… normal. Maybe a little pale? But I’ve always had… thin ankles, if that makes a difference. I don't usually pay much attention to them, honestly. Is that something I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Kobler, swelling is something you should be looking for. It can indicate a number of things. Now, let's move on. Any fever, chills, night sweats?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I see. I apologize. No, no fever that I've noticed. I don't often feel warm, if that helps. And no chills, or night sweats. I sleep… rather soundly, actually. I don’t usually wake up feeling… clammy, or anything. It’s been a very long time since I’ve been properly ill, I believe. Just this breathing and dryness. Is it possible it's… allergies? I've never had bad allergies, but... I’ve been hearing a lot about them lately.
DOCTOR: Allergies are possible, I suppose. Though with your symptoms and lack of any clear trigger, it's not the most likely explanation. Let's go through some more basic things. Do you have any past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… That’s… difficult. I’ve moved around a bit, and things haven’t always been… well-documented, I suppose. I don’t recall any serious illnesses, no. I had the usual childhood things – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing major. And… I had my appendix removed when I was younger, I believe. That's the only surgery I can recall. No chronic conditions, as far as I know. I've always been… relatively healthy. Until this, of course.
DOCTOR: Right. Appendectomy. And do you have any family history of heart or lung problems?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… tricky. I didn't grow up with… a large family. And I haven't been in contact with many relatives for a long time. I know my mother had… some sort of breathing trouble when she was older, but I don’t know what it was. She didn't talk about it much. And I don't recall any specific heart problems in my family, no. It's… a bit of a blank, I'm afraid. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: No, no medications. I don’t take anything regularly. Occasionally, if I have a headache, I'll take… acetaminophen, I believe. But that’s it. I try to avoid taking anything unless absolutely necessary. I prefer… natural remedies, when possible. Although… I haven’t found anything that helps with this, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I do not smoke, I very rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a small glass of wine on special occasions – and I have never used any recreational drugs. I assure you, Doctor. I lead a… very quiet life. I focus on my writing, and… maintaining my health. I find those pursuits quite satisfying. I apologize if my… lack of a clear medical history is frustrating. I’m doing my best to recall everything I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kobler. Let's move on to a physical examination, then. Perhaps that will provide some clarity. If you could just follow my instructions.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. I’ll do whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Right. Lie back. I’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale… again… Heart sounds are normal. Lungs… are clear bilaterally, but I hear some mild wheezing on auscultation. Not significant, but noted. Blood pressure is 118/72, pulse is 76 and regular. Now, let's check your extremities. Any swelling, as we discussed?
PATIENT: No swelling, Doctor. As I said before, they seem… normal. Just… thin, perhaps. I don't believe there’s been any change since you last observed them. Is everything alright? The wheezing… is that concerning?
DOCTOR: No edema. Peripheral pulses are present and strong. Mild wheezing can be concerning, but it's not necessarily indicative of anything serious. It could be a temporary constriction of the airways. Now, open your mouth. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Mucous membranes appear… slightly dry, but not significantly. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Hmm. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a chest X-ray to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: That sounds… prudent, Doctor. I’m happy to have those tests done. A chest X-ray… is that to look for… pneumonia, or something similar? I haven't had a cough, or a fever, as I mentioned before, but… I don't want to be a bother if it's not necessary. I truly appreciate you taking the time to investigate this. I’ve just been feeling so… unwell, and I’m hoping to find some answers.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia is a possibility, though, as you say, unlikely given your symptoms. The X-ray is simply to get a clearer picture of your lungs and rule out any underlying issues. We need to be thorough. I’m also going to prescribe a bronchodilator to help open your airways. It’s a mild medication. Use it as directed. Here’s the prescription. The lab and radiology orders are already sent. You'll receive a call to schedule the appointments. Come back in a week with the results. If your symptoms worsen before then, or if you develop a fever, come in immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A bronchodilator… Thank you, Doctor. That sounds… hopeful. I… I suppose I don’t have any specific questions at the moment. Just… what are the chances that it’s something serious? And… what if the tests are inconclusive? I understand you’re busy, and I don’t want to take up too much of your time. But I’ve been feeling so… uncertain, and I’m rather worried. Perhaps… perhaps it's just anxiety, but... it's difficult to say.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Kobler, I understand you’re anxious, but you’re fixating on worst-case scenarios. It’s highly unlikely to be anything serious, given your history and presentation. We're running these tests to rule things out, not because I expect to find something alarming. And if the tests are inconclusive, we’ll revisit the matter. Perhaps we’ll consider a referral to a pulmonologist. But let’s not jump to conclusions before we have the results. For now, take the bronchodilator as prescribed, try to relax, and come back in a week. And frankly, Ms. Kobler, a little less self-worry might do you some good. Now, if that’s all… next patient.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. I understand. You’re right… I shouldn’t worry so much. Thank you for your time, and for your… patience. I’ll take the bronchodilator as directed, and I’ll be sure to schedule the appointments. I apologize for being… difficult. .
