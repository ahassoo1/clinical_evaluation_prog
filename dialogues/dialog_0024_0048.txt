DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. Be concise, if you would. My schedule is…demanding.
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It's these…episodes, I suppose you'd call them. I get confused. Not all the time, mind you. But enough to be…inconvenient. It’s unsettling, really. My wife says I ask the same questions over and over, like a child. It’s…irritating.
DOCTOR: “Episodes,” you say. And your wife has noted repetitive questioning. Very well. Let’s attempt to quantify this “inconvenience.” When did these episodes begin?
PATIENT: Quantify? Honestly, Doctor, I don't speak in numbers when it comes to my mind. But…let me think. It's been…oh, maybe six months now? Started subtly, I suppose. Asking where I put my glasses when they're on my head, that sort of thing. Then it got…worse. Not much worse, but noticeable. Around the new year, I’d say it really became a problem. My wife…well, she’s very observant. She noticed before I did, naturally. Women are like that, aren’t they? Always noticing.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Six months. And these episodes…do they occur at specific times of day?
PATIENT: Specific times? No, not that I’ve noticed. It doesn't seem to follow any pattern. Sometimes it's in the morning, sometimes afternoon, sometimes…well, I honestly can’t say. It's just…random. And it's not like I completely lose my mind, Doctor. I'm not senile! It's just…a blank. A little…foggy. I know who I am, what I do. I just…can't recall things. Simple things. Where I parked the truck, the name of that fellow from the hardware store…things like that. Not a good look, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you experience any other symptoms concomitant with these…episodes?
PATIENT: Concomitant? Doctor, are you trying to test me? Just use plain English! Other symptoms…let me think. Well, sometimes I feel a little…off balance. Not enough to fall, mind you. Just…wobbly. And sometimes a bit of a headache, but I get headaches anyway. From the sun, mostly. I work outside, you see. Tile and stone. It’s hard work. So, a headache doesn’t necessarily mean anything. It's hard to say if it's with the confusion or just…life. Really, it's mostly the forgetting. That's what bothers me – and my wife, of course. She worries.
DOCTOR: “Off balance” and headaches. Noted. Have you experienced any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? No, not that I’ve noticed. I wear glasses, of course, have for years. The prescription hasn’t changed recently, I know that much. I go to Dr. Chen, good man, very thorough. He checks everything. No, my vision is fine. I can see perfectly well, thank you. It’s my memory that’s the problem, not my eyes. Are you even listening to me, Doctor? It feels like you're asking about everything but the actual issue.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Lason, I am listening. A comprehensive assessment is paramount. Now, let us proceed with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Well, I had a bit of trouble with my back years ago, working with the stone, heavy lifting you know. But that cleared up with physical therapy. And my wife insists I have high blood pressure, makes me take those little pills every morning. Honestly, I feel fine most of the time. She’s just… cautious. Beyond that, no. I’ve always been a strong, healthy man. Worked hard my whole life. This confusion… it's new. It’s worrying because it’s different. Not like getting a sore muscle. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? Or are we just making lists?
DOCTOR: Back pain, hypertension... and the wife's insistence is… noted. Do you take any other medications besides those for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Just the little white pills for the pressure. My wife tries to get me to take something for my joints, says they ache, but I refuse. I’ve always been one to tough it out, you see. No need to fill myself with chemicals just because I’m getting older. It's a principle. And honestly, I don't feel like I need anything else. It’s just…this forgetting. It’s frustrating. I used to be able to remember everything. Dates, names, faces… Now, it's like a fog. It’s unsettling, Doctor, truly unsettling. Are you writing all this down? It's important.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Lason, I am documenting everything. Now, let’s briefly discuss your family history. Are there any instances of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease in your family?
PATIENT: Dementia…Alzheimer’s… Well, my mother… she was a bit… forgetful towards the end. But everyone forgets things when they get old, don't they? It wasn't anything serious, I don't think. Just…age. And my uncle, on my wife’s side… she says he had something, years ago. But she doesn't remember the details. She's not very good with dates, my wife. So, it's hard to say. Honestly, Doctor, my family history is… unremarkable. We're a strong, hardworking people. Not prone to… illness, or forgetting. This is all very unsettling. I feel like you're looking for something that isn't there.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us proceed with a brief neurological examination. I understand your…frustration, Mr. Lason. But it is my professional obligation to rule out any underlying pathology. Now, can you please follow my finger with your eyes… without moving your head?
PATIENT: Follow your finger? Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? I can see perfectly well! But…fine. I'll play your game. There. Is that fast enough for you? Are we getting somewhere with this, or is this just busywork? I have a schedule, you know. Tile doesn't lay itself.
DOCTOR: Adequate tracking. Now, I would like you to close your eyes and tell me the date, including the day of the week.
PATIENT: The date? Honestly, Doctor… Today is… Tuesday. August… the 2nd. 2025. Is that correct? I think. My wife always keeps track of these things. Is that good enough? It's not as if I need to know the date to lay tile, is it?
DOCTOR: Adequate… for the moment. Now, I will test your short-term memory. I will say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me after I finish. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Ready as I’ll ever be, I suppose. This feels…degrading, to be honest. Three words, you say? Go on, then. Let’s get this over with. I have work to do, you know.
DOCTOR: The words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Repeat them back to me, please.
PATIENT: Apple… Table… and… um… It was something shiny… small… a… uh… I can’t… It’s on the tip of my tongue! It's… infuriating! I know I heard it… Apple, Table… and… something… I'm sorry, Doctor. It’s gone. I just can’t remember.
DOCTOR: That is…concerning, Mr. Lason. Given these findings, I recommend further evaluation. I will order an MRI of the brain and refer you to a neurologist for a comprehensive cognitive assessment. This is to rule out any potential underlying causes. I will have my assistant schedule these appointments for you. In the meantime, I advise that you avoid driving and refrain from operating heavy machinery. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: MRI? Neurologist? Avoid driving? Doctor, are you telling me I’m… losing my mind? I lay tile for a living! I need to drive! I am operating heavy machinery! This is… absurd! My wife will be furious. Is this absolutely necessary? Couldn’t we just… monitor it? What exactly are you looking for? What’s wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your… distress. However, it is my professional responsibility to investigate these cognitive deficits. These symptoms, while not definitively diagnostic, warrant a more thorough evaluation to rule out serious underlying pathologies, such as early-stage dementia or structural abnormalities in the brain. I am not suggesting you have anything serious, but we need to be certain. The MRI will provide a detailed image of your brain, and the neurologist will conduct a series of tests to assess your memory, attention, and other cognitive functions. I strongly advise against dismissing these findings. Early detection is crucial for effective management. I will have my assistant schedule these appointments immediately. Do you concur?
PATIENT: …Fine. Do what you have to do. But I still think my wife is exaggerating. And I don’t like the sound of any of this. Just… get it over with, then. Schedule the appointments. But don't expect me to like it. And tell your assistant to be quick about it. I have work to do, you know. .
DOCTOR: Very well. My assistant will contact you shortly. I will document these recommendations in your chart. Thank you for your time, Mr. Lason. I expect you to follow through with these appointments. .
