DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… yes. Right. My ear. It feels… blocked, I think. Full. Like something’s… in there. It's been… a while now, honestly. Not terribly painful, just… annoying. I don't really remember when it started, exactly. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Okay, “blocked” and “full” – I understand. And you said it's been going on for a while, but you’re not sure how long?
PATIENT: No, no, I'm not. Months, I think? Maybe longer. Honestly, things… blur together these days. It's not… a big deal, really. Just bothersome. I mostly notice it when it's quiet. Like… now.
DOCTOR: Alright, "months, maybe longer" is helpful. And it's more noticeable when it's quiet – that gives us a clue. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm. Not that I recall. I work outside a lot, with the… plants, you know? Agricultural Inspectors. So maybe dust? Or… the wind? It’s hard to say. It's just… always sort of there, a low-level thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, working outdoors with plants – that’s good information. Dust and wind are certainly possibilities. And it sounds like it’s a consistent issue, not something that comes and goes quickly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fullness in your ear?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. No pain, like I said. No… ringing. Not that I've noticed, anyway. My hearing seems okay. I haven't had trouble understanding people. Just… the blocked feeling. Sometimes it feels a little… itchy, maybe? Deep inside. But that could just be… my imagination.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, no ringing, hearing seems normal, and occasionally a little itchiness. That’s all helpful. Now, let's go through some general questions, if that's alright with you. Have you ever had any problems with ear infections, or any ear surgeries?
PATIENT: Ear infections… I think I did, as a child. A long time ago. Nothing serious, I don’t recall. Surgeries… no. Never had any surgeries on my ears. Or anywhere else, really. I try to avoid hospitals if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of ear infections as a child, but no surgeries. Good to know. And you prefer to avoid hospitals when possible – I understand that. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… No, not really. Just… a multivitamin, sometimes. For older people, you know? My wife… she used to remind me. I don't take anything regularly. Nothing for any specific ailment.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin occasionally. And no allergies to any medications that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, allergies. Not that I know of. I eat… pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to anything. Though, my wife… she had some trouble with shellfish. But that’s… not relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: No, your wife’s allergies aren’t directly relevant, but thank you for letting me know. Okay, just a few more questions about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high. But they gave me some… advice. About salt. And walking. So I… try to do that. Other than that… no. Nothing major. I’m a pretty healthy guy, for my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of slightly elevated blood pressure, managed with lifestyle changes. That's good to hear. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any family members with hearing loss or ear problems?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Family history… That’s… difficult. My wife’s side of the family was very large, and I didn’t… know them well. My own parents… my father had a bit of trouble hearing towards the end, I think. But it was just old age, probably. Nothing… specific. I don't really keep track of those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible history of hearing loss in your father, likely age-related. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a day in my life. I used to… have a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. But not anymore. It doesn’t… feel right, anymore. And no, definitely no recreational drugs.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to take a look in your ears, if that’s alright. It will only take a few moments.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need. Just… try to be quick, if you could? It… feels strange, having things near my ears.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as gentle and quick as possible. Hmm. There's some cerumen – earwax – present, and it appears to be impacted. That could be contributing to the blocked sensation. I also see some mild redness in the ear canal. Similar findings on this side – impacted cerumen and mild redness. Your eardrum appears intact on both sides, which is good. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve seen, it seems likely that your symptoms are due to impacted earwax. The mild redness could be due to irritation from the wax buildup.
PATIENT: Wax, huh? That’s… all it is? I was worried it was something serious. My wife always used to clean my ears with those little cotton swabs… maybe I should have kept doing that. But she said it was bad for them… now I’m confused. What do we do about it?
DOCTOR: It's good that it's likely just wax, and you were right to be concerned about something potentially serious. It's common to worry! And you're right, your wife was actually correct to discourage the cotton swabs. They tend to push the wax further in, compacting it even more and making the problem worse. There are a few options. We can try to remove the wax with ear drops at home. These drops soften the wax, which will hopefully allow it to come out on its own. If that doesn't work, we can schedule a procedure to remove it manually. It's a quick and painless process. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Ear drops… that sounds… manageable. Less invasive, I suppose. I'd rather try that first, if you think it will work. I'm not keen on anything… stuck in my ears. What kind of drops are they? And how long do I have to use them for?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, and I agree, starting with ear drops is a good first step. I'm going to prescribe you some ceruminolytics - that’s just a fancy word for earwax dissolving drops. They contain carbamide peroxide. You’ll need to put 5-10 drops in each ear twice a day for 7 days. After you put the drops in, it’s best to lie on your side for about 10 minutes to allow them to soak in. You might hear some bubbling, which is normal. After the 7 days, if you still have symptoms, we can then schedule an appointment for manual removal. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Twice a day for a week. I can manage that. Lie on my side… bubbling… And if it doesn't work, then we talk about… getting it out manually. Right. Thank you, Doctor. That’s… a relief.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. I’ll send the prescription electronically to your pharmacy, and you should be able to pick it up today. I’ll also print out some instructions for you with all of the details we discussed. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate your patience. Honestly, I… I don’t remember things as well as I used to. Thank you again. I’ll… see you in a week, if I need to.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. It’s my pleasure, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. It’s perfectly normal to have memory lapses, and I’m happy to clarify anything if needed. Here are those instructions for the ear drops. And remember, if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve after a week, please schedule an appointment. Have a good day, Mr. GuerreroloLopez, and I hope you feel better soon.
