DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. I'm Dr. Noordin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… this ringing in my ears. It’s been happening for a bit now, and it’s starting to get on my nerves, to be honest. I just want to figure out what’s going on, if that's okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears. We call that tinnitus, by the way. "Tinnitus" – tin-ih-tus. “A bit now” is a little vague though, could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, tinnitus, right. Sorry, I don’t really remember those words. Um… maybe a month or so? It started after a really loud party, but it hasn't gone away even though it’s been a while. I just thought it would get better on its own, you know?
DOCTOR: A loud party, okay. And it’s been consistently present for a month?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. It's not always super loud, but it’s always there, even if it's just a faint buzzing. Sometimes it gets worse when I'm tired, I think. It’s just… annoying, constantly having something going on in my ears.
DOCTOR: Okay, so consistent tinnitus for about a month, onset after a loud party, and it worsens with fatigue. Is it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… mostly in my right ear, but sometimes I feel it in my left too. It’s hard to tell, honestly. They both feel a bit… off. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon to experience it in both ears, even if it feels more prominent on one side. We need to rule a few things out, though. Have you noticed any hearing loss at all?
PATIENT: Hearing loss? Not that I've noticed, no. I mean, I watch TV pretty loud, but I always have. I don't think my hearing’s gotten worse, but I’ve never really paid attention, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the party, have you been exposed to any other loud noises recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… Work’s a bit noisy, sometimes. I’m a waiter, so lots of clattering plates and people talking. But nothing really loud, you know? Not like the party. Oh! And I went to a concert a couple of weeks ago… it was an outdoor one, so it was pretty loud, but not as bad as the party.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? No, not really. I've been a bit stressed at work lately, with a divorce and everything, but… that’s just life, I guess. No dizziness, no headaches, nothing like that. Just the ringing. It’s just… constant.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s take a look in your ears, just to make sure there’s nothing obvious going on. It'll only take a moment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. I’m not a big fan of things going in my ears, but if it helps, then sure. Let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. It'll be quick, and I’ll be gentle. I’m just looking for any wax buildup or signs of infection. It might be a little cool, but shouldn't be painful. Hmm. Your ear canals look clear. No obvious signs of infection or excessive wax. Tympanic membranes look normal as well. So, physically, your ears look okay. Given the history – the loud noise exposure and the tinnitus – it sounds like you’re likely experiencing noise-induced tinnitus.
PATIENT: Noise-induced? Does that mean… it's permanent? Is there anything I can do about it? I really just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Well, “permanent” is a strong word. The good news is, often tinnitus will improve over time, especially if you minimize further noise exposure. It’s not uncommon for it to fade gradually. However, it can also become chronic, meaning it persists for a long time. To be on the safe side, I’d like to get a basic hearing test done, just to establish a baseline and rule out any underlying hearing loss we haven’t detected yet. That way, we can track any changes. It's a simple test, and it doesn’t hurt at all. Would you be happy to schedule that for later this week?
PATIENT: A hearing test sounds good. If it helps figure things out, then definitely. Later this week is fine. Is there anything else I should be doing? Like, anything I can do at home to try and… I don’t know, quiet the ringing? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Okay. While we wait for the hearing test, there are a few things you can try. Avoiding loud noises is key – that includes using earplugs or earmuffs when you're in noisy environments. There are also some apps and sound therapies designed to mask the tinnitus – white noise, nature sounds, things like that. Some people find them helpful. Stress management techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, can also be beneficial, given your divorce. And finally, I’d advise against self-treating with anything you find online. There are a lot of unsubstantiated claims out there. I'm going to give you a handout with some reputable resources and tips on managing tinnitus. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, that’s… actually really helpful, thank you. I will definitely try to avoid loud noises, and I’ll look into some of those apps. And I appreciate you warning me about self-treating. I think that’s all my questions for now. Just scheduling the hearing test, then? Do you have availability on Wednesday afternoon?
DOCTOR: Yes, Wednesday at 2:30 PM is open. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, 2:30 on Wednesday is perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor. I feel a bit better knowing there are things I can do, and that you're taking it seriously.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaylyne. We’ll get this checked out. The audiologist will do a more thorough assessment on Wednesday. In the meantime, try those suggestions, and don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns. I'll see you then. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again. I will. You too, Doctor. Bye.
