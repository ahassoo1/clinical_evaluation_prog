DOCTOR: Good morning, Deloris. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s…nice to meet you too, I suppose. Honestly, it’s about a letter. A letter for my… pet. It’s a bit silly, really. Something about needing proof of ownership? My niece told me I needed to come get something signed. I don’t really understand all the fuss, but… here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, a letter for your pet – proof of ownership. No problem at all, Deloris. It's not silly at all – sometimes these things come up, especially with travel or housing. To get this letter sorted out for you, I just need a little information about your pet. What kind of pet do you have?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. What is his name again? It’s… a dog. A big one. A very…fluffy one. Brown, I think? Or maybe black? Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. He’s a good boy, though. Very protective. Always barking at… well, everything, really. He's just… a dog. A large dog. Is that enough information? I never really paid attention to breeds and things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Deloris. A large, fluffy brown or black dog – a good boy who’s protective and likes to bark. That gives me a good start. Do you happen to know approximately how old he is?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens. Now you're asking a difficult question! I got him… after my divorce, I think? So… maybe eight years ago? Nine? It feels like forever ago, honestly. He was just a puppy then, little thing. He’s grown a lot since then, that’s for sure. He wasn't a baby baby puppy, though. More of a…teenager puppy? I really couldn't tell you his exact age, Doctor. People always exaggerate puppy ages anyway, don't they?
DOCTOR: They certainly do! Eight or nine years old – that makes him a lovely, mature dog. And it sounds like he’s very important to you. Before we get to the letter, I’d like to ask a few routine questions, just to make sure he's as healthy as can be. Has he had any recent illnesses or injuries?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. He had a…a little cough last winter, I think? Or maybe it was the winter before? It wasn’t anything serious, just a bit of a hacking sound. My niece, Beatrice, gave him some syrup. It seemed to help. And he… he pulled something in his leg chasing a squirrel last spring, but that healed up quickly. He's a bit clumsy, that one. Always running into things. But honestly, he's generally a very robust dog. He eats like a horse, if that means anything.
DOCTOR: A little cough last winter, treated with syrup, and a pulled muscle chasing a squirrel that healed well. Good to know. And a healthy appetite is always a positive sign! Does he receive regular vaccinations and preventative care – things like heartworm and flea/tick prevention?
PATIENT: Oh… vaccinations? See, that's something Beatrice handles. She’s very good with all that… the appointments and the little shots and things. I just… I pay the bill, and she takes him. I’m not sure what he gets, exactly. Heartworm… flea and tick? Yes, she mentioned something about a monthly pill. She's very diligent, that niece of mine. Honestly, I don’t concern myself with the details. I just trust she’s taking good care of him. Is that a problem? I mean, should I be the one doing all this? It’s a bit much for an old woman, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all, Deloris. It sounds like Beatrice is very responsible and taking excellent care of your dog. It's perfectly fine to let her manage those details. Knowing that he is receiving preventative care is what’s important. Now, have there been any changes in his behavior lately?
PATIENT: Behavior? Hmm… now that you mention it… he's been a bit… grumpier, I suppose. Snapping at the mailman more than usual. And he used to love his belly rubs, but now he just…tolerates them. He'll let Beatrice do it, but if I try, he gives me a look like I’ve insulted his ancestors. It’s rather rude, if you ask me. Honestly, he’s getting a bit too big for his britches. I’ve told Beatrice he needs to learn some manners, but she just laughs and says he's an “old man” and deserves a bit of leeway. Really. An old man! He’s only eight or nine years old!
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit grumpier, snapping at the mailman, and less enthusiastic about belly rubs, especially from you. That is a change, and it's good you've noticed it. Sometimes these things are just personality quirks, but it can also be a sign of something else going on. Before we proceed with the letter, would you mind if I quickly examine your dog?
PATIENT: Oh. Examine him? Here? Now? I hadn't thought about that. He… he doesn't always like strangers touching him. He can be a bit… protective, you know? He gets very anxious around new people. He might… bark. A lot. And he has rather large teeth. I just don’t want to put him—or you—in a difficult position. Perhaps the letter is enough? I really just need proof for the airline. It’s probably just a formality. I’m not sure why I even bothered coming in.
DOCTOR: You're right to be cautious, Deloris. His comfort is the most important thing. It sounds like a full examination might be stressful for him right now. We can absolutely proceed with the letter without a physical exam. However, if you’re concerned about the behavioral changes, I would recommend a consultation with a veterinary behaviorist. They can help identify any underlying causes and develop a plan to address them. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: Oh, a referral... goodness. That sounds…complicated. Honestly, I think he’s just getting old and a bit…difficult. Beatrice says all dogs go through phases. And he is very spoiled. Perhaps a new chew toy will do the trick. No, thank you for the referral. I think we'll just…manage. Can we just get the letter, then? For the airline. I really just want to get this trip booked. It’s a long story, but… it’s important. Very important. I’d like to get this sorted as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Deloris. We can absolutely get the letter sorted for you right away. I just need a few details to make sure it's accurate. What is your dog’s name, and what is the airline’s specific requirement for the letter?
PATIENT: Oh, his name... ... It's Winston! Yes, Winston. That's it. Winston. And... the airline... let me see... ... Ah, here it is. They just need a statement confirming his identity, age , and that he’s a “suitable companion animal” for travel. Something about temperament. They need it on official letterhead. And a signature, of course. They're very particular. I hope this is enough. It’s all a bit much, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly reasonable. Winston’s name, approximate age, and a statement confirming he’s a suitable companion animal. I can certainly provide that on official letterhead. Here you are. It includes all the details you mentioned, and it’s signed and dated. Please review it to make sure everything is correct. And don’t worry, it’s all perfectly official. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Deloris?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Thank you so much, Doctor. Yes, that looks perfect! Absolutely perfect. Winston will be thrilled… or at least, he won't snap at me for a few minutes. No, I don't think that's all. You've been very helpful. I appreciate your patience. It's just... sometimes things are a bit overwhelming for an old woman, you know? Thank you again, Doctor Lahn. You've been a lifesaver.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Deloris. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future, even if it’s just to discuss Winston’s behavior. Have a safe trip, and give Winston a pat from me. .
