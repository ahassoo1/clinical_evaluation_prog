DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I'm Dr. Polczynski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Rowbottom. Yes. Well, it’s about… well, it’s unpleasant to talk about, frankly. I noticed some… red in the, uh, stool. A couple of times now. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to bother a man. It’s not right, is it? A man shouldn’t be seeing that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom, I understand. It's good you're bringing this up, even if it's uncomfortable. Seeing blood in the stool is definitely something we want to investigate. Just to clarify, you said it’s happened a couple of times now… roughly how long apart were those instances?
PATIENT: Oh, don't you worry, I’m not one to leave things unattended. A man has to take care of himself, you see. It was… let me think… about a week, maybe a little more, between the first time and now. Though, I will say, my memory isn't what it used to be. Not that you would know anything about that. It's these modern diets, I tell you. All processed rubbish. Back in my day…
DOCTOR: Right, about a week apart. And you mentioned changes to your diet… have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits – like the frequency, consistency, or any pain or discomfort when you go?
PATIENT: Consistency? Goodness. You doctors and your fancy words. It’s… normal enough, I suppose. Goes in, comes out. That's how it works. Maybe a little… looser than usual, if I'm honest. And no pain, not exactly. More of a… feeling of being incomplete, if you catch my drift. Like it doesn't quite all come out, you understand? Though, I haven't been paying that close of attention, if you want the truth. A man doesn't need to analyze everything, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. No, you certainly don't need to analyze everything! Just trying to get a clearer picture. "Feeling incomplete" is a helpful way to describe it. And the looseness… has that been a recent change, or something you've experienced on and off for a while?
PATIENT: Recent. Definitely recent. Started around the same time as… well, around the time I noticed the red. I've been eating a bit more fruit, admittedly. Thought it might be a good thing, all the vitamins and such. Apparently not. Modern fruit isn't what it used to be, either. All bred for sweetness, no substance. It's a disaster, I tell you. A complete and utter disaster.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the looseness and the red both started around the same time, and you’ve increased your fruit intake recently. That’s good information. Now, have you noticed any abdominal cramping, bloating, or nausea along with this?
PATIENT: Nausea? No, thankfully not. I had a touch of seasickness once, decades ago, flying over the Pacific. Dreadful experience. This isn't like that at all. Bloating… a little, perhaps. But then again, a man carries a bit of weight, doesn't he? It’s just… normal. Cramping… no, not cramping. Just a general… unsettled feeling, if you must know. Like something isn’t quite right. It's hard to explain. You wouldn’t understand.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you trying to explain, Mr. Rowbottom. “Unsettled” is perfectly fine. And yes, I understand that it can be difficult to put these things into words. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Diagnosed with? Hmph. I’ve lived a long life, young man. I've had the usual bumps and bruises, a few broken bones in my youth. Spent a lot of time in the air, you see. Pressure changes do things to a man. High blood pressure, perhaps, the doctor mentioned something once, years ago. Nothing serious. I don’t take any pills, if that's what you're asking. Never have. A man should rely on his own constitution, not some concoction from a laboratory.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of potentially elevated blood pressure, but no current medications. That's helpful to know. And no other diagnosed conditions?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. I was a pilot, you see. They run you through the wringer before they let you fly a plane. Everything was checked and re-checked. They wouldn’t let a man with a weakness anywhere near the controls. Though, these days… I doubt they check anything properly. Too busy with their computers and their paperwork.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… a tonsillectomy when I was a lad, and I had my appendix out during the war. Nothing else. A man doesn't go under the knife unless absolutely necessary. Too risky. Now, are we getting anywhere with this… this stool business? I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: We are, Mr. Rowbottom. Just trying to get a complete picture. Okay, no major surgeries aside from tonsillectomy and appendectomy. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Goodness. My father was a fisherman, a sturdy sort. Lived to be 90, if you can believe it. My mother… she was a teacher, a gentle woman. She died young, unfortunately. Cancer, I believe. As for anyone else… uncles, aunts… mostly they all just… lived and died. Nothing remarkable. No one prone to… stomach troubles, if that's what you're asking. Though, my cousin Edgar was always a bit… delicate.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with cancer, cousin with general health issues. And finally, let me ask about any allergies you have. Any medications, foods, or anything else that you know you’re allergic to?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. A man needs his nourishment, you see. Can't be picky. Though, I always did find shellfish a bit… unsettling. Not an allergy, mind you. Just a general distaste. It’s a texture thing, really. Now, is this all? I’m starting to feel rather… drained. All this reminiscing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom, thank you for all of that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I think it would be best to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and then I’d like to do a rectal exam. It's standard procedure when investigating blood in the stool. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A what exam? Absolutely not. Young man, I've lived a long life, and I've never… I will not be subjected to such an indignity. No. Absolutely not. I came here to talk about my stool, not to… to have you poking around down there! I think I’ve said enough. Perhaps I should seek a second opinion.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Rowbottom, and I certainly respect your wishes. A rectal exam is often helpful in these situations to identify the source of the bleeding, but it is absolutely not required if you are unwilling. Given your reluctance, and without a physical exam, it's difficult to determine the cause of the blood in your stool. However, based on what you've told me—the recent onset of looser stools, the red color, and increased fruit intake—it could potentially be a minor issue like hemorrhoids or a temporary digestive upset. But given your age and the presence of bleeding, it’s important to rule out more serious possibilities. I strongly recommend a colonoscopy to investigate this further. This involves a camera examination of your colon, which can identify any abnormalities. I can refer you to a gastroenterologist who specializes in this procedure. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A… colonoscopy? Sounds… invasive. And expensive, I imagine. I’ve never had anything like that done. I suppose… I suppose if you think it's necessary. But I don't want any unnecessary poking and prodding, mind you. And I want a second opinion first. I'll think about it. But no promises. And I still maintain that it's probably just something I ate. Modern food, you know. It’s a disaster, I tell you. A complete and utter disaster.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. A second opinion is always a good idea. I’ll write a referral for you to see Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected gastroenterologist in the area. She can discuss the pros and cons of a colonoscopy with you and help you make an informed decision. Here's the referral information. In the meantime, if you notice any significant changes – increased bleeding, severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or weakness – please go to the emergency room immediately. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment here in a few weeks to discuss your progress and any findings from Dr. Vance. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Emergency room… goodness. I’d rather not. And a follow-up appointment… well, we’ll see. I’m not one for making promises. But thank you, young man. I suppose. You’ve been… thorough. Though, I still think I just need to lay off the fruit. And perhaps a bit more… sensible food. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I’ve wasted enough of my time here today.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
