DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I am Dr. Bradlee Paraskevopoulos. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Well, I have been… how you say… wheezing. It makes it hard to breathe sometimes. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Not sure exactly when.
DOCTOR: Wheezing, you say. And difficulty breathing. A few weeks ago…right. It's often difficult to pinpoint the exact start date with these things. Can you describe the wheezing for me?
PATIENT: Hmm. It is… a whistling sound, when I breathe. Especially when I try to take a deep breath. It is worse when I walk, or do anything… active. Like when I am in the garden. I like to work in my garden, you see. But then I have to stop and rest. It makes me tired.
DOCTOR: A whistling sound, particularly with exertion. I see. And this occurs when you are, as you mentioned, engaged in activity such as gardening. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Some days are better than others. Today it is… not so bad. But yesterday, I had to stop many times. Even walking to the mailbox was hard. It worries me a little. I used to be very strong, you know. I was an… athletic trainer. For many years.
DOCTOR: An athletic trainer, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. For the school. Many years. Before… before my divorce. It was good work. I helped the young people. Now… well, now I mostly garden. And try not to wheeze too much.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anything, to your knowledge, triggered these episodes of wheezing?
PATIENT: Triggered? Hmm. That is a good question. I don't think so. Not that I know of. Sometimes it seems worse when the air is… damp. Or maybe when there are a lot of flowers blooming? I have many roses. Beautiful roses. But it happens even when it's dry, too. I am not sure.
DOCTOR: Roses, you say. And damp air. It could be related to allergies, although it's not always straightforward. Now, let's delve into a bit more detail about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, or any other respiratory conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have been very healthy, most of my life. Just… this wheezing. I did have the… the flu, maybe two years ago? It was bad, but I recovered. I did not go to the doctor for it, though. Just rested and drank a lot of tea. My mother always said tea cures everything.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you ever had any problems with…heart conditions?
PATIENT: Heart conditions? No, never. My heart is strong. I used to run many miles, you know. For the school teams. Always very healthy. But… my mother, she had some problems with her heart, when she was very old. But I don't think I inherited that. I worry about breathing, not my heart.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to your family history. Aside from your mother’s heart condition, were there any other significant medical issues among your close relatives?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question. My father, he had… high blood pressure, I think. And my sister, she had… problems with her stomach. But nothing with the lungs, or breathing. Mostly… old age things. They lived a long time, both of them. I think that is all. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't like to take pills, if I can help it. Just tea. And sometimes a little honey for my throat. My mother always said honey is good for everything. I try to be natural.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kilton. Now, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. I will listen to your lungs, check your heart rate, and take your blood pressure. It's standard procedure, of course. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… please be gentle. My bones are not as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please take a deep breath for me…and exhale slowly. I am hearing some wheezing, as you described, bilaterally. And some diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes. Blood pressure is 140/90. Heart rate is 88 and regular. I'm also noting a slight…decrease in oxygen saturation. 92%. It's not critically low, but it is something we should address.
PATIENT: Oh. 92? Is that bad, Doctor? I don't understand all these numbers. What does that mean? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It means your oxygen level is slightly lower than optimal. It's not an immediate emergency, but it does indicate some compromise in your respiratory function. We need to determine the cause. Given your history and the examination findings, several possibilities exist. It could be early bronchitis, a mild form of asthma triggered by environmental factors, or even… something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. The X-ray will help us rule out any underlying lung issues, and the blood count will check for signs of infection. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Oh dear. Is that… is that safe, Doctor? I have heard things… about those machines. And a blood count… will that hurt? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, the amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is minimal. It's a standard diagnostic procedure and the benefits far outweigh the risks. We take every precaution to minimize exposure. As for the blood count, it involves a small needle prick. It’s a quick procedure, and honestly, barely noticeable for most people. It’s necessary to rule out more serious conditions. We need to be thorough. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Oh… very well, Doctor. If you think it is necessary. I trust your judgement. But please… be gentle with the needle. And tell me if it will hurt. I don't like pain.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and escort you to radiology for the X-ray. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of an albuterol inhaler. It will help open up your airways and ease your breathing. It's a standard treatment for wheezing and should provide some immediate relief. Use it as directed, and if your symptoms worsen, or you experience any difficulty breathing, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I told you, I don't take anything. Just tea. I have never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. But… I do sometimes get a little dizzy when I stand up too quickly. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: That's orthostatic hypotension, Mrs. Kilton. It's common in older adults. Just rise slowly from a sitting or lying position. It's not directly related to the wheezing, but it’s something to be mindful of. Here is the prescription for the albuterol inhaler. The nurse will review the instructions with you. We will follow up once the lab results are available. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity, stay hydrated, and rest. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. Thank you for your help. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I hope the inhaler works. It sounds…complicated.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will be with you shortly. .
PATIENT: .
