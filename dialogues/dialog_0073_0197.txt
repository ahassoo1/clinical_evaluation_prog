DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarrotta. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I need a card so I can keep driving folks around. A ride-share thing, you know? They require a medical check-up now, and I figured I better get it done. I'm San, by the way. Please, call me San.
DOCTOR: Right. A commercial driver’s license… or something related. Yes, I understand. San. Very well. It's... prudent they require a check-up. We’ll need to go through a standard examination. Mostly just to be thorough. Let’s start with the basics. Do you have any current medical problems that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical problems… Let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that’s never bothered me. And I take a little something for my blood pressure, but it's under control, the doctor says. Other than that… not really. I’m pretty healthy for my age, if I do say so myself. I still work, you know? Logging equipment is hard work.
DOCTOR: Logging equipment… Yes, that is physically demanding. Alright, so gallbladder removal, and you're on medication for hypertension – blood pressure. Do you happen to know which medication you're taking, and what the dosage is?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the name… it’s on the bottle, of course. Let me see… …ah! Here we are. It’s Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, once a day. Usually in the morning, with my coffee. I don’t always remember which day I took it, but I take it every day, I promise. My daughter helps me keep track sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Good. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything, and I've never had a reaction to any medicine. I used to worry about bee stings, living in the country, but I haven’t been stung in years. Honestly, I'm more afraid of spiders. But that's not a medical thing, is it?
DOCTOR: No, arachnophobia is… not typically a medical concern we address in a driver's physical. We’re focused on things that could impact your ability to operate a vehicle safely. Now, family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Of course. Safe driving. Yes. My mother… she had diabetes, later in life. And her heart wasn’t strong. My father… he was healthy as a horse, always working. No problems there. My brother had some trouble with his eyesight, but I seem to be okay. I still read the newspaper every day.
DOCTOR: Diabetes in your mother, and cardiovascular issues. Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What exactly do you mean by that? I don’t really understand. Do you want to know if I go to church? Because I used to… but not so much anymore.
DOCTOR: No, not church attendance, San. I’m referring to… habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh! Habits. Well, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband tried, once, but I wouldn’t let him in the house if he did. And I certainly don't drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then. Nothing heavy. I need a clear head for the logging work, you know. And for driving, of course.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. Just standard things: blood pressure, heart and lung sounds, reflexes, vision… and a quick neurological check. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Physical exam. Sounds good. I always get a little nervous when the doctor wraps that thing around my arm. It feels so tight! Just try to be quick, please. I have a delivery to make this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your vision. Can you read this chart over there?
PATIENT: Oh. That's… a little far away. I used to have such good eyesight. Let me try… uh… is that an E? No… a T? Oh dear. It's all blurry. I think I need my glasses for this. I have them in my purse, somewhere…
DOCTOR: Yes, it appears you are having difficulty with the standard vision test. Do you typically wear glasses or contacts for driving?
PATIENT: Yes, of course I do! I can't see a thing without them! I just… I forgot them. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. I was so worried about remembering the medication name… Ah! That's much better. Can you read it now?
DOCTOR: Yes, with your glasses, your vision is 20/30 in both eyes. That’s… acceptable, but not optimal. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Reflexes. I always feel silly when they do that tapping thing. Just try not to hit me too hard, please.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Your gait appears steady. Now, to complete the exam, I need to ask about any current symptoms you may be experiencing. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, or changes in your cognitive function?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No chest pain, no shortness of breath. I get a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up too quickly, but that's been happening for years. Headaches… not really. And my… cognitive function? What does that mean? I sometimes forget where I put my keys, but isn't that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, occasional forgetfulness is common. But given your age and the requirements for a commercial driver’s license, we need to be thorough. It's important to rule out anything significant. Based on this exam, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, your reflexes are diminished, and your vision, while corrected, is not optimal. I recommend you follow up with your primary care physician to address your blood pressure. And while I don’t see any immediate disqualifying conditions, I’m going to require a formal neurological evaluation, just to be certain. I'll write you a referral.
PATIENT: A neurological evaluation? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is that going to take a long time? And will it cost a lot of money? I just need a little card to keep driving, I don’t want all this fuss!
DOCTOR: It’s a standard precaution, San. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a problem. It’s simply to ensure you meet the safety requirements for operating a vehicle. The cost will depend on your insurance coverage. I'm also going to recommend a repeat blood pressure check in one week. I’ll print out a summary of today's exam and the referrals. And I'll write a note advising you to limit your driving until you’ve completed these evaluations. Safety is paramount, San. It’s not just about you; it’s about the safety of others on the road. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Limit my driving…? Oh, this is just awful. Well… I suppose I have to do what I have to do. Is there any way to… speed things up? I have a lot of deliveries to make. And this is going to be so inconvenient. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… a lot of worry. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’ll go make some phone calls.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please schedule the neurological evaluation as soon as possible. And do prioritize your blood pressure check. Safety first, San. Have a good day. .
