DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 62 years of age. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, please, call me Sherion. It’s nice to meet you. Well, I been havin’ some pain in my chest. It’s… not good. Been worryin’ me a little.
DOCTOR: Chest pain, you say. Very well, Sherion. Can you describe this pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s hard to say. It’s not… sharp, you know? More like a… heavy feelin’. Like somethin’ is sittin’ on my chest. Sometimes it goes into my arm too, the left one. It comes and goes, not all the time. When I walk a little too fast, it gets worse. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A heavy feeling… radiating to the left arm… and exacerbated by exertion. Yes, that provides some clarity. Now, how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… maybe a month ago? A little over a month, I think. At first, it was just when I was climbin’ the stairs, but now… it seems to be happenin’ more easily. Even just walkin’ to the mailbox. It's a little scary, to be honest. I don’t want to be a bother, but… it’s makin’ me nervous.
DOCTOR: A gradual onset, worsening over a month… I understand your concern, Sherion. Now, do you experience any other symptoms with this chest discomfort?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… Sometimes I get a little short of breath when it happens. Not a lot, but I notice it. And… sometimes I feel kinda sweaty, even when it’s not hot. Not always, though. Oh! And my jaw feels a little tight sometimes, on the left side. Is that… is that normal? I don't know if that's part of it.
DOCTOR: Shortness of breath, diaphoresis… and jaw discomfort. Hmm. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: High… high what now? Oh, you mean… problems with the blood? My husband, he had high blood pressure, but I never did. The doctor always said I was good. Cholesterol… I don’t even know what that is. And diabetes? No, never. I eat pretty healthy, you know? Mostly rice and beans. And some chicken. I think. I don't remember the doctor ever sayin’ nothin’ about those things.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll need to confirm that. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh dear. Let me think… My mother, she passed away when she was pretty old, from… just wearin’ out, I guess. My father, he had a bad heart, I think. He always complained about it. He died when I was young, though. And my brother… he’s still alive, but he’s not very healthy. He smokes a lot. Does that help? It's hard to remember everything, you know. So long ago.
DOCTOR: Cardiac history in your father… smoking history in your brother. And you, Sherion, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life! Makes me cough just thinkin' about it. And I don't drink. Not even a little wine. My husband used to have a beer now and then, but he stopped a long time ago. We both just like water. Plain water is good enough for us.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. I had a little rash once from a cream, but that was a long time ago. Nothing serious. I haven’t taken much medicine in my life. Just… for a headache now and then. And some cough syrup when I was sick. But never anything that made me feel bad. I’m pretty sure I don’t have any allergies. Do you need me to think harder?
DOCTOR: No, that is sufficient for now. I am going to need to perform a physical examination, Sherion. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’ll need you to remove your shirt and bra, and I’ll provide a gown.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Take off my shirt? Hmm… Alright. Is it cold in here? I didn’t bring a sweater. But I can do that, I guess. Just let me know when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: It is adequately temperate, Sherion. I will listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your chest, and check your blood pressure and pulse. Please take a deep breath… and exhale slowly. Your heart rate is slightly elevated… and I detect a mild murmur. Lungs are clear bilaterally, though you are exhibiting slightly labored breathing. Blood pressure is 145 over 90. No tenderness to palpation. Now, I'm going to need to obtain an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart rhythm. It's a simple, painless test.
PATIENT: EKG… that sounds scary. Is somethin’ wrong, Doctor? My heart sounds bad? My breathing is bad? I'm gettin' a little nervous again. Is it somethin’ serious? Please tell me it’s not serious.
DOCTOR: Do not be alarmed, Sherion. An EKG is a precautionary measure. It simply provides more information. I am not prepared to make any definitive pronouncements at this stage. Now, remain still, and breathe normally. Hmm… The EKG reveals some minor ST-segment depression. This, coupled with your symptoms and blood pressure reading, is… concerning. I am going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and cardiac enzymes. We will also need a chest X-ray. I will also need to refer you to a cardiologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. This is standard procedure, Sherion. It does not necessarily indicate a catastrophic event.
PATIENT: Catastrophic? Oh dear. Blood work… X-rays… cardiologist… That sounds like a lot, Doctor. Is it… is it my heart? Am I gonna need… surgery? I don’t want surgery! I just want to know what’s wrong with me, and if it’s somethin’ I can fix. Is it somethin’ I ate? I’ve been feelin’ a little stressed lately, too, with my grandson… he’s havin’ some trouble in school. Could that be it? Please tell me it's just stress.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chelberg, please. Allow me to explain. Your symptoms—chest pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, elevated blood pressure, and the EKG findings—suggest the possibility of angina, or even a myocardial infarction. We must rule out any serious cardiac event. Stress can certainly exacerbate symptoms, but it is unlikely to be the sole cause. The blood work and X-ray will provide further information, and the cardiologist will determine the appropriate course of action. I understand your anxiety, but jumping to conclusions will not assist us. I will order these tests immediately, and a nurse will schedule the cardiology appointment. In the meantime, I will prescribe a low-dose aspirin to help prevent blood clots and a nitroglycerin tablet to be taken sublingually if you experience chest pain. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Sub… sublin… what now? Under the tongue? Oh, goodness. All this… aspirin… under the tongue… cardiologist… It’s too much. I… I think I need to sit down. My head is spinning. Just… can you just tell me if I’m gonna be okay? That’s all I want to know. Am I gonna be okay, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chelberg, I cannot provide you with a definitive answer at this juncture. It would be irresponsible of me to do so without a complete workup. The nitroglycerin is to be placed under your tongue if you experience chest pain. It will help to dilate your blood vessels. The purpose of all these tests is to determine if you are okay. Now, please, try to remain calm. A nurse will be with you shortly to draw blood and explain the process. We are taking all the necessary steps to ensure your well-being. I will be consulting with a colleague on this case as well. Some patients… simply impossible.
