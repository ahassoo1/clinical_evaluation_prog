DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… the flushing. My face gets very red. Happens sometimes. Not all the time, you see. It’s… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: “Sometimes,” you say. Right. And how long has this “sometimes” been going on?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Maybe… six months? No, more. Almost a year, I think. Yes, almost a year now. It started… after my wife, you see. Everything felt… different then. But the red face… that came a little later. Not right away.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, almost a year. And you feel it’s related to…stress, perhaps?
PATIENT: Stress… yes. Maybe. Everything is different. I don’t… I don’t go out much anymore. Just stay home. Read. Cook. It's quiet. I used to… we used to go to dances, you see. With my wife. Now… it’s just me. It’s hard to explain. But yes, maybe the stress. It feels… warm, when my face flushes. Very warm.
DOCTOR: Warm, alright. And does anything specifically trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger? Like… make it happen? Hmm. Not always. Sometimes it just… comes. But… if I talk to people, maybe. Especially if I have to… explain things. Or if they look at me for too long. I don't know. It's silly, I guess. I get very shy. And then my face… gets warm. It's worse when it's hot outside, too. Like today.
DOCTOR: “Silly” is not a medical term, Mr. Withycombe. It sounds like there are multiple factors involved here. Heat definitely can be a trigger for flushing, as can anxiety. Do you experience any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… sometimes my heart beats a little fast. Not like… racing, but faster. And… my hands get a little shaky. Not all the time, just when the face is very red. And… I feel a little dizzy sometimes. But that could be… just getting old, maybe. I don't know. I haven't told anyone about this before. It feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. Faster heartbeat, shaky hands, and dizziness along with the flushing. Those are certainly things we need to consider. Have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? No, not really. I cook the same things. Mostly Indian food. Curry, rice, lentils… I try to eat healthy. My wife… she always said I needed to eat more vegetables. I'm trying. But not much change, really. I drink tea, sometimes. Black tea. Not much coffee. I don't drink… anything else, you see. Never have.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. I don't like taking pills. Never have. I try to… fix things myself, you see. Read books. Try to relax. But… it doesn’t always help. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. It’s… expensive. And I didn’t want to bother anyone with just a red face. But it’s been happening more, lately. That’s why I came.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, and you've been avoiding the doctor. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Then I'll take a look at your skin. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… try to be quick, please? I don’t like being touched much. It makes me… nervous. And then my face gets… you know. But I’ll try. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… a relief to finally talk about this.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could just sit back and relax as much as possible. I’ll be as efficient as I can. Heart rate is a little elevated, as you mentioned. Blood pressure is 140/90… a bit on the higher side. Lungs sound clear. Skin is warm and slightly flushed, even at baseline. No visible rashes or lesions. I’m going to check your pulse in your wrists. Pulse is regular but a bit rapid. Based on what you’ve told me and this initial exam, it could be rosacea, or something related to anxiety and stress. But we need to rule out other causes. I’d like to order some blood work… just to be thorough. We'll check your thyroid levels, and do a basic metabolic panel. And perhaps an EKG, just to be safe. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an EKG? That sounds… complicated. And expensive. I don't have insurance, you see. I’m… not sure I can afford all that. But… if it will help… I guess. Can we… do it slowly? Maybe just the blood work first? I need to think about the EKG. And… how much will it cost? I need to know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Withycombe, I understand your concerns about cost. We can certainly start with just the blood work. It’s essential to get a baseline understanding of your overall health. The EKG is simply a precautionary measure, given your reports of a racing heart. Let me see… the blood work will be approximately $150. We can see if the clinic offers a payment plan, or perhaps we can identify a local lab with lower rates. I’ll have the receptionist look into that for you. In the meantime, I’d like you to keep a detailed log of when these episodes occur. What were you doing?
PATIENT: A log? Like… writing it down? What exactly should I write? And… $150? That’s… a lot. I’ll have to think about it. Maybe… my daughter can help. She lives in another state, but… she might be able to send some money. A log… Okay. I can try to write things down. But I don’t know what’s important. Should I write what I ate? Or how I felt? Or… what people were saying? This is complicated, Doctor. Really complicated. It just feels like my face gets hot sometimes, you see. That’s all. But… I'll try to write things down. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's keep it simple. Write down the date and time of each episode. What you were doing immediately before it started, what you were feeling—anxious, stressed, embarrassed—and if anything specific triggered it. What you ate is less important at this stage. I will have the receptionist give you a form with some prompts, and our financial counselor's contact information. Perhaps they can discuss payment options with you. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical conditions, Mr. Withycombe. I understand your concerns, but delaying a diagnosis could be detrimental. We'll start with the blood work, and we’ll reassess the need for an EKG once we have the results. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for… not laughing. It feels silly, you know? Explaining all this. But… you were very patient. And I’ll try to write things down. And I’ll talk to my daughter. Maybe she can help with the money. I think… that’s all. I should probably go now, though. Before my face gets too red. Thank you again. And… I’ll see the receptionist on my way out.
DOCTOR: Very well. The receptionist will guide you through the necessary paperwork. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions. Patient anxious and hesitant. Financial concerns present. Will follow up pending blood work results.
