DOCTOR: Hi Helaina, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, to be honest, a friend suggested I come talk about… something to help prevent HIV. She said there’s a pill you can take, even if you’re just… you know… careful. I don’t really understand it all, but I figured it couldn’t hurt to ask. I'm Helaina, by the way.
DOCTOR: It’s great you’re being proactive about your health, Helaina. And you’re right, it’s always good to ask questions. Your friend is likely referring to PrEP – Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis. It’s a medication taken to prevent HIV infection. It's a really good option for folks who are at risk, even if they are being careful. Before we get into specifics, could you tell me a little bit about why you’re considering PrEP?
PATIENT: Okay, PrEP. Good. That’s what she said. Why… well, it’s complicated. I’ve been… dating. And it’s not always easy to know everything about the people you’re with, you know? Especially these days. I’m not saying anyone’s untrustworthy, but… I’d just feel safer. I’m single, no kids, and… honestly? I just want peace of mind. It's been a while since I've felt that, I guess. Is that enough of an answer?
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly good answer, Helaina. It’s very responsible of you to think about this. It sounds like you’re prioritizing your health and well-being, and that’s excellent. To make sure PrEP is a good fit for you, I need to ask a few more questions. First, have you ever been tested for HIV?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Several times, actually. The last time was… let me think… March of last year, I believe. It was at a clinic downtown. Everything came back negative, thankfully. I have all the paperwork somewhere at home, if you need it. I’m very careful about getting tested regularly, even before my friend mentioned this pill. Just to be sure, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s great to hear, Helaina. Regular testing is fantastic. Let me just pull up your records to confirm… Ah, yes, I see your results from March of last year – negative, as you said. Excellent. Now, outside of HIV, are you generally in good health?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, it’s just old age, I guess. And my blood pressure runs a little high sometimes, but I’m trying to watch my salt intake. Otherwise, I walk every day, I eat pretty well… nothing fancy, just normal food. I had my yearly check-up in January and the doctor said everything was okay. I take Medicare, so they keep a close eye on things, too. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. So, arthritis in your knees, managed with lifestyle, and monitored blood pressure. That’s good to know. And yes, Medicare does a thorough job with preventative care. Do you take any medications regularly – prescription or over-the-counter – for anything other than your blood pressure or arthritis?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, honestly. And sometimes ibuprofen for my knees if they’re really bothering me. That’s it. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can, you know? My mother always said pills are just trouble waiting to happen. I know that’s silly, but… I try to stick to natural remedies whenever possible. Does that count as an answer? I hope I'm not being difficult.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Helaina. You’re not being difficult at all. It’s good to be mindful of what you’re putting into your body. Multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed – that’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or latex?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t think so. I used to be allergic to penicillin when I was a child, but I haven’t had a reaction in decades. I haven't taken it in… oh, goodness, over 40 years. And no food allergies, thankfully. I love to cook, so that would be a disaster! No latex allergies either. I've never had any trouble with condoms or gloves. Is there anything else you need to know? I just want to get this over with quickly, if that’s okay. My knees are starting to ache.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, we can move along. No known allergies, that’s good. And I understand about your knees – we'll try to be quick. Okay, just a few more questions before we talk about PrEP itself. I like to ask about social history—things like tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and recreational drug use. Do you currently use tobacco or vape?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never. My father smoked, and it was… not a pleasant experience. I can’t stand the smell of it. And no vaping either. I have enough trouble breathing with my knees, thank you very much. I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a month, if that. And definitely no recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I'm a pretty boring person, I guess. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Not boring at all, Helaina. Responsible and health-conscious, that's what you are. That’s excellent. And no tobacco, occasional wine, no recreational drugs - that’s great to hear. One last question before we move on to the practicalities of PrEP. Are you sexually active currently?
PATIENT: Well… yes. I am. It’s… casual, mostly. Dating, you know? I haven’t found anyone I want to settle down with yet. It’s not… regular, but it’s consistent enough that I thought it was best to be safe. I have a couple of… friends I see. That's probably enough information, right? I don't really like talking about this.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Helaina. You’ve given me enough information. It sounds like you are sexually active with casual partners, and you're being thoughtful about protecting yourself, which is commendable. Okay, now let’s talk about PrEP. It’s a pill you take daily, and it’s very effective at preventing HIV if taken consistently. The medication is called Biktarvy. It's generally very well tolerated, but there can be some side effects, like nausea or fatigue, in some people. Before starting, we’d need to do some bloodwork to make sure you're a good candidate and to check your kidney function. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Bloodwork is fine. I get bloodwork all the time with Medicare, so I’m used to it. What kind of side effects are we talking about? Nausea and fatigue… those don't sound very nice. And how often do people get them? I really don’t want to feel sick all the time. I have enough trouble with my knees as it is. Are there… alternatives? Is there anything else I can do to protect myself besides a pill?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Helaina. The good news is that most people tolerate Biktarvy very well, and serious side effects are rare. Nausea and fatigue are the most common, and they usually subside within the first few weeks as your body adjusts. It’s not common to feel sick all the time – many people experience no side effects at all. Regarding alternatives, the other main method of preventing HIV is using condoms consistently and correctly. However, condoms aren't foolproof, and they require consistent use. There's also an injection available, called Apretude, but it requires monthly injections and isn’t suitable for everyone. We can discuss those options further if you’d like. Before we make any decisions, let’s get that bloodwork done to see if PrEP is a good fit for you. It will also give us a baseline to monitor your health if you do decide to start. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, let's do the bloodwork. I want to get this over with. And I think… I think I'd rather try the pill if it's mostly well-tolerated. I'm just not very good at remembering things. Condoms… well, let's just say I'm better off with something I can take every day. But I'd like to know what that injection is about, just in case. So, bloodwork, pill information, and then injection information. Is that correct? And… how long will the bloodwork take? I have an appointment with my podiatrist at 3:00 pm.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Bloodwork, pill information, and then we’ll discuss the injection. The bloodwork shouldn't take too long, maybe 15-20 minutes. We have a lab right downstairs, and they’re usually very quick. I’ll write you a lab order now. After the results come back—usually within a couple of days—we can schedule a follow-up to discuss them and, if everything looks good, start you on Biktarvy. Does that work with your schedule?
PATIENT: Yes, that works perfectly. Thank you, Doctor. That’s… a relief. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And getting it done quickly. I’m glad I came. Okay, so bloodwork downstairs, and then I’ll call to schedule a follow-up? Do I need to fast for this bloodwork, or anything like that? My knees are really aching now, so I should probably get moving.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Helaina. I’m glad I could help. And yes, you do need to fast for 8 hours before the bloodwork. So, no food or drinks other than water. And yes, just call to schedule a follow-up appointment once you’ve had the bloodwork done. My nurse will be happy to assist you. Is there anything else I can do for you today, or are you all set?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate it. I should probably go lie down now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Helaina. Get some rest and take care of those knees. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day. .
