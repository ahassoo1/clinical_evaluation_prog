DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 51 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right, 51. Well, it’s a bit strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and I’ve been…yellowish, I guess you’d say? It started after I ate some fava beans. I love them, usually, but this time… not so good.
DOCTOR: Fava beans, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. I had them last week, and then a few days after that’s when I started feeling weak, and my wife pointed out I looked… unwell. Like my skin was a bit yellow. I didn't think much of it at first, but then it kept getting worse. I haven’t felt this tired in years, and it's making it hard to even get out of bed some days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Haggar. And just to clarify, this is a new symptom, the fatigue and the yellowing of the skin?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely new. I mean, I get tired sometimes, like anyone does, but this is…different. It’s a heavy tiredness. And the yellowing, that just started after the beans. I haven't had any other symptoms, not that I've noticed. No fever, no stomach pain, nothing like that. Just… weak and yellow. It's a little scary, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. And you said you love fava beans, and this is the first time you’ve experienced this reaction?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I’ve been eating them for years, since I was a little girl back in Romania, actually. My grandmother used to grow them. Never had a problem before. It's just…this time was different. I thought maybe it was a bad batch, but… I don’t know. I just wanted to get checked out, to be safe. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Haggar, fava beans can sometimes be associated with a condition called G6PD deficiency. It’s a genetic condition, and it can cause a reaction when someone eats certain foods, like fava beans. It causes the red blood cells to break down prematurely. But we need to run some tests to confirm if that’s what’s going on. First, I’d like to get a complete blood count and a few other liver function tests. And I’m going to need a detailed medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any known allergies, and what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, G6PD deficiency… I’ve never heard of that. Okay, tests sound good. I mean, whatever you think is best. Allergies… not really. I have a little sensitivity to dust, but nothing I take medicine for. And medications… let me think. I take a low dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure, that's it. And sometimes just ibuprofen for a headache. That’s all. Is that something I should stop taking before the tests, the ibuprofen?
DOCTOR: Good, good. No, you can continue taking the lisinopril as prescribed. The ibuprofen shouldn’t interfere with the tests, but it’s best to avoid it if you don’t need it before we get the results. Now, let’s go over your medical history a bit more thoroughly. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really, no. When I was a child, back in Romania, I had a really bad case of the flu, but I didn't need to be in the hospital. My mother took care of me at home. And, oh! Years ago, maybe fifteen years ago, I had my gallbladder removed, but it was a pretty routine surgery and I recovered quickly. Other than that, I’ve been pretty healthy, honestly. I try to eat well and get some exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, a cholecystectomy fifteen years ago. That’s good to know. And just to be thorough, do you have any family history of…well, any medical conditions at all?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, like me, but she lived to be 85, so it didn’t seem to bother her too much. My father… he had some heart trouble later in life, but I don't remember the specifics, to be honest. We weren't very close, and we didn’t talk much about health things. As far as anything serious… not that I know of. My grandmother was very healthy, always working in her garden. I think that kept her going! I don't think there was much illness on my mother’s side. Does that help? It’s hard to remember things sometimes, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, Ms. Haggar. Don't worry about remembering every detail. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I want to palpate your abdomen. And I'll check your skin color more closely. This will give me a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I'm a little worried, but I’m glad I came in. Go ahead. I'll just sit here and try to relax.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. And yes, your skin is definitely exhibiting jaundice – that’s the yellowing we discussed. I’m going to order those blood tests now. We need to check your liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and a G6PD enzyme level to rule out a deficiency. I'll also order a complete blood count. The lab technician will draw blood from your arm. Do you have any history of fainting or feeling lightheaded when having blood drawn?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve had blood work done many times, and I’ve never had any problems. I usually feel a little pinch, but that’s all. I don’t mind at all. So, we’re just waiting for the results of those tests now? How long will that take, roughly? I'm a bit anxious about it, to be honest, but I understand it takes time.
DOCTOR: Yes, we’re waiting on the results. Typically, it takes about 24 to 48 hours for the lab to process everything and send the results back to me. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I want you to avoid fava beans and any other foods that might cause a reaction. Also, if you notice any changes in your condition – like increased fatigue, dark urine, or pale stools – please contact my office immediately. We need to rule out any serious liver issues. We'll proceed cautiously, Ms. Haggar. Let’s not jump to any conclusions until we have the results. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I’ll avoid the beans, and I’ll watch for those symptoms you mentioned. I’ll just… wait for the call. Thank you very much for your time, and for not dismissing my concerns. It's good to know someone is taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: You are welcome, Ms. Haggar. We always take your concerns seriously. My nurse will be in touch. Have a good day.
