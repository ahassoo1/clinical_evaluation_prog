DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Uh, it’s this ringing in my ears. It’s been… annoying me for a bit now. It's kinda hard to explain, but it's just there, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears. That can be quite disruptive. "A bit now" – can you give me a sense of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe a couple of months now? It started quietly, and I thought it would go away on its own, but it hasn't. It comes and goes, but it's definitely still there more often than not.
DOCTOR: Alright, a couple of months. And it’s intermittent, meaning it doesn’t happen all the time. Is it in one ear, both ears, or does it feel like it’s inside your head?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my right ear, I think. Sometimes I feel it a little bit in the left, but not as strong. And yeah, it doesn't feel inside my head exactly... more like... in the ear itself, you know? It's hard to describe.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be tricky to pinpoint. And you said it started quietly and hasn’t gone away. Has anything specific happened around the time it started?
PATIENT: Let me think… around that time, yeah… I did go to a pretty loud concert. A band I like came through, and it was packed. I was right up front, so it was really loud. Could be that? I didn't really think much of it at the time.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful information. A loud concert is definitely a potential cause. Okay, let's talk a little more about the ringing itself. What does it sound like?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not like a buzzing, exactly. More of a… high-pitched whine, I guess? Sometimes it’s just a steady ring. It changes, really. It's not a loud ring, but it's constant enough to be annoying, you know? Like when you have that ringing after going to a concert, but it just… hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: Okay, a high-pitched whine, sometimes a steady ring, similar to what you experience after a concert. Good. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. When it’s really quiet, it’s worse. Like, when I’m trying to sleep, or if I’m in a quiet room. And… loud noises kinda mask it, I guess? If there's music or TV on, I don’t notice it as much.
DOCTOR: Okay, quiet environments exacerbate it, louder environments mask it. That’s consistent with what we’re thinking. Have you experienced any hearing loss, dizziness, or any pain in your ears?
PATIENT: No pain, thankfully. And no dizziness. I think my hearing is okay… but maybe a little bit muffled sometimes? It's hard to tell. I haven't really noticed anything major, just… a slight fuzziness, maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain or dizziness, potentially slight muffled hearing. Okay, let’s do a quick ear exam and a basic hearing test to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good, Doc. Whatever you think is best. I just wanna get this sorted if I can.
DOCTOR: Great. Please have a seat, and I’ll take a look. Okay, your ear drums look perfectly normal, no signs of infection. And your basic hearing tests are normal – meaning sound seems to be conducting normally. It’s unlikely you have a blockage or a major hearing loss. This is leaning towards tinnitus.
PATIENT: Tinnitus… is that… serious? Like, am I going deaf? Sorry, I'm just a little worried.
DOCTOR: That’s a very understandable concern, Jaylyne. Tinnitus itself isn’t usually a sign of immediate deafness, but it can be associated with hearing loss. In your case, the exam doesn’t suggest a major hearing loss, which is reassuring. Tinnitus is essentially the perception of sound when no external sound is present. It can be caused by a lot of things – noise exposure like you mentioned, stress, even certain medications. It’s more of a symptom, really, than a disease. Given your history of noise exposure, and the normal exam, it sounds like you likely have noise-induced tinnitus. The good news is, it’s often manageable.
PATIENT: Okay… manageable. That's… good to hear. What does "manageable" actually mean though? Like, is there anything I can do about it?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. There are several approaches. Since it seems to be triggered by quiet environments and worsened by stress, we can focus on those areas. First, we can try sound therapy. This involves using background noise – like a fan, white noise machine, or even low-volume music – to help mask the tinnitus and reduce your perception of it. There are apps for that, too. Second, stress management techniques – things like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga – can be very helpful. Stress often exacerbates tinnitus. Third, avoid further noise exposure if possible. If you attend loud events, wear earplugs. I’m going to write you a prescription for a trial of a tinnitus retraining therapy app, and I'll give you some resources on stress management techniques. We can also discuss referral to an audiologist for more comprehensive hearing testing if it doesn't improve, or if it worsens. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. An app and some stress stuff… I can definitely try that. I think I got some earplugs somewhere, too, from when I was doing some work around the house. So, it’s not gonna just… go away on its own? I mean, is there a chance it could get better even without doing anything?
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say definitively if it will go away on its own, Jaylyne. Sometimes tinnitus does resolve spontaneously, but in many cases, it’s persistent. That’s why we’re focusing on management – to reduce your awareness of it and minimize its impact on your quality of life. The app and stress management techniques can help retrain your brain to filter out the tinnitus sound, and potentially reduce its severity over time. It takes commitment, but it can be very effective. We’ll check in on your progress in a month, and if it’s not improving, we can discuss further options like the audiologist referral. Here's a summary of our discussion, including the app information and stress management resources. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's pretty much everything. Thank you, Doc. You've put my mind a bit at ease, at least.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaylyne. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Take care, and I’ll see you in a month.
