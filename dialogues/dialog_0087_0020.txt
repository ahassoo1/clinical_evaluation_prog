DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Avril. Yes, a consultation… it is good to be here. Well, it is… about my back. It has been bothering me for some time now. Not a sudden thing, you understand. More… a slow ache.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Avril. A slow ache in your back. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… hard to explain. It is not always there, you see? Some days are better than others. When I am working… bending, lifting… then it hurts more. When I sit for too long, also. It is… a dull pain. Not sharp. Mostly in the lower part of my back.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull pain in the lower back that's worse with bending, lifting, and prolonged sitting. And it comes and goes. Approximately how long have you been experiencing this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. It has been… maybe six months now? Perhaps a little longer. It started slowly, as I said. I thought it was just… getting old. I am a mechanic, you know? It is hard work. I did not think much of it at first.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months of gradually worsening lower back pain, related to your work as a mechanic. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs, or any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no pain down my legs. Not that I have noticed. And no… tingling. Just the ache in my back. Sometimes it feels… stiff. Like it is hard to move in the mornings. But no… nothing going down my legs.
DOCTOR: Okay, no radiating pain or numbness. Stiffness in the mornings. Have you tried anything to alleviate the pain so far – over-the-counter medications, heat, ice, stretching, anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes, I have tried a few things. I take… ibuprofen sometimes, when it is really bad. It helps a little, but not for long. My daughter, she gave me some cream… for the muscles. It smells nice, but I do not think it does much. And I try to stretch… when I remember. It is hard to remember everything. I also sometimes use a warm bath. That feels good, but it does not last.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen, a muscle cream, stretching, and warm baths, with limited relief. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of, Avril?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take a pill for that, every day. And… I had my gallbladder removed a long time ago. But other than that… no, not that I know of. My knees bother me sometimes, but that is just… getting old, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure managed with medication and a past gallbladder removal. And some knee discomfort. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the one pill for my blood pressure. Every morning, with my breakfast. I try to be good about it. My daughter reminds me, sometimes. She worries about me. A good girl.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the medication for your blood pressure. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Do you have any family members with back problems, arthritis, or any other musculoskeletal issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question. My mother… she had trouble with her hips when she got older. She needed a new one, eventually. And my brother… he was always complaining about his back, but I do not think it was ever anything serious. Just… aches and pains. I do not really know… We do not talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of hip problems in your mother and some back aches in your brother. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or participate in any regular exercise?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. Never have. And I do not drink alcohol, not anymore. My husband… he liked a glass of wine with dinner. But he passed away a few years ago, and I just… lost the taste for it. As for exercise… I used to walk more, when my husband was alive. Now… not so much. I am on my feet all day at work, but that is not really exercise, is it? Mostly just bending and lifting and… being tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking or alcohol use, and limited exercise. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I have never had a reaction to anything. My daughter always asks me that, and I always say no. I have a strong stomach, I think. But I always tell her to double-check, just in case.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you for providing me with all of that information, Avril. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to assess your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to have you stand and I’ll observe your posture and how you walk. Then, I’ll ask you to bend forward, backward, and to the sides to assess your range of motion. Finally, I’ll palpate your spine and surrounding muscles to check for tenderness or muscle spasm. Okay, Ms. Benites, I’m noticing a slight forward curvature of your lower back. Now, if you could bend forward slowly and touch your toes, or go as far as you comfortably can. I'll be watching your movement.
PATIENT: There… that is about as far as I can go. It pulls a little. Not a sharp pain, just… a pull. It is harder to get back up than to go down, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling some tenderness along your spinal muscles on both sides, particularly in the lower lumbar region. There's also some mild muscle spasm present. No signs of any neurological deficits at this point. Alright, Ms. Benites. Based on your history and the physical exam findings, it appears you're experiencing mechanical lower back pain, likely due to muscle strain and possible facet joint irritation. It's not uncommon with your profession, given the physical demands. We will need to rule out other more serious causes. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: Mechanical… muscle strain? That sounds… about right, I suppose. Lots of bending and lifting. Facet… what did you say? The little joints? Is that what you meant? And you need to… check for other things? What kind of other things?
DOCTOR: Yes, the facet joints are small joints located on the back of each vertebra. They help with movement and stability. And yes, while mechanical back pain is the most likely diagnosis at this point, it's important to rule out other possibilities, such as a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. To do that, I’d like to order some imaging – an X-ray of your lower back. It will help us visualize the bones and rule out any structural abnormalities. We can also consider an MRI if your pain doesn’t improve with conservative treatment, as that provides a more detailed view of the soft tissues, like the discs. Are you comfortable with getting an X-ray?
PATIENT: An X-ray… yes, I suppose that is alright. My husband had X-rays all the time. But an MRI? That sounds… scary. Is it painful? And what if it shows something bad? I just want to fix my back. I do not want anything serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Benites. An MRI is a painless procedure. You lie still inside a large machine, and it uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your spine. It doesn't involve any radiation. As for showing something bad, the goal of the imaging is to get a clear picture of what’s going on so we can provide you with the most appropriate treatment. We're not necessarily looking for something bad, but if there is an issue, knowing about it early allows us to address it effectively. We will discuss any findings thoroughly before making any decisions. For now, let’s start with the X-ray. I’ll write you a referral order. In the meantime, I recommend you continue with the ibuprofen as needed, and try to avoid activities that aggravate your pain. Gentle stretching and warm baths can also be helpful. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… an X-ray first. That sounds better. And… ibuprofen, stretching, warm baths. I can do that. I will try to be careful at work, but it is hard. Will the X-ray tell me if I need to… stop working? That is my biggest worry. I need my job.
DOCTOR: That's a valid concern, Ms. Benites. The X-ray will help us assess the structural integrity of your spine and identify any potential issues that might be contributing to your pain. It may indicate if you need to modify your work activities, but it doesn't automatically mean you'll have to stop working altogether. We'll discuss the results of the X-ray in detail, and then we can explore options for managing your pain while allowing you to continue working as safely as possible. That might involve ergonomic adjustments at your workplace, physical therapy to strengthen your back muscles, or other strategies. I'm going to write a referral for the X-ray to the imaging center down the street. They’re very good there. I’ll also give you a list of some gentle stretches you can try. Do you have any further questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all for now. Just the X-ray and the stretches. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. I hope it is nothing serious. And I hope I can keep my job.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. I understand your concerns, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. I'm optimistic that we can find a solution that allows you to manage your pain and continue working. Here’s the referral and the stretches. Please schedule the X-ray as soon as possible. Once you have the results, you can either schedule a follow-up appointment with me, or you can have them sent directly to my office. If you experience any worsening of your pain – such as fever, numbness or weakness in your legs, or loss of bowel or bladder control – please seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, I look forward to discussing the results of the X-ray with you. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. Fever, numbness… I will remember that. Thank you again, Doctor Soodeen. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. You have a good day as well, and please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. .
