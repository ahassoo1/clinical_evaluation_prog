DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you also. Um… my back. It’s been really bad. Worse than usual, even. It started, I think, maybe three days ago? It hurts to move, to stand... pretty much everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain. And you said it started about three days ago?
PATIENT: Yes, three days. Maybe four? Time gets a little… fuzzy sometimes. But it’s definitely gotten worse each day. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not just one spot, it feels like… all of it. From my lower back all the way up.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to pinpoint exactly when things started, and the fact that it’s spread is helpful to know. “All of it”... so, not just a sharp pain in one specific area, but more of a general soreness and discomfort running from your lower back upwards?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s… that’s exactly it. Not sharp, not really. More like… a heavy ache. And stiff. So, so stiff. It makes it hard to even bend over to put on my shoes. And it’s… well, you know, with the cancer and everything, I get worried it’s something… more.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Meigs, especially given your history. It’s good you’re bringing this to our attention. We definitely want to rule out anything serious. Let’s talk a little more about the pain itself. Does anything specifically make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Laying down helps a little. But I can't stay laying down all day, you know? And… bending over, like I said, makes it worse. Also, if I try to lift anything… even something small. Oh, and sitting for too long. Sitting is bad. Standing is bad. Everything feels bad, honestly! Sorry. I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: You're explaining perfectly, Ms. Meigs. It sounds like a lot of everyday activities are aggravating it, which is understandably frustrating. So, laying down offers some relief, but prolonged sitting or standing, and any kind of lifting, make it worse. No need to apologize at all. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the back pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. No fever, I don’t think. I haven’t checked. Um… no numbness or tingling in my legs or feet. And… no problems with… going to the bathroom. I’m sorry, that’s personal! Just… no changes there. My appetite hasn’t been very good lately, but that's probably the cancer treatments, you know?
DOCTOR: No, that's all very helpful information, Ms. Meigs, and you're right, a decreased appetite is common with cancer treatments. No fever, no numbness or tingling, and no changes in bowel or bladder function… that's good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to assess your back and see how it’s moving. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. I trust you, Doctor. Just… please be gentle? It hurts even when I just breathe sometimes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Meigs. I will be very gentle. Please let me know immediately if anything is too uncomfortable. Okay, Ms. Meigs, I'm just checking your range of motion. And now, just a little bit of pressure here… and here. Alright. I'm noting some muscle tightness and tenderness along your lower back, and a slightly limited range of motion. There doesn't seem to be any pain radiating down your legs, which is good. I don't feel any obvious abnormalities, but the muscles are definitely quite tense.
PATIENT: Okay. That… that sounds about right. It feels tight, like a big knot. And it is hard to bend. I’m glad you didn’t say anything about my legs. That would be scary. Do you think… is it just my back muscles? Or is it… something worse? I know you probably can’t tell me right away, but… I’m worried.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Ms. Meigs, and it's understandable that you're worried. Based on the exam, it could be a muscle strain or spasm, especially given your history and the way you describe it. However, given your cancer history, we need to rule out other potential causes. I don't want to dismiss anything. I'd like to order a few tests, just to be safe. An X-ray of your spine to rule out any structural issues, and a blood test to check for inflammation and rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. If it will help figure out what's wrong, then yes, please do the tests. I just… I want to know. And I want to feel better. It’s just… hard to do anything when I hurt this much. Are the tests… painful? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Meigs. The X-ray is completely painless. It just involves standing still for a few moments while the machine takes a picture. The blood test will involve a small needle prick, and it might be a little uncomfortable, but it’s very quick. We'll do our best to make you as comfortable as possible, and the phlebotomist is very good. I'll write the orders now. We can get those scheduled for you as soon as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend some gentle pain relief. Have you been taking anything for the pain already?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t taken anything. I try to avoid… all those pills if I can. I was worried it would mask something important. But it’s getting so bad, I don’t know what to do. What kind of pills are you thinking? And will they… make me sleepy? I need to be able to take care of myself, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible of you to be cautious, Ms. Meigs. We certainly don’t want to mask anything important. For now, I’m thinking a mild anti-inflammatory, like ibuprofen, may help. It’s available over the counter, and we can discuss a safe dosage. It may cause some mild drowsiness in some people, but it shouldn’t interfere with your daily activities if you take it as directed. We can also explore other options if that doesn't work or if you experience any side effects. I'll write that down for you. And we'll get those tests scheduled. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening. And for not… brushing me off because of the cancer. Some doctors do that, you know? They just say it’s the cancer and don’t look any further. It feels good to be… taken seriously.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. It's my job to listen and take your concerns seriously, and you deserve the best possible care. It’s never right for a doctor to dismiss your concerns. I want to make sure we get to the bottom of this and find you some relief. I'll have the nurse come in shortly to schedule your tests and provide you with a prescription for the ibuprofen. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And remember, if the pain becomes unbearable, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as numbness, weakness, or fever, please go to the emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. Take care of yourself, and we'll see you soon. .
