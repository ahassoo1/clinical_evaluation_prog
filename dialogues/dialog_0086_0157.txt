DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudeney. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don’t see why I even had to come in. It's not like I feel bad.
DOCTOR: Right. The nurse mentioned something about a blood pressure reading taken over the phone. It’s standard protocol to investigate those, even if you’re not experiencing symptoms. High blood pressure can be silent, and it's important to rule things out. Now, can you tell me a little more about when you first became aware of this elevated reading?
PATIENT: Elevated… what now? Look, I just told you, some lady called and said my numbers were “high.” I don’t remember when exactly. Probably a few days ago? It’s not like I keep a calendar of my blood pressure, okay? I work. I have a life.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I understand you're busy. “Elevated” just means higher than the normal range. It’s good you came in. Alright, let's try to get a better picture of things. Do you know where this blood pressure reading was taken?
PATIENT: At home. They sent me one of those machines. A little cuff thing. My husband helped me set it up, he's good with electronics. It’s… automatic, I guess. I just put it on and it beeps. Don’t ask me to explain it further. It's a machine.
DOCTOR: Okay, a home blood pressure monitor. That's helpful to know. And how often have you been checking it since you got the machine?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? Not very often. Maybe three or four times. It's a hassle. And it always seemed a little… high. But I figured it was probably just because I was nervous about using it, or something. My husband kept saying I should relax more.
DOCTOR: Right. And what were those readings, if you recall?
PATIENT: I… don’t have them written down. Why would I? I told you, I don’t keep a log of this stuff. I remember the top number was always around… 140-something, maybe? And the bottom number was… well, I don’t know. Lower, obviously. It was just… numbers. Higher than whatever is normal, I guess. It stressed me out, so I stopped taking it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll need to get a current reading here in the office to compare. I'd also like to ask a few routine questions, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No. And frankly, I don't have time for a whole lot of questions. I took time off work for this, you know. Just tell me if I need pills or not. Is that too much to ask? I’m perfectly healthy, usually. This is probably just a fluke.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, I understand your frustration, but dismissing potential health concerns without proper evaluation isn’t responsible. It’s my responsibility to investigate this blood pressure reading, and your responsibility to provide me with the information I need. Now, have you ever had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Look, are you accusing me of something? I just want to know if I'm going to be okay. Surgeries? No. Never. I take care of myself. Why are you asking me all these… personal questions? This is ridiculous. My husband will be furious if I'm here much longer. He had to cover my shift.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on, then. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have been diagnosed with high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: My grandmother… on my mother’s side. She had… something. I don’t remember exactly. She lived a long life, though. Really long. Probably just old age. Everyone in her family lived a long time. They were all… strong people. Not like some people I know. Is that helpful? I don’t really keep track of everyone’s medical history.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just vitamins. A multivitamin, mostly. And sometimes I take something for allergies, when the pollen is bad. But that’s it. I don’t like taking pills. They make me feel… weird. I prefer to just deal with things myself. Do I look like someone who needs a lot of medication?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Are you seriously asking me this? This is insulting! I'm a professional. I have a reputation. Of course I don't do any of those things. Honestly, I can't believe you're even asking. This is a complete waste of my time. I want to see the results of the test, and then I want to go home. Now.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's get a blood pressure reading, then. I’m going to need you to sit quietly for five minutes before we proceed. Then we'll check your pulse and listen to your heart and lungs. Please, have a seat. And please, try to relax. It will affect the reading.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just hurry up. This is going to take forever, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It won’t be long. Just try to keep your arm still and don’t talk. Your blood pressure is currently 152/98. Your pulse is 82 and regular. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds are normal. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles noted. Okay. Based on these readings, and what you've told me, your blood pressure is elevated. We need to investigate this further.
PATIENT: Elevated? I knew it. It's probably just stress. All this questioning, it's giving me a headache. Look, can’t you just give me something for it? A pill or something? I have a deadline to meet and I really don’t have time for a bunch of tests. My husband said I should try deep breathing exercises. Maybe that will help. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, I understand you're frustrated, but simply masking the symptom with a pill isn't a solution. High blood pressure, if left untreated, can lead to serious complications like heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure. We need to determine the cause of the elevation before we can decide on a treatment plan. I'm going to order some blood work and a urine test. We’ll also need an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity. These tests will help rule out any underlying medical conditions. I'm also going to recommend a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor. This will give us a more accurate picture of your blood pressure throughout the day and night. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Seriously? This is ridiculous. I told you, I’m perfectly healthy. Look, I don’t like needles. I faint easily. And I have a very important meeting tomorrow. I can’t be spending all day in a lab. My husband… he's going to be so angry. Just give me something to lower it now, and I’ll deal with it. I'm a very responsible person. I'll be fine. Why are you making such a big deal out of this?
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, with all due respect, your refusal to cooperate with basic medical investigations is concerning. I understand your anxieties, but ignoring a potentially serious health issue is not a responsible course of action. I’m going to order the blood work and urine tests. The lab technician will be aware of your needle phobia, and we can take precautions to make you comfortable. As for the 24-hour monitor, we can discuss rescheduling it if absolutely necessary, but it’s a crucial piece of the puzzle. I’m also going to prescribe a low dose of a diuretic to help lower your blood pressure in the meantime. It's a mild medication with minimal side effects, but it’s important to follow the instructions carefully. Do you have any questions about the medication or the tests?
PATIENT: A diuretic? So… a water pill? Great. Just what I need. Look, I really don’t like all these pills. And I’m telling you, I feel fine. Mostly. This is all going to be a waste of time and money, and my husband is going to kill me. I swear. Just… write down the instructions for the pill, and let me go. I’ll take it. Maybe. But I’m not promising anything about those other tests. This is just… ridiculous. I want to go home. Now. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Here are the instructions for the diuretic. Please read them carefully. And I strongly advise you to schedule those tests as soon as possible. Ignoring this elevated blood pressure could have serious consequences. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review the test results and discuss a long-term management plan. If you experience any side effects, such as dizziness or excessive urination, please contact the office immediately. I wish you a good day, Ms. Dudeney. And please, take care of yourself.
