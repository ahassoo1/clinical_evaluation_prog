DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, yes. Beinborn, you say? A good Palauan name, I reckon. Well, it's this… waterworks situation. Been going to the bathroom a lot lately. More than a fella ought to, if you ask me. It’s… bothersome. Can’t quite get a good rest, you know? Wakes me up at night. Not ideal.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lot more frequent urination, especially at night. I understand it’s disrupting your sleep, and that’s definitely bothersome. Thank you for letting me know. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? Well… it just happens. I drink a normal amount, I suppose. Maybe a little more tea than water, if I’m honest. Old habits, you know? But it’s not like I’m guzzling gallons. Just… regular. And then, whoosh, gotta go. Several times a night. Used to be, I could sleep right through. Now… not so much. And it’s not painful, mind you. Just… frequent. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, it's just… old age catching up, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, just increased frequency, particularly at night, even with what you consider a normal fluid intake. You mentioned a little more tea than water – about how much tea would you say you drink in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How much tea… that’s a tricky one. I don’t measure it, you see. It’s just… several cups. Maybe… three or four, easily. Sometimes more if the wife’s made a good batch. She makes it strong, you know? Real strong. Black tea, mostly. None of that fancy herbal stuff. Just… good, honest tea. Is that helpful? I’m terrible with amounts, always have been. My wife does all the measuring in this house.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Segretto. It's helpful to have a general idea. So, three or four cups of strong black tea a day. Tea does contain caffeine, and that can sometimes contribute to increased urination. Now, besides the increased frequency, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Caffeine, eh? Well, I’ve been drinking tea for… seventy years, at least. Never bothered me before. But alright, alright. Maybe it’s the tea. Hmm. Other changes… let me think. Not really. I mean, I get up a few more times at night, that's the main thing. And… well, I suppose I'm a bit slower getting around these days. But that's just age, isn't it? No burning, no… trouble getting it out, if you catch my drift. Just… more of it, more often.
DOCTOR: Okay, no burning or difficulty with urination, just increased volume and frequency, and you’ve noticed some general slowing down which you attribute to age. That's good information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… well, I’ve got the usual aches and pains, you know? Old war wounds, so to speak. Nothing serious. The wife keeps telling me my blood pressure's a bit high, but I don’t bother with doctors much. They always tell you to stop enjoying life. And I’m not about to do that. I think I had a bit of a cough last winter, but it cleared up on its own. Oh, and the arthritis in my hands, makes it hard to work in the garden sometimes. But I manage. Do you need a list? My wife probably has one somewhere. She worries about everything.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been quite resilient over the years. And it’s good that you manage things well. No, a full list isn’t necessary right now. Just knowing about the high blood pressure, arthritis and the occasional cough is helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… yes, now that you mention it, I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And… oh dear. I think I had a bit of work done on my knee, years and years ago. Farming accident. But that was a long time back, before they had all the fancy new techniques. It doesn't bother me much these days. Nothing else comes to mind. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Segretto. Sometimes past surgeries can contribute to current problems. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Oh, goodness. That's a long story. My father… he had a weak heart, I think. Died young, he did. And my mother… well, she lived a long time, but she had… what do they call it… the sugar sickness? Diabetes, that’s it. Several of my siblings had it too. And my wife’s side… lots of bad backs, from working the land. It's a farming family, you see. Lots of aches and pains. Is that the kind of thing you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. A family history of heart trouble and diabetes is important information. We’ll keep those in mind. Now, before we move on, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Not much, really. The wife gives me a pill for my blood pressure, sometimes. A little white one. I forget what it's called. And I take something for my arthritis, when it flares up. Ibuprofen, I think. Over the counter stuff, mostly. Nothing fancy. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. They never agree with me. And she makes me take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, says I don’t get enough sun. That’s about it, I think. Are you writing all this down?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am, Mr. Segretto. Everything you tell me is helpful. So, you take a blood pressure medication, ibuprofen for arthritis when needed, and a vitamin D supplement. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never been one for fancy foods, so I haven't had much chance to be allergic to anything. I get a bit of a sniffle with pollen in the spring, but that's just a normal spring thing, isn't it? And the wife says I get a bit red when I eat shellfish, but I haven't had that in years. Not worth the trouble, if you ask me. So, no, I don’t think I have any serious allergies. Nothing that’s ever landed me in the hospital, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild pollen sensitivity and possible reaction to shellfish. That’s good to know. Now, Mr. Segretto, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Physical exam, eh? Well, I suppose so. Can't hurt to look, I reckon. Though I'm not a big fan of doctors poking and prodding. But alright. Go ahead. Just be gentle, mind you. These old bones aren't what they used to be. And don't take too long, if you please. I've got a garden to tend to, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I'll be quick. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 88. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some slight crackling in your lungs, which could be a sign of fluid build-up. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a slight fullness in your lower abdomen. Do you feel any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Crackling in the lungs, you say? Fullness in the abdomen… Ooh, yes. A little bit there, right in the middle. Not much, mind you. But a bit uncomfortable. Feels like… a bit of a pressure, like I need to… well, you know. But I’ve already been several times, like I said. It’s just… strange. Is that bad? Is something wrong? My wife always worries about everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Segretto. The fullness and slight tenderness in your lower abdomen are worth noting. The crackling in your lungs and slight fullness could be related, but we need to investigate further. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam findings, it sounds like we're dealing with a few possibilities. The increased frequency of urination could be due to several things, including an enlarged prostate, which is common in men your age, or a urinary tract infection. The crackling in your lungs and abdominal fullness could indicate some fluid retention, which can be related to heart or kidney issues. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. These include a urine analysis to check for infection, a blood test to assess your kidney function and look for signs of infection, and a prostate-specific antigen test to check the size of your prostate. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. My wife is going to be thrilled. She always wants me to get every test imaginable. Alright, alright. If you think it’s necessary. But I hope they don't take too much blood. I get lightheaded easily, you know. And what about this… prostate test? Is that uncomfortable? I've heard stories. Is it something I need to prepare for? Honestly, I'd rather just be left alone with my garden. But alright. Do what you have to do. Just be quick about it, if you please.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Segretto. We'll take things one step at a time. The blood draw will be relatively small, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable during the process. We'll have you lie down and take it slow. The PSA test is just a blood test, so it's not uncomfortable. It simply measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. I’m also going to order a basic metabolic panel which will help assess kidney function and electrolyte levels. To rule out infection, we will send a urine sample to the lab for analysis. The nurse will give you instructions on how to collect a clean sample. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. For now, let's get those orders in. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you the instructions for the urine sample. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions… Well… how long will it take to get these results? And will they require any follow-up appointments? I'd like to know what I'm getting myself into. My wife likes to schedule everything three months in advance, you see. And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Drinking more water? Less tea? Just… tell me what I need to know. And try not to use too many big words, if you please.
DOCTOR: Good questions, Mr. Segretto. The results typically take about 2-3 business days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend drinking a normal amount of fluids – about 6-8 glasses of water a day – and avoiding excessive caffeine intake. Cutting back on the tea might be helpful, but don't eliminate it completely if you enjoy it. I also recommend keeping track of how often you’re urinating and the amount of fluid you're drinking, just so we have a better understanding of your symptoms. It’s important not to jump to conclusions before we have the results. The tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and develop a plan to address them. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: 6-8 glasses of water… that’s a lot of water. Alright, alright. I’ll try. Keeping track… my wife can help with that. She’s good at keeping lists. I suppose… I suppose that’s all for now. Just… let me know when I need to come back. And try not to keep me waiting too long. I’ve got tomatoes to prune, you know. And the weeds are relentless this year.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. We’ll do our best to get you in as soon as possible. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you further instructions. Thank you for coming in today. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, and enjoy your garden. .
PATIENT: Alright. You too. Tomatoes aren't going to prune themselves, you know. And the weeds… oh, the weeds. .
