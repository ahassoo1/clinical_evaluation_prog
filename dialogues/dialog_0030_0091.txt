DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It nice to meet you as well. Well, lately I been feelin'… just very thirsty all the time. And hungry too, even after I eat a good meal. It just don’t seem right, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Feeling excessively thirsty and hungry, even after eating, is certainly something we should investigate. Can you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see… I think it start maybe… a month or so ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little more thirsty than usual. But it been gettin’ worse each week. And the hunger… that come a little later, maybe two weeks ago. I does try to eat good food, you know, but it not stick with me. I feel empty again soon after.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about a month of increased thirst, progressing over the last few weeks, with the increased hunger starting about two weeks ago. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – are you going to the bathroom more often, or perhaps less often?
PATIENT: Yes, I have been goin' to the bathroom more. Especially at night! It really botherin' my sleep, you know? I have to get up sometimes two, three times in the night. It never used to be like that. I does drink a lot of water, of course, 'cause I so thirsty, but still… it just a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency of urination, particularly at night – that's important information. Have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision? Hmm... I does wear glasses, you see. I get them check every year. But I ain't notice nothin' different with the glasses on. Sometimes, when I take them off, things seem a little blurry, but that always been so. Nothing new there. I hope I makin' sense?
DOCTOR: You are making perfect sense, Bianca. No changes in your vision with your glasses, and the usual blurriness when you take them off. That's good to know. Now, have you experienced any unexplained weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: Weight… well, now that you mention it, I think I might have lose a little weight. Not a lot, but my clothes feel a little looser than they used to. I ain’t been weighin' myself though, to be honest. I just notice the clothes. My husband, he say I look a little thinner, but he always sayin' things like that! He like when I cook him nice meals, you know.
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned that, even a small amount of weight loss can be significant. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, I ain’t been diagnosed with nothin’ serious, if that make sense. The doctor, years ago, say my pressure was a little high, but he give me some pills and it seem to be alright since then. I take them every day, like he say. Other than that, I just get the usual aches and pains for a woman my age. Nothing that bother me too much. I try to stay active, you know, gardenin' and things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure managed with medication, and some typical age-related aches and pains. And do you know what medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see... my husband, he does manage the pills for me. I think... it a white pill, small one. And another one, it blue. He tell me the names, but I forget them easily, you know. I does just take them every mornin' like he say. He pick it up from the pharmacy, so I don't worry too much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can certainly look that up with the pharmacy information. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Years ago, I had my appendix out when I was a young woman. That was a long time ago, though. And I had a cataract removed from one eye, maybe five years ago? But that's all I can remember. Nothing else. Small surgeries, you know, nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in the past and cataract removal about five years ago. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Are there any family members – parents, siblings, or close relatives – who have diabetes, kidney problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, my family... yes, my mother, she had diabetes. She was sick for a long time with it. And my father, he had a heart problem. He passed away when I was still young. My brother, he got high blood pressure, like me. So, it seem to run in the family, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. That’s important information. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. My husband, he used to smoke a little, but he stop years ago. It bad for your health, you know? Always been bad for your health.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking history. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I does have a little glass of wine with my dinner sometimes. Just one glass, though. Nothing more. It help me relax, you know? After a long day of work. But I don't drink every day. Maybe two or three times a week.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional light alcohol consumption. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently experiencing any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I eat all kinds of food, and I take the pills the doctor give me without any problems. Never had a reaction to anything, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Bianca, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I would like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Great. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’d like to do a simple blood test to check your blood sugar levels. Please relax your arm for me. 148 over 92. Your pulse is 88 and regular. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Now, we'll need to do a quick finger prick to check your blood sugar. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's alright. A little prick won't bother me. My hands are a little rough from the gardenin', but you can find a spot, I'm sure. Just get it over with quickly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a quick pinch. … Okay. Your blood sugar level is 210. That is elevated. Normal is generally below 100, and above 126 on two separate occasions suggests diabetes. Based on your symptoms – the increased thirst, frequent urination, weight loss – and now this elevated blood sugar, it is likely you have diabetes. We will need to confirm this with further testing, but this is a strong indication. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Diabetes… my mother had that. So that’s what it is… all this drinkin' and goin' to the bathroom. What does this mean, Doctor? Will I… will I be sick like my mother? Will I have to take pills like her? What can I do?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Bianca. It's natural to be worried when you hear something like this, especially with a family history. But please know that diabetes is a manageable condition, and many people live long and healthy lives with it. It doesn't necessarily mean you'll experience the same symptoms or complications as your mother. Treatment has come a long way, and we can work together to create a plan that's right for you. We will need to do some further blood tests to confirm the diagnosis and see how well your body is processing sugar. I’ll also refer you to a diabetes educator who can teach you about diet, exercise, and monitoring your blood sugar. Medication may be necessary, but often lifestyle changes alone can significantly improve your condition. We'll discuss all your options once we have the results of the tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds alright. A plan… that’s good. I like the idea of a plan. Diet and exercise… I can do that. I always liked gardenin', as you know. And I suppose I can cut back on the sweet things, though my husband, he loves his cakes… The diabetes educator… what will they teach me exactly? And how long will it take to get the test results? I’m a little scared, Doctor, if I'm honest. I don't want to end up like my mother.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be scared, Bianca. Your feelings are completely valid. And I assure you, we’ll do everything we can to help you avoid the complications your mother experienced. The diabetes educator will teach you about carbohydrate counting, how different foods affect your blood sugar, how to monitor your blood sugar at home, and how to recognize and manage low blood sugar. They will also provide support and guidance to help you make healthy lifestyle changes. The blood tests should be back within a few days. Once we have those results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a personalized treatment plan. I’ll also give you a referral to the diabetes educator today, so they can get in touch with you to schedule an appointment. For now, try not to worry too much. Focus on drinking plenty of water, eating balanced meals, and getting some gentle exercise if you feel up to it. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. That all sounds… manageable. Thank you for explainin' everything so clearly. And for not… for not makin' me feel like it’s a hopeless situation. Just… please let me know as soon as the test results come back. I want to get started on this, you know? I want to take control of this before it takes control of me. I think… I think that’s all. For now, anyway.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Bianca. I completely understand. I will personally call you as soon as the results are back – no later than three business days. In the meantime, I'm providing you with a pamphlet on diabetes and a list of helpful resources. Remember, you are not alone in this, and we are here to support you every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you, Bianca. Take care of yourself, and please try not to worry too much. .
