DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Gegan, you said? Yes… well, it’s this cough. Been… a while now. A dry cough, mostly. Doesn't seem to go away, no matter what. It just… is. I don’t rightly remember when it started, to be honest. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it’s good you came in to have it checked out. “Just is” can sometimes mean something important is going on. You said it’s been a while… even a rough estimate would be helpful. Weeks?
PATIENT: Weeks… months, maybe? Oh dear… it’s hard to say. Seems like… since the weather got warmer, perhaps? Before that… not so bad. I used to work on cars all day, you know. Out in the sun, dust and everything. Maybe that started it. Or maybe it was before that. I… I don't remember exactly. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s common for memories to become less clear over time. So, it seems the cough worsened with the warmer weather, and you used to work on cars, which involved dust exposure. Do you notice anything specifically that makes the cough worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… specifically? Well, lying down, I think. Definitely worse when I try to sleep. And… sometimes when I eat. Not always, but… dry things, maybe? Crackers or something. Water helps a little, but it comes back quick enough. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Worse when lying down and with dry foods... okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… I get a little… short of breath sometimes. Walking up the stairs, definitely. Not every time, but enough to notice. And… I’ve lost my appetite a bit. Not much interest in food these days. My wife used to make such good food… But that was a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Short of breath with exertion, like climbing stairs, and a decreased appetite... Okay. Have you had a fever, chills, or night sweats at any time recently?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… No, I don't think so. I haven't felt feverish, anyway. And no night sweats. I sleep pretty soundly, actually. Or, I try to. It's just the cough keeps waking me up. Everything feels… tired, all the time. But no fever or chills, no. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like asthma, COPD, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one. I saw a doctor when I was in the service, a long time ago. Just a check-up, mostly. Nothing major. My wife… she always handled the doctor appointments. She remembered everything. I think… I think they told me I had a little bit of high blood pressure once. But that was years ago. I don't take any pills for it now, and haven't for… well, a long time. Nothing else that I recall, no. I mostly just worked on cars. Kept me pretty healthy, I thought. For a while, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of hypertension, but currently not on any medications. And you haven’t had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. Never needed 'em, thankfully. And no hospital stays. Just the regular doctor check-ups when I was younger. And… a few scrapes and bruises working on cars, of course! But nothing serious enough for the hospital. I was always pretty careful. Well… as careful as you can be with a wrench in your hand.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of, no. My wife always said I could eat anything. She used to worry about me trying new foods. But I never had a reaction to anything. No rashes, no trouble breathing… nothing. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, no. Though… sometimes dust bothers my eyes. But that's not an allergy, is it? Just… dust. From the cars.
DOCTOR: No, that wouldn't necessarily be an allergy. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. My wife used to try to get me to take a multivitamin, but I never really got around to it. Just… nothing. Plain as can be. I drink a lot of water, though. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That does count! Staying hydrated is very important. Okay, Mr. Pavlovic, now I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Been a long time since I had a good check-up. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I'm an old man, you know. Everything creaks a bit.
DOCTOR: I will, absolutely. I’ll be gentle. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Could you please take a deep breath in for me… and out… good. And again… Okay. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your age and activity level. Now, I’m going to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Everything looks good there. Finally, I’m going to feel your abdomen and listen to it with my stethoscope. Your abdomen feels fine. Everything seems to be in order, but based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a blood test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray and a blood test… Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. I haven't had an X-ray in… goodness, I don't even remember. A blood test, too… alright. Just let me know when and where I need to go. And… how much it will cost? I’m on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. We can discuss the costs beforehand. The lab and radiology departments have financial assistance programs available for patients with limited income, and we have a patient financial counselor who can help you navigate those options. We'll make sure you understand everything before proceeding. The X-ray will help us visualize your lungs and rule out any underlying causes for your cough. The blood test will give us information about your overall health and potentially identify any infections or inflammation. We can get the orders for both tests done right away. The radiology department is just down the hall, and the lab is on the first floor. Do you think you'd be able to get those done today?
PATIENT: Today… Yes, I suppose I can. As long as it doesn't take too long. I don't drive anymore, you see. My son usually takes me to appointments. He’s at work now, but he can pick me up later. Just let me know how long it'll take, and I'll ask him to come get me. Down the hall and on the first floor… alright. Sounds manageable. I appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. It makes me feel… less worried.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. I’m glad I could ease your worries. The X-ray shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes, and the blood test will likely be about 30 minutes. We'll have the results sent to me as soon as they're available. I’ll write down the instructions for both tests and give them to you now. After we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good. Instructions… alright. A follow-up appointment… yes, that's sensible. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. My wife… she would have liked you. She always liked a doctor who took the time to explain things. Alright. I think I can manage this. Down the hall and the first floor… and then we'll see what the tests say.
DOCTOR: I’m glad I could provide that same level of care for you, Mr. Pavlovic. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, we’ll work through this together. Do you have any other questions for me right now before you head down to radiology and the lab?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything. You've answered all my questions, and I feel… a little better, knowing we’re getting this checked out. Thank you again for your kindness. It means a lot. I’ll go find the radiology department now. I appreciate your help, Doctor. Really, I do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take your time, and please let the staff at radiology know if you need any assistance. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
