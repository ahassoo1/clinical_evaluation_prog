DOCTOR: Good morning, San. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get a card… a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. You know, like Uber or taxi work. I want to make sure I’m allowed to do it, legally. I'm San Sciarotta, by the way.
DOCTOR: Okay, San. So it sounds like you're looking for a medical evaluation to ensure you meet the requirements for commercial driving – specifically for ride-sharing services. That’s perfectly alright. We can certainly look into that. Let me pull up your information here… I see you’re 70 years old, and your insurance is Medicare. Just to confirm, are you otherwise healthy, or are there any ongoing medical conditions I should be aware of before we begin?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Seventy. Feels older some days! Um… let me think. I had a bit of trouble with my knees a few years back, but that’s mostly managed with some exercises. And… oh! My blood pressure sometimes runs a little high, but I take a pill for that. Otherwise, I feel pretty good, all things considered. I try to stay active.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees and blood pressure. That's helpful to know. And just to be thorough, San, could you tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… It’s… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. My daughter helps me keep track of everything, so I sometimes forget the names. But I take it every morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. Good. And how many milligrams of Lisinopril are you taking each day?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that… I really don't remember. I think it’s a small white pill? Is there a way you can just… look it up with my name? I feel bad not knowing these things. My doctor just tells me to take it.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, San. It's very common to forget these details, and that's what I'm here for. Let me check your medication list through Medicare… Okay, I see here you're taking 20 milligrams of Lisinopril daily. Now, besides your knees and blood pressure, have you been experiencing any other health issues recently?
PATIENT: Twenty milligrams, okay. Thank you. That’s good to know. No, not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn't? And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, but I wear glasses. Nothing major, Doctor. Honestly, I feel pretty strong for my age. I still do some gardening, you know. It keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, San. Gardening is wonderful exercise. Just to get a more complete picture, let's quickly go through a few things. Have you had any changes in your vision recently, other than just the typical aging process?
PATIENT: No, not really. My glasses prescription was updated last year, and I’ve been fine since then. Everything’s been clear enough. I can still read, and I can see the road when I drive. I wouldn’t be driving if I couldn’t, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, San. That's very good to know. And have you experienced any dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting spells?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Not at all. I haven’t felt faint or anything like that. Sometimes a little unsteady when I stand up too fast, but that happens to everyone, right? It passes quickly.
DOCTOR: It does happen sometimes. Now, San, have you ever had any issues with your heart, like chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, never. Not any chest pain or trouble breathing. My heart’s been… well, it’s been okay. My regular doctor did an EKG a couple of years ago, and he said it was fine. No palpitations or anything like that either. I'm a pretty calm person, I think!
DOCTOR: That's reassuring to hear, San. Now, lastly, have you had any recent neurological issues, like headaches, weakness, numbness, or difficulty with speech or memory?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my memory isn’t perfect, as we’ve established. But no, no serious headaches or anything like that. No weakness or numbness. Sometimes I forget where I put my keys, but who doesn’t? And my speech is fine, I think. You’re understanding me alright, aren’t you?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly, San. Okay, that’s very helpful. Now, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam, just to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and reflexes?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go ahead, Doctor. The sooner we get this done, the better. I have some gardening to do this afternoon, you know!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 135/80. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. And I’m going to quickly check your pupils. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Everything seems to be within acceptable ranges. Do you have your glasses with you?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here they are. I need them for reading, of course, but my distance vision is okay without them.
DOCTOR: Okay, with your glasses on, your near vision is 20/25 and your distance vision is 20/30. That’s perfectly adequate for driving. Alright, San, based on my examination and your history, it appears you meet the basic medical requirements for a commercial driver's license. However… due to your age and history of high blood pressure, I do recommend a baseline EKG and a complete blood count to ensure everything is optimal. It's just a precaution. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds reasonable. A precaution is fine. Better safe than sorry, right? An EKG and a blood test… okay. Can I get that done here, or do I need to go somewhere else? And how long will it take? I really do have that gardening…
DOCTOR: Yes, we can definitely do that here. We have a lab right down the hall. The EKG will just take a few minutes, and the blood draw won't take long either. We'll send the results to your regular doctor and I’ll review them as well. It should take a couple of days to get everything back. I’ll put in an order for both tests now. And I will provide you with a note outlining the recommendation for these tests. Would you like a copy for your records as well?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A copy for my records would be good. And… is there anything else I need to do? Any forms to fill out? I just want to get this all sorted out as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Here you go. This is the order for the EKG and blood work, and this note summarizes my recommendations. The lab technician will give you instructions on fasting requirements for the blood draw – you may need to fast for a few hours beforehand. And there's a form you’ll need to take to the DMV when you apply for the commercial driver's license – it's a medical certification form that your doctor needs to complete after you’ve had the tests. It’s included with this paperwork. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Okay… EKG, blood test, DMV form… No, I think I understand. It’s a lot, but I think I can manage. So, just go to the lab, get the tests done, and then take this form to my regular doctor? And then to the DMV? And… will this affect my Medicare coverage at all? I’m worried about unexpected costs.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Lab tests, then form to your doctor, and finally the DMV. Regarding Medicare, the lab tests should be covered under Part B, as long as they are deemed medically necessary. However, it’s always a good idea to double-check with your insurance provider to confirm coverage and any potential out-of-pocket costs. I can provide you with the billing codes for the tests if that helps. Do you have any other concerns or questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful, even if it is a bit complicated. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll get those tests scheduled right away. And hopefully, I’ll be back to gardening – and maybe even ride-sharing – soon!
DOCTOR: It's my pleasure, San. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns along the way, don't hesitate to call the office. And please, stay safe and enjoy your gardening! Have a good day, San.
