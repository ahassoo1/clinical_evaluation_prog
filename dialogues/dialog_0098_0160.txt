DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t have all day for this. It’s…well, I’m just tired. More tired than usual, and it's getting ridiculous. And I've been…eating dirt. Not like a lot, but enough to where I thought I should probably get it checked out. It’s embarrassing, really. People eat normal food, not…that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Tired” is quite broad, though. Can you tell me a little more about how you’re tired?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t need the lecture, dear. It’s just…everything feels like a struggle. Getting out of bed, walking to the bus stop, even just thinking straight. It's like my batteries are always running low, and they're the cheap kind. And it doesn't matter how much sleep I get, it doesn't help. I used to be able to do things, you know? Now…not so much. And this dirt eating started a few weeks back, right when I felt the worst of it. It’s like…a craving. A weird craving.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, fatigue is the main concern, and it's been impacting your daily activities. And this craving for dirt…when you say “a few weeks back”, can you pinpoint roughly when it started?
PATIENT: Around…mid-July, I suppose. Maybe the 10th? Yes, around then. Right after that heatwave we had. Terrible heat, really. I thought it was just that at first, you know? But it hasn’t let up, even though it’s cooled down. And it’s not like I'm shoveling it in, alright? It's just…a handful here and there. From the garden. Don’t look at me like that. I wash it first! Though I suppose that doesn’t make it good for me.
DOCTOR: Of course not, Candis. I'm not judging, I’m just trying to gather information. It’s helpful to know you wash it. Alright, so fatigue starting around mid-July, coinciding with the heatwave, and this…pica, as we call it, with the dirt eating. Has anything else changed around that time?
PATIENT: Pica? Is that what you call it? Fancy. No, not really. Same routine, mostly. Work, bus, a little TV. Though…Old Man Hemlock down the street passed away around then. Terrible thing. Always gave me a friendly wave. Maybe that upset me more than I realized? I don't know. It’s just…things happen, you know? People get sick, people die. It’s life. I'm not one for dwelling.
DOCTOR: Okay. Grief can certainly manifest in unexpected ways. And it's good you’re acknowledging that possibility. Let's move on to a bit more detail about the fatigue. When you wake up in the morning, how do you feel immediately after getting out of bed?
PATIENT: Immediately? Like I’ve been run over by a bus, honestly. Just…heavy. And drained. It takes me a good hour to feel even remotely functional. And even then, it's just…putting one foot in front of the other. I have to force myself. I used to jump out of bed, ready to go. Now? It’s a monumental effort. Don’t even get me started on getting ready for work. It’s just…exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay. That sounds quite debilitating. And it's not improving with rest. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and the pica?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, I’ve been a bit…lightheaded sometimes. Nothing major, just a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. And my stomach…it’s been a bit unsettled. Not sick, exactly, just…off. And my skin feels…dry. I thought it was the weather, but maybe it’s something else. Honestly, I just feel…old. Older than my years, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lightheadedness, some stomach upset, and dry skin…those are all things to consider. I’m going to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. It will give me a better sense of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I haven’t got all day, you know. Just…try to be quick about it. And don't poke too hard. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be gentle. Blood pressure is a little on the lower side, 108/65. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. No masses or distention. Skin is indeed dry, and I notice some slight pallor. Alright, Candis. Everything seems within normal limits, but those findings – the lower blood pressure, pallor, and tenderness – are things we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Investigate? What does that mean? More poking and prodding? I just want to know why I’m so tired and why I feel like eating dirt! Is it a vitamin deficiency? Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question. A vitamin deficiency could be playing a role, particularly iron. The dirt eating itself – the pica – can sometimes indicate an iron deficiency, or other nutritional deficiencies. However, it could also be something else. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. A complete blood count, iron studies, and a basic metabolic panel. These tests will help us check your overall health, your iron levels, and rule out other possible causes for your fatigue and the pica. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests…fine. As long as it doesn’t take forever. But I don’t have insurance, you know. How much is this going to cost? I’m on a fixed income, and I can’t afford to be paying a fortune for tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Candis. I know that medical costs can be a significant burden, especially on a fixed income. Let me see what the costs are likely to be. The complete blood count and iron studies will be about $120, and the basic metabolic panel is around $80, so roughly $200 in total. I can also check if there are any assistance programs or lower-cost labs in the area that we could explore. There might be a community health center nearby that offers discounted rates. Would you like me to look into that for you?
PATIENT: Two hundred dollars…That's…a lot. Look into those programs, dear. Please. I really can’t afford to be paying that kind of money. And if it turns out to be some silly vitamin deficiency, I'm going to be very annoyed. Honestly, I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Candis. I’ll absolutely look into those assistance programs for you right away. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a referral to a local hematologist. A hematologist specializes in blood disorders, and they will be best equipped to interpret the test results and determine the best course of treatment. They are also often aware of financial assistance options. Would you like me to go ahead and write that referral for you now?
PATIENT: A specialist? Oh, this is getting ridiculous. Fine. Just…get it over with. The sooner I get this sorted, the sooner I can stop feeling like an old woman who eats dirt. But don’t expect me to be making another appointment anytime soon. I don’t like doctors.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let’s get the referral written up then. Here you go. This is the contact information for Dr. Anya Sharma. She's a very good hematologist, and her office is located on Elm Street. The referral will be sent electronically to her office, and they will contact you to schedule an appointment. I also want to emphasize that if your symptoms worsen at all – if you experience any dizziness, shortness of breath, or severe fatigue – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just…thank you. I suppose. Get me out of here, dear. I have a bus to catch. And please, send that referral quickly. I don't want to be waiting around forever. .
