DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I’m Dr. Yackey. Please, have a seat. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Yackey. Thank you. It is… concerning. My memory, you see. It has been… not as reliable lately. I am Venus Alvara. I made an appointment because of this. It is… troubling for someone in my profession, managing properties and all.
DOCTOR: Venus Alvara… yes, I see your file. “Memory concerns.” Right. Well, Ms. Alvara, these things happen. Age, stress… it all contributes. To clarify, when did you first notice these… lapses?
PATIENT: Lapses is a good word, yes. Perhaps… six months ago? It was small things at first. Forgetting a name, misplacing keys. But it has grown. I remember every detail of a property inspection from ten years ago, but what I ate for breakfast? That is… gone. It is very strange. And I have… the pressure. The doctor before… he said my blood pressure is high. Is this… connected?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, yes, I see that noted. And… detailed recall of past events, difficulty with recent memory. Hmm. While I wouldn’t definitively link the two at this stage, it’s… not uncommon for cognitive changes to accompany hypertension. It’s a bit vague, frankly. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No… no dizziness, I do not think so. No headaches. I sleep… reasonably well, though I wake often. Sometimes I am… slower to find the correct word, you know? It is not often, but it is… frustrating. I manage many people, and I need to be precise. I do not want to appear… incompetent.
DOCTOR: Difficulty finding words… Right. And how would you rate your overall stress level, Ms. Alvara?
PATIENT: Stress… it is… significant. I manage fifteen properties, numerous tenants, and a rather… difficult homeowner’s association. There are always problems. Leaks, complaints, legal issues. It never stops. I like to be in control, to solve problems, but lately… it feels overwhelming. It is a lot for one person.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that sounds stressful. Let’s move on to a more… concrete assessment. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: My appetite… has been smaller, yes. I do not actively try to lose weight, but I find I am not as hungry. And… I believe I have lost some. Not much, perhaps five or six kilograms. I have not weighed myself precisely, but my clothes feel… looser. It is not a concern, I do not believe, just a consequence of the stress, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Loss of appetite, weight loss… Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am not. The previous doctor… he wanted me to take something for the blood pressure, but I… I did not like the idea. I try to manage it with diet and exercise. Mostly walking. And… I simply did not want the side effects. I prefer to avoid medication if possible.
DOCTOR: No medications. Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: My family… my mother had… problems with her memory, in her later years. Very vague. She would repeat herself, forget where she put things. The doctor said… old age. She did not seek treatment. My father was… healthy, I think. Heart problems, but nothing… mental. It was a long time ago. I remember details, you see, but… broad strokes are difficult.
DOCTOR: Family history of memory issues… Right. Now, Ms. Alvara, I’m going to do a brief cognitive assessment. Just a few simple questions, to get a baseline. It's fairly standard. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Questions are… fine. Though I must say, I am rather busy this afternoon. I have a meeting with the homeowner’s association at four o’clock. But… I will do my best. Please, proceed. I trust you are efficient?
DOCTOR: Efficient, yes. I assure you. Now, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… … It is… August… the second. Yes, August 2nd. 2025, of course. I always keep track of the date. Very important for meetings and deadlines. But… it took a moment. That is… unusual.
DOCTOR: Yes. Now, can you spell “world” backwards for me?
PATIENT: … Hmm. That is… trickier than it seems. Let me think… D-L-R-O-W. Is that… correct? It feels… strange to spell it backwards. I usually write forwards. For reports, you see.
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words. Listen carefully. Apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Is that… correct? I remember them, yes. But I had to… think about it. I usually remember things instantly. This is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Ms. Alvara, based on this brief assessment, and considering your reported symptoms, I believe a more thorough evaluation is warranted. It could be a number of things – stress, early cognitive decline, even vitamin deficiencies. To be certain, I recommend a referral to a neurologist. They can perform a full neurological exam and order appropriate imaging, such as an MRI. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: An MRI…… Imaging sounds… serious. And a neurologist… Is it… bad? I have a great many responsibilities, Doctor. I cannot simply… disappear for tests. I manage fifteen properties, you see. This is… inconvenient. But… if you believe it is necessary… yes, I suppose. But quickly, please. I have deadlines.
DOCTOR: "Quickly" is relative, Ms. Alvara. I will submit the referral electronically to Dr. Eleanor Vance. She’s quite good. I’ll also order a basic blood panel to rule out any deficiencies. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your stress where possible. And… try to get more sleep. I'll have the nurse provide you with the referral information and the lab requisition. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. Just… information about Dr. Vance, and how long the wait might be. And the lab… is it far? I must be efficient with my time. Fifteen properties, you understand. Thank you for your… assistance. I trust this will be resolved quickly. I have a meeting at four.
DOCTOR: The nurse will provide all of that information. And Ms. Alvara, I must remind you that medical timelines are not always… predictable. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
