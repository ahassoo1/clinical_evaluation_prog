DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s good to meet you too, Doctor Osterholm. Well, it’s this itch. Everywhere, really. It’s been going on for… oh, let me think… about three weeks, I’d say. Started on my arms, and now it’s all over. It's not painful, just… incredibly annoying.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, all over… annoying, not painful. Okay. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm. Changed… let me see. Not really. I’ve been keeping to my usual routine. I go for a walk every morning, read the paper… I did switch laundry detergents about a month ago, now that I think about it. A new brand, on sale at the store. Could that be it? I honestly don’t know. I’ve never had this problem before.
DOCTOR: A new detergent… that’s a good place to start, I suppose. Though, it’s not always the culprit. Do you use any new soaps, lotions, or anything else on your skin?
PATIENT: No, nothing new there. Same old stuff. I use a basic bar soap, and sometimes a little hand lotion in the winter when things get dry, but I haven’t used any lotion for months. Just the soap, really. And, you know, I'm pretty careful about what I put on my skin. My wife… well, she was a nurse, and she always stressed the importance of that. So I’m usually pretty good about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And this itch… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's pretty constant, actually. It’s not like it flares up and then goes away completely. It’s just… always there. Sometimes it’s worse than others, like after I’ve been sweating, or if I get a little warm. But it never really goes away completely, even when I'm trying to relax. It’s driving me a bit crazy, to be honest. I haven't slept properly in days.
DOCTOR: Constant, worse with sweat… sleeplessness. Okay. Let's take a look at the skin, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds good. I'm happy to do whatever you need. I'm just hoping we can figure out what’s causing this. It’s… well, it’s unsettling, you know? I'm usually a pretty healthy guy.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just get up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Just let me know if you need me to move a certain way or anything. I’m a bit… stiff these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s have a look… Hmm. I see some very mild redness, but nothing particularly alarming. No visible rash, blisters, or anything like that. Is it itchy everywhere – even your back, your chest?
PATIENT: Yes, it’s pretty much everywhere. My back is definitely itchy, and my chest too. It's even on my legs, although it's not as bad there. It's hard to scratch everything, you know? I feel like I’m constantly fidgeting. It’s… just an all-over sensation. Not painful, just… relentlessly itchy. And it's getting harder to concentrate on things.
DOCTOR: Okay. And no fever, chills, or any other symptoms accompanying this itch?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No fever, no chills, no other symptoms at all. Just the itch. I’ve been checking my temperature regularly, just in case, but it’s been normal. And I haven’t felt sick or anything. I'm eating normally, sleeping… well, trying to sleep… and my energy levels are okay. It’s just this constant irritation. It's baffling, really. I’ve never experienced anything like it. I mean, I’m 53 years old, and I've had my share of minor illnesses, but never something like this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it doesn't seem to be anything visually dramatic. Given the lack of other symptoms, and the timing with the new detergent… it’s possible it's a simple contact dermatitis. However, we can’t rule out other things. We’ll need to do some blood work just to be safe.
PATIENT: Blood work… okay. That sounds sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out. So, what exactly will the blood work tell us? Is it looking for allergies, or something else? And will it take long to get the results? I have a bit of a schedule to keep, you know. Not urgent, but… I like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: The blood work will give us a general overview, check your liver and kidney function, rule out any underlying systemic issues, and give us a basic allergy panel. It’s mostly to exclude other causes. As for allergies, it won’t be a comprehensive allergy test, but it can give us some clues. Results usually take about 3-5 business days, depending on the lab. I'll have the nurse draw the blood before you leave. In the meantime, I recommend stopping use of the new detergent immediately and switching back to what you were using before. We'll see if that makes a difference.
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Stop the detergent, blood work, and wait for the results. 3-5 days… I can manage that. And switching back to the old detergent is easy enough. I just hope it’s that simple. I really don’t like the idea of this lingering on for weeks. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to figure this out. Can the nurse just take a small amount of blood? I'm not particularly fond of needles, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, just a standard blood draw. I’ll make a note to the nurse to be gentle. And you’re welcome. We’ll get to the bottom of this. We'll also prescribe a topical hydrocortisone cream to help alleviate the itching while we wait for the results. It’s over-the-counter strength, but it can offer some temporary relief. Do you have any allergies to medications, especially topical creams?
PATIENT: No allergies to medications that I know of. I've had a few prescriptions over the years, mostly for blood pressure, but never had a reaction to anything. And I haven't used any topical creams regularly, so I definitely haven't encountered anything that caused a problem. Hydrocortisone cream… okay. That sounds good. Anything to get some relief from this constant itching. Thank you again, Doctor. I'm starting to feel a bit more optimistic already.
DOCTOR: Good. Alright, I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood, and she’ll give you the prescription for the cream. If the itching gets significantly worse before the results come back, or you develop any other symptoms – fever, rash, blisters – please call the office immediately. Otherwise, we’ll just wait for the lab work. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and your time. Just getting some idea of what might be going on is a huge relief. I’ll stop the detergent, use the cream, and wait for the blood work. And I’ll definitely call if anything changes. Thank you again. I suppose I should go and see the nurse now, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. The nurse is just outside. She'll get you sorted. And don't hesitate to call if you think of anything else. Have a good day, Mr. Ferneding.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
