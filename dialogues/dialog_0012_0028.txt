DOCTOR: Hi Nadene, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away, and my heart… it hasn’t been feeling the best lately either. It feels a little weak, you know? I’ve had a cough for… oh, let me think… maybe six weeks now?
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough for about six weeks and some heart palpitations, or a feeling of weakness?
PATIENT: Weakness, yes, that’s a better way to put it. Not exactly palpitations, more like… tired. My heart feels tired, and then the cough just makes everything worse. It’s a dry cough mostly, doesn’t bring up much. I used to be able to walk to the market every day, but now… it takes me a while to get my breath back.
DOCTOR: Okay, six weeks of a dry cough, and you've noticed some fatigue and shortness of breath that's impacting your daily activities, like walking to the market. Can you tell me a little more about the cough?
PATIENT: Well, it’s worse when I lie down, definitely. I have to prop myself up with pillows to sleep comfortably. And it seems to get a bit worse in the evenings, too. Not a terrible cough all the time, but enough to keep me from resting easy. It doesn't really hurt, just… irritating. I've tried some cough drops, but they don’t seem to do much good.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse when lying down and in the evenings. No pain with the cough, just irritation. And the cough drops aren't helping much. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the cough and fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My ankles have been a little swollen lately, now that you mention it. Not terribly, but I can definitely tell they’re puffier than usual. And I’ve been feeling a little bit more breathless than normal just doing things around the house. It's like I'm always a little out of breath, even when I haven’t been doing anything strenuous.
DOCTOR: Okay, ankles swelling and increased breathlessness with minimal exertion. That's good information. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh yes. Well, about ten years ago, the doctor told me I had something wrong with my heart. Congestive heart failure, I think he called it. He put me on some medicine for it, a water pill mostly, and I’ve been taking it ever since. I’ve had a couple of other things over the years, but nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, congestive heart failure diagnosed about ten years ago, and you've been on a water pill since then. Do you remember the name of the water pill, or any other medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have a list here somewhere. Ah, here it is. Furosemide, that’s the name of the water pill. And… Lisinopril. Those are the two I take regularly. Sometimes I take Tylenol for my arthritis, but that’s about it. And I haven't changed the dose of either one in a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Furosemide and Lisinopril, consistently taken. Good. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not that I know of. I've been lucky that way. The doctor always asked when he first prescribed everything, and I haven't had any bad reactions. No allergies to food either, come to think of it. Just a sensitive stomach sometimes, but that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, just a couple more questions about your background. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Oh, yes! A hysterectomy, a long time ago. Must be… forty years now? And I had my appendix out when I was a little girl, but that was so long ago I barely remember it. Nothing else, not that I can recall. Everything else has been just little things, nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, hysterectomy forty years ago and appendectomy in childhood. And finally, can you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she had high blood pressure, and she had a heart problem towards the end of her life. She wasn’t as lucky as I have been. And my father, he had diabetes. That runs in the family, I think. Most of my brothers and sisters were healthy, though, thankfully. No heart trouble like my mother.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of high blood pressure and heart problems in your mother, and diabetes in your father. Thanks for sharing that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your ankles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds good, Doctor. Do whatever you need to do. I’m here to help you figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Your breathing sounds a little congested, and I can hear a bit of extra fluid around your lungs. And I'm feeling some swelling in your ankles. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m hearing and feeling now, it sounds like your congestive heart failure may be worsening. The cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and ankle swelling are all consistent with that. Do you know when was the last time your heart failure was checked?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good. Let me think… the last time I saw the cardiologist… oh, it must have been… two years ago, maybe three. He said everything looked stable then, and I’ve been taking my medicine regularly. I just thought it was getting older, you know? But it sounds like it’s more serious than that. What does this mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been two to three years since your last cardiology follow-up. It’s definitely possible your condition has changed since then. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some tests. We'll need a complete blood count , a basic metabolic panel , an EKG to look at your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to see how much fluid is in your lungs. I also want to check a BNP level, which is a blood test that helps us assess the severity of your heart failure. Would you be able to get those done today at the lab down the hall?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like a lot of tests. But if that’s what you think is best… yes, I can go to the lab. Is it down the hall, like you said? I can manage. I just hope it’s not too serious. What will those tests tell you? And what happens after that?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s just down the hall to the left. The lab technician will draw some blood and take some quick measurements. Those tests will help us to see how your kidneys are functioning, check for any signs of infection, assess your heart rhythm, and most importantly, get a more accurate idea of how severe your heart failure is right now. Once we have the results back, we can discuss the best course of action. It’s possible we’ll need to adjust your medications, or perhaps refer you back to the cardiologist for further evaluation. In the meantime, it’s important to monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant swelling in your legs and feet, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. So, watch for worse breathing, chest pain, and more swelling. I can remember that. Will the lab call me when the results are back? Or do I need to call you? And… how long will it take, usually, to get the results? It's just… I don't want to worry my daughter unnecessarily. She’s been a big help with everything.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. The lab will send the results directly to me here at the clinic. Usually, it takes about 24 to 48 hours to get everything back. I will review the results as soon as they come in and then my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. You don't need to worry about calling me directly. And it’s good that you have your daughter's support. It's always helpful to have someone to help you through these things. In the meantime, try to limit your salt intake and weigh yourself every day. If you notice a sudden weight gain, that could be a sign of fluid retention, and you should let me know right away. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, limiting salt and weighing myself. I can do that. I used to weigh myself every day when the doctor first diagnosed me. And my daughter will help me keep track of everything. She’s very good with that sort of thing. So, I go to the lab, they draw blood, then your nurse will call me in a couple of days. And if things get worse… go to the emergency room. I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor Yoshino. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nadene. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before my nurse calls. And remember, if you experience any worsening symptoms, please don’t delay—go to the emergency room. We'll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I'll talk to you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will.
