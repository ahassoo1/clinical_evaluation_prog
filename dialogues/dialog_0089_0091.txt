DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, lately… I does be very, very thirsty. Always wantin’ a drink. And I feel hungry all the time too, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just… not right, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Constant thirst and hunger, even after eating… that's definitely something we should look into. And how long have you been experiencing this, Bianca?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It start… maybe about two months now? Slow, slow at first. I thought it was just the heat, you know? But it gettin’ worse and worse. Now I does wake up in the night wantin’ water. And I feel weak sometimes too, if I don’t eat.
DOCTOR: Alright, two months of increasing thirst and hunger, waking up at night thirsty, and some weakness if you don’t eat. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – how often you’re going, the color, anything like that?
PATIENT: Urine? Let me see… I does go to the bathroom… normal amount, I suppose. Maybe a little more often than before, now that I think on it. And the color… it look alright. Not dark or nothin'. Just… yellow, like it always is. I haven't really been payin' much attention to it, to be honest. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Bianca. It's perfectly normal not to focus on those details unless something feels off. Okay, so normal urine volume, maybe slightly more frequent, and normal color. Have you had any changes in your weight, either gaining or losing, over these past two months?
PATIENT: Weight… hmm. I does cook a lot, you know? My husband like my cookin’. I ain’t really weigh myself lately. Maybe… maybe I put on a little weight? But I can't say for sure. Everything just feel… off, like I said. It hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible slight weight gain, but uncertain. And you mentioned feeling "off" generally. Any other symptoms at all – blurry vision, slow-healing cuts, frequent infections, anything like that?
PATIENT: Blurry vision… no, not really. My eyesight always been a little bad, so I does wear my glasses. Cuts… well, I get little scrapes now and then, from the garden. Heal normal, I think. Infections? Not that I know of. I does try to keep things clean, you know? I ain't been sick or nothin'. It just this thirst and hunger botherin' me. And I feel tired sometimes, but who doesn't?
DOCTOR: Alright, no blurry vision, normal wound healing, no recent infections, and some general fatigue. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment, Bianca. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… nothin’ major. I does have a little pressure sometimes, my husband always tellin’ me to watch the salt. And my knees does bother me in the cold weather. But that's it, really. I haven’t been to the doctor in a long time, to be honest. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat my food and I get my rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, some occasional high blood pressure and knee pain. And you haven't been to the doctor recently. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never had no surgeries. And I never been in the hospital, thank goodness. I does try to avoid the doctor when I can, if that makes sense. I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded, you know? But this thirst… this is worryin’ me. It just ain’t normal.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Let's talk about your family, Bianca. Is there anyone in your family with diabetes, or any history of kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother… she had some trouble with her legs, towards the end. But I don't know what it was exactly. And my cousin, on my father’s side… I think he had some sort of sickness with the sugar? He always had to be careful what he eat. But that was a long time ago. I don't know much about it, to be honest. My family don't really talk about these things, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, possible family history of diabetes, but uncertain. And finally, Bianca, can you tell me about what a typical day of eating looks like for you?
PATIENT: Well, I does get up and have a little coffee with a biscuit. Then, for lunch, I cook a big plate of rice and peas, maybe some chicken or fish, and a salad. I like to cook plenty of food! For dinner, it depend. Sometimes it rice again, sometimes stewed chicken, sometimes roti. I does eat a lot of carbohydrates, I suppose. And I like a little sweet treat after dinner, maybe a piece of cake or some mango if it in season. My husband, he love my cookin', so I cook for him. He does eat everything I make.
DOCTOR: Okay, a typical day includes coffee and a biscuit, a large lunch with rice, peas, and protein, and a large dinner also often with rice and protein, and sometimes a sweet treat. That gives me a good picture. Now, I’d like to ask about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements.
PATIENT: Medications? No, I don't take no medications. Not for anything. I does take a little vitamin C sometimes, when I feel a cold comin’ on, but that's it. I don’t like takin' pills, you know? I prefer to let nature take its course. I does drink a lot of bush tea, though. Different kinds for different things. My husband does take some pills for his pressure, but not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional vitamin C and bush teas. And your husband takes medication for high blood pressure. Finally, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I can eat anything. I does get a few mosquito bites now and then, but that’s it. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thank goodness. I does try to stay away from things I don't know, but I haven't had no allergies, not ever.
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca, that's very helpful. Given your symptoms of increased thirst and hunger, along with a possible family history of diabetes and your diet, I think we need to run some tests to rule out diabetes. We'll also do some basic blood work to check your kidney function and overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sound alright. If that’s what you think best. I just want to feel better, you know? This thirst… it just won't go away. So, whatever tests you need to do, I does do it. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. We’ll start with a blood glucose test to check your sugar levels. I’m going to draw a little blood now. Also, I'll need a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup and you can go to the restroom when you’re ready. The lab will also need a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. While you're getting the urine sample, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs and feel your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that alright. Blood test, urine sample… whatever you need. I does trust your judgment. My heart been feelin' alright, but you can listen if you want. And you can feel my tummy too. I just hope it ain't nothin' serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Lungs sound a little congested, but not overly concerning at this point. Now, let’s listen to your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but a little tender here on the right side. Nothing major, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, could you please go to the restroom and collect a urine sample for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I go to the restroom now. I'll bring back the sample when I'm done.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Bianca. Okay, everything looks normal here. Now, we’ll send these samples to the lab, and we should have the results back in a couple of days. I'll give you a call as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I'd like to recommend that you try to reduce your intake of sugary drinks and carbohydrates and drink plenty of water. We’ll discuss the results and a plan of action when I call. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You explain everything very clear. Reduce the sugar, drink more water… I can do that. Thank you for takin' care of me. I does appreciate it. I just hope it ain't nothin' serious. I'll wait for your call then. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bianca. I understand your concern, and we'll get to the bottom of this. We’ll take things one step at a time. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as increased weakness, blurred vision, or confusion – please don’t hesitate to contact my office immediately. Here’s my card with the office number. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’ll discuss everything thoroughly when I call with the results. Have a good day, Bianca. And please, remember to drink plenty of water.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you very much. I will drink more water, I promise. And I will wait for your call. Have a good day too, you as well. Bye bye to you too!
