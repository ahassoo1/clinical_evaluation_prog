DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s this ringing in my ears. It's been happening for a bit now, and it's starting to get on my nerves, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears. And how long is “a bit now”?
PATIENT: Hmm... maybe like, three weeks? It started after a really loud wedding, actually. I was helping set up the sound system and it was pretty intense. It wasn’t constant at first, just after loud noises, but now it seems to be there most of the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks, and it started after exposure to loud noise at a wedding. That’s helpful. Is it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly my right ear, yeah. Sometimes I notice it a little in the left, but it’s definitely worse on this side. It's not a loud ring, more like a high-pitched whine, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A high-pitched whine, primarily in the right ear. Has your hearing felt diminished at all, besides the ringing?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… now that you mention it, yeah, a little bit. Sounds just don't seem as... clear, maybe? It's hard to explain. Like things are muffled sometimes, especially after being around noise. But it could just be my imagination, honestly. I work as a waiter, it's pretty loud in the restaurant all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, some difficulty with clarity, especially after noise exposure. We'll definitely look into that. Any dizziness, nausea, or feeling off-balance?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Nothing like that at all. Just the ringing and... not hearing as well, like I said. It’s just annoying, you know? Makes it hard to concentrate. I'm divorced, and honestly, I just want to get back to normal. It’s another thing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright. No dizziness or nausea, just the ringing and some muffled hearing. And it's impacting your concentration. Have you tried anything to alleviate it so far?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I mean, I've tried to avoid loud noises when I can, but that’s hard with my job. I haven't taken anything or anything like that. I didn't really know what to do, that's why I came to see you. I just hoped it would go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay. No prior attempts to treat it. Let’s do a quick ear exam and a hearing screening to get a better picture of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just want to figure out what's causing it, hopefully it's nothing serious. I have to get back to work later today, so the quicker, the better, if that’s okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand you need to get back to work. Okay, let's take a look. I'm going to gently insert this into your ear to look at your eardrum. It might feel a little cool. Your ear canals and eardrums look normal. No signs of infection or wax buildup. Now, let’s do a quick hearing test just to get some baseline numbers. We'll do this in the sound booth right next door. It involves wearing headphones and indicating when you hear tones. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Headphones are fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long, that’s great. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Alright, have a seat. I’m going to put these headphones on for you. There will be beeps and tones at different pitches and volumes. Just press the button when you hear a sound. Don’t worry if you miss some - it’s perfectly normal. I’ll be right outside if you need anything.
PATIENT: Okay, done. All finished. That was a lot of beeps! Hopefully, you got what you needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Yes, that gives us a good starting point. The hearing test shows some high-frequency hearing loss in your right ear, which correlates with your report of tinnitus and difficulty with clarity. Given the timing – the wedding and the loud noise – it’s very likely this is noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus. It’s not uncommon, unfortunately. It's good that you didn’t experience any vertigo. This suggests that the issue is isolated to the hearing and isn't affecting your balance. We can try to manage the tinnitus and prevent further damage. Would you like me to explain some options?
PATIENT: Yeah, please. Anything to make it stop, honestly. And to keep it from getting worse, like you said. I appreciate you explaining it, it’s good to know what’s going on. I just want to get back to normal as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, unfortunately, there's no "cure" for tinnitus, but we can manage it. The main goals are protecting your hearing and finding strategies to cope with the ringing. First, hearing protection is critical. I recommend wearing earplugs or earmuffs whenever you're exposed to loud noises – at work, concerts, even using lawnmowers. Second, there are several therapies that can help you habituate to the tinnitus – meaning your brain learns to filter it out. This includes tinnitus retraining therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and sound therapy. Third, we can explore some medications to manage any anxiety or sleep disturbance that may be associated with the tinnitus. I’d recommend starting with hearing protection and potentially a referral to an audiologist for more in-depth evaluation and management of the tinnitus. They can fit you with custom earplugs and discuss the therapy options in more detail. What do you think about that?
PATIENT: That all sounds reasonable, Doctor. Definitely the earplugs, for sure. I didn’t even think about custom ones. The therapy sounds good too, if it can help me ignore it. I’m a bit wary of medication, if we can avoid that, that'd be good. So, earplugs and the audiologist first, right? How do we go about that? Is it covered by my insurance?
DOCTOR: Yes, earplugs and the audiologist are a good first step. I’ll write you a referral to a reputable audiologist in the area. As for insurance coverage, let me quickly check your benefits. Okay, it looks like your insurance does cover diagnostic audiological evaluations and custom hearing protection with a copay of $50. We can also submit a pre-authorization for the custom earplugs to ensure coverage. Here's the referral. They'll schedule an appointment for a comprehensive hearing evaluation. They can then discuss the best options for custom earplugs and therapy based on your individual needs. Do you have any questions about the referral or the process?
PATIENT: Perfect. $50 is fine, I can handle that. Thank you for checking. No, I think that covers everything for now. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It’s a relief to have a plan. I think that’s all I needed. I’m glad I came in. Do I need to follow up with you after seeing the audiologist?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I'm glad we could get a plan started. Yes, I’d like to see you for a follow-up appointment in about 6-8 weeks to discuss the audiologist's recommendations and assess how you're doing. We can also address any other concerns you may have. I’m going to schedule that now. Does mid-September work for you?
PATIENT: Mid-September is fine, yeah. Whatever works on your end. I'm just glad to finally have a bit of direction with all this. Thank you again, Doctor. I think that's everything for today. I should get going and try to avoid loud noises as much as I can!
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. I've scheduled you for September 15th at 10:00 AM. You can sign in at the front desk when you arrive. And yes, avoiding loud noises is crucial. Remember, prevention is key. Take care, Jaylyne. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Alzoubi. I will do that. Have a good day!
