DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Or, is it Tasmia?
PATIENT: Tasmia. Just Tasmia is fine. Look, I got things to do today, so if we could just get this over with, that’d be great.
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. Efficiency is important. So, what brings you in today, Tasmia?
PATIENT: My husband made me come. He says my blood pressure is too high. Honestly, I feel fine. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sometimes it's good to have someone looking out for us. High blood pressure often doesn’t have symptoms, which is why it’s important to check it regularly. Do you happen to know what your blood pressure reading was that concerned your husband?
PATIENT: No. He just...showed me a number on that little machine he got. I don’t really do numbers. Is it bad? He was making a big deal out of it.
DOCTOR: Well, it's good that he's paying attention to your health. Numbers can be helpful. We'll check it ourselves today and see what it is. Before we do that, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No. Never. And honestly, I’ve never felt sick enough to need a diagnosis. I work outside, I’m active. This is probably just a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a complete picture, are there any other medical conditions you’ve been treated for, or any surgeries you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Just the usual bumps and bruises from the job. I’m a civil engineering tech, so I’m out in the field all the time. Not sitting in an office, thank goodness. Look, can we just take whatever test you need to take and get this done?
DOCTOR: Alright. Before we proceed, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Nothing. I don't take pills. Never have, never will, if I can help it. My grandma always said real medicine comes from the land, not a bottle. Honestly, all those things just sound like trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. I eat whatever’s put in front of me. I haven’t had a problem yet. Though, I don’t care for those fancy city spices. Give me chili peppers any day. This is getting ridiculous. What exactly are we trying to figure out here?
DOCTOR: We're just gathering information to understand your overall health, Ms. Dudney. Since your husband is concerned about your blood pressure, we want to rule out anything serious. Now, a quick family history question: Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: My dad… he liked his salt. And he wasn't exactly a health nut. He worked construction his whole life. But that was a long time ago. He’s gone now. My mom… she was pretty healthy, I think. Didn’t really bother with doctors much either. Look, is this going to take much longer? I have a site inspection this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Not much longer. Just a few more questions, then we'll do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I’m a professional. I need to be clear-headed for my job. My husband would have a fit if I did any of that. And frankly, I don't need anything to mess with my head. This whole thing is… insulting. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, just a general question: how would you describe your typical diet and exercise routine?
PATIENT: Look, I work outdoors. That is my exercise. And I eat when I’m hungry. Mostly whatever’s quick and easy. Sandwiches, things like that. Sometimes my husband cooks something fancy, but I prefer just getting something done. Are we almost finished? I really need to go. This is a complete waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief exam. Then we’ll go from there. It won’t take long. Please, have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Just...be quick. I’m not comfortable sitting around in these places.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just relax your arm for me, please. Deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft. Your blood pressure is elevated – 160 over 95. That is higher than normal, and explains your husband’s concern. Your pulse is also a bit fast. Now, this isn’t necessarily an immediate emergency, but it does require further investigation. Do you have any headaches, vision changes, or chest pain at the moment?
PATIENT: Headaches? No. Everything looks fine, as usual. Vision's good, always has been. And chest pain? No. I told you, I feel fine. This machine is probably wrong. It's probably one of those cheap things. I don’t understand why we’re even bothering with this.
DOCTOR: It’s important to confirm these readings, and to rule out any underlying causes. We can repeat the reading in a few minutes, and then I'd like to order some basic blood work and an EKG to assess your heart function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? An EKG? Seriously? This is getting ridiculous. What are you trying to find? I feel perfectly healthy! My husband is just a worrier. I don't need all these tests. Look, can’t we just…ignore it? Maybe it was something I ate. A spicy burrito, maybe? .
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand your frustration, and I respect your feelings. However, consistently high blood pressure can lead to serious health problems if left untreated – stroke, heart attack, kidney failure. Ignoring it is not a safe option. The blood work and EKG are relatively simple and will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. It’s better to be proactive and address this now, rather than waiting for a potential emergency. I want to make sure you’re healthy. Are you willing to consider these tests?
