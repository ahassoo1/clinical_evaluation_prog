DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, my back… it’s been botherin’ me somethin’ fierce lately. Lower back, mostly. Feels… old, I guess. Like it’s gonna break when I bend over. It’s just… not good.
DOCTOR: "Old," you say. Alright. And how long has this "old" feeling been bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Not bad at first, just a little stiff. But it’s gotten worse each month, I think. Now it hurts to even… garden. I like my tomatoes, you see. I used to be able to do all the work myself.
DOCTOR: Six months, gradually worsening. And gardening is becoming difficult… I see. Can you describe the pain specifically?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a sharp pain, not really. More like a dull ache. A heavy ache. And sometimes, when I try to stand up straight after bendin’… oof. Like somethin’ clicks in my back. Not a good click, you know? Makes me kinda scared to move. It doesn’t go all the way down my legs, though. Just… in my lower back.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, six months’ duration, aggravated by bending, with a… “clicking” sensation. No radiation down the legs, you said. Have you tried anything to alleviate the pain so far?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. My daughter, she gave me some of those… what do you call ‘em… ibuprofen? Those little white pills. They help a little, for a few hours. But then the ache comes back. And I try to be careful, not lift nothin’ too heavy. Mostly. But the tomatoes… they need pickin’! I also rub it sometimes. Just… rub my back. Doesn't do much, though.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen provides temporary relief… Rubbing it doesn’t seem to help much. Alright. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever had any back problems before—injuries, surgeries, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, not really. I pulled a muscle once, a long time ago. Workin’ in the fields when I was younger. But it healed up quick. Nothing like this. My mother, she had trouble with her bones when she got old, but I don't know what it was. Just… brittle, she said. She had to be real careful. I don’t think it was like this, though. It wasn’t her back, as much as… everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. A muscle pull in the past, but nothing significant. Your mother had some bone issues… Do you have any other medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, arthritis, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables from my garden! Doctor told me years ago my cholesterol was a little high, but it went down when I started walkin’ more. And… I don’t know. I just get tired easy, now. But that could be my age, right? I’m seventy-seven years old, Doctor. Things just… wear out.
DOCTOR: No major medical conditions… slightly elevated cholesterol managed with walking… fatigue consistent with age. Do you take any medications currently, besides the ibuprofen when you need it?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Just the ibuprofen when my back flares up. And… a little bit of fish oil, sometimes. My daughter says it’s good for your heart. But I forget to take it half the time. Old age, you know. My mind… it doesn’t work like it used to. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: Fish oil… Occasionally. Alright. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any. I eat almost anything. Except maybe lima beans, but that's just 'cause I don't like 'em. No reactions to any medicine, never. I can take pretty much anything, I think. Well, except maybe if it makes me sick. That would be bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Let's move on. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination of your back, if that’s alright with you. I'll just have you lie down on the examination table, and we’ll see what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Anything you need. I'll just… lie down, right? It might take me a minute… my knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Vankampen. No need to rush. I’ll be right over when you're ready. And just so you know, I’m going to palpate your spine, assess your range of motion, and do a few neurological tests. Just to see if anything is pinched or compressed.
PATIENT: Oh. Palpate… neurological… Just… feel my back and move it around? Is that right? It doesn't sound too bad. Just let me know if it hurts too much, Doctor. I don’t want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Yes, essentially. I’ll be gentle. Now, if you could lie face down, please. And let me know immediately if anything causes pain. Now, I’m going to start by palpating your lower back. Hmm. There’s some tenderness here, on the left side. And some muscle spasm. Alright, Mr. Vankampen, does this hurt?
PATIENT: Oof! Yes, that one… a little. Not terrible, but… definitely something there. It feels… tight. Like a knot. Right there… yes, that’s the spot. It hurts when you push. Like someone’s been… squeezin’ it for a long time.
DOCTOR: Tenderness with palpation over the left lumbar spine… muscle spasm present. Alright, Mr. Vankampen, can you try to bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oof! Oh dear… I can't… I can't reach my toes anymore. Used to be able to, years ago. It hurts to bend like that. A sharp ache in my lower back. Oh… oh my. That wasn't good. I think I pulled somethin’. Just a little.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion, with pain on forward flexion. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs. Just relax. Reflexes are normal, bilaterally. And sensation is intact. Alright, Mr. Vankampen, I think I have a pretty good idea of what’s going on. It seems you have a muscle strain in your lower back, likely aggravated by gardening and bending. It doesn't appear to be anything serious, such as a pinched nerve or a fracture.
PATIENT: Oh… a muscle strain. That doesn’t sound… too bad. So… what does that mean? Do I need… surgery? Or medicine? I just want to be able to pick my tomatoes again, Doctor. That’s all.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Vankampen, you absolutely do not need surgery. And while medicine can help with the pain, it’s not a long-term solution. It’s a muscle strain, as I said. Essentially, you've overstretched or torn a muscle in your lower back. That’s why it hurts to bend and move. The good news is, most muscle strains heal on their own with rest, ice, and over-the-counter pain relievers. We'll focus on managing the pain and inflammation, and then gradually increasing your activity level. I recommend rest for a few days, applying ice packs to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day, and taking ibuprofen as needed. And, of course, avoid any activities that aggravate your pain, such as gardening and heavy lifting. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Rest, ice, ibuprofen… and no tomatoes. I understand. But… how long will it take? Will I be able to garden again this summer? My tomatoes are almost ready, Doctor. They’re my best crop yet. Maybe I can just… ask my daughter to pick them for me?
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say precisely how long it will take, Mr. Vankampen. Most muscle strains improve within a few weeks, but it depends on the severity of the injury and how well you follow the recommendations. As for your tomatoes… asking your daughter to pick them for you is a perfectly reasonable solution in the short term. I recommend starting with gentle stretches and low-impact exercises once the pain subsides. But you need to listen to your body and avoid pushing yourself too hard. I'll also give you a handout with some basic exercises you can do at home. I am also going to give you a referral for physical therapy. A therapist can teach you proper lifting techniques and help you regain your strength and flexibility. And I'm prescribing a stronger pain reliever, just in case the ibuprofen isn't enough. Here you go. Follow these instructions carefully, and I expect to see improvement within a few weeks. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… physical therapy. That sounds… like a lot. Okay… I’ll try. I’ll listen to my body. And I’ll ask my daughter about the tomatoes. No, I don’t think I have any other questions, Doctor. Just… thank you. For not makin’ me have surgery. And for the handout. Hopefully, it has pictures. My memory… you know.
