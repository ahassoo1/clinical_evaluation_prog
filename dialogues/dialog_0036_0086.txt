DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, like we talked about. I’m Kahrin, by the way. Can we just… get right to it? I have a pretty packed day.
DOCTOR: Of course, Kahrin. No problem at all. I understand you’re eager to get this sorted. Just to confirm, you're here for the results of the blood work and urine analysis we ordered on July 26th?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. July 26th. I remember exactly when it was, the lab was really busy that day. So, what did they say? Everything okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s go over these results. Overall, most of your routine blood work came back within normal limits. Your complete blood count, metabolic panel, and thyroid function were all within the expected ranges. However, there were a couple of things that I want to discuss with you. Your urine analysis showed a slightly elevated level of protein. It’s not dramatically high, but it’s enough to warrant a bit more investigation. Also, your Vitamin D level was quite low. Before we jump to any conclusions, can you tell me if you’ve noticed any swelling, particularly in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No swelling, not that I've noticed. I'm on my feet a lot for work, running logistics, so I'd probably feel it if there was. And honestly, I don’t really pay much attention to my ankles unless my shoes are pinching. Protein in the urine… is that bad? I'm not really a medical person, so… what does that mean? And Vitamin D… I work indoors mostly, does that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know about the ankles. And you’re right to ask about the protein – it's good you’re asking questions. Protein in the urine, called proteinuria, can be a sign of kidney issues, but it can also be caused by things like dehydration, strenuous exercise, or even stress. Because it’s a small elevation and you haven't noticed any swelling, it’s likely not something serious right now, but we want to rule out anything concerning. As for the Vitamin D, you’re spot on. Working indoors means you're not getting as much sunlight exposure, which is the main way our bodies produce Vitamin D. It’s important for bone health, your immune system, and even your mood. Before we decide on a course of action, could you tell me a little bit about your diet?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… reassuring, I guess. Stress, yeah, I get a lot of that. Logistics is… complicated. My diet? Um… it’s pretty basic. I try to eat healthy, but it's hard when you're always running around. Lots of quick things – sandwiches, salads if I have time, some pasta. I drink a lot of water. I don't really eat a lot of fish, and I definitely don't take any supplements. Is fish good for Vitamin D? I should probably write some stuff down, I always forget everything.
DOCTOR: It is good to be proactive, and it’s perfectly normal to forget things, don’t worry about it. Stress can definitely play a role in the protein levels, so that’s good to keep in mind. Yes, fatty fish like salmon, tuna, and mackerel are excellent sources of Vitamin D. But it’s tough to get enough from diet alone, especially if you don’t eat it often. To get a clearer picture, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing diagnosed. I've been pretty healthy, honestly. I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, that sort of thing. But nothing serious, no chronic conditions, no surgeries. My family… my mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had some issues with his knees when he got older, but nothing major. I go to the dentist regularly, if that counts. I haven't seen a doctor in… a couple of years, probably. Just for check-ups. Is this taking long? I really do need to get going.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Kahrin. We're almost done. Just a few more questions. Knowing your family history is helpful. And regular dental visits definitely count! Okay, so no current medical conditions, no surgeries, family history of high blood pressure and knee problems. Good. Have you ever had any allergic reactions to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing I know of, anyway. I haven't ever had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat whatever, take any medication without problems. I've had the usual antibiotics, pain relievers… nothing weird. I'm pretty boring, medically speaking. Can we talk about what we're going to do now? Like, do I need more tests? Medication?
DOCTOR: "Boring" is good! It means things are likely uncomplicated. Okay, so no allergies, no medications currently. Given the slightly elevated protein in your urine and the low Vitamin D, I'd like to order a repeat urine test in a week to see if the protein level has changed. That will help us determine if it was a one-time occurrence or something we need to investigate further. We'll also do another Vitamin D level check at the same time. I'm also going to recommend a daily Vitamin D supplement – 2000 IU should be sufficient. You can get it over the counter at any pharmacy. In the meantime, just try to stay well hydrated and manage your stress levels as much as possible. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. Repeat urine test, Vitamin D supplement. I can do that. I’ll pick up the supplement on my way home. How often do I need to come back after that? I really don't want to make this a frequent thing. And is there anything else I should be worried about? Honestly, I’m just stressed about having something wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm glad that sounds manageable. We'll take things one step at a time. After the repeat urine test and Vitamin D level check in a week, we'll review the results. If the protein level has gone down, we can simply monitor it periodically with a urine test every six months. If it remains elevated, we might consider a referral to a nephrologist – a kidney specialist – just for a more thorough evaluation. Right now, there's no need to worry about anything major. The slight elevation in protein could be due to a number of harmless factors. We are being proactive to rule out anything serious. Stress can actually worsen these results, so let's try to focus on managing that. Do you have any methods you find helpful for stress relief?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not really. Work is… stressful. I try to get enough sleep, but it’s hard. I walk sometimes. That's about it. Okay, so one week, repeat tests. And if it's still high, I see a specialist. That's all I need to know right now, I think. Do I need anything in writing? Like, instructions for the tests? And the supplement dosage? I always forget these things. Can we just… finish up? I really need to go. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That's perfectly understandable. Here’s a lab requisition form for the repeat urine test and Vitamin D level check. It also has instructions on how to prepare for the test, and the recommended Vitamin D dosage is clearly written. I’ll also print out a summary of our discussion today, including these instructions and a note about the potential referral, just for your records. It was a pleasure meeting you, Kahrin. If you have any questions at all before your next appointment, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here are the forms. Feel free to take your time getting settled.
PATIENT: Thank you. That's really helpful. I appreciate you not making me feel like I'm dying. Okay, I think I’m good. I really need to run. Bye, Doctor Bacy.
