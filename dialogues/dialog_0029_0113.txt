DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I’m Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s…it’s the bladder, I suppose. I just…go. A lot. More than I used to, that’s for sure. It’s a nuisance, really. Old age, I reckon. Everything starts to go, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay. A change in your bladder habits…more frequent urination. And you feel this has come on with age?
PATIENT: That’s right. Can’t say when exactly it started, mind you. Things blur after a while. But it’s definitely more than it used to be. Wakes me up at night sometimes, too. My wife gets annoyed, naturally. She says I disturb her sleep. Women. Always complaining.
DOCTOR: Right, waking you up at night – nocturia, we call it. And is it a full emptying each time, or just a little bit at a time?
PATIENT: Noct…what now? Never you mind with the fancy words, Doctor. Just…most of the time it's not a full emptying. Feels like there’s always a little left. Annoying, that is. Like a leaky bucket, I tell ya. Not a good feeling, not a good feeling at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so incomplete emptying. And how much fluid are you typically drinking throughout the day?
PATIENT: Oh, I drink…well, I drink what I always drink. Coffee, mostly. A few glasses of water here and there. Not excessive, I wouldn't say. Used to have a bit more vodka, but my wife put a stop to that. She’s got me on a tight leash, that woman. Not that I'm complaining. Much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Coffee can certainly contribute to increased urination. Let's try to get a better picture. Do you experience any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not exactly. Just…a bit of a weak stream, sometimes. Like trying to water the garden with a kinked hose. And it takes a bit to get going, you know? Have to wait a moment. Not comfortable, but not painful. Is that what you’re asking about?
DOCTOR: Okay, a weak stream and hesitancy – difficulty starting. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color? Smell? Doctor, I don’t stare at my urine, you know. I go to the bathroom, I do my business, and I’m done with it. I suppose it looks…yellow. Like it always does. And smells…like urine. Is that what you want to know? This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Let me ask you this – have you had any recent fevers, chills, or lower back pain?
PATIENT: Fevers? Chills? No, nothing like that. I haven’t been sick a day in my life, practically. Well, maybe a little cold now and then, but nothing serious. And back pain…a bit of an ache sometimes, but that’s just from working in the garden, you know? Old age creeping in. It's just a bit of wear and tear. Nothing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’d like to do a quick prostate exam. It will give me a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A…a what exam? Doctor, are you sure that’s necessary? I haven’t…I don’t particularly like the sound of that. Is there anything else we can do? I'm a farmer, you know. I'm used to fixing things myself. I don't need someone poking around down there!
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Segretto. It's not the most comfortable exam, I'll admit. But it’s a very important part of evaluating urinary issues in men your age. It helps me rule out some potential causes and ensure nothing serious is going on. It takes just a moment. If you’re still uncomfortable, we can certainly discuss alternative tests, but it will likely delay getting to the bottom of this. Would you like me to explain the exam a little more, so you know what to expect?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Explain it, then. But make it quick. And don’t go poking around too much, understand? I’ve got things to do. The tomatoes aren’t going to pick themselves. And don’t think I haven't heard about these…unpleasant procedures. My brother-in-law…well, let's just say I'd rather not repeat what he told me. Just get it over with. And be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course. It will be quick and as comfortable as possible. I'll explain everything as I go. I’ll be wearing gloves, and I'll use lubricant. I simply need to feel the size and shape of your prostate gland. It won’t be painful, though you may feel some pressure. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Just...how long will this take? And will I need someone to...drive me home? My wife will have my hide if I take too long. And...and if it is something bad...what then? Just tell me straight, Doctor. I don't like beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: It will only take a minute or two, Mr. Segretto. And no, you shouldn’t need anyone to drive you home. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but if it is something requiring further investigation, we'll discuss the options together. I'll order some blood work to start, just to get a baseline. It could be a simple enlarged prostate, which is very common with age, or a urinary tract infection. We’ll know more after the exam and the blood tests. If you’re ready, we can proceed. Just lie on your side with your knees bent.
PATIENT: Fine. Let's get it over with. But be quick about it, Doctor. And gentle. Very gentle. I haven’t got all day, you know. The tomatoes…
