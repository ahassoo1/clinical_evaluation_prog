DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sucich. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's these hiccups! They just won't stop. Been going on for… well, a good few days now, I reckon. Not painful, just… irritating. Like a little fish flapping around in my chest, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, hiccups. Yes. Well, they’re usually not serious, thankfully. A few days is… longer than I’d expect, though. Can you tell me a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, it's good to know they're not usually serious. I worry sometimes, you see. Old habits. Anyway… let me think. They started Tuesday, I believe. I was having lunch with my daughter, Elina, and just… hic… started. At first, I thought it was just something I ate, but it hasn't gone away with resting. I've tried holding my breath, like people always say, and drinking water upside down... nothing seems to work. They come and go, but they’re pretty constant, especially when I'm talking. hic See? It’s awful when I’m trying to have a nice conversation.
DOCTOR: Tuesday… alright. And you've tried the usual remedies. Holding your breath… drinking water… anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… Elina suggested a spoonful of sugar, but I don't really have a sweet tooth, and it didn't do a thing. Oh! And I tried startling myself, you know? My grandson jumped out and scared me half to death, but still… hic… hiccups! It was a bit much, really. I told him not to do that again. He's a good boy, just a little… enthusiastic. I haven't taken anything for them, mind you. No pills, no potions, just trying to ignore them, which is proving rather difficult.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no medications. No other symptoms accompanying the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, nothing else at all. No heartburn, no tummy trouble, no shortness of breath... just these pesky hic hiccups! I feel perfectly fine otherwise, really. A bit tired, maybe, but that’s just old age catching up with me, I suspect. I've been sleeping alright, though. And my appetite's good. I had a lovely mango this morning. It's the season, you know. A good mango can fix almost anything, except, apparently, these hiccups! hic
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said you've had a good appetite… any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Not really, I don’t think. I haven't been weighing myself regularly, mind you. But my clothes still fit, and I haven't noticed anything different. I used to weigh myself after my divorce, but that was… a long time ago now. It's best not to dwell on those things, eh? I’m a bit taller than most women, you see, always have been. Around 5’10”, I reckon. And I was always… solid, let's say. Never a waif, that's for sure! hic About 180 pounds? Give or take a few. It fluctuates, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sucich. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh yes, good question. Let me think... Just my blood pressure medication. Lisinopril, I think it's called. Been on it for years, keeps things nice and steady. And I take a calcium supplement with Vitamin D. My doctor recommended it, you know, for my bones. Old age, again. That's about it, though. No herbal remedies, no fancy potions, nothing like that. I like to keep things simple. hic I’m a pretty straightforward woman, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And no allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thank goodness. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. She was a very practical woman, my mother. Fijian women are tough, you see. We have to be! hic Lots of sun and hard work. I've never fainted, never had a rash, nothing like that. I'm pretty sure I'm alright in that department. Though, I do get a bit sunburnt easily, if I'm not careful. But that’s just my skin, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a listen to your chest, just to make sure everything sounds clear. And I'll take your pulse and blood pressure quickly. Then we’ll see.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I always trust a doctor's judgement. hic Go right ahead, I'm ready. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your lungs sound clear, thankfully. Pulse is a bit fast, 88, but not terribly concerning given your age. Blood pressure is 140 over 90, a little elevated, but consistent with your usual readings, according to the chart. Let's rule out anything serious, though. I’m going to order a basic blood panel: CBC, electrolytes, kidney function tests. Just to be sure. We’ll also do a chest x-ray.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. I'm glad you're being so careful. hic A little worried about the x-ray, I must admit. Never had one before, I don't think. Is it… painful? And the blood tests... will they take much? I don’t like needles very much, if I'm honest. But I'll do whatever you think is best, of course. I just want these hiccups to go away! hic It's getting rather embarrassing.
DOCTOR: No, the x-ray isn’t painful at all, Mrs. Sucich. You just stand still for a moment while the machine takes a picture. The blood work...yes, there will be a needle, but it’s quick. A small prick, that's all. The phlebotomist is very good. Honestly, these tests are just to rule out anything unusual causing the hiccups. Most of the time, they just… go away on their own. I suspect that’s what will happen here. But we need to be certain. I'll write up the orders now. The nurse will take you down to the lab and radiology.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s reassuring to hear, Doctor. “Small prick,” you say? Good. hic I can handle a small prick. And you think they’ll just go away on their own? That's what I'm hoping for, really. I'd much rather not fuss about with tests and needles if I can avoid it. hic I suppose it's best to be safe, though. If you think it's necessary. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. What happens after the tests? How long will I have to wait for the results? And can I still have lunch with Elina tomorrow? I promised her… hic I really don't want to cancel.
DOCTOR: The results should be back by tomorrow afternoon, Mrs. Sucich. And yes, you can still have lunch with Elina. Don't cancel your plans. It’s unlikely these tests will reveal anything serious that would prevent that. The nurse will let you know when you can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, if the hiccups become severe—if they interfere with your breathing or cause you significant distress—go to the emergency room immediately. Understood?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful news about lunch! Thank you, Doctor. Elina would be so disappointed if I cancelled. hic And yes, I understand about the emergency room. Severe… breathing trouble. Got it. hic I'll be sure to go if that happens. It's just… exhausting, having them constantly. It's the constant interruption, you see. hic Makes it hard to concentrate, hard to enjoy a conversation. But I suppose that's just life, isn't it? Things always getting in the way. Well, I guess I'll go and see the nurse then. Thank you again, Doctor, for everything. You've put my mind at ease. hic I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sucich. The nurse will be right with you. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. And try not to worry too much. It’s likely nothing serious. .
