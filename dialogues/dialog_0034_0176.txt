DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's… the hiccups. They just won't stop. It’s been over two days now, and it’s really starting to get on my nerves.
DOCTOR: I understand. Hiccups lasting over two days can certainly be bothersome. Let’s try to figure out what might be causing them. To start, can you describe the hiccups themselves?
PATIENT: They're… normal hiccups, I guess? You know, the kind where your chest jerks and you make that “hic” sound. They come on randomly, not really triggered by anything specific that I've noticed. Sometimes they're just one or two, and other times they come in a whole bunch, one after the other. It’s mostly just annoying, but it’s hard to eat or even hold a conversation when I keep… hic… doing that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And you said they’ve been going on for over two days now, without any obvious trigger?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Over 48 hours, at least. I tried drinking water really fast, like my mother always told me to, and holding my breath, but nothing seems to work. I even tried getting someone to scare me, but… hic… even that didn't do it. Honestly, I'm starting to feel a bit silly trying everything!
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’ve tried some common remedies, but don't feel silly at all. Sometimes hiccups can be persistent. Let's go through some more details to see if we can identify a possible cause. Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major. I’ve been a little bit more tired than usual, maybe? And… hic… my stomach feels a bit bloated, but I ate pretty normally yesterday. I had some fish for dinner, and a salad with lunch. Oh! And I had a large glass of iced tea with lunch, a really sweet one. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good information, thank you. The iced tea, especially if it was very sweet, is worth noting. Bloating and fatigue could also be relevant. Now, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, I don't really have any serious medical problems. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that's it. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I don't take any regular medications, just an occasional pain reliever if I have a headache. And I'm not allergic to anything that I know of. I used to smoke, but I quit about fifteen years ago. hic… Doctor, is this going to take much longer? It’s getting really frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ivette, and we'll get through this. Knowing your history is helping us narrow things down. The gallbladder removal is good to know, and it's positive that you don't have any chronic conditions. We're almost finished with the initial questions. Let's talk about your family. Do you have any family members with similar problems, or any significant medical issues that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother used to get hiccups all the time, but she just shrugged them off. Said it was just something she lived with. My father had high blood pressure, and my brother has asthma, but neither of them really struggled with hiccups. Nothing else comes to mind, honestly. hic… I really don’t think it’s anything serious, do you? It just feels…random.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It’s good to know your mother had a history of hiccups, even if she didn’t seek treatment for them. And thank you for sharing your family history. Given what you've told me – the persistent hiccups, the bloating, the fatigue, and the fact that you’ve tried some home remedies without success – I'd like to do a quick physical exam just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want them to stop. hic… Please. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take a look. If you could just have a seat here on the table, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. We’ll start with your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay. hic … Here we go. I hope this doesn’t take too long. It’s getting harder to concentrate with these… hic… hiccups.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing sounds are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. Anything here?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s a little tender, right there. Not painful, exactly, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. And… hic… it feels a bit full there, too. Like something’s pressing.
DOCTOR: Alright, tenderness in the right upper quadrant, with a feeling of fullness. That could indicate some mild inflammation or discomfort in the liver or gallbladder area, even though you had your gallbladder removed some time ago. Given your symptoms and the physical exam findings, it’s unlikely to be anything serious, but to be on the safe side, I would like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. This will help us assess your liver function, rule out any underlying infection, and ensure there are no electrolyte imbalances. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. I’m happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel normal again. hic… This is really starting to wear me down. When will I get the results? And… is there anything I can do in the meantime? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, and we’ll work towards getting you feeling better. The lab work should be back within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, let’s focus on supportive care. Continue to drink plenty of fluids – water is best – and avoid sugary drinks, especially iced tea for now. Try eating smaller, more frequent meals instead of large ones. And avoid lying down immediately after eating. You could also try some ginger tea; ginger has anti-inflammatory properties that might help with the bloating and discomfort. But most importantly, try to relax and manage your stress. Stress can sometimes exacerbate hiccups. If the hiccups become significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms like fever, severe abdominal pain, or vomiting, please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. Does that all sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly manageable. Smaller meals, no iced tea, ginger tea… and try to relax. hic… Easier said than done, but I'll try. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and not dismissing this as just “hiccups.” I’ll wait for the nurse to call with the results. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I'm glad I could help. No, I don’t think there’s anything else for you to do right now. My nurse will give you instructions on how to access your lab results online, as well. I’ll make a note to follow up with you in a few days to see how you’re doing, regardless of the lab results. If you think of any other questions or if your symptoms change, please don't hesitate to call the office. Get some rest and try not to worry too much. I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Seil. I appreciate your kindness. I will. .
