DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. I feel fine.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to feel perfectly well even with high blood pressure, which is why it's important we investigate it further. While you feel fine, consistently elevated blood pressure can unfortunately lead to serious health problems down the line. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about when you first learned about your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Learned? The nurse took it this morning, and she said it was high. Before that, I hadn't really been checked in…years, probably. My husband makes me go sometimes, but I always tell him I'm perfectly healthy. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: I see. So this is a relatively new finding, taken by the nurse this morning. And it's been some time since your last routine check-up, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. And honestly, I don’t understand why it was so high this morning. Maybe the nurse was doing it wrong. She was new.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you mention that, Ms. Dudney. We always want to ensure accurate readings. However, even if there was a slight variation in technique, it's still important to investigate. Blood pressure can fluctuate for many reasons. To start, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I work outside, I’m active, and I eat…normal food. My husband tries to get me to eat those…organic things, but I don’t believe in all that. I'm healthy. I told you.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that. Being active and eating a balanced diet are certainly wonderful habits. "Normal food" is a good starting point. Could you describe a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, now you're asking me about food? Look, I eat what I want. Breakfast is usually coffee and a pastry if I have time. Lunch is a sandwich, maybe chips. Dinner…depends. Sometimes it’s steak, sometimes it’s pasta. I don’t track everything, and I don’t need to. I'm not…sick. Do you always ask people this much when they come in for something simple?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. It's not about assuming you're "sick," but rather gathering information to understand why your blood pressure might be elevated. Diet plays a significant role in overall health, and understanding your typical intake helps us determine the best course of action. Let me assure you, I’m not trying to make you feel unwell. But even a seemingly healthy diet can sometimes contribute to elevated blood pressure. To move forward, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. And ibuprofen when my back hurts from work. That's it. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I feel perfectly fine, and you’re asking me about my vitamins? Is this how you spend your days?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney, and I assure you I am taking your concerns seriously. It’s important to rule out any potential contributing factors, even seemingly minor ones, to ensure we address the root cause of the elevated blood pressure reading. Both multivitamins and ibuprofen can sometimes have an impact, and it's important for me to be aware of everything you're taking. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. Look, can we just…skip all this? Can’t you just give me something to lower it and be done with it? I have things to do. This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a quick solution, Ms. Dudney, but it's important to approach this carefully. Simply prescribing medication without a proper evaluation wouldn't be responsible care. We need to understand why your blood pressure is elevated before determining the best course of action. There are many possible causes, and the right treatment depends on the underlying reason. To help me understand things better, let's talk about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: My mother had…something. She was always sick. She went to the hospital a lot. But she liked to drink. I don’t know what she had, and frankly, I don't care. She wasn’t a healthy person. My father was fine. Worked hard his whole life. That's all I know. Can we please just wrap this up?
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that information. It's helpful to know about your mother’s health history, even if the details are limited. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health status, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll check your heart rate, listen to your lungs, and examine your overall condition. This will help me assess your blood pressure more accurately and rule out any potential underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. But I'm telling you, you're wasting your time. I'm perfectly healthy. I always have been.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney. Let's begin. I'm going to take your blood pressure again, and then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please relax and take slow, deep breaths. Your blood pressure is currently 162/98. That is elevated. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s faint, but worth noting. Your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Pulses are equal and strong in all extremities. Skin is warm and dry. Everything appears generally normal, Ms. Dudney, but the elevated blood pressure and the slight heart murmur warrant further investigation. I'd like to order some blood tests to assess your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and rule out any other underlying conditions. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Seriously? Fine. Whatever. Just…get it done. I have things to do, you know. This is costing me a whole day. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney, and I apologize for the inconvenience. These tests are necessary to get a clearer picture of your overall health and determine the best course of action. The lab technician will draw a small amount of blood. It should only take a few minutes. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and develop a plan together. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your sodium intake, increasing your physical activity if you are able, and trying to manage any stress you may be experiencing. I'll also provide you with a written summary of our conversation and the tests I've ordered. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
