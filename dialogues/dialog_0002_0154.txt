DOCTOR: Hi Claudene, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s my water. It’s been bothering me. Again. I… I think it’s the same thing as before, but I can’t quite… remember what it is. It just… hurts when I go to the bathroom. And feels… uncomfortable, all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're having some pain and discomfort with urination, and you've experienced this before. Let's try to figure out what's going on. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Pain… yes. It burns, mostly. Right when I start, and for a little while after. Not… terrible pain, but enough to make me… not want to go. And then, like I said, it just feels… achy, down there, all the time. It's been… a few days, I think? It’s hard to keep track, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Burning with urination and a general achiness – that definitely sounds uncomfortable. And it's okay if it's hard to keep track of the exact timing. A few days gives us a starting point. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain and discomfort?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think… Hmm. I think my water looks a little… darker than usual. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little tired. But I’m old, Doctor, so maybe that’s just… oldness. I don’t know. No fever, I don't think so. No… shaking, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, darker urine and some fatigue. Those are good things to mention. And it's good you haven't noticed a fever or shaking chills. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any lower back pain, or pain in your sides?
PATIENT: Lower back pain… sometimes. But I have bad back, always have. So it’s hard to tell if it's that pain, or… something else. Sides… not really. No, I don’t think so. I mean, not any more than usual. Oldness again, you know? Everything hurts a little.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be tricky to sort out new pain from existing discomfort. Okay, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, or had problems with your bladder before?
PATIENT: Oh dear… now you’re asking things I really can’t remember. I… I think so? A long time ago. Maybe. The doctor gave me… pills, I think? Orange pills. Yes, orange pills! And it… helped. But I don’t remember why I was taking them, exactly. It was… years and years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Orange pills for a possible urinary tract infection in the past. We'll keep that in mind. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've taken lots of pills over the years, and never had a… reaction, or anything. No, I don't think so. Nothing I remember, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… just a little something for my arthritis. A white pill. I take it every morning. That’s all, really. Nothing else. I try not to take too many pills, you know? Makes me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a white pill for arthritis. Good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just need you to lie down on the examination table, and I'll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. It’s just… I don’t like being poked and prodded, you know? But… do what you need to do, Doctor. Yes. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay, everything sounds normal there. Now, I'm just going to gently press on your lower abdomen to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Okay. That area feels a little tender. And I’ll just do a quick external exam. Okay, I'm going to collect a urine sample to send to the lab for testing. They can check for infection and other issues. Do you have a clean catch sample available, or would you like me to provide you with a cup?
PATIENT: Oh… it did hurt a little when you pressed there, yes. That’s where it feels bad. And… a urine sample? Yes, I can… try. I haven’t… collected one in a long time. Would you like me to go to the… little room? Yes. I think that's best. I'm a bit flustered now.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. Let’s get you settled in the restroom. I'll leave the instructions for the clean catch sample on the counter. Take your time, and let me know if you have any trouble. I’ll be right here when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… try my best. It’s just… getting old is hard. .
