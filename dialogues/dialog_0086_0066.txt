DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mastrantonio. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, for the past… oh, let me think… about three weeks now, I’ve been having this sensation in my back. It’s hard to describe, but it feels like it’s popping or clicking when I move certain ways. It doesn't hurt, exactly, but it’s… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Hmm, popping or clicking, you say. Three weeks. And it doesn't cause you any pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not pain. It’s more of a… a feeling, a mechanical sort of sensation. Like something is… releasing, maybe? It’s not constant, thankfully. Just when I bend over to pick something up, or twist a little too quickly. Does that make sense? I worry about it because I do a lot of physical work, you see. I repair electrical systems in trains, so bending and reaching are part of the job.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Mechanical sensation, not painful, triggered by bending and twisting… and it’s concerning because of your occupation. So, you're a train electrical systems repairman. And this started about three weeks ago, gradually?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct, Doctor. Gradual is a good word. It didn't just start one day, it sort of… built up. At first, it was very faint, barely noticeable. I thought maybe I just slept wrong. But it’s become more pronounced over the last few weeks. And yes, I repair the electrical systems in the trains. Quite a bit of climbing and maneuvering in tight spaces, as you can imagine. It is a physical job.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where exactly are you feeling this sensation?
PATIENT: It's… lower back, Doctor. Sort of on either side of my spine, where your belt would sit, if that makes sense. Not directly on the spine itself, but close to it. Sometimes it feels like it radiates a little bit to my hips, but mostly it’s centered in that lower back area. I can pinpoint it pretty accurately, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back, bilateral, around the belt line, sometimes radiating to the hips. Hmm. And have you experienced any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I've noticed. No numbness, no tingling, no weakness in my legs. No fever, no changes in my bowel habits… just the popping and clicking. It hasn't interfered with my work yet, but I'm concerned it will if it gets worse. I pride myself on being able to do my job safely, and I don't want to risk injuring myself.
DOCTOR: Right. No associated neurological symptoms, no systemic signs. Good. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to check your range of motion and palpate your back to see if we can isolate where this sensation is coming from. Could you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Palpate, you say? I’m happy to cooperate in any way that will help. Just let me know if I need to adjust my position.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mastrantonio. I’m going to gently feel along your spine and the muscles around it. Please tell me if anything feels particularly tender or painful. I’ll start just by observing your posture while you’re lying flat. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that's… not painful. Just the normal sensation of being touched. A little pressure, perhaps, but not unpleasant. It feels… well, normal. Is there a specific area you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And what about when I ask you to rotate your trunk?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this, Doctor? It feels… a little stiff, perhaps, but no sharp pain. I do notice the clicking sensation a bit more when I do that. It seems to be coming from the right side, specifically. Is that what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. I do feel some muscle guarding on the right side, and there's a slight tenderness to palpation there. Now, can you try bending forward and touching your toes, if you’re able?
PATIENT: I can try, Doctor. It’s a bit difficult, to be honest. It feels… tight. I can't reach my toes without putting a lot of strain on my back. The clicking sensation is also more pronounced when I bend forward. Is that what you needed?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. Limited forward flexion, and you’re experiencing the clicking sensation. Reflexes are normal bilaterally, and sensation is intact. Alright, Mr. Mastrantonio. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have a mechanical back strain, probably involving the muscles on the right side. It's not uncommon, especially given the physical demands of your job. However, it’s important to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: That's… reassuring, Doctor. A strain sounds manageable. What does that mean exactly, though? And what kind of things would we need to rule out? I appreciate you being thorough. Also, what sort of treatment would you recommend?
DOCTOR: Right. A muscle strain means that you’ve overstretched or torn fibers in the muscles supporting your spine. It’s not usually a serious injury, but it can be quite painful and debilitating. To rule out anything more serious, I’d like to get an X-ray of your lumbar spine just to make sure there aren’t any fractures or other structural abnormalities. We'd also consider an MRI if your symptoms don’t improve with conservative treatment, to assess for things like disc herniation or nerve compression. But let’s start with the X-ray. For treatment, I recommend the following: rest, ice, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen. You can also try gentle stretching and low-impact exercises, like walking. Avoid any activities that aggravate your symptoms. We can also discuss a referral to physical therapy if you're not seeing improvement after a week or so. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable. X-ray first, then we go from there. I’m happy to do whatever you recommend. Rest, ice, over-the-counter medication… and avoid aggravating activities. I can certainly manage that. How do we proceed with the X-ray? Do I need to change clothes, or is it a quick procedure? Also, is there anything I should avoid doing immediately before the X-ray?
DOCTOR: Good. Yes, for the X-ray, you’ll need to remove any metal objects, like belts, jewelry, or anything with metal fasteners. You don't need to change clothes, but if you're wearing anything with a lot of metal, like metal buttons, it's best to change into something else. There's nothing specific you need to avoid doing before the X-ray, just try to relax. The technician will position you and take the images. It's a quick procedure, usually takes just a few minutes. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they’re available, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Would you like me to schedule that now, or would you prefer to call the office later?
PATIENT: Scheduling now would be excellent, Doctor. That way, I won’t forget. Whatever time works best for you, I’m fairly flexible. I really appreciate you taking the time to examine me so thoroughly. It puts my mind at ease knowing we're taking a methodical approach.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mastrantonio. How about next Thursday at 10:00 AM?
PATIENT: Next Thursday at 10:00 AM sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you. So, just to recap: remove metal objects before the X-ray, and we'll discuss the results next Thursday at 10:00 AM. Is there anything else I should be aware of? .
