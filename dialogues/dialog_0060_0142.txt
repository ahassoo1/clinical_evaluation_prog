DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lawther. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Yeah, so... it's my head, mostly. I keep getting these really bad headaches. And, like, I get all sweaty when they happen, and my heart races. It's… not fun. I don't really remember when it started, to be honest. It's been a while, though.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay, headaches, sweating, racing heart… and you’re not sure when this started, just that it’s been going on for a bit. Can you describe the headaches themselves?
PATIENT: Um… they’re… really intense. Like, a throbbing pain, mostly on both sides of my head. Sometimes it feels like a pressure, too. It's hard to explain. And they can last for… hours, I guess? It kinda just depends. I usually have to lie down in a dark room. Does that make sense? I’m not good at describing things, sorry.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Lawther, don’t worry about it. Throbbing, both sides, pressure… lasting hours, requiring you to lie down. Okay. And do you notice anything that triggers these headaches?
PATIENT: Triggers? Jeez… that's a good question. Not really, not that I've noticed. I mean, sometimes they just… happen. I’ve tried thinking about it, but… I don't know. Stress, maybe? But I always feel a bit stressed, so that doesn’t really narrow it down, does it? I honestly can’t pin anything specific to it. I wish I could.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, stress is certainly a common one. And it’s not always easy to identify a specific trigger. Let’s try this: are there any other symptoms that happen with the headaches?
PATIENT: Symptoms… other than the sweating and heart racing? Let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, like I might be sick, but I never actually am. And… everything seems really bright, like light bothers me when it’s happening. Oh, and sometimes I get a little dizzy, too. Not like falling-over dizzy, just… off-balance, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea, sensitivity to light, and dizziness along with the headache, sweating and racing heart. Have you noticed any changes in your vision at all, like seeing spots or blurry vision?
PATIENT: Blurry vision… no, not really. Everything feels off, like I said, but I haven't noticed anything different with my sight, if that makes sense. I mean, I don't wear glasses or anything, so I wouldn't necessarily notice a change in blurry-ness. Does that help? I’m starting to feel a bit confused just thinking about it, to be honest. It’s like trying to remember a dream.
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Lawther. It’s alright to feel confused; headaches can be complicated. Let’s go through some more general things. Do you have any medical problems that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Uh… not really? I mean, I had my tonsils taken out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And I broke my arm once, but it healed fine. Nothing… ongoing, I guess? I don't really go to the doctor much. I kinda just try to tough things out. I’m not sure if that’s the right thing to do, but… that's how I've always done it. Oh, wait... my divorce was pretty rough on me. Does that count as a medical problem? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, broken arm, and a recent divorce. I understand that difficult life events can certainly impact your health. Let’s stick with medical history for a moment. Any family history of headaches, migraines, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mum got headaches sometimes, but she just used to take some pills and lie down. Nothing… serious, I don’t think. And my dad… he was pretty healthy, as far as I know. No, I don’t think anyone in my family had anything bad with their head. I mean, I'm not super close to my family, so I wouldn’t necessarily know if they did, would I? Sorry, this is probably not helpful. I’m really bad at remembering things.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Lawther. You're doing fine. No significant family history reported. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any supplements?
PATIENT: Um… no. I don't really take anything regularly. If I get a really bad headache, I might take some ibuprofen, but that’s about it. And I haven’t taken any in ages, actually. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. They always make me feel a bit weird. And no supplements, no. Just… nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications or supplements. And finally, do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies… uh, I think I’m allergic to… cats? Yeah, definitely cats. I get really sneezy and my eyes get itchy. Other than that… not that I know of. I haven't really had any bad reactions to anything. I think. It’s like, I don’t really go anywhere that would cause an allergic reaction, if that makes sense. Does cat allergies count? I mean, it's just a bit of sneezing.
DOCTOR: It does. Okay, Mr. Lawther, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best, really. I just want to figure out what’s causing these headaches. I'm kinda tired of feeling awful all the time. So, yeah, go ahead. What do you need me to do?
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to check your vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then, I’ll do a quick neurological exam, checking your reflexes, coordination, and strength. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, pulse is 88, temperature is 98.6, and respiration is 16. All within normal limits. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Like this? I think so. It's a little hard to focus, actually. Everything seems a bit… fuzzy. But yeah, I’m following it. Is that okay? Should I try harder? I’m sorry if I’m making this difficult.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Lawther. Just relax and follow my finger. Okay, good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that tight enough? I'm trying, but my hands feel a little weak, actually. I haven't been doing much lately, to be honest. Mostly just… sitting around. Sorry if it’s not very strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s fine. A little weakness, but not alarming. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please sit with your legs dangling?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Like this? It's a bit awkward, actually. I haven’t been sitting for very long lately. I usually lie down when my head hurts. Okay, go ahead. What are you looking for? I'm sorry if I’m asking too many questions. I just get a bit nervous when I’m at the doctor’s.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to ask questions, Mr. Lawther. It’s good you’re engaged. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Overall, your neurological exam is mostly normal, but there are some subtle findings. Given your history of headaches, sweating, racing heart, nausea, and sensitivity to light, and these exam findings, I suspect you may be experiencing tension headaches with some migraine features. However, given your report of weakness and diminished reflexes, and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order some blood work and a CT scan of your head. The CT scan will help us ensure there's nothing serious going on inside your skull. The blood work will check for any underlying infections or other medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan? And blood work? That sounds… serious. Is it something really bad? I mean, I feel awful, but I didn’t think it was… that bad. Is it going to cost a lot of money? I don’t have insurance, so… I’m kinda worried about the bill. I guess if you think it's necessary… but is there anything else we could try first? Maybe some medication or something? I just get a bit anxious about hospitals and stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lawther. It’s good you brought up the cost; that’s a valid point. We can discuss payment options with the billing department, and I’ll write a note explaining your uninsured status. As for the tests, I'm not trying to alarm you. However, given the subtle changes I found during the exam, it’s important to rule out other possibilities, like a structural problem or underlying medical condition. A CT scan is a relatively quick and painless procedure, and it will give us a clear picture of what's going on inside your skull. The blood work is also standard and will help us get a better understanding of your overall health. We can start with the blood work and discuss the CT scan after we get the results. In the meantime, I can prescribe you some ibuprofen for the headaches, but it’s important to remember that it’s just a temporary solution. Would you like me to write you a prescription for ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Okay… blood work first sounds… better. And yeah, ibuprofen would be good. Just to get me through. I guess if you think it’s necessary. I just wish I knew what was going on. It’s like a weight on my head all the time. Okay, blood work and ibuprofen. What do I need to do for the blood work? Do I need to fast or anything? And… when will I get the results? I’m sorry, I’m just asking a lot of questions. I just get a bit panicky when I’m unwell.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Lawther. It’s good to be informed. You’ll need to fast for 8 hours before the blood work – meaning no food or drinks except water. The lab is located just across the street, and you don't need an appointment. Here’s a requisition form with all the details. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back, and my office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they’re available. In the meantime, if your headaches worsen or you develop any new symptoms – like fever, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about those instructions?
PATIENT: Okay, 8 hours fasting, lab across the street, call in 24-48 hours, and go to the ER if it gets worse. I think that covers it. No, I don’t think I have any more questions right now. Thank you, Dr. Nooruddin. You’ve been very helpful, even though it’s a bit scary. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I guess I’ll go get the blood work done.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re welcome. Get the blood work done as soon as you can, and don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day.
