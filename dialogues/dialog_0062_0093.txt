DOCTOR: Hi Chanz, good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Right. Well, to be honest, it’s… everything feels a bit off. I keep hearing about optimizing things, you know? Sleep and… being fit. My wife used to handle all that. She had a real knack for it. Now… well, it's just not the same. It’s probably nothing serious, but I figured I should get it checked. It’s just… tiring, always being tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing a general sense of fatigue and things feel a bit disrupted since your wife was handling things. That's completely valid, and it's good you're coming in to get it checked out. "Tiring" is a good way to describe it – we want to figure out why you're feeling tired. To start, can you tell me a little more about this fatigue?
PATIENT: Ugh, where to begin? It's not like… collapsing tired, you understand. More… a constant drag. Like wading through something thick. I wake up feeling… not refreshed, exactly. Just… less tired than when I went to bed, maybe? And it doesn't really lift throughout the day. I get through things, I fix instruments, but it takes… effort. A lot of effort. It’s… irritating, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay, "constant drag" and "irritating" – those are helpful descriptions. It sounds like it's impacting your daily life, even if it's not debilitating. And it's not just about how much sleep you're getting, but the quality of it, right?
PATIENT: Exactly. Quality. That’s the word. She always talked about sleep cycles and… I don’t know, REM and all that. It all went over my head, honestly. I just slept. Now… I don’t know. I toss and turn a bit. Not every night, but enough to bother me. And I don’t feel… rested when I wake up. It’s like I haven’t even been asleep.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a tricky one. It started, really, after… well, you know. After my wife. It's been… a year and a half, maybe? Two years? Time sort of… blurs. At first, it was just grief, I assumed. But it hasn’t really… lifted. It’s just… settled into this constant state of… bleh.
DOCTOR: I understand. Grief can absolutely manifest physically, and it’s not uncommon for it to linger. It’s good you're acknowledging it hasn’t resolved and are seeking help. So, a year and a half to two years of this fatigue and disrupted sleep. Okay, besides the fatigue and sleep issues, have you noticed any other changes in your body or how you're feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My appetite isn't what it used to be. I eat, because I know I should, but I don’t really… enjoy it. And I’ve lost a bit of weight, I suppose. Nothing dramatic. My clothes just feel a bit looser. Oh, and… I used to walk everywhere. Enjoyed it, really. Now… I can’t be bothered. It feels like… too much effort. Honestly, everything feels like too much effort.
DOCTOR: Okay, loss of appetite, some weight loss, and decreased motivation to walk – those are all things we need to consider. Do you have any trouble concentrating or remembering things?
PATIENT: Concentrating? Remembering things? Doctor, you’re talking to a man who can barely recall what he had for breakfast! No, it's not… new. It’s always been a bit of a struggle, to be honest. But it’s… worse now, perhaps? I forget where I put my tools, things like that. I blame the… the general state of things. It’s all a bit of a fog, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like there are a number of things going on. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… not much, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… nothing serious. Oh, and I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. Aside from that… no. Nothing major. I’ve always been a healthy man. Or, I was a healthy man. Before… you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Appendectomy as a teenager, otherwise generally healthy. Any surgeries besides your appendix?
PATIENT: No, no. Just the appendix. Never had anything else done. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Though, I’m not feeling very lucky these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my parents are both gone now. Passed away years ago. And… my wife, of course. No siblings. No children. It was just the two of us, really. Which… makes things rather difficult, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It does, and I'm very sorry for your losses, Chanz. That’s a lot to carry. Did your parents have any significant medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had… arthritis, I think? In her hands, mostly. It bothered her in her later years. My father… he had high blood pressure, I believe. That’s about all I recall. They weren’t ones for talking about their ailments, really. Just… old age, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and high blood pressure in your parents. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. My wife always handled the medication, so I never really paid much attention to the labels. She was very careful about those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I haven’t taken a pill in… well, I can’t remember when. I don’t like taking medication, if I can avoid it. Always felt… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, not currently on any medications. Now, I’m going to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just take a general look. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Honestly, I doubt you’ll find anything. It’s probably just… old age creeping in. Though, I’m not that old.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 135 over 85. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your abdomen feels okay, though your bowel sounds are a little quiet. Reflexes are normal. I'm going to order some blood work, just to get a baseline and rule out anything obvious. We'll check your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… fine. Whatever you think is necessary. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not expecting much to come of it. I’m probably just… run down. It’s the grief, I tell you. It just won’t go away.
DOCTOR: I understand, Chanz. While grief can certainly have long-lasting effects, it’s important to rule out any other underlying causes for your symptoms. The blood work will give us a clearer picture. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend trying to get some gentle exercise, even just a short walk each day, and focusing on getting a regular sleep schedule, if possible. I know it’s easier said than done, but it can make a difference. We’ll discuss the results when they come back and create a plan from there. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions? No, not really. I suppose… will these tests actually find anything? I've had doctors poke and prod before, and it always comes back "normal." It’s just… tiring, the whole thing. I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s not too much to ask at all, Chanz. And I understand your frustration. It’s discouraging when tests come back normal, and you still aren’t feeling well. I'll be thorough in my review of your results, and if the initial tests don't reveal anything specific, we can explore other possibilities, including referral to a specialist if needed. We'll work together to figure this out. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a handout with some resources for grief support. It's okay to seek help, and there are people who can provide support during this difficult time. Do you have any questions about the handout or anything else we've discussed today?
PATIENT: Grief support… right. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. Honestly, I think I’ve grieved enough. It’s just… this feeling. It’s not sadness, exactly. It’s… emptiness. I suppose… no, I don’t have any more questions. Just… getting the results, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, Chanz. I understand. We’ll get those results to you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results once they are back. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’ll… see you when the results come back.
DOCTOR: Alright, Chanz. You take care. And remember, we’re here to help. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
