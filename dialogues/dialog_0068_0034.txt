DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Dr. Sham. I just... moved here. And I need to, like, get set up with a doctor, I guess? It's for Medicare. I don't really... remember what I'm supposed to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, a new patient visit, establishing care… and you’re here to get everything set up with Medicare. That’s perfectly fine. It can be a little confusing. So, besides establishing care, are you having any specific health concerns right now?
PATIENT: Not really… I mean, not that I remember. I work with… machines? Lots of fixing stuff. Sometimes my back gets a little sore, but that's just from bending over, I think. It goes away. Is that… something I need to tell you about?
DOCTOR: It's good to know. Back soreness can be from work, certainly. But even if it comes and goes, it's helpful for me to have a complete picture. Just to be thorough, can you describe the soreness a bit more?
PATIENT: Um… it's just… achey. Like, when I’ve been bending a lot, or lifting things. It's mostly in my lower back. And it feels better when I sit down, or when I take a break. It doesn’t… shoot pain, or anything. Just… tired. I don't know if that makes sense. Honestly, I usually just ignore it.
DOCTOR: That does make sense. Okay, so lower back ache, related to physical activity, relieved by rest… We'll definitely want to document that. Now, aside from your back, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sick? No, not really. I'm always a little tired, but that's just from working, I think. And sometimes my hands get… numb? But that's probably from holding tools all day. I don't know… I don’t really pay attention to stuff like that. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some numbness in your hands… We’ll include both of those. And you believe the numbness is related to your work?
PATIENT: I think so. It happens when I'm using tools for a long time, like… tightening bolts, or wiring things. It’s not all the time, though. It comes and goes. It doesn’t really bother me too much, so I just… keep working. Is that bad? Should I be stopping?
DOCTOR: It's good you're aware of it, Emileigh. Ignoring symptoms isn’t usually the best course of action, even if they’re mild. We should investigate the numbness a bit further, just to rule out anything more serious. Now, let's go over some basics. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… um… I don’t think so. I haven’t really taken much medicine in a long time. Maybe when I was a kid? I don’t remember. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. But I could be wrong. I forget things easily, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. We'll note that as well. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take something for headaches, if they’re really bad. But that's not very often. It's just… ibuprofen, I think? The regular kind. Is that important? I don't usually tell doctors about stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ibuprofen for headaches. It is helpful for me to know everything, Emileigh, even things that seem minor. It helps me understand your overall health picture. Now, have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Um… that’s… a hard one. I don’t really remember. I was pretty young when I left home. I think I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, maybe? But I don't really remember. Everything is kinda… blurry. I don't think I've had any serious illnesses. Just colds, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll document that as possible tonsillectomy in childhood. And no other major illnesses or surgeries reported. Now, is there any family history of significant medical conditions – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… oh boy. That’s… hard. I didn't really keep in touch with my family. I don’t really know much about their health. I don't think so. I don't remember anyone being really sick, but I could be wrong. Everything is so… far away. I'm sorry. I wish I could tell you more.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. It’s common not to have that information. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! No, none of that. Never. I don’t do any of those things. I work with machines, that’s enough excitement for me. It’s important to be careful, you know? Especially with my job.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. That's good to know. And finally, can you tell me a little about your work?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah! I’m a mechanical engineering technician. I fix things! Mostly big machines, like… factory equipment, or construction stuff. It’s a lot of bending and lifting, and using tools. Sometimes I have to go to different sites, so it’s not always the same thing. It’s… tiring, but I like it. I’m pretty good at it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, mechanical engineering technician, involves bending, lifting, and tool use. We've covered a lot. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Um… okay. Sure. That’s… fine. What will you do? Will it hurt? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles today, Emileigh. Just a basic check – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, looking at your ears, nose, and throat. I’ll also feel your abdomen and check your back. It shouldn’t hurt at all, just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. If you could sit up there for me, that would be great.
PATIENT: Okay… I’m a little nervous. But… okay. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, please?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Bowel sounds are normoactive. Lower back demonstrates mild muscle tension, no acute tenderness to palpation. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally in upper extremities, and 2+ in lower extremities. Neurological function appears intact. Ears and throat appear normal on visual inspection. Do you experience any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, that’s… a little sore. But it's okay. It always is. Like I said, from bending over at work. It’s just… a little achey. It’s not bad bad. Just… there. Everything else feels okay, I think. I don’t know much about… all this stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild tenderness to palpation in the lower back, consistent with history. That’s helpful. Based on what you've told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like you're experiencing musculoskeletal back pain, likely related to the physical demands of your job. It doesn’t appear to be anything serious at this time, but it’s important to manage it to prevent it from worsening. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Musculo… what? Does that mean I need to stop working? Because I can’t do that. I need my job. What do I do to… manage it? Like, what should I be doing? Is there a pill I can take?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't mean you need to stop working. "Musculoskeletal" just means related to your muscles and bones. We don't think you need to stop working, but we do want to prevent it from getting worse. For now, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen as needed for pain. Also, stretching and strengthening exercises for your back can be very helpful. I can give you some handouts with some basic exercises to try. It's also important to practice good posture and lifting techniques at work. As for a pill, you could continue the ibuprofen, but it's best to try the non-medication options first, as long as your pain is manageable. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… exercises. And good posture. I can try that. But… I forget things easily, you know? Will the exercises be hard to remember? And what if I hurt my back while doing the exercises? Is there someone I can call if I need help? I don’t really have anyone here.
DOCTOR: That’s a valid concern. The exercises are relatively simple, and I can give you a handout with pictures to help you remember. Start slowly, and don't push yourself too hard. If you experience any pain during the exercises, stop immediately. As for someone to call, my office number is on this paper. You can call if you have any questions or concerns, or if you experience any worsening of your pain. If your pain becomes severe, or if you develop any numbness, weakness, or bowel or bladder problems, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… office number. And stop if it hurts. No bladder problems. I think so. It’s a lot to remember, but… I’ll try my best. Thank you, Dr. Sham. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little better now. So… am I all set? Do I need to come back anytime soon?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. I'm glad I could help. You're all set for now. I'd like to see you back in six months for a follow-up, just to check on your progress. If your pain worsens or doesn't improve with these measures, please schedule an appointment sooner. I'll make a note for that six-month follow-up. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Six months. I’ll try to remember. Thank you again, Dr. Sham. You’ve been really kind. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emileigh. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything. You have a good day as well.
