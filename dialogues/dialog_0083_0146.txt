DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's good to meet you too. Well, to be honest, it's my muscles. They've been… weak, I guess is the best way to put it. It's been happening for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, “weak muscles” for a little while. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Sure. It started maybe… three months ago? It’s not like I can’t do things, but everything feels harder. Like, getting up from a chair takes more effort than it used to. Carrying groceries… even just walking up the stairs. It's not a sudden thing, it just… gradually got worse. No pain, just… tired muscles, and they don’t feel as strong as they should.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a gradual onset of weakness over the past three months, affecting activities like getting up from a chair, carrying groceries, and walking stairs. No pain associated with it. Is this weakness all over, or is it more pronounced in certain areas of your body?
PATIENT: It's… mostly in my legs, I think. And my arms feel it a bit too, when I try to lift things. It's not like I can't lift, but like I said, everything just takes more effort. It doesn't feel like it should. My hands are okay, though. I haven’t noticed any weakness there. Does that make sense? I'm trying to be specific.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. McKinnon. So, primarily legs and arms, with no noticeable weakness in your hands. Has this weakness been interfering with your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. Work is… okay, I mostly do appraisals, so it’s not super physical. But I used to help my neighbor with some yard work, moving stuff around, and I’ve had to stop doing that. It’s just… embarrassing, honestly, having to ask for help with things I used to do easily. And even just getting around feels slower. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. McKinnon. It's certainly concerning when your body isn’t performing as it should. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major, anyway. I had the flu a couple of times, but that's it. No chronic illnesses, no surgeries. I haven't been to a doctor in… probably five years, to be honest. I usually just tough things out. It's silly, I know.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Mr. McKinnon. Many people delay seeking medical attention. And that's perfectly alright. Have there been any illnesses in your family – perhaps a parent or sibling – that are similar to what you’re experiencing, or any significant neurological conditions like muscular dystrophy or multiple sclerosis?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My dad… he had some problems with his balance when he got older, but the doctors said it was just part of aging. Nothing like this, though. He never complained about muscle weakness. My mom was healthy as a horse, never sick a day in her life. And I don't have any siblings, so… no, I don’t think so. I don’t know of anything, anyway. I wasn't really involved in their medical stuff much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of similar conditions. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I live alone, in the city. I work most days, appraising cars. I try to eat pretty healthy – mostly chicken and vegetables, things like that. I don't drink much, maybe a beer once a week. And I don't smoke. I walk a lot, getting to and from work, but I haven’t been doing much exercise exercise lately, if that makes sense. Just the walking.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. McKinnon. So, generally healthy lifestyle, no smoking, moderate alcohol intake, regular walking, but not much dedicated exercise. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can take most medications fine, as far as I’m aware. I haven't needed much medication in my life, honestly. I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. I don't really believe in taking a lot of pills unless I absolutely have to. Just the way I am, I guess. I haven't taken anything regularly for years.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to assess your muscle strength, reflexes, and overall neurological function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Get it over with, I guess. I've got a lot to do today, but I understand it’s necessary. Just let me know what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. First, could you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Here we go. Feels a little unsteady, to be honest, but I'm here.
DOCTOR: Okay, this might be a little uncomfortable, but shouldn’t be painful. I'm just checking your reflexes. Good. Those appear normal. Now, I’m going to ask you to resist as I try to move your arms and legs in different directions. Just try to hold firm, and let me know if you feel any pain. We’ll start with your arms. Can you please extend your arms straight out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Okay, all set. Try and move 'em whenever you want. Just let me know if something hurts, like you said. It already feels a little weaker holding them like this, but… here we go.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm noting slightly decreased strength in both arms, particularly on your left side. It's subtle, but noticeable. Now, let’s check your legs. Could you please lie back on the table?
PATIENT: Okay, all set. Just let me know what you need me to do. Getting up is getting harder, so hopefully, I won’t need to do that too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you to try and push your feet against my hand like you’re pressing the gas pedal in a car. Good. And now, I’m going to check your muscle tone. Okay. Muscles feel… slightly diminished, but nothing major. Alright, Mr. McKinnon, that completes the physical examination. Overall, I'm finding some mild weakness in your arms and legs, with slightly diminished muscle tone. Your reflexes are normal, which is reassuring. Based on what you've told me and my findings, I have a few initial thoughts, but I'd like to order some blood work to help rule out any underlying medical conditions. This will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a vitamin D level. Additionally, I’d like to check your thyroid function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… thorough. Blood work is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what's going on. Is it something serious? I'm a bit worried now, if I'm honest. It's just… it's getting harder to do things, and that's scary. I’ve got a lot to do. So, what's the next step?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. McKinnon. It’s perfectly natural to feel anxious when experiencing unexplained weakness. And you're right to want answers. The blood work will help us rule out common causes, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or other underlying medical conditions. I'm going to order the blood work now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll need a small sample of your blood. It shouldn't take too long. Once the results are back – typically within 2-3 business days – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, it's important to avoid any strenuous activities that might exacerbate your weakness. Try to get plenty of rest, and maintain a healthy diet. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Just… avoid strenuous activity, rest, healthy diet. Got it. And 2-3 business days for the results. Okay. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and for not dismissing it. I’ve got a few things I need to get done, so I guess I'll head down to the lab. Is there anything special I need to do before the blood work? Like, fast or anything?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. I’m glad I could help. Yes, for this specific blood work, it's best if you fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. Please let the lab technician know you’re fasting for this test. Here's a lab requisition form with all the details. If you experience any sudden or severe weakness, or if you develop any new symptoms in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Fast for 8-12 hours, and call if anything changes. Okay, I can do that. Thanks again, Doctor. I appreciate it. I'll head down to the lab now. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. Please take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
