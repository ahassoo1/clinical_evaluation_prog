DOCTOR: Hello, Ms. Creagh. Welcome. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’ve been experiencing some…well, pressure in my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now. It’s not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable and frequent.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Frequent and uncomfortable pressure, alright. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, I believe, around the beginning of June. So, about two months now, give or take a week. At first, it wasn't too bad, just noticeable, but it's slowly gotten…more persistent, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, two months. And you said it’s become more persistent. Can you describe what you mean by "persistent"?
PATIENT: Certainly. It used to be I’d just feel the urge a little more often, and I could easily manage it. Now, I feel the need to go much more frequently, even if I’ve just gone. And sometimes… it feels like I don’t completely empty my bladder when I do go, if that makes sense? It’s a strange feeling.
DOCTOR: Right, so increased frequency, and a sensation of incomplete emptying. Do you notice any pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no pain. It’s never been painful, just… the pressure and the feeling that I haven’t fully emptied. And sometimes, just a general discomfort in my lower abdomen. Not sharp, just…present. Does that make sense? I’m trying to be as specific as possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. No pain with urination is good. General lower abdominal discomfort… alright. Are you experiencing any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of those. No fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. I feel perfectly well otherwise, just this bladder issue. My appetite is normal, I’m sleeping well… honestly, it’s mostly just this nagging feeling that’s concerning me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Changes in my urine… let me think. No, I don’t think so. The color seems normal, and I haven’t noticed any unusual odor, or… blood. Nothing obvious like that, no. It looks the same as it always does, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I’m married, and we are. I suppose that could be relevant? It’s been… consistent, if that matters. Nothing new or different in that area, though.
DOCTOR: Consistent. Alright. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you ever had any urinary tract infections, kidney problems, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: I haven’t had any urinary tract infections, thankfully. And no kidney problems that I’m aware of. I was diagnosed with mild hypertension a few years ago, but it’s well-managed with medication. Other than that… no major medical conditions. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. Do you want me to list the name of the medication I’m on for my blood pressure?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Certainly. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams daily. And no, I don't have any allergies to medications, as far as I know. I’ve never had a reaction to anything I’ve taken. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, 20mg. Alright, that's good to know. Any family history of kidney problems, bladder issues, or anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had some problems with frequent urination later in life, but it wasn't ever properly diagnosed. They just attributed it to aging, I believe. My father was perfectly healthy, no history of any related issues. And my siblings are also healthy, as far as I know. I don't believe there's a strong family history of kidney or bladder problems, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, how much fluid do you typically drink in a day?
PATIENT: I try to drink a good amount of water, probably around eight glasses, maybe a little more. I like tea as well, herbal tea, usually. I wouldn’t say I drink an excessive amount, but I definitely make sure I stay hydrated. I've always been told it's important, especially with the warmer weather.
DOCTOR: Okay. Eight glasses of water and tea. Ms. Creagh, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. That will involve listening to your abdomen and a pelvic exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I understand. Please, go ahead. I trust your professional judgement. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on the table for me, please. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen. I'm listening for any abnormalities. No tenderness to palpation, thankfully. Bowel sounds are normal. Okay. Now, I'm going to need you to bend your knees and relax your muscles. I'll perform a quick pelvic exam. This may be a little uncomfortable, but I’ll be as gentle as possible. I'm assessing the bladder and the surrounding structures. Your pelvic muscles seem normal. I do note some mild tenderness on palpation of the bladder, but nothing significant. Now, I'm going to order a urinalysis, just to rule out any infection. I'm also going to check your post-void residual, which measures how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. We'll want to rule out any issues with complete bladder emptying.
PATIENT: That sounds very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you being so careful. A urinalysis and checking the residual amount makes perfect sense. What would those tests indicate, if something was wrong? I just like to understand what we're looking for.
DOCTOR: Certainly. A urinalysis will check for bacteria, blood, or other signs of infection. If we find bacteria, it indicates a urinary tract infection. Blood in the urine could indicate infection, kidney problems, or other issues, though it doesn’t always mean something serious. As for the post-void residual, if a significant amount of urine remains in your bladder after you urinate, it could indicate that your bladder isn’t emptying completely. This could be due to a number of factors, such as a weakened bladder muscle, a blockage in the urinary tract, or nerve damage. It's important to remember that these tests are just a starting point. If the results are abnormal, we'll need to do further testing to determine the cause of your symptoms. It's likely nothing serious, but it's best to be thorough. We'll take it one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly to collect a urine sample. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: That explanation is very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. I think I understand. No, I don't believe I have any further questions at this time. Just let me know when the nurse is ready. I appreciate your time and patience with me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse will be with you shortly. In the meantime, I’ll review your chart further while you wait. We'll get this figured out, Ms. Creagh. .
