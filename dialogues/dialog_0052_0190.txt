DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s about my balance, I suppose. It’s been… off. I feel unsteady, like I might fall sometimes. It's rather worrying, to be honest. I don’t… I don't quite recall when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling unsteady is certainly concerning. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. Let's try to pinpoint what might be causing this. You mentioned it’s been happening for a while, and you’re unsure when it began. Could you describe what you mean by “off”?
PATIENT: Hmm… “off.” That’s a good way to put it. It’s not a constant thing. Sometimes I feel perfectly normal, and other times… it’s like the room is tilting just slightly. Or maybe I’m tilting. It’s difficult to explain. It doesn’t happen when I’m standing still, usually. More when I walk, or try to turn quickly. And… sometimes I feel a bit dizzy with it, but not always. Does that make any sense? I apologize for being so vague. My memory… isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Snerling, and you're not being vague at all. It's very helpful to understand the specifics, and describing it as the room tilting, or feeling unsteady when walking and turning, is quite informative. And it’s perfectly alright that recalling details isn’t easy; we’ll work through this together. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if anything specific seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you to say, Doctor. I appreciate that. Let me think… specific triggers. It’s difficult. I work on an oil rig, you see. Rotary drill operator. It’s… a physically demanding job, lots of movement. Perhaps it’s related to that? It happens on the rig sometimes, but also… at home, when I’m just trying to do simple things. I don't recall a particular event that started it, just that it… gradually became noticeable. I suppose being tired makes it worse, definitely. And… loud noises, perhaps? The rig is very noisy, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Snerling. That's very helpful. Working as a rotary drill operator, with the physical demands, movement, noise, and potential fatigue, is important information. We’ll certainly consider those factors. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history… that’s… a bit complicated. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly in… a long time. My husband… he handled all of that. He passed away a few years ago, and after that… it all became rather overwhelming. I do have private insurance, thankfully. I don't recall any major illnesses. I had the usual childhood things, I suppose. I did break my arm once, when I was a child. And… I have been taking some over-the-counter pain relievers for aches and pains from work, but that’s about it. I really can’t recall much else. I apologize. Is there… a specific thing you’re looking for? Perhaps if you tell me what you need to know, it will jog my memory.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Snerling. It’s perfectly alright. Losing a spouse is incredibly difficult, and it's understandable that medical matters might have taken a backseat. Don't worry about recalling everything at once. Let's start with allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything that I’m aware of. No food allergies, as far as I know. And I haven’t had any issues with medications. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times, when I’ve been sick, but never had a problem. Honestly, I’m fairly certain I don’t have any allergies. My husband always said I was… remarkably resilient. It's just… remembering everything is becoming increasingly difficult. I apologize for repeating myself.
DOCTOR: You're not repeating yourself, Ms. Snerling. It’s important to be thorough, and I appreciate your honesty. Knowing you have no known allergies is helpful. Now, regarding your current medications. You mentioned taking over-the-counter pain relievers for aches and pains. Could you tell me what specifically you've been taking, and how often?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I take… ibuprofen, I believe. The regular kind, you can buy at any drugstore. And sometimes… naproxen. My husband used to get me both. I take them… when my muscles are sore after work. Some days it’s just once, other days it’s twice. It depends on how demanding the shift was. I don’t really keep track, to be honest. Just enough to get through the pain. I don't take them every day, but… fairly often. Does that make sense? I fear I'm being terribly vague again.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly clear, Ms. Snerling. Intermittent use of ibuprofen and naproxen for work-related muscle soreness is helpful information. We’ll need to consider that when we explore potential causes for your balance issues. Now, let's move on to your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of balance problems, dizziness, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… That's… a difficult question. My mother passed away when I was young, and I didn’t know my father. My husband’s family… I didn’t get to know them very well. I suppose… his aunt had some issues with her vision, later in life. And I think his grandfather had something… with his nerves, perhaps? But I’m not entirely sure. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t particularly close to them. I’m afraid I don’t have much information. I truly apologize for being so unhelpful. It feels like my memories are… fading away.
DOCTOR: You are not being unhelpful at all, Ms. Snerling. You've provided valuable information, and it's understandable that recalling family history is difficult under these circumstances. We can work with what you do remember. To get a better understanding of your overall health, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh. That's… a straightforward question. No, I do not smoke. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine on special occasions, but that’s it. And absolutely no recreational drugs. I’ve never had any interest in those. I lead a fairly… simple life. Work, and… trying to keep things together. I suppose that's it. I do drink a lot of coffee, though. To stay awake during long shifts. Would that be relevant?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Snerling. No smoking, rare alcohol consumption, and no recreational drugs is good information. And the high coffee consumption is relevant, as caffeine can sometimes contribute to dizziness or balance problems. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your symptoms. You mentioned feeling unsteady when walking or turning. Does that come on suddenly, or gradually?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. It usually comes on… gradually. It doesn’t happen all at once, like I’ve suddenly lost my footing. It starts with a slight feeling of dizziness, perhaps. And then my balance feels… off. It’s difficult to explain. It’s more of a feeling than a sudden event. Sometimes it’s worse than others, but it rarely comes on completely unexpectedly. It's… a creeping feeling, I suppose. And it usually happens when I’m moving around. Standing still is usually okay. Does that make sense? I apologize for being so unclear. It’s difficult to articulate these things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Snerling. The gradual onset, with a creeping feeling of dizziness, is very helpful information. It helps us to narrow down potential causes. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’d like to assess your balance and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I understand that’s part of figuring out what’s going on. I’m ready whenever you are. I just hope… I hope it’s not something serious. I need to keep working. It’s… important. I apologize for stating the obvious, but… it’s true.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Snerling. We will do our best to determine the cause of your balance issues and find a solution that allows you to continue working. Let's begin. Please have a seat. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Now I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I'd like to assess your balance. Could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here I am. It’s a bit… difficult, to be honest. I feel rather fragile today. Do you need me to do anything specific? I’m ready when you are, Doctor. Please, just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you. No need to rush. Just stand comfortably. First, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes and extend your arms straight out in front of you. This is to assess your balance with your vision removed. Okay, go ahead and close your eyes. Hmm… a slight sway, but generally stable. Now, please open your eyes. Okay. Now, could you please walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for about ten steps?
PATIENT: Alright. Here I go. This is… a bit unsettling. It’s difficult to maintain my balance without being able to see. There. I completed it, I think. It wasn’t particularly graceful, but I managed to stay on my feet. It's… difficult to walk without looking where I'm going, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, you did very well, Ms. Snerling. It was a bit unsteady, which is what we expected. Now, could you please stand with your feet together and close your eyes again?
PATIENT: Alright. Here I am, trying to remain still. This is… rather precarious, I must admit. It feels as though I’m going to fall over at any moment. I’m trying my best to keep my balance, Doctor. It’s… difficult.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're doing well. It’s alright. Just relax. Okay, you can open your eyes now. That’s all for the physical examination. Thank you for your cooperation, Ms. Snerling. Based on the examination, you have some instability with both eyes closed and with tandem walking. This could suggest a few possibilities, including issues with your inner ear, proprioception , or possibly some early neurological changes.
PATIENT: Inner ear… proprioception… neurological changes… Those all sound… rather serious, Doctor. Is it something I should be very worried about? And what does that mean for my work? I need to be able to perform my duties safely. I’m a rotary drill operator, as you know. It's… a demanding job. I’m rather anxious about this, to be honest. Please, tell me what you think. What are the next steps?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Snerling, and it's good that you’re asking these questions. While these possibilities can be serious, it doesn't necessarily mean that's what's going on. It’s important to investigate further to determine the exact cause. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, I recommend a few tests. First, an audiological evaluation to assess your inner ear function. Second, a neurological consultation to rule out any early changes. And finally, a blood test to check for any vitamin deficiencies that could contribute to balance problems. Do you have any concerns about these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… Yes, I suppose that’s… necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. An audiological evaluation… neurological consultation… and blood tests. I can… manage those. Will they be painful? And how long will they take? I need to arrange time off work, as you can imagine. It's… difficult to get coverage. And… what if it is something serious? I apologize for asking so many questions, but… I'm rather worried about this, as you can tell. I need to know what I'm facing.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Ms. Snerling. It's perfectly reasonable to want to know what's going on and what to expect. The audiological evaluation is non-invasive and painless. It simply involves wearing headphones and responding to different sounds. It usually takes about an hour. The neurological consultation will involve a review of your medical history and a physical examination, potentially with some simple coordination tests. That usually takes about 30-60 minutes. The blood test is a simple blood draw, which is relatively quick and painless as well. I’m going to write you referrals for these tests. I'll also give you a note for your employer explaining that you are undergoing medical evaluation, and may need some time off. It's best to schedule these tests as soon as possible. If the tests reveal anything concerning, we’ll discuss the results and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, please be careful and avoid activities that could increase your risk of falling. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate your patience with me. Writing the referrals is… very kind of you. And the note for my employer as well. I’m… still rather anxious, but at least I have a plan now. I’ll schedule the tests as soon as possible. Thank you again, Doctor. If… if I think of anything else, may I contact you?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Snerling. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to support you. I will also follow up with you once I receive the results of the tests. In the meantime, please be kind to yourself and prioritize your safety. Take care, Ms. Snerling, and I look forward to discussing the results with you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Shely. I appreciate your kindness and support. I will… I will take care. Goodbye.
