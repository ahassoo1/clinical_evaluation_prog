DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get to it. It’s this… stuff. Coming up. Acid, mostly. Happens after I eat, usually. It’s unpleasant, is what it is. And frankly, I haven’t got time for unpleasantness.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re experiencing some discomfort after eating, described as acid coming up. We'll certainly try to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as we can. When you say “after eating,” about how long after eating does this typically happen?
PATIENT: Oh, give or take. An hour, maybe? Sometimes less if it’s something…rich. You know, good food. Not this rabbit food everyone’s on about these days. It’s not immediately after, if that’s what you’re asking. It builds. Like a bad…well, never mind. Point is, it's not instantaneous. And it happens more when I've really enjoyed my meal, usually.
DOCTOR: Right, so it's delayed, roughly an hour, and seems to be more common after a larger or particularly enjoyable meal. That's helpful. Can you describe the sensation a little more?
PATIENT: It burns. It's a burn, coming up my chest. And it tastes…sour. Really sour. Like vinegar, almost. And sometimes, a little bit comes up into my mouth. Not a lot, thankfully. I don’t need to be swallowing that all day. It’s… distressing, is what it is. I’ve had it for a while now, and I thought it would just go away on its own. It hasn’t, obviously.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a burning sensation in your chest, a sour taste, and sometimes regurgitation. You said you've been experiencing this for a while – roughly how long is “a while”?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Months. At least six, maybe more. I don’t really keep track of these things. It started gradually, you know? A little bit here and there. I figured it was just something I ate. Then it got…worse. And it's definitely more frequent now. Look, I’m a busy man. I don't have time for lingering stomach issues.
DOCTOR: I understand, and we'll try to get to the bottom of this efficiently. Six months or more of progressive symptoms is definitely something we need to investigate. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about any other symptoms you might be experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? It burns. It comes up. What else is going to happen? I haven’t grown a second head, if that’s what you’re asking. No, honestly, I don't think so. Maybe a little bit of…bloating, sometimes, after a big meal. But that’s probably just the meal being big, right? And sometimes my throat feels a little…scratchy. Like something’s irritated it. But I live in the country, dust is everywhere. It's probably just that.
DOCTOR: Okay, bloating after meals and a scratchy throat are good things to note. The scratchy throat, given where you live, could be environmental, but we'll keep it in mind. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Look, I'm a healthy man. Always have been. I work hard, I eat well , I don't sit around all day. No, I don't have anything. Never had anything, really. My wife keeps telling me I need to go to the doctor more, but honestly, what for? Everything works fine, mostly. High blood pressure, maybe, a few years back, but they gave me a pill for that. I take it. That's it. I haven’t been seriously sick in my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. You mentioned high blood pressure in the past, currently managed with medication - do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Ugh, names. Honestly, no. My wife handles all that. She keeps a list, but I don’t bother with it. It’s a little white pill. That’s all I know. I take it every morning, with my coffee. She makes sure I don’t forget. It’s…something-pril. Lisinopril? Is that it? Something like that. I really don't pay attention to these things.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, yes. Thank you. That's helpful. And you've been taking that regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, religiously. My wife would have my hide if I didn't. Every morning. Same time. I'm a creature of habit, you see. I need my routine. Coffee, pill, then get to work. I don’t have time to mess around with forgetting things. It's…important. Unlike this…stomach issue. Which is why I'm here now. To get it sorted. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril daily as prescribed. That's good. Now, any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I eat everything. I’m Polish, you know? We don’t mess around with allergies. My grandmother…she fed us everything. Pickles, cabbage, meat, everything. No allergies. Never had any. Look, I’m a simple man. Simple diet, simple life. No allergies, no sensitivities. Just this…burning. Which, frankly, is very annoying. Is there anything we can do about it now? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Are you kidding me? I was raised in the countryside. You breathe fresh air. Why would I intentionally fill my lungs with smoke? No. Absolutely not. I haven’t touched a cigarette in my life. My father was a carpenter, you know. He always said, "Strong lungs build strong things." I've always taken that to heart. And frankly, it smells awful. And it’s bad for you. Why would anyone do it? Honestly. Now, can we get back to my…problem? I’m losing daylight.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No smoking history. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Look, I enjoy a good drink now and then. A glass of vodka with dinner, maybe a beer on a hot day. Nothing excessive. I'm not a lush, if that's what you're implying. I like good company, good food, and a good drink to go with it. But I don’t sit around all day drinking. It’s…social. That's it. I'm a reasonable man. I know my limits. Now, can we please move this along? I have a farm to run.
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate alcohol consumption. And finally, regarding your diet, you mentioned enjoying good food – are there any particular foods that seem to worsen the burning sensation, besides just larger meals?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly? Spicy food, obviously. Tomatoes. Citrus fruits. Anything acidic, really. Chocolate. The good stuff, mind you. Not that cheap stuff. My wife keeps telling me to cut it all out, but what's the point of living if you can't enjoy a little chocolate? It’s just…unreasonable. Everything good seems to make it worse. That's why I’m here. To find a way to enjoy life without feeling like I’m swallowing fire. Can we talk about solutions now? I’m starting to get hungry.
DOCTOR: Okay, spicy foods, tomatoes, citrus, chocolate all seem to exacerbate the symptoms. That's helpful information. Alright, Mr. Altine. Based on what you’ve told me, and the timeline of your symptoms, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing symptoms consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. It’s a common condition, and often related to the lower esophageal sphincter not functioning properly, allowing stomach acid to come back up. I do see a record of your high blood pressure management with lisinopril. Before we move forward, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to listen to your heart and lungs and feel your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: GERD? Sounds…complicated. And frankly, I don’t like complicated. Lower…whatsit? Just fix it. That's all I want. Fine, examine me. Get it over with. But don't expect me to understand a lot of fancy medical terms. I’m a farmer, not a doctor. And quickly, please. The sun doesn’t wait for anyone.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. It’s not as complicated as it sounds. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then palpate your abdomen. It’ll only take a moment. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation, and I don’t feel any masses. There's a bit of fullness, but that's not unexpected given what you've described. Based on the exam, there’s nothing immediately concerning. To confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few tests. A simple blood test to check for anemia and inflammation. And I’d recommend an upper endoscopy, where we can visualize your esophagus and stomach with a camera. That will give us a definitive answer. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests? Anemia? Inflammation? A camera down my throat? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. I came here for a quick fix, not a whole series of…inconveniences. Look, I don’t like needles. And the thought of a camera going down my throat…it's unsettling. Is there anything else we can do? Some pills, maybe? Something simple? I have work to do. I can’t spend all day in a doctor’s office getting poked and prodded. And frankly, I don’t trust cameras. They’re always taking things out of context.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Altine. I wouldn’t recommend these tests if I didn’t think they were necessary to get an accurate diagnosis. However, we can start with a trial of medication, as you suggested. We can start with a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, which reduces the amount of acid your stomach produces. It's a common medication for GERD, and often provides significant relief. We can also recommend some lifestyle modifications, like elevating the head of your bed and avoiding trigger foods, like spicy foods and caffeine. I will write you a prescription for omeprazole, 20mg daily, for four weeks. If your symptoms improve with the medication and lifestyle changes, that may be all you need. However, if your symptoms persist or worsen, we will need to reconsider the upper endoscopy. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Omeprazole…that sounds…less invasive. Four weeks, you say? And avoid spicy foods, caffeine? I can try that. It won’t be easy. Fine. Let’s try the pills. But if they make me miserable, I’m coming back here to yell at you. And if I can’t enjoy my coffee, I’m holding you personally responsible. Write the prescription. Let’s get this over with. I have a farm to run, you know. And daylight is wasting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I understand your concerns. I’m writing you a prescription for omeprazole 20mg daily for four weeks. I will also print out some information about GERD and lifestyle modifications for you. Please take the medication as directed, and try to avoid your trigger foods as much as possible. If you don't see improvement within two weeks, or if your symptoms worsen at any time, please call my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. Just…get me out of here. And hopefully, these pills will work. I really don’t want to come back. Thank you. I think that’s all. Now, if you’ll excuse me…I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I understand. If you have any concerns or questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to contact my office. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
