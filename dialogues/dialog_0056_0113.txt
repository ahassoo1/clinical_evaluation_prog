DOCTOR: Hi Arlan, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s… something with the, uh… going to the bathroom. Too often, you see. Just too often. It’s a bother, really. Not a big bother, but… a bother. It's been happening for a bit now, I suppose. I don’t rightly remember when it started, to be honest. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Frequent urination can definitely be disruptive. Let’s try to get a better idea of what’s going on. When you say “too often,” about how many times a day would you say you’re going?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking me to count! I don’t count these things, Doctor. Really, who does? It feels like… all the time. More than a normal person, I’d wager. Back when I was working the farm, I didn't have to go nearly this much. I suppose things change, don’t they? It's just... frequent. Very frequent. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. “Very frequent” gives me a starting point. And it’s good to know it’s a change from when you were working on the farm. Do you find yourself needing to go urgently – like, having a sudden, strong need to go right now?
PATIENT: Urgent? Hmm… sometimes. Not always, mind you. Sometimes it just… comes on. Other times I have a bit of warning. It's unpredictable, that's what it is. Unpredictable. And it's worse at night, if I remember correctly. Waking me up, you know? My wife gets annoyed. She says I rustle the blankets too much. Women… always noticing the small things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so unpredictable and worse at night, waking you up. That’s good information. Do you ever experience any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. A little discomfort, maybe. Like… a little bit of a sting. But nothing awful. I've had real pain before, broken bones and such. This isn't like that. It’s more of an… irritation. A little bit of a burning feeling sometimes, but not always. It's hard to describe, you see. Old bodies do funny things.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be hard to describe. No significant pain is good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color? Smell? Goodness, Doctor, are you asking me to be a urine expert now? I just go to the bathroom, I don’t inspect it! It looks… yellow, I suppose. Like it usually does. I haven’t noticed anything particularly… off. And smells like… well, like pee. What do you expect it to smell like? My wife would be the one to notice these things, and she hasn't said a word, so I assume it’s normal.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's fair enough. Let's switch gears a bit. Do you have any difficulty starting the stream of urine, or do you feel like you completely empty your bladder when you go?
PATIENT: Difficulty starting? Sometimes… a little bit of a wait, maybe. Not a long wait, but it doesn’t just come rushing out right away. And… emptying? I think so. I feel like I do. Hard to be certain, you see. I don't exactly measure it. I just go, and then I'm done. Old bodies don't work like they used to, Doctor. Everything's a bit… sluggish.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little hesitancy starting and feeling like you don’t fully empty. Now, I’m going to ask about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, no diabetes. Never had that. High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned something about that years ago, but I don’t take anything for it. It wasn’t bad enough, he said. Just watch the salt, he told me. And I do, mostly. My wife is good about that, too. She makes everything bland, if you want the truth. I've had a bad back for years from the farm work, and my knees ache something awful, but that's about it. Old age, you see. It comes with the territory.
DOCTOR: Okay, no diabetes, controlled blood pressure, bad back and knees. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm… let me think. Years ago, I had my appendix out. That was a long time ago, when I was a young man. And… oh, I had a hernia operation, I think. Or maybe it was my neighbor who had the hernia. I get things mixed up, you see. It was a long time ago, and I don't rightly remember all the details. Nothing recently, though. Just the usual aches and pains. Old bodies, you know. They fall apart.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… just some aspirin now and then for my knees. When they really bother me. And a little something for my back, when it flares up. My wife handles all that, mostly. She keeps track of everything. I don’t rightly remember the names of them. Little white pills, mostly. Or maybe they’re blue. It's all a blur, you see. I leave the medical details to the experts… and my wife. She’s got a better memory than I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, aspirin as needed for pain. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just listen to your abdomen and do a quick neurological check. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam, you say? Well… alright. I suppose that’s necessary. I’m not a fan of doctors poking and prodding, but if you say it’s needed… go ahead. Just be gentle, will you? Old bodies are fragile, you see. And don't be surprised if I flinch. My back’s been bothering me something awful lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, Arlan. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Reflexes, eh? Haven’t had those checked in years. Alright, alright. Be careful now, Doctor. These old bones aren’t as flexible as they used to be. And try not to hit my knees too hard, alright? They’re already aching something awful. What are you looking for, anyway? Some kind of… jumping? Is that what reflexes are?
DOCTOR: Okay. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which isn’t uncommon at your age. It just means the nerves aren't sending signals as strongly as they used to. Now, I’m going to do a quick digital rectal exam. This is to check the size and consistency of your prostate, and to rule out any abnormalities. I know it’s not the most comfortable exam, but it’s important to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on now, Doctor. A… what did you say? A digital exam? You want to… poke around there? Goodness gracious. That doesn't sound very pleasant at all. Is that absolutely necessary? Can't you just… ask me some more questions? Maybe take a blood sample? Anything but that. Old men have their dignity, you know. And that… that sounds like a violation of it. I suppose… I suppose if you insist… but I'm not going to like it one bit. And be quick about it, alright? Very quick.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Arlan, and I apologize for making you uncomfortable. You are absolutely right to be concerned about your dignity, and I would never proceed without your full consent. The digital rectal exam is often the best way to assess the prostate, which can sometimes contribute to frequent urination. However, given your discomfort, we can certainly explore other options first. We could start with a urinalysis to check for infection or other abnormalities in your urine. We can also order a prostate-specific antigen blood test, which can give us some information about the size of your prostate. If those tests are inconclusive, then we can discuss the possibility of a digital rectal exam further. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Now that sounds much better, Doctor. A little urine sample and a blood test… I can handle that. Much more civilized, you see. I'm perfectly happy with that. No poking and prodding, alright? Just the simple tests. My wife always tells me, “Let the doctors do their tests,” and I always say, “As long as they don't start sticking things where they don't belong.” So, yes, let's start with those tests. And thank you, Doctor, for being understanding. A little kindness goes a long way with old men, you see.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arlan. I'm happy to accommodate your preferences. I'll get the lab technician to come in and collect a urine sample and some blood. It will just be a routine blood draw, nothing to worry about. While we wait, can you tell me a little bit about your fluid intake?
PATIENT: Oh, fluid intake. Well, I drink my coffee, you see. Black, strong coffee. A couple of cups in the morning, maybe one in the afternoon. And water, of course. I try to drink enough water, my wife keeps nagging me about it. And sometimes a little juice with dinner. Not much, though. I don't go for all those fancy drinks. Just the simple things, you see. I wouldn't say I drink a lot of fluids, but I don't go out of my way to avoid them either. I don't track it or anything. Old men just drink when they're thirsty. Is that alright? Should I be keeping a log? I don’t have one of those.
DOCTOR: No, no log is necessary. Just knowing you drink a typical amount of fluids is helpful. Okay, so a couple of coffees and some water throughout the day. While we wait for the lab tech, let's talk about any medications you’ve taken for your back or knees recently. What have you been using, and how often?
PATIENT: Oh, the back and knees… yes. Well, for the back, I take… let me think. There’s a little white pill, my wife gets it for me. It helps take the edge off, you see. I don't know the name of it, honestly. She handles all that. I take it when it really flares up, maybe three or four times a week. And for the knees, sometimes I use a cream. Rub it on, you see. Helps a little, but not much. It’s… blue, I think. Or maybe green. It’s hard to remember. They all look alike after a while. I just use whatever my wife gives me. She says it’s good for arthritis. Does that make sense? I’m not very good with names, you see.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Arlan. It's very common to not remember medication names. Knowing you use a pill for your back and a cream for your knees is helpful. We can look up the names once the lab tech is here if you'd like. Here is Sarah, the lab technician. She will be taking a urine sample and drawing some blood for us. Sarah, this gentleman is concerned about frequent urination.
PATIENT: Oh, hello there, young lady. Be gentle, alright? Old veins are fragile, you see. And I don’t like needles. Not one bit. Hopefully this won’t take too long. My wife is waiting in the car, and she gets impatient, you see. So, hurry it up, alright? Just get it over with as quickly as possible.
