DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Barban. I'm Dr. Soodeen. Welcome to the clinic. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Yes, thank you. I am here for… a check-up before the insurance starts. A physical, you said? I need to make sure everything is… acceptable for the Medicare. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. A physical exam to establish a baseline for your Medicare coverage is a good idea. We'll review your medical history, perform a physical examination, and order any necessary tests. Let's start with a little about your medical background. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant… illnesses? Not really. I stay healthy. I eat… normal food. And I work. Food processing, you know. It keeps a man busy. I have not been to the hospital for… a long time. Perhaps a broken finger when I was small. But nothing… serious. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So no major hospitalizations or chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or asthma?
PATIENT: No, no. Nothing like that. I do not have those things. My father… he had problems with his stomach. But I am not like my father. I am strong. Do you think I look like someone with… stomach problems?
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you’re feeling well. And no, you don’t look like someone with stomach problems. Family history is important though. Do you know what specific stomach problems your father had?
PATIENT: Specific… problems? He just… complained. A lot. He would eat too much, then… feel unwell. The doctor gave him pills. Many pills. I do not know the name of the problem. Old country doctors, you know? They did not write things down so clearly. They just… gave pills. Is this important? It sounds like a waste of time to talk about my father's… discomfort.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, we don’t need the exact diagnosis. Knowing he had stomach issues and required medication is helpful. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I am a practical man. I avoid… cutting into myself if possible. What would I need a surgery for? Are you implying something is wrong with me? I told you, I am healthy.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. I’m simply gathering a complete medical history. It’s standard procedure. Let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. All kinds of food. Spicy food, sweet food, everything. I work with food, you know. I would know if I was allergic to something. People are too worried about… allergies these days. My grandmother, she ate everything and lived to be very old. Very old, I tell you.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And you aren’t currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I do not need anything. A strong man does not require… potions. I get enough from my work and… normal food. Are we finished with these… questions? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. We’ve covered your medical history, allergies, and current medications. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me establish a baseline for your Medicare coverage. It includes checking your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your throat and ears. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: If you must. But make it quick, Doctor. I do not have all day. And… be gentle. I am a strong man, but I do not enjoy being… prodded. Blood pressure… is that important? It sounds… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: It will be quick, I promise. And blood pressure is very important. It gives us a good indication of your overall health. It’s a simple, painless test. If you'll just have a seat here, we can get started. First, I'll take your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Pulse is 72 beats per minute, regular. Blood pressure is… 140/90. That blood pressure is slightly elevated. We'll want to monitor that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Elevated? What does that mean? Is it bad? I told you, I am healthy. Perhaps it is the… the stress of being here. All these questions! Hurry up, please. I do not like this.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear, but I do hear some slight wheezing. It's subtle, but present. The slightly elevated blood pressure and the mild wheezing are things we should investigate further. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it's good to have a baseline. Do you experience any shortness of breath, coughing, or chest tightness?
PATIENT: Wheezing? Shortness of… breath? No. Never. I lift heavy things all day at the food processing plant. I do not have time for… delicate complaints. Perhaps it is the dust. There is a lot of dust at work. I do not need a doctor to tell me there is dust. Are we finished yet? I have important things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can discuss some options. Since you have no significant symptoms, but the wheezing is present, I recommend a chest X-ray to rule out anything concerning. We can also do a basic metabolic panel to get a snapshot of your kidney and liver function. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: X-rays? More… poking and prodding? Doctor, I came here for a simple check-up before the insurance starts, not to be… dissected! Is this necessary? I do not understand why I need all these… tests. It is a waste of time and… probably expensive. Fine. Do the tests. But if they show nothing, I do not want to come back. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll proceed with the chest X-ray and the basic metabolic panel. It’s better to be thorough and establish a baseline, and as you said, if everything comes back normal, we’ll re-evaluate the need for further testing. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood for the panel and give you the order for the X-ray. The X-ray can be done at the imaging center across the street. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. Just… make it quick. And tell the nurse to be gentle. I do not enjoy needles. Is that all? I believe I have wasted enough of my day here. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. The nurse will be with you shortly. We’ll review the results as soon as they are available, and we’ll discuss a plan from there. Here's a sheet with some information about the tests and a number to call if you have any questions. Thank you for your patience today. We’ll get this sorted out. .
