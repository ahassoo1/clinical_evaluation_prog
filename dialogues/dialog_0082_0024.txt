DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. IUZZOLINO. It’s… good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. A confirmation that I'm able to fly. It's for… well, it's a bit complicated, but my travel insurance requires it.
DOCTOR: A letter for travel insurance… yes, yes. Confirming you're fit to fly. I see. Right. And… have you been seen by another doctor recently for anything that might… preclude you from flying?
PATIENT: No, not recently. It’s been a while, honestly. Just… regular check-ups before, nothing major. My husband… well, he handled all that. It's been a little over a year since he passed, and things have been… quiet, health-wise, for me. I don’t feel any different, if that makes sense. But the insurance company is being very strict.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing a spouse… that's difficult. And it’s common for things to fall by the wayside when you're dealing with grief. “Quiet, health-wise” is good to hear, certainly. Just to be thorough… and my apologies if this seems repetitive, it’s just protocol… have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or swelling in your legs or feet recently?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Honestly, I've been feeling pretty good, all things considered. No chest pain, breathing’s normal, no dizziness, and my feet aren't swollen. I walk quite a bit, actually. Keeps me… occupied. I don’t want to sound insensitive, but I really just need the letter so I can finalize the travel plans. It’s… important.
DOCTOR: Not insensitive at all, Kiante. It's perfectly reasonable to want to get this sorted. And staying active is excellent. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I haven't taken anything regularly in years, aside from the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing serious. Just the standard over-the-counter stuff. I think my husband kept a more detailed record of everything, but… well, you know. It’s all a bit disorganized at the moment.
DOCTOR: Right. Understandable. And are you currently taking any vitamins, supplements, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a while ago. I’ve been trying to eat better, get enough sunshine… simple things, really. I just want to make sure this letter covers everything they need. Is there a specific form I need to fill out, or will a standard letter be sufficient? I haven't really dealt with insurance claims since… well, a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Let me take a quick look here… Hmm. The records are… not as detailed as I'd like. It appears you had a few routine check-ups several years ago, all within normal limits. A standard letter should suffice, I believe, outlining your general good health. To be extra cautious, I'd like to quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, just to confirm everything is as you say. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, go ahead. I want to make sure everything is done properly. I just… I really need to get this trip booked. It's… important for me to go.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please, have a seat here. We'll just do a quick listen and check your blood pressure. Shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Everything sounds healthy, Kiante. Do you have any history of blood clots, or a recent surgery?
PATIENT: No, no blood clots. And no recent surgeries. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was… a very long time ago. And my husband… he had a knee replacement a few years back, but that was his issue, not mine. I haven’t had any major health problems, honestly. I feel… fine. Perhaps a little tired sometimes, but who isn’t?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. A little fatigue can be common, certainly. Alright, I’m drafting a letter confirming your good health, stating you have no known contraindications to air travel. I’ll include the recent examination findings – normal heart and lung sounds, blood pressure within normal limits. Is there anything specific the insurance company asked about?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. They sent a rather long questionnaire, but I believe they specifically asked about any history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. And… and if I’d been hospitalized in the last year. They were very detailed. But, no, I haven’t been hospitalized, and I definitely don’t have any history of blood clots. I can look at the questionnaire again if you’d like, but I’m fairly certain that's what they were focused on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll include that for clarity. Just one more question, Kiante, and this is just to be thorough: are you currently experiencing any pain, swelling, redness, or warmth in your calves?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My legs feel normal. No pain, no swelling, no redness, no warmth. I walk every day, like I said, and I haven’t noticed anything unusual. Honestly, Doctor, I think I’m good. I just want to get this letter and be on my way. It’s… a bit of a stressful situation.
DOCTOR: Alright, here you go. This confirms you are in good health and have no known contraindications to air travel. It specifically mentions the absence of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and recent hospitalization. I hope this is sufficient for your insurance company. If they require any further documentation, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: That’s perfect! Thank you so much, Doctor. Honestly, that’s a huge weight off my shoulders. No, I don’t think I have any further questions. You’ve been very thorough and helpful. I really appreciate your time. Thank you again. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I'm glad I could help. You have a good day as well, and safe travels. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or you have any concerns. .
