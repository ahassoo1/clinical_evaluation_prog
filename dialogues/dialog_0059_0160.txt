DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, please, call me Candis. Doctor’s names are just…too much. And honestly, I haven’t got all day. It's this tiredness. Just awful tiredness. And…well, I’ve been eating dirt. Not a lot, but…enough to be concerning, I suppose. My daughter insisted I come. She thinks I’m losing it. Honestly, probably is right, with all this nonsense.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candis. Just Candis is perfectly fine. And no worries about the time; we'll take things at your pace. Thank you for sharing that with me. Eating dirt is…unusual, and I appreciate you being so open about it. Let’s start with this tiredness. Could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Unusual? It's disgusting, that's what it is. And it started…oh, goodness, months ago, I suppose. Just slowly getting more and more tired. Used to be able to get everything done, now I nap twice a day, and still feel drained. It’s not like a normal tired, you know? It’s…empty. Like all the energy’s been sucked right out of me. And it doesn't matter how much I sleep. It's just…there. Honestly, it’s probably just old age.
DOCTOR: I understand, Candis. It certainly sounds very draining, and it's good you’re able to describe it so well. It’s not simply about the amount of sleep, but the quality of it, and that empty feeling is important to note. And you mentioned it started months ago and has been gradually worsening. Have you noticed anything specifically that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Better? Nothing makes it better. Absolutely nothing. Worse…well, being cold, I suppose. And…when I haven’t had…you know. The dirt. Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? But if I don't have a little bit, I just feel…worse. Like I’m fading away. My daughter thinks it’s a mineral deficiency or something, but honestly, I just crave it. Like needing a cup of tea. It's just…there. I don’t understand why she makes such a fuss. It’s not harming anyone.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound ridiculous at all, Candis. It’s important to understand why you feel this way, and the craving is a key part of that. We’ll certainly investigate it. And it's good your daughter is concerned; it's always best to have someone looking out for you. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about your diet otherwise?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My diet. Well, I used to cook lovely meals, Ethiopian food mostly. But now…mostly just whatever my daughter brings over. Soup, usually. And toast. Not much appetite these days. I try to eat my vegetables, but they just…sit there. I used to love injera, but it takes too much effort to make, and…well, I don’t really feel like cooking. It all feels…pointless. I suppose it’s not very healthy, is it?
DOCTOR: It sounds like your appetite has decreased, and that's understandable given how tired you've been feeling. And don't worry about it being "healthy" or not right now; we're just gathering information. Now, Candis, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and the craving?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. Well, I’ve been a bit…forgetful, I suppose. Nothing major, just…misplacing things. And sometimes, I have trouble…finding the right words. It’s embarrassing, really. And my hands ache sometimes. Not constantly, but…enough to notice. Oh, and I’ve been feeling colder than usual, even when it’s warm. Honestly, it’s probably just old age catching up with me. It's all downhill from here, isn't it?
DOCTOR: I understand, Candis. Forgetfulness, difficulty finding words, hand aches, and feeling colder than usual – those are all important things to note. It’s good you’re telling me all of this. Now, Candis, have you had any recent illnesses, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Oh, goodness, no. Not for years. Had a bad flu a couple of winters ago, but nothing serious. Just stayed in bed for a week with soup and tea. My daughter made me go to the doctor then, but they just said it was the flu. And before that…well, I don’t really remember. It was ages ago. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It's probably just old age, isn't it? .
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis, that's helpful to know. And it's perfectly normal for memory to change as we get older. Now, could you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
