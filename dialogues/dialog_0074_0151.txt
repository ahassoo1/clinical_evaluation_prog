DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s lovely to meet you. Please, have a seat. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's this tingling… in my hands and feet, mostly. It's been going on for a little bit now, and it's… well, annoying, to put it nicely. I just wanted to see if it was something serious, you know? I don't want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Uzarski. Annoying tingling in the hands and feet certainly warrants a look. It’s good you came in to get it checked. When you say “a little bit now,” can you tell me roughly how long this tingling has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three, four months ago? It comes and goes, it's not constant, thankfully. Some days I barely notice it, other days it feels like my fingers are… asleep, but not really. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Uzarski. Intermittent symptoms can be tricky to describe. Three to four months is helpful information. And where exactly are you feeling the tingling?
PATIENT: Mostly in my fingertips and toes, but sometimes it goes up my hands a bit, like… the backs of my hands. And in my feet, it’s like… all over, really. Not one specific spot. It’s in both hands and both feet, too, not just one side. I walk a lot for my job, you know, delivering the mail… maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know it’s in both hands and feet. And yes, walking a lot for your job is very relevant information. Can you describe the sensation a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let's see… It's not pain, exactly. More like… pins and needles, but… not sharp. A sort of… buzzing, I guess? And sometimes… like they're numb, like you said. It’s hard to feel things properly. Like when I'm sorting the mail, sometimes I have trouble feeling the edges of the envelopes. It’s not all the time, but it's worrying me. I need my hands for my job, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about needing your hands for your job, Ms. Uzarski. That buzzing and pins and needles sensation, and the difficulty feeling things – that’s very helpful information. Now, have you noticed anything that makes the tingling worse, or anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, when I’m really tired, it seems worse. Like, at the end of a long day, definitely. And if I'm standing for a really long time, without moving. That’s bad. As for better… not much, really. Sometimes if I move my hands around a bit, it gets a little better, but it always comes back. And… I don’t know if this matters, but I worry a lot. Maybe that makes it worse? I’ve just been feeling… anxious lately.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Ms. Uzarski. Fatigue and prolonged standing are both relevant. And yes, anxiety can absolutely play a role in these kinds of sensations. Let's move on to some other questions, if that’s alright. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get tired, like I said, but I haven’t dropped anything, or anything like that. I can still hold things, still sort the mail. I'm strong enough for my job, I think. I’d notice if I couldn't do it anymore. I’ve been a mail carrier for a long time, you know? I'd feel it if something was really wrong.
DOCTOR: That’s reassuring to hear, Ms. Uzarski. No weakness is a good sign. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with this tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. No pain anywhere else. I’ve been a little more clumsy lately, maybe… but I always put that down to being a bit forgetful as I get older, you know? Not anything major. Oh! Actually… my feet do feel a little colder than they used to, sometimes. But it’s winter coming up, so… maybe that's normal? I don't know.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Uzarski. The clumsiness and slightly colder feet are good things to mention. It’s good you make the distinction about it possibly being related to the colder weather. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… let me see. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it was under control now. I used to take pills for it, but I haven't taken them in years. And I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it doesn’t bother me much. Nothing else, really. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. My husband… well, he had a lot of problems, but that was before… before he passed. I try not to dwell on it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Uzarski. Thank you for sharing that. Controlled high blood pressure and some arthritis are good to know. It's alright not to dwell on things. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... Yes, I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And I had a hysterectomy, too. But that was… a long time ago, decades. That's it, really. Nothing else. A lot of my friends have had more, but I’ve been lucky, I guess. Is that important? Does that have something to do with my hands?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Uzarski. Knowing about the gallbladder removal and hysterectomy is helpful. Those surgeries are unlikely to be directly related to your hand and feet symptoms, but I always want a complete picture. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything, take any medicine, no problems. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty good in that department, thankfully. It's one less thing to worry about, you know? My husband, now he was allergic to everything! Pollen, dust, cats… you name it. But I’ve been lucky.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Uzarski. No known allergies are very helpful. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not a thing. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. Just a little bit of vitamin D in the winter, maybe. But that's it. I try to stay healthy naturally, you know? Fresh air, good food… that's what I believe in. I don't trust those medicines much. They always have side effects. Is that all the questions you have, Doctor? I'd like to get this sorted out if possible. I have a route to finish this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Uzarski. That’s very helpful. No current medications are good to know. Okay, Ms. Uzarski. Based on what you’ve told me, and considering your history, it sounds like you’re experiencing some peripheral neuropathy, which is tingling or numbness in the hands and feet. There are many possible causes, and it’s not always possible to pinpoint one exact reason. However, given your age, medical history, and the nature of your symptoms, we need to investigate a few things. I would like to do a quick physical exam now to assess your reflexes, strength, and sensation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… sensible. A physical exam. Yes, I suppose that's what doctors do. Reflexes… hmm. I don’t know about my reflexes. They probably aren't what they used to be, to be honest. Yes, go ahead. Let’s get it over with, shall we? I do have that route to finish, you know. I just want to know if it's something serious, that's all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Uzarski. I'll be as quick as I can. Please lie down on the table for me. First, I'm going to check your reflexes in your knees and ankles. This involves a little tap with a small hammer. It shouldn’t be painful, but let me know if it’s uncomfortable. Alright. Your reflexes are… slightly diminished, but that's not uncommon with age. Now, I’m going to test your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It’s not as strong as it used to be, I suppose. Carrying all those letters… it takes its toll, you know? And it’s cold today. My hands are a little stiff. Is that what you’re looking for? Just tell me if it's something bad, Doctor. I really do need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good, Ms. Uzarski. Your strength is good overall, though I agree, a little less than I'd expect. Now, let’s check your sensation. I’m going to lightly touch different parts of your hands and feet with this cotton swab. Please tell me when you can feel it. Okay. You have some reduced sensation in the tips of your fingers and toes on both hands and both feet. Based on this brief examination, it does appear you have some peripheral neuropathy, as we discussed. The diminished reflexes and sensation, combined with your symptoms, are consistent with that. However, neuropathy can be caused by a variety of factors, including vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, and even just the normal aging process. We need to rule out some other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, blood sugar, and kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… oh, dear. I don't like needles. But… if you think it’s necessary. It's just… another appointment, another wait. Alright, Doctor. Do what you need to do. But please, make it quick. And tell me if it's something serious, alright? I really do need to know. I have a route to finish, and I don’t want to worry about this all day. What kind of vitamin levels are we talking about? Is it something I can fix with a good diet, maybe?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Uzarski. I’ll make sure the blood draw is as quick and comfortable as possible. It's a simple test, and we’ll get the results back fairly quickly – usually within a few days. We’ll check your vitamin B12, vitamin D, and folate levels. These are all important for nerve health. And yes, sometimes a vitamin deficiency can be corrected with diet or supplements. Other times, it may require injections. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Here’s a requisition for the lab. You can go to [Name of Local Lab] – they don’t require an appointment. Just take this with you. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a multivitamin with B vitamins to start, just as a preventative measure. And I would recommend trying to incorporate more foods rich in B vitamins into your diet – things like leafy greens, eggs, and lean meats. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: [Name of Local Lab]… alright. I suppose. As long as they’re quick. A multivitamin… that sounds sensible enough. I do try to eat healthy, but… I get tired, you know? Sometimes it’s just easier to grab something quick. Alright, Doctor. A multivitamin and the blood tests. I'll get it done. Is there anything else? I really do need to get back to work. I just hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Uzarski, that’s all for now. I'm going to schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from now, once we have your lab results. We’ll discuss those results and determine the next steps. Here's a card with the date and time of your appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe pain, weakness, or difficulty walking – please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. And remember, while neuropathy can be concerning, it’s often manageable with proper treatment. We’ll work together to figure out what’s causing yours and get you feeling better. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: A week… alright. No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I just hope it's nothing too serious. And thank you for being quick. I really do appreciate it. Alright then. I’ll see you next week. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Uzarski. I understand your concerns, and we’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. .
