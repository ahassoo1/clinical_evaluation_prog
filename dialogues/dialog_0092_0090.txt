DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I'm here for...a check-up, I believe. Before a surgery. It’s…difficult to recall the specifics, truthfully. My husband handled most of the arrangements. It's something I've been wanting for a while now, but I’m a bit hazy on why exactly we scheduled it for now. It feels important, though.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It's quite common to have a lot on your mind, and details can become blurry. No worries at all. We can certainly go through everything and clarify as we go. Just to confirm, you mentioned surgery. Do you recall what type of surgery you are scheduled for, or roughly when it’s planned?
PATIENT: That's...a good question. I think it has something to do with…my face? Perhaps a lift? Or something to do with the skin…It’s all very vague. My husband said it would make me feel more like myself again, but… I honestly can’t say when it’s scheduled. I've been relying on his calendar, and…well, he’s no longer with us. Perhaps you have a record of it here?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Brightful, I do see here that you are scheduled for a facelift on August 23rd. It appears the appointment was arranged by your husband, Mr. Carlos Brightful, a few months ago. I am so sorry to hear about your loss; that must be incredibly difficult. We can certainly proceed with the pre-operative evaluation today, or we can reschedule if that feels overwhelming at this time. Would you like me to briefly explain what the evaluation involves?
PATIENT: August 23rd…That’s soon. Oh, my. Carlos… Yes, it has been difficult. Thank you, Doctor. No, please, let’s proceed. If Carlos thought it was important, I trust his judgment. Could you explain what the evaluation involves, please? I want to be as prepared as possible. Although…I may need you to repeat things. I apologize in advance. My memory just hasn’t been the same.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Brightful. No need to apologize at all. We will take our time, and I’m happy to repeat anything as many times as needed. The pre-operative evaluation is primarily to ensure you are healthy enough for surgery and to minimize any potential risks. We'll start with a review of your medical history – any previous illnesses, surgeries, allergies, and medications you’re currently taking. Then, I'd like to perform a physical exam, focusing on your heart and lungs, and of course, examine the area of your face where the surgery will be performed. I may also order some routine blood work to assess your overall health. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That sounds…reasonable. Yes, that all sounds quite alright. My medical history… I suppose I'm generally healthy. I try to eat well, though I haven’t been terribly motivated since…well. I do have a slight allergy to penicillin, I believe. And I take a low-dose blood pressure medication – lisinopril, I think it's called. But beyond that… I don’t recall anything significant. Would it be helpful if you asked me specific questions? Perhaps that would be easier than trying to remember everything myself?
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent idea, Ms. Brightful. It often is easier to go through a structured questionnaire. We'll start with a bit of the History of Present Illness – essentially, what has been going on with your health recently. But since this is a pre-operative evaluation and not focused on a specific complaint, we can keep it brief. Have you experienced any changes in your overall health in the last few months – any unexplained weight loss or gain, fatigue, fever, or any new pains or discomfort?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, as I said, my motivation has been…low. That’s led to less activity, I suppose. And probably some weight gain, though I haven’t weighed myself recently. I've been…tired, yes. Not constantly, but…easily fatigued. It’s difficult to describe. I wouldn't say any new pains specifically, just…a general feeling of being run down. And perhaps a little more forgetful than usual, though that could be the grief… or just getting older. I’m not sure if any of that is helpful.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Brightful. It gives me a good overall picture. It’s understandable that you’ve been feeling fatigued and experiencing some forgetfulness given your recent loss. We will certainly keep those factors in mind. Now, let's move on to a brief Review of Systems – essentially, we’ll just go through the different body systems to see if you’ve noticed anything unusual. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations. My heart feels…normal, I believe. Though, I haven’t been very active, so I haven't really tested it, if that makes sense. Carlos always said my heart was strong, but he might have just been being kind.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And it sounds like Carlos was a very kind man. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – any constipation, diarrhea, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh…well. No blood in my stool, thankfully. I have been a bit constipated, if I'm honest. Again, I think it's the lack of activity and…well, generally not taking very good care of myself. It’s not been severe, just…uncomfortable at times. Is that something I should be concerned about?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily something to be overly concerned about at this point, Ms. Brightful, especially given your recent circumstances and decreased activity level. We can discuss some simple dietary changes or over-the-counter remedies to help alleviate that. Let's continue with the review of systems. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No nausea or vomiting. No abdominal pain, either. My appetite…has been somewhat reduced, yes. I haven't been very hungry lately. I manage to eat, but I don’t really enjoy it, if that makes sense. Everything just tastes…bland. It could just be the grief, though. Everything feels…muted these days. I apologize for being so…melodramatic.
DOCTOR: You’re not being melodramatic at all, Ms. Brightful. It's perfectly natural to experience changes in appetite and enjoy things less after a significant loss. It sounds like you’re processing a lot, and it’s important to acknowledge those feelings. Now, let’s talk about your Past Medical History. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or asthma?
PATIENT: Hmm… I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years ago, as I mentioned earlier, I take lisinopril for it. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. I’ve always been generally healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. No asthma, no diabetes, no…anything chronic that I'm aware of. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, if that counts. And… Carlos always made sure I went for my yearly check-ups. He was very conscientious about my health.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And it sounds like Carlos was very dedicated to your well-being. Now, let's move on to Past Surgical History. Aside from your tonsils, have you had any other surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just my tonsils, as far as I can recall. No other surgeries or hospitalizations. I've been very lucky, in that regard. I've always been a bit…accident-prone, but I've never needed to go to the hospital for anything serious. Carlos used to joke that I had nine lives.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. Now, let’s talk about Family History. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Oh…family history. That’s…tricky. My mother had heart disease, I believe. She passed away when I was quite young. And… my grandmother, on my father’s side, had some sort of dementia, I think. But honestly, I don’t know much beyond that. We weren't a very close family. Carlos knew more about their medical history, but… I'm afraid I can't be of much help with that. It's a bit of a blur, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. It’s common for family medical histories to be incomplete. We can make a note of the heart disease in your mother and dementia in your grandmother. Now, let’s talk about Social History. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And definitely no recreational drugs. Carlos and I…we both preferred a quiet life. We were homebodies, mostly. Enjoyed gardening and cooking. Simple pleasures.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, let’s talk about Allergies. You mentioned penicillin. Are you allergic to anything else – medications, foods, environmental allergens?
PATIENT: Penicillin, yes. And… I think I'm mildly allergic to dust, but it’s just a little bit of sneezing and a runny nose. Nothing serious. No food allergies, as far as I know. Carlos used to tease me about being a picky eater, but that wasn't an allergy, just preference. No, I can't think of anything else. I'm fairly lucky in that regard as well, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Brightful, that completes the initial part of our history gathering. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I will listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and briefly examine the area where the facelift will be performed. This will help me assess your overall health and ensure you are a good candidate for surgery. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment. Just… try not to startle me, if possible. I’m not particularly fond of surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Brightful. I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138/82. Slightly elevated, but not overly concerning given your anxiety and recent stress. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular and strong. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to briefly examine the area on your face where the facelift will be performed. Skin has good elasticity for your age. I don't notice any unusual masses or areas of concern. Overall, the area appears healthy. Everything appears to be within normal limits.
PATIENT: That's…good to hear, Doctor. Thank you. So, does that mean I'm a suitable candidate for the surgery? Is everything… alright? I apologize for being so anxious. It’s just… a lot to process, and I want everything to go smoothly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Brightful, your anxiety is completely understandable. And you’re not at all overthinking this. Based on my initial assessment, you do appear to be a suitable candidate for the facelift. Your overall health is good, and there are no obvious contraindications to surgery. However, to be absolutely thorough, I would like to order some routine blood work. This will give us a more detailed picture of your health and rule out any underlying issues. It’s just a standard precaution. Would you be willing to proceed with the blood work?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. Please, proceed with the blood work. If it’s a standard precaution, I’d be happy to do whatever is necessary. I just want to make sure everything is as safe as possible. Will the results take long to come back? And… what happens after that?
DOCTOR: The blood work should take approximately 2-3 business days to come back. Once the results are in, we’ll review them together. If everything looks good, we can schedule your pre-operative appointment with the anesthesiologist and finalize the details of the surgery. At the pre-op appointment, the anesthesiologist will review your medical history, discuss the anesthesia options, and answer any questions you may have. We will also go over the post-operative instructions and ensure you have a clear understanding of what to expect after the surgery. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience and kindness. It’s…a comfort to know I’m in good hands. Is there anything I need to do in the meantime? Anything I should avoid or prepare for?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Brightful. I’m glad I could reassure you. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to prepare for the surgery. Please avoid taking any blood-thinning medications, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, for at least two weeks before your surgery. And it would be best to avoid any strenuous activity. Also, please arrange for someone to drive you home after your pre-op appointment and surgery, and ensure you have someone to help you out at home for the first few days as you recover. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough. I will certainly make sure I have someone to drive me and help me out afterwards. Thank you again for everything. I feel much more at ease now. I’ll await your call with the results of the blood work.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Brightful. I'm glad I could help. My office will contact you as soon as the blood work results are in, which should be within 2-3 business days. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You have been wonderful. Have a good day as well.
DOCTOR: .
