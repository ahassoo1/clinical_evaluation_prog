DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve been having trouble going to the bathroom. It just… takes me a long time, and it feels like I don’t empty everything. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, maybe five or six weeks. It’s not every time, but often enough that it’s worrying me. It's definitely gotten worse lately, though. I used to just think it was because I drank too much tea, but it's still happening even when I don't.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is there any pain or discomfort while you're trying to go?
PATIENT: Not really pain, Doctor. More… a straining feeling. Like I have to push a lot, even when I don’t feel like I need to. It's not sharp, just… effort. And sometimes, after I do go, it feels like there’s still some left in there, you know? Like it doesn’t quite empty all the way.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Changes in… what did you say? My… well, the, uh, business? Is it different somehow? I hadn't really paid close attention, to be honest. It looks… normal, I suppose. Maybe a little thinner than usual sometimes, but I eat a lot of soup in the summer, so I figured that was it.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or blood in the toilet bowl?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no blood. Definitely not. I would have noticed that, wouldn't I? I always check. It's just… the difficulty, and feeling like I can’t get everything out. That's what's bothering me. I don't want something serious, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s what I came about! It’s… it takes a long time to start, and then it’s not very strong. It kind of… dribbles at the end. And I feel like I have to go back again soon after I just went. It’s frustrating, really. I don't sleep through the night as well as I used to, always getting up.
DOCTOR: Right, so you’re having difficulty both starting and completely emptying your bladder, as well as with your bowel movements. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... Well, I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, and I had a bad bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered. Otherwise, not much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, I think. My mother had high blood pressure, but I don’t. And I take a little bit of something for my arthritis, just when it flares up. I can tell you the name if you'd like. It's… Naproxen, I believe.
DOCTOR: Naproxen is good to know. And any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. Nothing else. I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, but that healed on its own with a cast. I’ve never needed anything major. I’m usually very careful, you see. I don’t take many risks. And I try to eat healthy, though I do like my sweets… But nothing serious, Doctor. I promise.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the Naproxen when I need it, and… oh! Yes. I take a multivitamin every day. Just a regular one, you can get it at any pharmacy. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take some glucosamine and chondroitin. But I don’t take that every day, just when I’m walking a lot. It’s the kind for joints, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. Never had any allergies. Not to penicillin, not to anything. My mother always said I was a very sturdy baby. I’ve always been lucky that way, I suppose. No hives, no swelling, nothing. I can eat anything, pretty much. Though I don’t like shellfish, but that’s just a preference, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I've never smoked a day in my life. My husband, God rest his soul, he smoked for a while, but I always made him go outside. It smelled terrible, you know? I always told him it was bad for his health. And I’ve always been very careful about drinking alcohol too. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, if I’m feeling fancy. Nothing more.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 88, but she had high blood pressure, like I said. My father died when he was quite young, a heart attack. And my brother… he had diabetes, but he didn’t take very good care of himself. He ate a lot of sweets, just like me! As for other relatives… I don’t really know much about their medical history. We weren’t very close, you see. My family is mostly back in Lithuania.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just tell me what to expect, if you would. I don’t like surprises, you see. And please, don’t be embarrassed if I ask questions. I just want to understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. And finally, I’ll need to do a rectal exam to assess your rectal tone and check for any abnormalities. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Yadao. It'll give me a much clearer picture of what's going on. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: A rectal exam…? Oh. Well, I… I suppose I knew it might come to that. It’s just… a little uncomfortable, isn’t it? Is it going to hurt? And how long will it take? I have a bit of an appointment later this afternoon, you see, and I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t be painful, Ms. Yadao, but it can be a little uncomfortable, yes. We’ll be as gentle as possible. It’ll only take a few moments, I assure you. We'll just be checking for any tenderness, masses, or other abnormalities. And I’ll explain everything as I go. It's important to rule things out. It shouldn’t interfere with your afternoon appointment. Do you need a moment to prepare?
PATIENT: No, no, it's alright. Best to get it over with, I suppose. Just… please be quick. And tell me what you’re doing as you go, like you said. I just… I don’t like being surprised. Is there anything I need to do? Do I need to… change into a gown or anything?
DOCTOR: Alright. No, you don’t need to change. Just lie on your left side with your knees bent. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take nice, deep breaths for me, Ms. Yadao. Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s… a little sensitive, maybe, on the lower left side, but nothing painful. It’s just… a dull ache, sometimes. Like when you’ve eaten too much, you know? It comes and goes. I thought it was just indigestion, mostly. Oh, there. That’s a little tender, yes. But it’s not a sharp pain. It's more of a… fullness.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, I'll need to perform the rectal exam. I’m going to ask you to bend your knees and take a deep breath. I’ll use a lubricated gloved finger to gently check your rectum. It will give me information about the tone, any masses, and look for blood. Just relax as much as possible. Let me know if you feel any discomfort. …Tone is normal. No masses detected. No evidence of blood.
PATIENT: Okay… That wasn't as bad as I thought, actually. Still not pleasant, mind you, but… manageable. So, what did you find? Is everything alright? Is it something serious? You didn't say anything while you were doing it, so I’m hoping that means it’s good news.
DOCTOR: The physical exam was fairly unremarkable, Ms. Yadao. No significant abnormalities were detected. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and the abdomen is soft with mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant. The rectal exam was also normal. However, given your symptoms of difficulty starting and emptying both your bladder and bowels, as well as the straining and incomplete emptying, I suspect this could be related to pelvic floor dysfunction or possibly a mild form of constipation. The tenderness could also indicate some diverticulitis, though there weren’t any clear signs of it. To be certain, I recommend a stool sample to rule out any infection and a urinalysis. I'd also like to order a complete blood count to check for inflammation.
PATIENT: Oh. Pelvic floor… what did you say? Is that… serious? And diverticu-what? It sounds very complicated. And a stool sample? Oh dear. I suppose I can manage that. But the blood tests… will they hurt? And what if it is something serious? I don’t want to be stuck in the hospital, Doctor. I live alone, you see. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Anything to help with the… straining?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao, let’s take things one step at a time. Pelvic floor dysfunction simply means the muscles supporting your bladder and bowel aren’t working as efficiently as they should. It’s common, especially as we get older, and often treatable with exercises. Diverticulitis is inflammation of small pouches in the colon, but it's not necessarily serious. The tests will help us rule those things out and get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The blood test is just a simple pinprick, a very minor discomfort. And the stool sample… well, it’s not pleasant, but you can do it at home. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fiber intake, drinking plenty of water, and avoiding straining when you go to the bathroom. We also want to make sure you’re not holding it in for too long. I'm also going to give you a list of exercises called Kegels. They can help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… fiber and water and… Kegels. I can manage the fiber and water, I suppose. I do like my prunes. And I’ll try to remember the exercises. Are there any instructions? I don’t want to do them wrong. And… how long will it take to get the test results? A week? A month? And if it is something serious, what kind of treatment are we talking about? Surgery? Pills? Oh dear. This is all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days. I will have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they are available. I'm giving you a handout with detailed instructions on how to do the Kegel exercises. And yes, I understand it’s a lot to take in. Most likely, if it is diverticulitis, it will be managed with diet and antibiotics. Surgery is rarely needed. And, if it's pelvic floor dysfunction, we can discuss physical therapy if the exercises aren't enough. I’m not going to jump to conclusions until we have the test results. For now, let’s focus on increasing your fiber and water intake and trying the Kegel exercises. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
