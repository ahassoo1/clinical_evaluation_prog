DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. Good to meet you. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, now… it’s my ears, I think. They just don't… work like they used to. Everything's a bit muffled, you see? Not a sharp pain or anything, just… quiet. It’s been getting worse, slowly, for… well, a long time now, I suppose. I don't rightly remember when it started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “A long time now,” is… not terribly helpful, Mr. Schneer. But alright. Muffled hearing, you say. Is it in both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Sorry, Doctor. It’s just… time gets away from you, doesn't it? Both ears, yes, I think so. Hard to tell sometimes. It's like… when someone’s talkin' from across the room, I can't make out what they're sayin’. And the television… I have to turn it up real loud, and even then, it's hard to hear. My neighbor, Mrs. Gable, she says I yell too much when I'm watchin’ the game.
DOCTOR: Right. So, gradual onset, affecting both ears, difficulty with distance hearing, and your neighbor thinks you're being… loud. Has this been impacting your daily life in any other ways?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. It’s… frustrating, mostly. I used to love listenin' to the radio, you know? Old time music. But now… it’s just a jumble of sounds. And sometimes when people talk, I get… confused. Like I miss parts of what they’re sayin’. Makes it hard to follow a conversation, especially when there’s a bit of noise. I don't go out as much anymore. It’s just… easier to stay home.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like this is more than just a little bit of difficulty hearing. Have you ever had your hearing tested before, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: A hearing test? Hmm… now that you mention it… I think maybe, a long time ago. When I was workin' at the shoe factory, they made us get our ears checked every year, I think. Because of the machines, you know? But that was… oh, Lord, must have been fifty years ago! I don't remember the results, or anything about it. Everything’s a bit… hazy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, we're going to need to get a current hearing test done, then. It'll give us a baseline and help us figure out what's going on. Before we do that, let’s quickly go over some other things. Any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Hmm… Sometimes, yes. A faint… buzzing. Not all the time, though. Mostly when it’s quiet, I suppose. Like when I’m tryin' to fall asleep. It’s not awful, just… there. I usually just tune it out. Or I turn on the radio, quiet like. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Tinnitus – ringing in the ears – is common. Now, have you had any recent ear infections, or any drainage from your ears?
PATIENT: Ear infections… not that I remember. Not recently, anyway. As a boy, maybe. I got sick a lot when I was a lad. But not since… oh, goodness, must be seventy years ago! And no drainage, no. My ears feel… dry, mostly. Sometimes a little itchy, but nothing more than that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any dizziness or balance problems?
PATIENT: Dizziness… now that you ask… well, sometimes I feel a little unsteady when I stand up too fast. But I figured that’s just my age. I’m not a spring chicken anymore, you know? And sometimes when I turn my head quickly, I get a little… woozy. But nothing major. I haven’t fallen or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just to be thorough, let's quickly go through some other things. Any history of head injuries?
PATIENT: Head injuries… oh, my. Let me think. When I was a young man, workin' construction, I did bump my head a few times. Not nothin' serious, mind you. Just little knocks here and there. Fell off a ladder once, but landed in a pile of hay! Luckily, no broken bones. And as a boy, I used to get into scraps with the other lads, but I don't think I ever got a serious head injury. Does that make sense, Doctor? It was a long time ago…
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes! Let me see… I take a little pill for my blood pressure, the red one. And another one for my arthritis, the white one. And sometimes, when my knees are really botherin' me, I take a pain reliever. That's the yellow one. Oh, and a vitamin D supplement, the small blue one. I think that's all of them. My daughter helps me keep track, mostly. She's a good girl.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. Now, I’m going to take a look in your ears with an otoscope. Then, I'd like to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your balance and reflexes. It'll only take a few minutes. After that, we’ll get you scheduled for a full hearing test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… perfectly alright, Doctor. You’re the expert, after all. Just try not to poke too hard! And if I start yellin’, don’t be alarmed, that’s just my ears talkin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. This might be a little cool. Hmm. There’s some cerumen buildup, earwax. And the tympanic membrane appears… slightly dull. Now the right ear. Similar findings. Some cerumen buildup, tympanic membrane appears slightly dull bilaterally. No obvious signs of infection. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly… muffled. Lungs are clear. Now, I want you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Do what you need to do. It's all a bit… blurry, as usual. Follow your finger, you say? Oh dear, it's jumpin’ around a bit! Is this alright? I’m tryin’ my best.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what I've seen so far, and your history, I suspect we're dealing with a combination of age-related hearing loss, cerumen impaction – earwax buildup – and possibly some mild fluid buildup in the middle ear. It's not an emergency, but it’s definitely something we need to address. First, I recommend we get that earwax removed. We can do that in the office with irrigation, or I can refer you to an audiologist. And we absolutely need that full hearing test to get a baseline and determine the severity of the hearing loss. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s… a lot of fancy words, Doctor. Earwax, fluid, hearing loss… It all sounds rather serious! Irrigation, you say? That sounds… wet. And an audiologist? Is that a… a special ear doctor? What about the television? Will I be able to hear it better? And Mrs. Gable… she gets awfully upset when I yell. Will this fix that?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. Let’s break this down. Earwax buildup is very common, and easily treatable. It can definitely contribute to muffled hearing. The irrigation is just a gentle rinsing of the ear canal with water to remove the wax. It’s not unpleasant, and we’ll take it slow. An audiologist is a specialist in hearing. They’ll perform a comprehensive hearing test and help us determine the best course of action. As for the television and Mrs. Gable… hopefully, removing the earwax and addressing the hearing loss will improve your hearing enough to lower the volume and make things more comfortable for everyone. I can’t guarantee a complete fix, but it’s a good starting point. I recommend we schedule you for the hearing test first, then we can discuss options for earwax removal. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible, Doctor. A test first, then maybe… a little rinse. As long as it doesn’t involve anything… pokey. And will this… test tell me how bad it is? Like, will I need one of those… hearin’ aids? I don’t fancy wearin’ one of those, if I can help it. They look awfully big.
DOCTOR: The test will tell us the extent of your hearing loss, yes. It will measure your ability to hear different frequencies at different volumes. As for hearing aids… we don’t know if you’ll need them yet. Many people can benefit from hearing aids, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. If the test shows significant hearing loss, we can discuss options. Modern hearing aids are much smaller and more discreet than they used to be. Let’s focus on getting the test done first. Then, we’ll have a clearer picture of what’s going on and discuss the best course of action. I have my nurse schedule you for a comprehensive hearing test with the audiologist next week. Is Tuesday afternoon okay?
PATIENT: Tuesday afternoon… hmm. Yes, I suppose that will do. I usually have bingo on Tuesday evenings, but I can skip it just once. Alright, then. Tuesday it is. And will I need to… prepare for this test? Like, not eat anything special, or… wear my good hearing ear?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Schneer, you don’t need to prepare in any way. Just come to the appointment. No special diet, no need to wear your “good hearing ear” – just come as you are. The audiologist will explain everything to you when you get there. My nurse will give you the appointment details before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly… even though it’s a bit scary soundin’. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to an old man ramble. And thank you for not laughin’ at me. I suppose I’ll go now. And hopefully, I’ll be hearin’ better soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. You take care. My nurse will escort you out. And don’t worry, we’ll do our best to get your hearing back on track. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
