DOCTOR: Hi Chellsea, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor. Well… it’s about my cancer. I was told to come see you.
DOCTOR: Okay. You were told to come see me regarding a cancer diagnosis… Right. That’s… a lot to take in. Could you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. It was… a few months ago now. They found something during a check-up. I don’t… I don’t remember exactly what they said, just that it was cancer. And that I needed to see someone… like you. It's all been a bit blurry, honestly. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all. That's perfectly understandable – hearing news like that is incredibly overwhelming. It's very common to have trouble remembering details. Do you happen to remember where they found something?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… in my chest, I believe. Yes, that sounds right. They did some scans… a lot of pictures. And the doctor… he pointed to something on the screen. It was small, he said, but… it wasn’t supposed to be there. I think it was in my lung? It’s hard to be sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest and possibly the lung. We'll definitely get to the bottom of it. Do you have any records from that initial check-up – scan results, a doctor’s report, anything like that?
PATIENT: I… I think so. My husband, he kept most of the papers. He… passed away a few months after I found out about the cancer. Everything is… in a box at home. I haven't really gone through it yet. It's too hard. I can get it, though. If you need it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That's… a lot to deal with, and it's perfectly alright that you haven't gone through those papers yet. We can absolutely work with what you remember for now. Do you recall what type of cancer they mentioned, even generally?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think they said. Just… cancer. They said it was… not good. And that I needed treatment. I remember being very scared. And very confused. I asked a lot of questions, but I don’t think I understood the answers. Everything felt… like a dream. I'm sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful just by sharing what you do remember, Chellsea. It's okay if the details are fuzzy. Let’s see if we can piece things together. Do you remember if they started any treatment at all?
PATIENT: Yes, they did. I had… pills. And I went to a place… for something called radiation. It made me very tired. And sick. It was… not pleasant. I only did it a few times, though. Before… before my husband got sick. It was all very quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, pills and some radiation therapy. That gives us a little more to work with. And about those pills… do you remember what they looked like?
PATIENT: Hmm… they were small. White, I think. And… round. Just little white pills. I had to take them every day. I don't remember the name of them. They didn't seem to do much, honestly. I still felt sick all the time. I’m sorry. I wish I could remember more details. I feel like I’m failing.
DOCTOR: You're not failing at all, Chellsea. These things can be incredibly difficult to recall, especially with everything else you’ve been going through. Okay, small, white, round pills. We can look into what those might have been based on the timeframe and the initial radiation. Let’s shift gears a bit. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty healthy. I used to… I used to walk a lot with my husband. Before… well, you know. I haven’t been walking much lately. But I haven’t had any other health problems, as far as I know. I don’t take any other pills, besides the ones the cancer doctor gave me. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. No other medical conditions and only the pills from the cancer doctor. Okay. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she had… something with her stomach, I think. But I don’t remember exactly what. She passed away a long time ago. My father… he was healthy. Very strong. But he died in an accident when I was young. I don't think anyone else in my family had cancer, as far as I know. It's hard to say, really. We didn't talk about those things much. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Chellsea. It's very common for families not to discuss medical history openly. Okay, mother with a stomach issue, father healthy. Now, just a few more questions, then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Never have. My husband, he liked a beer sometimes, but I never did. I don't like the taste. And I think it’s bad for you. I always told him that. He listened to me, mostly. I’m sorry… I keep talking about him. It’s just… hard.
DOCTOR: You don’t need to apologize at all, Chellsea. It’s perfectly natural to talk about someone you loved and lost. Okay, no smoking, no alcohol. That’s good. And lastly, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve always been pretty lucky, I guess. Well… until the cancer. I’m sorry. I don’t mean to be negative. I just… I’m still trying to understand everything. It’s all very overwhelming.
DOCTOR: You're not being negative at all. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. So, just to summarize, you were diagnosed with cancer in your chest, possibly in your lung, a few months ago. You received some pills and a few radiation treatments, but you don’t recall specifics. You don’t have any other medical conditions or allergies, and you don't smoke or drink. Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. That… that’s about as accurate as I can get, I think. It’s all a bit of a blur, but yes. That sounds right. Thank you for listening. I feel… a little better, just talking about it. I hope I wasn’t too confusing.
DOCTOR: You weren't confusing at all, Chellsea. And you’re very welcome. Okay. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It will just help me get a better picture of things. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. That sounds… fine. I trust you, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I just… I just want to know what’s going on. And what we can do about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Wonderful. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Okay. Your heart sounds regular. Your lungs… I do hear some decreased air movement on the lower left side. Now I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. No tenderness or masses that I can feel. Everything seems relatively normal, but the decreased air movement on the lower left lung warrants further investigation. Do you feel any pain when you take a deep breath?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little… tired, maybe. But no pain. It just feels… tight, sometimes. Like I can’t get enough air. But it doesn’t hurt. I thought it was just… from the cancer. And the treatment. I'm sorry… I don’t know if that makes sense. It's just a feeling. A hard-to-describe feeling.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Chellsea, and you're not bothering me at all. A tight feeling in your chest is a very valid symptom, and it's good you mentioned it. Based on what you've told me and the exam, I think we need to get some imaging done – a chest X-ray, and likely a CT scan. This will help us see exactly what's going on in your lungs and determine the extent of the cancer, if it’s still present, and if there's anything else causing your symptoms. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. If that’s what we need to do. I just… I just want to know. I want to know what’s happening, and what we can do about it. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. When can we do these scans?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s excellent. I agree, imaging is the best next step. I can get you scheduled for a chest X-ray and CT scan at the Rural Clinic tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. Do you have any transportation arranged, or would you need assistance getting there?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, that works. I can… I think I can get a ride. My friend, Sarah, she offered. She’s very kind. I don’t think I’ll need assistance. But thank you for asking. That’s very thoughtful.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Okay, so you're scheduled for a chest X-ray and CT scan tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM at the Rural Clinic. Sarah is providing transportation. After the scans, the radiologist will read the results, and I’ll review them with you as soon as I can, likely within a few days. We’ll discuss the findings and develop a plan of action. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – severe chest pain, shortness of breath, fever – please don't hesitate to go to the nearest emergency room. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s very clear. Chest X-ray and CT scan tomorrow at 9:00 AM. And if anything gets worse, go to the emergency room. Thank you, Doctor Polczynski. You’ve been very helpful. I feel… a little less scared now. Knowing what’s happening, and having a plan… it makes a big difference.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. That’s my job, and I’m glad I could help ease your mind a little. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything I was wondering. I’ll just… focus on getting through tomorrow. And wait for the results. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Chellsea. You take care, and don’t hesitate to call my office if anything comes up. We’ll get through this together. Have a good evening, and I'll see you soon.
