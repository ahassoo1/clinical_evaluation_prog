DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Quicksey, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s this…pain. When I breathe deep, it kinda hurts. Not all the time, just when I…take a big breath. It’s been going on for a little while now, I think. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I see. Pain with deep breaths, you said. And it’s been present for some time, though remembering exactly when is difficult. That’s perfectly alright; we’ll do our best to figure it out. To help me understand a bit better, could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Describe it… It’s not a sharp pain, not like when I fell off the roof helping with the shingles years ago. It’s more…a dull ache. Right here, in my chest. It feels…tight, sometimes. Like someone’s squeezing. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Ruocco. A dull ache with a tightening sensation in your chest when you take deep breaths. That’s very helpful. Now, does anything specifically make the pain worse, besides deep breathing?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not that I can recall, no. I do a little work, you know, construction…lifting things, that sort of thing. Doesn’t seem to bother it. Coughing doesn’t either, and I used to smoke, so I’ve had a good cough or two in my life! Honestly, it’s just…when I try to take a good, deep breath. It's a strange feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain isn’t related to exertion, lifting, or coughing. It’s primarily with deep breaths. Good to know. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like heart problems, lung issues, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a long time ago now. I… I think the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high, once. Years and years ago. And I had some trouble with my back when I was working on houses, but that was just old age, I figured. Lung problems… not that I remember. I smoked for a long time, but I never got sick with anything…serious. Arthritis…maybe? My wife, she always said my joints were creaky. But I don’t recall any official diagnoses, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Ruocco. It sounds like you had some elevated blood pressure in the past and some back issues, but no specific lung or arthritis diagnoses. We can certainly look into those further if needed. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital… Let me think. My appendix, when I was a boy. That was a long time ago. And…oh, I had my gallbladder out, too. That was… maybe twenty years ago? Something like that. No other surgeries, that I can recall. And not much time in the hospital, thankfully. I always preferred to patch myself up at home, if I could.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you had your appendix removed as a child and your gallbladder out approximately 20 years ago. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Not at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Never really needed much, to be honest. Just a little ibuprofen for my back sometimes, but that’s about it. And I haven't taken any of that in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications or recent ibuprofen use. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat just about anything. My wife used to say I had a cast iron stomach. Never had a reaction to anything… at least, not that I remember. Everything seems to sit alright with me.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Now, Mr. Ruocco, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I used to. A long time. A pack a day, maybe more, for…oh, goodness, forty years? Something like that. But I quit. A long time ago, too. Maybe fifteen, twenty years now. It was hard, but I did it.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Ruocco! Quitting smoking is a huge accomplishment. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little. Just a beer with dinner sometimes. Nothing fancy. Maybe a couple of times a week. I'm not a big drinker, never was. My wife didn't care for it much, so I didn't have much reason to.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of beers a week. And finally, do you live alone or do you have family or friends nearby?
PATIENT: I live alone now. My wife…she passed away a few years back. I have a son, lives out of state. We talk on the phone sometimes. And a few friends, but they’re all getting on in years like me. It gets…lonely, sometimes. But I manage.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Ruocco. Losing a loved one is never easy. And I understand it can be lonely. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your chest to check for any tenderness. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I guess it can’t hurt. Just… be gentle, alright? My ribs aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I will be as gentle as possible. Your lungs sound clear to me, Mr. Ruocco, with no wheezing or crackles. Your heart rate is regular and a bit elevated, but that could be from talking. I do notice some mild tenderness when I press on your sternum, but no significant masses. Your ribs feel stable. It doesn't seem to be anything alarming on physical exam.
PATIENT: Hmm. That is where it hurts, you know. Right there. But it’s not a bad pain, just… uncomfortable. So, what does that mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I'm not one for long hospital stays, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Ruocco. It’s good to know that the tenderness is localized to your sternum, where you’re experiencing the pain. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings from the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing costochondritis. Have you ever heard of that before?
PATIENT: Costo… what now? No, never heard of it. Is that… bad? Is it something I caught? I haven't been around anyone sick, if that matters.
DOCTOR: No, it's not contagious, Mr. Ruocco. Costochondritis is an inflammation of the cartilage that connects your ribs to your sternum – the bone in the middle of your chest. It’s a common cause of chest pain, and it's usually not serious. It can feel like a dull ache or a sharp pain, and it can be aggravated by deep breathing or movement. It often happens after a minor injury or strain, but sometimes the cause is unknown. Do you recall any recent strenuous activity or injury to your chest?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really. I do a little work, lifting things here and there, but nothing too strenuous. I haven't fallen or bumped into anything recently, not that I remember. Maybe… maybe I twisted a little when I was helping my son move some boxes last month? But that was a while ago. It wasn’t a bad twist, just a little awkward.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slight twist while helping your son move boxes last month is possible. To be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a chest X-ray. It’s a quick and painless procedure that will allow us to visualize your lungs and heart and ensure there are no other underlying causes for your pain. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… Well, I don't like being exposed to all that… radiation. Is it really necessary, Doctor? I've lived a long life without too many tests, and I'd like to keep it that way. But… if you think it's important, I suppose I can do it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about radiation exposure, Mr. Ruocco. The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is very small, and the benefits of ruling out other potential causes for your pain outweigh the risks in this case. It's a standard precaution, and it will give us peace of mind. I'll write you a referral for the X-ray, and the radiology center should be able to schedule you for an appointment quickly. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of treatment. In the meantime, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help manage your pain. Would that be agreeable?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Ibuprofen… I used to take that for my back. Yes, that's fine. Just… let's hope it doesn't show anything bad, alright? I'm not one for long hospital stays, like I said. And thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly, even if it’s a little worrying.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. I understand your concern, and I’ll be sure to review the X-ray results carefully as soon as they are available. Most likely, it will confirm costochondritis, and we can manage it with pain relievers and rest. I’ll also give you a written summary of our discussion and the referral for the X-ray. And if your pain worsens or you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please don’t hesitate to call my office or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve answered everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time. I appreciate you listening to an old man like me. I best be going now, before I forget where I parked the car.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. It was my pleasure. And don’t worry about forgetting where you parked – it happens to the best of us! Here’s that summary and the referral. Please take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again to discuss the X-ray results. Have a good day.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you again. Now, where did I park that car…?
