DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Luft. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well… it’s about the cancer. I was told to come see you.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for coming in. To clarify, were you recently diagnosed with cancer, or is this a follow-up appointment regarding a previous diagnosis?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… recently. A few weeks ago, I think. It was all very fast, to be honest. I’m still trying to understand everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. A new cancer diagnosis can be incredibly overwhelming, and it's perfectly normal to feel that way. We will take our time and ensure you understand everything clearly. Could you tell me what type of cancer you were diagnosed with, and where it is located?
PATIENT: They said… breast cancer. In my left breast. I don’t… I don’t know much about the specifics. It was a biopsy, and then the doctor told me… it was cancer. I mostly just remember being scared.
DOCTOR: That is certainly understandable. It’s alright if details are hazy right now. Do you recall anything about the stage or grade of the cancer, or any specific characteristics they mentioned?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. They used a lot of words I didn’t understand. Something about… cells? And numbers? I think it was Stage Two, maybe? But I’m really not sure. They said they wanted me to see you to talk about… what to do next. I just… I’m a little lost.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. Medical terminology can be very confusing. Stage Two is a reasonable recollection, but we’ll verify that with the pathology report. To help me get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me a bit about any treatment recommendations that were made?
PATIENT: They talked about… surgery, I think. And… chemotherapy. And maybe radiation. It was a lot all at once. They said surgery first, to remove the… the lump. But I honestly didn’t catch everything. My head was spinning. I asked if there were other options, but they said those were the standard ones.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a standard approach for Stage Two breast cancer. It's perfectly fine that you didn't absorb everything at once – it's a lot to process. Before we proceed, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had… the flu a few times, when I was a kid. And a broken arm, once. But nothing serious. I’m usually very healthy. This… this cancer is a shock. My husband… he would be so worried.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is certainly unexpected, especially if you've been generally healthy. And it's natural to be concerned for your husband. Have you ever had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, sir. This would be my first. And… I’m scared of them. I’ve always been a little nervous around doctors, to be honest. This is all… a lot more than just a check-up.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. It’s completely normal to feel anxious about surgery, especially with everything you’re going through. We’ll discuss the procedure in detail, and I'll answer all of your questions so you feel as comfortable as possible. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… my mother had… heart problems. She passed away a few years ago. My father is still living, but he’s very old. He doesn’t really talk about… health things. As far as cancer… I don’t think anyone on either side of the family has had it. But I’m not really sure. We weren’t a close family.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. It's helpful to have that information. Now, I’d like to ask a little about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, sir. I’ve never smoked. I don’t drink alcohol, either. And definitely no drugs. I… I work a lot. Occupational Therapist. I try to be healthy. This cancer… it doesn’t make any sense.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It's helpful to have a complete picture. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. No allergies. I’ve always been lucky that way. Just… scared. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Thank you for providing me with all of that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I would like to perform a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. This will help me assess your overall health and get a better understanding of the cancer. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs, and then I'll examine the area around your left breast. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That’s… that’s fine. I guess. Whatever you need to do. I just… I hope it doesn’t hurt.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll explain everything as I go. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rhonchi, or crackles noted. Lymph nodes are non-palpable. On examination of the left breast, I palpate a firm, irregularly shaped mass approximately 2 centimeters in diameter in the upper outer quadrant. The skin overlying the mass is slightly dimpled. No nipple retraction or discharge noted. The right breast is unremarkable. Alright, Ms. Luft. That completes the physical exam. As expected, the examination confirms the presence of a mass in your left breast, consistent with the initial diagnosis. Now, I would like to review your pathology report in more detail, if you don’t mind. That will give us a clearer understanding of the type of cancer, its grade, and whether it has spread to any lymph nodes. Do you have the report with you?
PATIENT: No, sir. I don’t. They said the doctor would have it. I just… I went to the appointment, and they told me about the cancer. And then they said to come here. I don’t have anything with me.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. I will request the report from your previous doctor right away. In the meantime, based on what you’ve told me and the findings of the physical exam, it's most likely an invasive ductal carcinoma, which is the most common type of breast cancer. To clarify, do you recall any imaging studies being performed, such as a mammogram or ultrasound?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. They did a mammogram. And an ultrasound. I remember… the technician was very nice. She kept saying everything was okay, but then the doctor came in and said… it wasn’t.
DOCTOR: I understand. That can be very unsettling. Those imaging studies likely helped to pinpoint the location and size of the mass. I will review those as well once I have access to them. Ms. Luft, based on the information we have so far, the standard treatment approach for a Stage Two invasive ductal carcinoma typically involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. However, the specific plan will depend on several factors, including the grade of the cancer, whether it has spread to any lymph nodes, and your overall health. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: Chemotherapy? I’ve heard… bad things about chemotherapy. Will it make me sick? And lose my hair?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Ms. Luft. It's true that chemotherapy can have side effects, and they can be unpleasant. Nausea, fatigue, and hair loss are common side effects, but it's important to remember that not everyone experiences them, and there are many things we can do to manage them. We have made significant advances in chemotherapy over the years, and there are now medications available to help prevent nausea and vomiting. We can also adjust the dosage and schedule of chemotherapy to minimize side effects. And in some cases, we may be able to use a different type of chemotherapy that has fewer side effects. We would discuss all of this in detail before starting any treatment, and we would closely monitor you throughout the process to ensure your comfort and well-being. Do you want me to elaborate on anything in particular regarding the possible side effects, or how we manage them?
PATIENT: What about… radiation? Does that hurt? And… will I be sick from that, too?
DOCTOR: Another valid question, Ms. Luft. Radiation therapy can also have side effects, but they are typically localized to the area being treated. You might experience some redness, soreness, or fatigue, similar to a sunburn. In some cases, you might experience some swelling or changes in skin pigmentation. Like chemotherapy, the side effects of radiation therapy can vary depending on the dosage and location of treatment. We would carefully plan your radiation therapy to minimize side effects, and we would closely monitor you throughout the process. We can also use medications to help manage any discomfort. It's important to remember that the goal of treatment is to eliminate the cancer and improve your overall health. The potential benefits of treatment far outweigh the risks of side effects. Before we proceed, I would like to order some additional tests to get a clearer understanding of the extent of your cancer. This includes blood tests to assess your overall health and a bone scan to rule out any spread to your bones. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That’s… that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just… I want this to be over.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Luft. It’s natural to feel overwhelmed and want this to be over as quickly as possible. I assure you, we will work together every step of the way. We will develop a personalized treatment plan that is tailored to your specific needs and goals. I will order the blood tests and bone scan right away. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we will schedule another appointment to discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, sir. I don’t think so. Not right now. I just… thank you. For explaining everything. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Luft. My pleasure. Remember, I am here for you. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small they may seem. We will get through this together. I will see you at our next appointment once the test results are available. Have a good day, Ms. Luft. .
