DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Vodzak. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… well, my face gets red. Really red sometimes. It's been happening for a little while now, and I thought maybe you could take a look. It's mostly my cheeks, but sometimes my neck too.
DOCTOR: Okay, redness of the face and neck. And you said this has been happening for a little while… could you tell me approximately how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six, seven months ago? It comes and goes. Not every day. More when I eat, I think. Spicy food mostly. But sometimes even just… normal food. It's hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Alright, six or seven months of intermittent facial redness, seems to be associated with eating, particularly spicy foods, but not exclusively. And you mentioned it’s mostly your cheeks and neck. Does it feel warm or itchy when it happens?
PATIENT: No, not itchy. Just… warm. Like when you’ve been out in the sun. Not burning, just… flushed. And sometimes it feels tight, like my skin is pulling. It doesn't last long, though. Maybe ten, fifteen minutes. Then it goes away.
DOCTOR: Okay, warm and tight sensation, lasting about ten to fifteen minutes, primarily on your cheeks and neck. That's helpful. Now, let's talk a little more broadly. Have you noticed anything else that seems to trigger it, besides eating?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I haven’t been… stressed, not any more than usual. I drink a little tea, sometimes. Black tea. And… well, I used to drink a little bit of wine with dinner, but not so much anymore. Since… since my wife passed.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. It's understandable that things have changed since then. And thank you for sharing that. So, no significant stress, occasional black tea, and less wine consumption recently. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any bumps, blisters, or changes in the texture of your skin along with the redness?
PATIENT: No, no bumps or blisters. Just red. Smooth, just… red. And it doesn’t hurt. It's not like a sunburn, just… noticeable. People ask if I’m okay, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, no changes in skin texture, just redness that others notice. And you mentioned you drink black tea. Any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, or medications you take regularly?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I used to have a little trouble with my blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor said it was okay. He just told me to watch my salt. And I don’t take anything, no pills, no anything. Just… the tea. Do you need to know about allergies? I don't think I have any. Never been bothered by cats or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, managed with dietary salt restriction, no current medications, and no known allergies. That’s good to know. Let’s do a quick examination. I’d like to take a look at your skin and check your blood pressure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. You can start whenever you are ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. If you don't mind, I'm going to start by examining your face and neck. I'll just gently look at the skin, noting any redness, texture changes, or visible blood vessels. I do notice some redness, particularly on your cheeks and the bridge of your nose. There are some very small visible blood vessels – telangiectasias, we call them – but nothing too concerning at first glance. Your skin appears generally healthy. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138/82. That's slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. We'll keep an eye on it. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial examination, it sounds like you might be experiencing something called rosacea. It's a common skin condition that causes redness, flushing, and sometimes small visible blood vessels. Spicy foods, heat, and stress can often trigger it. Do you have any family history of skin conditions?
PATIENT: Rosacea… I don’t think so. My mother had… arthritis, I think. And my father… he had heart trouble. But no one ever talked about skin problems. I don’t think anyone in my family had anything like this. I never noticed anyone getting red in their face like this before. Is it… serious? Is there something I can do?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of skin conditions. Rosacea isn't typically considered serious in the sense that it’s life-threatening, but it can be uncomfortable and affect your quality of life. It's a chronic condition, meaning it can come and go, but it can be managed with treatment and lifestyle changes. Based on your history and examination, this is my working diagnosis. To be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few tests. I’d like to check your complete blood count, and possibly a skin biopsy to get a closer look at the tissue. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… a biopsy? That sounds… a bit scary. What will the biopsy tell you? And what about the blood tests? What are you looking for in those? I’m not sure I understand. I don’t want anything… too invasive.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Withycombe. A biopsy sounds more daunting than it is. It involves taking a very small sample of skin – smaller than a freckle – and examining it under a microscope. It helps us to confirm the diagnosis of rosacea and rule out other conditions that can look similar, like eczema or psoriasis. It’s a quick procedure, and we use a local anesthetic to minimize any discomfort. The blood tests will help us to check for underlying conditions that might be contributing to the flushing, and to get a baseline of your overall health. We'll be looking at things like your white blood cell count and inflammation markers. Both tests are relatively simple and safe. We can discuss the results in detail once we have them, and we can tailor a treatment plan to your specific needs. Would you like me to explain the potential treatment options before we proceed with the tests?
PATIENT: Treatment options… yes, please. What can be done? I don’t want to be putting creams on my face forever if it doesn't help. And are there things I can do? Certain foods to avoid? Anything like that? I’d like to know everything before we go any further.
DOCTOR: Certainly. There are several treatment options for rosacea, ranging from lifestyle modifications to topical and oral medications. Lifestyle modifications are a great place to start. These include avoiding known triggers, such as spicy foods, hot beverages, alcohol, and sun exposure. Gentle skincare is also important – using a mild cleanser and moisturizer, and avoiding harsh scrubs or exfoliants. Wearing a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher is crucial, even on cloudy days. Topical medications, such as metronidazole or azelaic acid, can help to reduce redness and inflammation. These are applied directly to the affected skin, usually once or twice a day. We would start with a low concentration and gradually increase it as needed. In some cases, oral antibiotics, such as doxycycline, may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and control symptoms. These are typically used for a short period of time. Finally, there are procedures like laser therapy or intense pulsed light therapy that can help to reduce visible blood vessels and redness. As for things you can do, keeping a diary to track your triggers can be very helpful. Pay attention to what you eat, what activities you engage in, and what products you use on your skin. Avoiding your personal triggers is the best way to prevent flare-ups. And managing stress can also be beneficial. The goal is to find a combination of treatments that works best for you. We can start with the lifestyle modifications and topical medications, and see how you respond. If those aren't enough, we can consider other options. Would you like me to order the blood tests and discuss the possibility of a skin biopsy?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… manageable. Lifestyle changes I can do. Creams, I can try. Let’s start with the blood tests then. And… maybe hold off on the biopsy for now? Let's see what the blood tests say first. If they don’t show anything, then we can talk about the biopsy. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Mr. Withycombe. We will absolutely start with the blood tests and see what they reveal. We can always revisit the possibility of a skin biopsy later if needed. I’ll order those for you now. You can have them drawn at the lab down the street – I’ll give you a requisition form. Once the results are in, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up for today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Just the blood tests, and then a follow-up appointment. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I’m glad I could help. I’ll have the requisition form ready for you. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And remember, keeping a diary of your triggers can be very helpful. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
