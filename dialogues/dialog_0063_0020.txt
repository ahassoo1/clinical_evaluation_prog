DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is... is good to meet you. I am here for this... telehealth thing. My daughter, she make the appointment for me. She say I need check-up, but I feel... okay, mostly. Just old, you know?
DOCTOR: “Telehealth thing,” yes. Right. Your daughter seems…concerned. “Mostly okay” is not a diagnosis, Ms. Benites. We need to establish why she felt the need to schedule this appointment. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific... hmm. Well, I work. I fix cars. Always have. It is... hard work. My back, sometimes it aches. And my hands… they are not as strong as before. It is difficult to hold the tools, sometimes. But I keep working. I need to work. My husband... he would want that.
DOCTOR: Fixing cars. A… physically demanding profession. And your husband… passed, I presume?
PATIENT: Yes. Five years now. It was… sudden. A heart. He loved cars too, you know? We had the shop together for… a long time. Thirty years. I keep it going, for him. And for the money, of course. It is not easy, doing it alone. But I manage.
DOCTOR: Right. So, the back pain and hand weakness are primarily related to your occupation. And the grief… is undoubtedly a factor, though not a medical complaint we can directly treat. When did this back pain begin?
PATIENT: Begin… hmm. It is not sudden. It is slow. Years, I think. Maybe when I turn fifty? Small aches at first. Now… it is more. Especially when I lift heavy parts. And sometimes, at night, it wake me up. I take pills. From the store. They help a little.
DOCTOR: “Pills from the store.” Over-the-counter analgesics, I assume?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… Advil? Ibuprofen? Something like that. My daughter, she say I should not take so much, but... when it hurts, you know? It is hard to work when you hurt. Is that bad? Should I stop?
DOCTOR: Chronic use of NSAIDs – that is, ibuprofen, naproxen, etcetera – can have adverse effects on the kidneys and gastrointestinal system. We need to determine the cause of this pain, Ms. Benites, rather than simply masking it with over-the-counter medication. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Sometimes, my legs, they feel… tired. Like they are heavy. And… I get dizzy when I stand up too fast. Not all the time, but… sometimes. Is that… the back? Or the pills? I do not know. Everything feels old, Doctor. Everything hurts.
DOCTOR: Right. Dizziness and leg fatigue… That could be a number of things. We should perform a basic physical examination. Please, if you would, stand up slowly for me. I want to assess your balance and observe your gait.
PATIENT: Okay. Is… like this?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly like that. Your gait is somewhat antalgic – that is, you are altering your walk to avoid pain. And your balance appears… compromised. I also notice some mild lumbar lordosis – an exaggerated curvature of the lower back. Now, if you’ll permit, I’d like to palpate your spine and assess your range of motion. Please lie flat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay. Is… cold. What are you looking for?
DOCTOR: I’m assessing for areas of tenderness, muscle spasm, and any structural abnormalities. Please tell me if anything is particularly painful. Bend forward, if you can. And try to touch your toes.
PATIENT: Oof. That is… not good. It hurts here. And here. It is always worse on this side.
DOCTOR: Right side tenderness… Significant lumbar restriction. Now, I'm going to perform a straight leg raise test. Lie flat on your back, and I’m going to lift your leg, keeping it straight. Tell me if you feel any pain radiating down your leg.
PATIENT: Aiee! Yes! That… that hurts! Not in my back… down my leg! Like… like a shooting pain. Stop! Please, stop!
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We’ll stop. That suggests possible sciatic nerve impingement. Now, if you'll allow me, I'm going to check your reflexes and assess the strength in your legs. Please keep your legs relaxed.
PATIENT: Okay. Is… bad? What does this mean? Is… is something broken? I need to fix cars, Doctor. Can I still fix cars?
DOCTOR: The reflexes are diminished on the right side, and there is some weakness in your right leg. It does not necessarily mean something is broken, Ms. Benites, but it does indicate nerve compression. We need imaging to determine the exact cause. An MRI of the lumbar spine would be the most informative. It’s likely you have a herniated disc or spinal stenosis compressing the sciatic nerve. Now, I can't provide a definitive diagnosis without the MRI. As for fixing cars… it is inadvisable to continue engaging in physically demanding activities until we have a clearer understanding of what we’re dealing with. I will send a referral to orthopedics, and they will schedule the MRI and discuss further treatment options. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a mild muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Orthopedics… MRI… That sounds… expensive. Will Medicare cover that? I… I don't have much money. And if I cannot fix cars… I don't know what I will do.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare should cover the MRI and the orthopedic consultation, Ms. Benites, though there may be co-pays or deductibles. Let me verify the specifics based on your plan. Alright, it appears your plan covers 80% of the cost of both procedures after you meet your deductible. The deductible is… …$350. The orthopedic clinic will handle the billing process. We'll also make sure to address any concerns with the social worker to see if there are any assistance programs available. Now, let me write these prescriptions for you, and I'll get the referral sent to orthopedics right away. We’ll get this sorted out, Ms. Benites. Don’t worry. .
