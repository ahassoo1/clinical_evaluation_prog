DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Andraca, is it? Well, it’s about this heat. Can’t take it anymore, honestly. Never used to bother me, but now… feels like I’m gonna melt just walking to the car. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Coby. The heat has been quite intense lately. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. It's important to figure out what's going on, especially since it’s a new change for you. Could you tell me a bit more about what you mean by "can’t take it anymore"?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not just being a bit warm, you know? It’s… everything feels hotter. Like, I’m sweating constantly, even when I’m just sitting still. And I get dizzy. Real dizzy. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. I used to work outside all day, painting houses, no problem. Now? Fifteen minutes and I’m feeling like I need to lie down. It’s pathetic, really. Some people just aren't built for this modern world, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That doesn’t sound good at all, Mr. Coby, and it’s definitely not pathetic to be concerned when your body is reacting this way. It's good you're paying attention to these changes. Constant sweating and dizziness are things we need to investigate. When did this start happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It wasn't sudden, exactly. It started… probably around spring, maybe April? It was gradual at first, just feeling a bit warmer than usual. But it’s gotten worse and worse since then. By June, I noticed I was really needing to take breaks when I was doing anything. Now, like I said, fifteen minutes in the sun and I'm finished for the day. I even had to send my helper home last week because I couldn’t keep up. It’s costing me money, this is.
DOCTOR: Okay, starting around April and progressively worsening… that’s helpful. And it's impacting your work, which is concerning. Besides the sweating and dizziness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… my thirst is up, quite a bit. I’m drinking water constantly, more than I ever have before. And I feel… tired. Not just from the heat, but a general tiredness, you know? Like I haven’t slept properly. Oh, and my stomach’s been a bit off too. Not sick, exactly, but… unsettled. Kind of queasy sometimes. And headaches. A dull ache, mostly in the back of my head. Not migraines, thankfully. I get enough trouble as it is, without those showing up.
DOCTOR: Increased thirst, general tiredness, stomach upset, and headaches… okay. Thank you for sharing all of that, Mr. Coby. It’s giving me a clearer picture. Now, have you had a fever or chills at any point?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I check sometimes, you know, with a thermometer. Nothing. Just… hot. And uncomfortable. And weak. It’s not like I’m shivering or anything. It's just... a feeling of being overheated, constantly. Like my body is working too hard just to stay cool. It's frustrating, to be honest. I’ve always been a strong man, always able to handle myself. This is… different.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Coby. It sounds very disruptive to your daily life, and it's understandable that you're concerned, especially given your history of being a strong, active individual. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor mentioned it a few years back, said I should watch my salt intake. I mostly ignore that, to be honest. It’s all just scare tactics, if you ask me. Everything causes cancer these days, too. Diabetes, no. Heart problems, no. Never had any trouble with my heart. I've always been very careful about my diet. Well, careful enough. I eat my vegetables, mostly. And I don't smoke. Never have. I used to drink a bit, but not much anymore. It doesn't agree with me. Mostly, I just try to keep myself busy, you know? Working keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of being told to watch your salt intake, but no formal diagnosis of high blood pressure. That’s good to know. And no diabetes or heart problems. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. Silly thing. Had it set, all healed up fine. And I had my appendix out when I was in my twenties. That was unpleasant, but it was a long time ago. Other than that… no. No major surgeries, no hospital stays. I've always been lucky, I suppose. I try to avoid doctors as much as possible, to be honest. They just like to poke and prod and tell you things you don't want to hear. But this heat… this is getting serious. It's not something I can ignore anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child, appendix removed in your twenties, otherwise healthy. I understand your reluctance to come to the doctor, but you’re right to address this now. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he had a weak heart, I think. Died young, in his sixties. My mother lived to be quite old, almost ninety. She was a tough woman, very resilient. She never complained about anything. My brother… he’s healthy as a horse, lives in Nepal still. No health problems that I know of. Other than that… I don't really know. We didn't talk much about family history. It’s not something we did. Mostly, we just focused on getting on with things. It's not like knowing if your uncle had a cough is going to change anything, is it? I mean, you still get the cough if you get the cough.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Mr. Coby. Your father’s heart condition is something we’ll keep in mind. Now, just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't believe in all those pills. They just mask the problem, they don't fix it. I take a bit of turmeric sometimes, for my joints. My helper told me it’s good for inflammation. But that's it. Nothing regularly. I prefer to deal with things myself, if possible. A good night’s sleep and a bit of hard work usually does the trick. But this heat… it's different. I can't work my way out of this one.
DOCTOR: Okay, just turmeric occasionally for your joints. No regular medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've eaten everything, traveled everywhere. Never had any trouble. I'm not a fussy man. Dust gets to me a bit, sometimes, but that's just a sniffle. Nothing serious. Honestly, I think people worry too much about allergies these days. A bit of discomfort never hurt anyone. Look at all the things people used to do, before all these regulations and warnings. They didn't bother with allergies, and they were perfectly fine. It's all a bit of a fuss, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Thank you for answering all of those questions. That gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to check your temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Don't poke too hard, though. And try not to take too long. I have things to do, you know. This heat isn't going anywhere, and I need to get back to work if I'm going to earn a living. But go ahead. Just be gentle, alright? My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Coby. I’ll be as gentle as possible. It won’t take long. First, let’s check your temperature. Okay, your temperature is 100.2°F. A little elevated. Now, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 162/94. That’s a bit high. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart rate is 88 and regular. Your lungs sound clear, but I am hearing a slight murmur. And your pulse is a little weak. Do you feel any pain in your chest?
PATIENT: A murmur? Weak pulse? What’s that mean? I don’t feel any chest pain, no. Just tired. Always tired these days. And hot. Like I said, constantly hot. So, what’s going on? Is it something serious? I knew I should have stayed home. This always happens when I come to the doctor. They find something wrong, even if there isn't anything really wrong. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit lightheaded. Maybe it’s just the heat. But what did you find? Tell me straight, alright? Don’t beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Coby. It’s good you’re asking directly. Your slightly elevated temperature, high blood pressure, and the murmur I heard are things we need to investigate further. The weak pulse is also concerning, especially with you reporting feeling tired and lightheaded. A murmur is an unusual sound heard during a heartbeat. It can be caused by a variety of things, some harmless, some requiring treatment. The high blood pressure, combined with the murmur and your symptoms, is what's concerning me most at the moment. It could indicate a problem with your heart or blood vessels. I want to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. I also want to order an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity, and a chest X-ray to see if there are any problems with your lungs or heart size. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Of course. Honestly, it’s always something. Fine, do what you have to do. But I’m telling you, I feel fine. Just a bit hot and tired. It's the heat, I tell you! But alright, do the tests. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long. And tell me what all this is going to cost. I’m not made of money, you know. I’m a painter, not a doctor. And I have bills to pay. So, tell me straight. What’s the damage? And when can I expect the results? Don't tell me "a few days," alright? I need to know. Now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Coby. I assure you, we’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible. The blood tests and EKG should be able to be done here at the clinic today. The chest X-ray will likely need to be scheduled at an imaging center nearby, but we can arrange that for tomorrow morning. The cost of the blood tests is approximately $250, the EKG is $150, and the chest X-ray will be around $300. Your Medicare insurance should cover a significant portion of these costs, but there may be a copay or deductible depending on your plan. Our billing department can provide you with a more accurate estimate based on your specific coverage. The results of the blood tests typically take 24-48 hours, and the EKG results should be available within a few hours. Once we have all the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail. In the meantime, I recommend you stay hydrated, avoid strenuous activity, and avoid prolonged exposure to the heat. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, alright. $700… It’s highway robbery, if you ask me. But what choice do I have? Alright, do the tests. Schedule the X-ray for tomorrow morning, as early as possible. And tell the billing department to call me with a real estimate. I don’t want any surprises. So, I just sit here and wait for them to poke and prod me some more? And then wait for the results? Sounds like a waste of a perfectly good day, if you ask me. Alright. Let's get it over with. What's first? Blood, is it? Wonderful. Just try to be quick, alright? And don’t ask me about my medical history again. You’ve already asked me everything twice. Just… get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. No need to repeat anything. I’ll have the phlebotomist come in to draw your blood. It will just take a few minutes. And then we’ll get you set up for the EKG. I’ll leave you in the care of the technician now. Please let me know if you need anything at all. .
