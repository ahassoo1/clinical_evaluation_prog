DOCTOR: Hi Rayshun, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. My name is Rayshun Knabenshue. I appreciate you taking the time to see me. I’m here regarding a matter at my place of work… it concerns the masks they’re requiring. I'm hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, or perhaps alternative arrangements.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So this is related to the mask policy at your work. We can definitely talk about that. To get a better understanding of the situation, can you tell me a little more about why you’re seeking an exemption or alternative arrangements?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s a bit… difficult to explain, truthfully. It's not a simple discomfort, if that makes sense. I find wearing a mask… well, it causes a feeling of… restriction. It’s not that I can’t breathe, but it evokes a strong, unpleasant sensation. A tightness in my chest, and a… a bit of anxiety. It's connected to… experiences from my past, I believe. I don't wish to go into detail unless necessary, but it's deeply personal and unsettling. It impacts my ability to focus and perform my duties effectively. I work with vulnerable people, and I need to be fully present and calm when I’m assisting them.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Rayshun. That sounds really difficult, and it's good you're recognizing how it's affecting you. It's completely understandable that past experiences can create these kinds of responses. So, just to clarify, you're experiencing anxiety and a sensation of tightness in your chest specifically when wearing a mask?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is precisely it. The sensations don't occur otherwise. I feel perfectly fine when not wearing one. It’s truly only when the mask is on my face that these feelings arise. It's… almost immediate. I've tried different types, different fits, all to no avail. The result is the same. It’s not a physical allergy, I’ve confirmed that. It’s… more of an emotional or psychological response, I suppose. I apologize if I’m not explaining this clearly. It’s not something easily put into words.
DOCTOR: No, you're explaining it very well, Rayshun. It sounds like you’ve already done some troubleshooting, which is good. And it does sound like this is more related to a psychological response, and that's perfectly valid. I'm going to quickly review your chart here to see if there's anything relevant in your medical history. Just one moment. Okay… I see you have a history of… some previous episodes of generalized anxiety, managed with lifestyle changes. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is correct. I had a period a few years ago where my anxiety was more pronounced. I was able to manage it through regular exercise, mindfulness practices, and a strong support network. I haven’t required medication, and generally, I’ve been doing very well. The mask issue… it feels like a resurgence of those feelings, but specifically triggered by this one circumstance. I hadn’t anticipated it would be such a problem. It's… frustrating, because I enjoy my work, and I take pride in providing good care.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a little more context. So, knowing your history of anxiety, it makes sense that the mask could be a trigger. We need to figure out the best way to address this so you can continue to work safely and comfortably. I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, and check your oxygen levels to rule out any underlying physical issues that could be contributing to the chest tightness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. I understand the need to rule out any physical causes. Please proceed. I have no objections whatsoever. I assure you, I’ve been mindful of my body, and I’m quite certain it’s not a physical ailment, but I fully support your thoroughness. It’s reassuring to know you’re taking all possibilities into consideration.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you could just have a seat here for me. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Oxygen saturation is 98%, which is excellent. So, physically, everything looks good. No signs of any respiratory distress or underlying issues. Now, just a deep breath in… and out… again… good. So that helps to confirm that this is likely related to the anxiety and the psychological response to the mask. Now, let’s talk about possible options. We could explore a formal accommodation request at your workplace. That would involve documentation, potentially a consultation with a mental health professional. Are you open to that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am very much open to that. A formal accommodation request sounds like the most reasonable path forward. I understand documentation will be required, and I am willing to comply with whatever procedures are necessary. A consultation with a mental health professional would also be acceptable, if you deem it appropriate. I simply wish to find a solution that allows me to continue performing my duties effectively and safely, without jeopardizing my well-being. I'm grateful for your guidance in this matter.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I think that's the best approach. I can definitely provide documentation outlining my assessment – that your symptoms are likely related to anxiety triggered by mask use, and that a formal accommodation may be beneficial. To be thorough, and to best support your accommodation request, I would recommend a brief consultation with a therapist or counselor specializing in anxiety. They can provide a more in-depth assessment and potentially offer coping strategies specifically tailored to your situation. I have a list of local providers I can share with you. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please do share that list with me. I believe a consultation with a specialist would be incredibly helpful. I’ve managed my anxiety successfully in the past, but a professional’s perspective on this specific trigger would be invaluable. I appreciate you offering that resource. It’s reassuring to know there are options available, and that I’m not alone in navigating this challenge. Thank you again for your understanding and support.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Here’s that list. I’ve included a few different options, with varying specialties and insurance acceptance. I’m going to write up a summary of our conversation and my assessment here. I’ll also include a note recommending a consultation with a mental health professional. Do you have any questions for me before I finalize everything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have covered everything thoroughly. I do not have any further questions at this time. I am confident that the documentation and the referral will be sufficient to initiate the accommodation process at my workplace. I am truly grateful for your professionalism, your compassion, and your willingness to listen to my concerns. This has been a very productive and reassuring consultation. Thank you again for your time and expertise.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Here’s a copy of the summary for your records. It outlines everything we discussed today, as well as my assessment and recommendations. I wish you all the best with the accommodation process. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Amussen. I greatly appreciate your assistance, and I will certainly keep your contact information should any further questions arise. Have a pleasant day.
