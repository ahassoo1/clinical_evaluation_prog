DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Neppl. It's August 2nd, 2025. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s very kind of you to see me. I’m Velda Squiers. I’m needing a wee bit of information, if you don't mind. I’m planning a cruise, you see, and they require a form filled out by a doctor. Just a general check, really, to say I’m fit to travel. Do you handle those sorts of things?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Squiers. I frequently complete those travel medical forms. It's quite common. We’ll just need to go through a bit of your medical history to ensure the form is accurate and complete. To start, have you had any significant illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, aye. Let me think now… significant illnesses. Well, when I was a girl, I had the measles, of course, but that was a lifetime ago! And scarlet fever, I believe. But nothing serious since then, thankfully. Hospitalized… hmm. My husband, God rest his soul, he passed away five years ago this coming November. I was in hospital with him then, naturally, but that wasn’t me being ill, you understand. Just… supporting him. I had a touch of the flu once, maybe ten years back, but I stayed home for that, didn’t need to be admitted. Is that what you mean, serious things?
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Squiers. When you say “serious things,” I'm looking for any major medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, lung problems, or anything that might affect your ability to travel safely. It sounds like you’ve been quite healthy overall, which is wonderful. Just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, well, now that you mention it… Doctor MacIntyre – lovely man, retired now – he did say my blood pressure was a wee bit elevated a couple of times at routine check-ups. Not enough to do anything about, he said, just to watch my salt intake. And I think he mentioned my cholesterol was a little high too, but I don’t recall him prescribing anything for it. Just advised a healthier diet. Honestly, I’ve a terrible sweet tooth, so that was easier said than done! I haven't seen a doctor regularly since he retired, though. Would that be important?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know that, Ms. Squiers. Yes, that is important information. Even slightly elevated blood pressure and cholesterol can be relevant when considering travel, especially a cruise. Do you currently take any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, not a single one. I pride myself on not being one for pills! I take a multivitamin now and then, just to be on the safe side, but that's it. I used to take something for indigestion, years ago, but I found peppermint tea worked just as well, and without the side effects, you see. So I stopped that a long time ago. Just the peppermint tea now, when my stomach’s a bit off.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And you don’t have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, do you?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine I’ve taken – though, as I said, I don’t take much! My husband, poor man, he was allergic to penicillin, but I’ve never had any trouble myself. Does that cover it? I’m happy to tell you anything else you need to know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Squiers. To complete the assessment, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Have any close relatives – parents, siblings, or children – had any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… let me think. My mother, God rest her, she had a touch of arthritis in her later years, but nothing too serious. My father, he lived a long and healthy life, a farmer he was, very strong. He passed away in his sleep, peacefully. My brother, Alistair, he’s still with us, thankfully, but he’s always been a bit prone to colds and the flu, nothing major. And I didn't have any children, sadly. So, nothing major on either side, I suppose. My husband’s family… well, I didn’t know them terribly well. They lived down south, and we didn’t see them often. I’m afraid that’s all I can tell you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Squiers. That’s helpful. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked a pipe, for a time, but I always made him smoke it outside. I just couldn't abide the smell! I believe it’s a terrible habit, and I’ve always been very careful about my health. So, no, never smoked a day in my life. Thank goodness for that!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. Squiers. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a wee dram now and then, Doctor. A small glass of whisky on special occasions, like Hogmanay or a birthday. Nothing excessive, you understand. I enjoy a good sherry with a biscuit now and then too. But I wouldn't say I drink regularly. It's more of a social thing, really. Keeps the cold away, you know!
DOCTOR: Very good. Finally, could you tell me your approximate height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh, aye, of course. Let me think… I’m around five foot seven, I believe. Maybe five foot seven and a half. And my weight… oh, dear, I haven’t weighed myself in a while. But I’d say around ten stone, give or take a pound or two. I’m a bit of a slim build, you see. Always have been. I used to be a dancer, you know. Kept me very trim! Is that alright? Do you need a more precise number?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Squiers. Five foot seven and ten stone is very helpful. Now, to be thorough, I’d like to quickly listen to your heart and lungs and take your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I'm happy to cooperate. I always trust a good doctor. Go right ahead, then. I haven’t had my blood pressure taken in a while, so it will be good to know. Just let me know if anything seems amiss, you hear?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Squiers. If you could just sit back and relax, please. Your heart sounds good, and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 138 over 82, but not significantly concerning given your age and occasional alcohol use. We can monitor it. Now, one final question. Are you experiencing any pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or any other symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear about my heart and lungs! Slightly elevated, you say? Well, I do get a wee bit anxious sometimes, especially when I’m organising something. Perhaps that explains it? And no, Doctor, thankfully. No pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness. I’m feeling perfectly fine, really. A bit tired perhaps, but that’s just from all the preparations for the cruise. Packing and making lists and… well, it’s a lot of work! But nothing to worry about. I feel fit as a fiddle, to be honest. Is that enough, then? Do you think I’m alright to travel?
DOCTOR: That’s reassuring to hear, Ms. Squiers. Based on your history and my examination, I do not see any contraindications to travel. You are generally in good health. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend checking it again with your primary care physician when you return from your cruise. And, as always, stay hydrated, wear comfortable shoes, and protect yourself from the sun. I’ll complete this form for you now, attesting that you are fit for travel. Here you are. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful news, Doctor! Thank you so much for your time and reassurance. I was worried about the blood pressure, but you've put my mind at ease. No, I don't think I have any questions, thank you. You've been very thorough and kind. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I suppose that’s everything, then? I’m very grateful for your help. I shall be sure to mention the blood pressure to Doctor MacIntyre when I return. It was lovely meeting you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I’m glad I could help. Enjoy your cruise! Safe travels and do take care. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any unexpected health concerns while you're away. Have a lovely day.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you again, Doctor. I certainly will. You have a lovely day as well. And thank you, truly, for everything.
