DOCTOR: Hi Emileigh, welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi! Um… well, I just moved here. And I need to… get set up with a doctor, I guess? I have Medicare. It's nice to meet you too. I don't really… remember what I'm supposed to do when I move, you know? It’s all a bit much.
DOCTOR: I completely understand – moving is a huge undertaking, and getting all the medical stuff sorted can feel overwhelming. Don’t worry, we’ll get you all set up. It’s good you’re getting this done right away. So, you’re establishing care with me, that’s great! Before we dive into that, let's just talk a bit about your overall health. Are you currently experiencing any health problems or have any concerns you'd like to discuss?
PATIENT: Um… not really? I mean, nothing big. I get tired sometimes, but everyone does, right? And my back… aches a little if I stand for too long. I work with… machines. It’s kinda hard work. I don’t know if that’s normal or not. I'm married, by the way. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and some back discomfort, especially with your work… those are good things to mention. And yes, your marital status can be relevant, so thank you for sharing that. It helps me get a fuller picture. When you say tired, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Uh… it’s just… like, at the end of the day. I’m really tired. Not like, sick tired, just… worn out. Even after sleeping. And sometimes during the day, I feel kinda… foggy? Like I can’t really… focus. It's hard to explain. It’s been going on for a while, I think. Maybe a few months? I really don't remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue that doesn't really get better with sleep, and some difficulty with concentration… a few months now. That’s helpful. It’s good you’re noticing these things. Now, thinking about your past health… have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Um… I think so? Maybe? I had… something when I was little, I think my mom told me. Something with my… ears? I had tubes put in. But I don’t really remember it. And… I think I broke my arm once. But that’s it, I think. Honestly, I'm not very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, ear tubes as a child and a broken arm… that’s good to know. It's perfectly alright if you don't remember everything – we can always look things up if needed. Have you ever had any surgeries besides the tubes in your ears?
PATIENT: Oh… um… I don't think so? No, I’m pretty sure not. I would remember that, right? I mean, surgery is… pretty big. Unless… maybe when I was really little? Before I even started school? I honestly don't know. It's all kinda… blurry.
DOCTOR: No worries at all. We don't need to stress over things you can't recall. It sounds like no surgeries beyond the ear tubes. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… um… My grandma had… something with her heart, I think? And my uncle… he has diabetes. I think. He’s always talking about his sugar. My mom… she gets headaches a lot. Really bad ones. That’s all I can really remember, honestly. They don't really talk about much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart issues with your grandma, diabetes with your uncle, and frequent headaches for your mom. That’s good information, thank you. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Um… none? I don't think so. I mean, I take vitamins sometimes. But that's it. Nothing the doctor has given me, anyway. I don't really like taking pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications besides occasional vitamins. That’s good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies… um… I think I'm allergic to… cats? Yeah, I get really sneezy around cats. And… sometimes my skin gets itchy if I wear certain fabrics. Like… wool? I don't know. It's not bad itchy, just… annoying. I don't think anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so allergies to cats and some skin sensitivity to certain fabrics. Noted. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…? Um… I work a lot. With machines, like I said. I usually just go straight home after work. My husband and I… we watch TV sometimes. I don't really… do much else. I don't really have hobbies, I guess. We don't really… go out much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a fairly sedentary lifestyle with work being the primary activity. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, definitely not! I don't smoke, never have. And I hardly ever drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine once in a while with dinner. And… no, nothing like… drugs. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no drug use. That’s good to know. Alright, Emileigh, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better overall picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, okay. That’s fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have to get back home to… well, to relax, I guess. And feed the cat. Even though I'm allergic.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. Let's start with your height and weight. Okay, I’m seeing here you are 5’0” and 160 pounds. Your lymph nodes feel normal. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems within normal limits so far, but based on your reported fatigue and slight difficulty with concentration, I'd like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out any underlying causes like anemia, thyroid issues, or vitamin deficiencies. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Blood work…? Um… okay. If you think it's necessary. I don’t really like needles, but… if it will help. What exactly will it… do? And how long will it take to get the results? I have to get back to work, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, and I’ll make sure it’s as quick and comfortable as possible. The blood work will give us a lot of information about what’s going on inside your body. We’ll be checking things like your red blood cell count, thyroid hormone levels, vitamin D, and a few other key indicators. It usually takes about 3-5 business days to get the results back. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Would you like me to go over the specific tests we'll be doing?
PATIENT: Um… no, that’s okay. Too much information. Just… tell me what I need to do. Where do I go to get the blood taken? And… will it hurt a lot?
DOCTOR: Alright, no problem. The blood work can be done right here in the clinic, at the lab just down the hall. It’s a quick process. As for the pain, it’s usually just a brief pinch, like a quick mosquito bite. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will make it as comfortable as possible. Here’s the requisition form. Just take this to the lab, and they’ll take care of everything. They’re open Monday through Friday, 8am to 5pm. Do you have any questions about where the lab is located or how to schedule an appointment?
PATIENT: Um… no, I think I can find it. It's just down the hall, you said? Okay. And… do I need to fast before the blood work? Like, not eat anything? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question! Yes, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood work. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. It's important for accurate results. I’ve written “fasting required” on the form to remind the lab technician. Alright, Emileigh, that's everything for today. Please let us know if you have any questions after the bloodwork or if anything changes. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are back to discuss everything. Do you have any questions before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you. It was… nice meeting you. Even though I forgot a lot of stuff. I guess I’ll go find the lab now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. It was lovely meeting you too, and don’t worry about forgetting things – that’s perfectly normal. We’re here to help, and we’ll take things at your pace. The lab is just down the hall to your right. If you have any trouble finding it, just ask the receptionist at the front desk. Take care, and we’ll see you soon. .
