DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Could you please tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, uh, consultation. Right. It's... about travel. I need to go somewhere. Somewhere far. My wife... she wanted to go. Before... before everything. So, I guess I still wanna go. But I need... shots or something? I don’t know. What do people even need for travel these days? It’s all so complicated.
DOCTOR: I see. A trip in memory of your wife, that’s very thoughtful. Travel medicine can be complicated, you’re right. To best advise you, could you tell me where you are planning to travel?
PATIENT: Uh… somewhere in… Asia, I think. She always talked about… Nepal. Is that right? Nepal? It was her… home, I think. Or close to it. I don’t really pay attention to… places. Just… she wanted to go back. That's all I remember. Does that… help? I don't know what I need for Nepal. Or even if I'm going to the right Nepal. There's lots of places, isn't there?
DOCTOR: Yes, that helps quite a bit. Nepal is a beautiful country. And you are correct, there are many places with similar names. We’ll assume you’re referring to the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal in South Asia for now. To determine what you might need in terms of vaccinations and preventative medications, I’ll need to gather some more information. First, do you know where in Nepal you’ll be traveling?
PATIENT: Uh... no. Not really. She… she had a village. Somewhere… in the mountains, I think. Very small. She never said the name. Too… complicated for me to remember, I guess. Just… the mountains. Lots of green. That's all I know. Will I need a special map? I don’t do well with… directions. Or remembering things, you know? It’s been… a while.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re planning to travel to a rural, mountainous region of Nepal. That’s helpful to know. Even without a specific village name, we can still make some recommendations. To begin, let’s review your medical history. Have you had any vaccinations recently, or do you have a record of your previous vaccinations?
PATIENT: Vaccinations? Uh… I think so. When I was… younger. For… work, maybe? I build… parts for planes. They made us get some things. But I don't have any paper. My wife… she always kept all the papers. After… well. I don't know what I had. Yellow card? Is that what they call it? I don’t think so. I just… show up and get poked. It hurts, mostly. I don't pay attention to the names.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s not uncommon to not have a record readily available. We can proceed without it, but it’s good to know. To ensure your safety, we’ll likely need to repeat some vaccinations. Before we discuss those, let's briefly go over your past medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I'm… strong. I work with my hands all day. Building things. I eat… okay. Not fancy. Just… normal food. Never been to the hospital, except… you know. After. But that wasn’t… a normal thing. I don’t get… sick. Usually. Just tired. A lot. But that’s… everything. No fancy diseases or anything. I’m a simple man.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And I appreciate you sharing that with me. Let's move on to any past surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgery. Never. I break things, I fix things. I don’t… get cut open. Too much… poking. I don’t like poking. Just the shots are bad enough. No… nothing ever needed fixing inside. Everything always worked. Mostly. Just… tiring work, you know? But no cutting. Definitely no cutting.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries, that’s good to know. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Uh… my wife’s family… they all lived… a long time. In the mountains. Very healthy people. They ate… everything. From the land, I think. She said. Never got sick much. Her father… he was very old when he… passed. Just… old age. No fancy diseases or anything. My family… I don’t really know. I didn’t… see them much. Just… work. Mostly. So no. No diseases. I don't think. They were… simple people. Like me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. Makes you cough. Bad for building things. Drink… sometimes. A little beer. With my friends. Before… before everything. Not much anymore. Just… sad. Drugs? No. Never. I need my hands to work. Clear head. No… no bad things. Just… sad sometimes. That's all. Simple. Like me.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for sharing that. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh… no. I don’t think so. I eat everything. My wife… she cooked everything. Never had a problem. Sometimes my skin gets… itchy. But that’s… the dust at work. Lots of metal dust. Or… the sun. Gets hot. But no… fancy allergies. No hives or anything. Just… itchy sometimes. Simple. Like me. I don’t pay attention to… fancy things. Like allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t like… pills. Make me feel… funny. Just… tired. I take… nothing. Maybe some… pain killer. For my back. After work. But not all the time. Just… when it really hurts. Simple. Like me. No fancy medicine. Just… try to work through it. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar, thank you for providing that information. Now, let's perform a brief physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. Fine. But… quick, please? I don’t… like doctors much. Too much… poking. And listening. Makes me… nervous. Just… quick, please? I have… things to do. Planning. Remembering. It’s… tiring. But… okay. Quick. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I’ll be as quick as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 130 over 80. That's within the normal range. Now, let’s check your pulse. 72 beats per minute, regular rhythm. And your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is also normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. This will just take a moment. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds good so far. Do you have any pain anywhere currently?
PATIENT: No… no pain. Just… tired. My back… sometimes aches. After work. But it’s… normal. Building things is… hard. But no… sharp pain. Just… dull ache. It goes away when I… rest. Sometimes. It's… okay. Don't worry about it. You said everything sounds good? That's… good. Can I… go now? I need to… think. About things. About her. And the mountains. It's… tiring. All this… poking. And listening. But… good? You said good?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Tayar, everything sounds good. Your vital signs are stable, and your heart and lungs sound clear. The ache in your back sounds like it’s likely related to the physical demands of your work. We can discuss some strategies for managing that discomfort later if you'd like. Based on our conversation and the exam, you appear to be in generally good health. However, given your travel plans to a rural area of Nepal, I highly recommend several vaccinations and preventative medications to protect you from potential health risks. Would you like me to outline those recommendations for you now?
PATIENT: Uh… vaccinations? More poking? I don’t… like poking. But… Nepal. She wanted me to go. So… yes. Tell me. What do I need? But… quick, please? I need to… remember things. Planning. It's… tiring. But… yes. Tell me the poking things. But… not too many. Please. Just… what I need. For her. And Nepal.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tayar. I understand your hesitation, and I’ll keep it concise. Given your destination, I recommend the following vaccinations: Hepatitis A: This is recommended for anyone traveling to areas with poor sanitation. Typhoid: This is also recommended for travelers to areas with poor sanitation. Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis : It’s important to ensure you’re up-to-date on this. Japanese Encephalitis: Depending on the specific areas you plan to visit and the time of year, this may be recommended. Additionally, I recommend discussing the possibility of taking Malaria prophylaxis with me, as Nepal has areas with Malaria risk. We’ll also discuss preventative measures to avoid traveler's diarrhea. These vaccinations usually require a series of shots over several weeks. We can schedule those appointments today. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Uh… a series of shots? Several weeks? That's… a lot of poking. And… names. Hepatitis… Typhoid… Japanese… I can't… remember. Malaria? Is that… dangerous? Several weeks… I need to go… soon. Before… before the weather changes. Before I… forget. Can’t I just… take a pill? One pill? To protect me? Just… one? No poking? Is that… possible? Just… one thing? For her. And Nepal. Please? Several weeks is… too long. I need to… remember things. Planning. It's… tiring. Just… one pill? Is that… possible?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Tayar. You're right to ask about simpler options. Unfortunately, there isn't a single pill that provides comprehensive protection against all the potential health risks in Nepal. While there are medications to prevent Malaria, they are taken daily for the duration of your trip and for a period after you return. They aren’t a one-time fix. Regarding the other vaccinations, they are essential to build immunity to these diseases, and they require multiple doses spaced over time to be effective. However, we can prioritize the most critical vaccinations based on your planned itinerary and timeframe. We could start with the Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccinations, which are often recommended for any travel to Nepal. These require two doses, spaced several weeks apart. We can also discuss the possibility of starting a course of Malaria prophylaxis today, even if we don't complete all the vaccinations before your departure. Would that be a reasonable compromise?
PATIENT: Compromise… okay. Two shots… less poking. And… the pill. For the Malaria. That’s… better. But… how long? How long do I need to… take the pill? And… what does it do? I don’t… like taking things. Makes me… feel funny. And… the shots. Two shots. How long until… they work? I need to go… soon. Before the weather changes. Before I… forget. Two shots… and the pill. How long? Tell me. Please. Just… quick. I need to… remember things. Planning. It's… tiring. Two shots… and the pill. How long? And… what does the pill do?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tayar. Let's break it down. The Hepatitis A vaccine requires two doses, six to twelve months apart for full protection. We can give you the first dose today. The Typhoid vaccine requires two doses, taken at least two weeks apart. We can also schedule the second dose today, giving you some protection before your trip. The Malaria medication, typically atovaquone-proguanil, is taken daily, starting 1-2 days before entering the Malaria-risk area, during your entire stay, and for 7 days after leaving the area. It prevents the Malaria parasite from developing in your system. Side effects are usually mild, such as nausea or stomach upset, but it’s important to be aware of them. It’s important to understand that even with the vaccinations and medication, there is no guarantee of complete protection. We will also discuss preventative measures to avoid mosquito bites and traveler’s diarrhea. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Daily pill… for the whole trip? And a week after? That’s… a lot of pills. And… side effects? Nausea? Stomach upset? I already feel… tired. I don’t… want to feel worse. And… no guarantee? So… I could still get sick? Even with all the poking? And the pills? That’s… not good. She… she wanted me to be safe. To remember her… happy. Look… can I just… skip the pills? Just the shots? Two shots… and… maybe some spray? For the mosquitos? Is that… possible? I don’t… like taking things. Makes me… feel funny. Just the shots. And… spray. Is that… enough? For her. And Nepal. Please?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Tayar. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about taking medication, especially if you're already feeling tired. However, I must strongly advise against skipping the Malaria prophylaxis. Nepal does have areas with Malaria, and the consequences of contracting Malaria can be very severe, even life-threatening. It's not a risk we can simply ignore. While the vaccinations provide protection against certain diseases, they do not protect you against Malaria. To mitigate the risk, we can explore alternative Malaria medications. Some have fewer side effects than others, but they all require daily dosing for the duration of your trip and a week after. We can discuss the options and see if we can find one that you’re more comfortable with. Regarding mosquito repellent, it’s essential to use a repellent containing DEET, picaridin, or IR3535, and to wear protective clothing, but it’s not a substitute for medication. I am concerned about your health and safety, Mr. Tayar. Would you be open to discussing the alternative medications with me?
PATIENT: Alternative… okay. Fewer side effects… that’s… better. But… what are the options? Tell me. Quickly. I need to… think. About things. About her. And Nepal. Fewer side effects… and… what are the options? And… what happens if I do get sick? Even with the pills? And the spray? And the shots? Is there… a hospital? In Nepal? A good one? I don't… want to be sick. I need to… remember things. Planning. It's… tiring. Fewer side effects… options… hospital… Tell me. Please. Just… quick. I need to… remember things. Planning. It's… tiring.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tayar. Let’s address your concerns. The two main alternative Malaria medications are doxycycline and mefloquine. Doxycycline is taken daily and is generally well-tolerated, but it can cause stomach upset and can increase your sensitivity to the sun. It also cannot be taken with certain medications. Mefloquine is also taken weekly but can have more significant side effects, including nausea, dizziness, and vivid dreams. It’s not recommended for individuals with a history of psychiatric conditions. I would generally recommend doxycycline as the first option, given your preference for fewer side effects. However, we need to discuss your medical history and any medications you're currently taking to ensure it's safe for you. Regarding hospitals in Nepal, Kathmandu has several reputable hospitals, including Patan Hospital and Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital. However, medical facilities in rural areas may be limited. It's essential to have travel insurance that covers medical evacuation in case of an emergency. If you were to develop symptoms of Malaria, such as fever, chills, and headache, it's crucial to seek medical attention immediately. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential. We can discuss the symptoms and how to find a healthcare provider in Nepal before your trip. Does that address your concerns?
PATIENT: Doxycycline… okay. Fewer side effects… that’s… better. But… sun sensitivity? I work outside. Building things. And… stomach upset? I already feel… tired. Look… can I just… take something after I get sick? If I do get sick? Just… something to help? I don’t… want to take pills every day. For the whole trip. And a week after. It's… tiring. Travel insurance… okay. Medical evacuation… that sounds… expensive. But… okay. Look… just… tell me what I need. For the shots. And… if I do get sick. Just the basics. Please. I need to… remember things. Planning. It's… tiring. Shots… and… if I get sick. The basics. Please. Just… quick. I need to… remember things. Planning. It's… tiring.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Tayar. However, there is no medication you can take after you get sick with Malaria that will prevent serious complications or death. Malaria progresses rapidly, and early treatment with antimalarial medication is essential. Here’s what you need: 1. Hepatitis A vaccine: One dose today. We'll schedule the second dose in six to twelve months. 2. Typhoid vaccine: Two doses, scheduled two weeks apart. 3. Doxycycline: Start taking 100mg daily one to two days before entering a Malaria-risk area, continue throughout your trip, and for seven days after leaving. This is non-negotiable if you are traveling to a Malaria-risk area. 4. Travel insurance: Ensure your policy covers medical evacuation. 5. Mosquito repellent: Containing DEET, picaridin, or IR3535. 6. Awareness of Malaria symptoms: Fever, chills, headache, muscle aches. Seek medical attention immediately if you develop these symptoms. If you develop symptoms of Malaria, you will need to see a doctor immediately and receive treatment with an antimalarial medication. The treatment will vary depending on the severity of the infection and your medical history. I understand this is a lot to take in, but it’s essential to prioritize your health and safety. Do you have any further questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Shots… typhoid… doxycycline… every day… insurance… spray… symptoms… Doxycycline… every day… for the whole trip… and a week after… That’s… a lot of pills. Okay. Just… schedule the shots. And the pills. Get it over with. Just… get it over with. Just… schedule it. Please. I need to… remember things. Planning. It’s… tiring. Just… schedule it. And… tell me when to come. And… how much it will cost. Just… schedule it. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tayar. I understand this is a lot, and I appreciate your willingness to prioritize your health. I’ve scheduled your Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccines for today. We’ll give you the first dose of Hepatitis A, and schedule the second Typhoid dose for two weeks from now. I will also write you a prescription for Doxycycline, with instructions for starting it one to two days before your trip. The cost for the vaccines is $150 in total. The Doxycycline prescription will depend on your insurance coverage, but I estimate it will be around $30-$50. I will also provide you with a handout outlining the Malaria symptoms and preventative measures. Please come back today at 2:00 PM for your vaccinations. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… no questions. Just… 2:00 PM. For the shots. Thank you… I think. For… everything. I… I need to go. Now. I have… things to do. Planning. It's… tiring. Thank you… again.
DOCTOR:
