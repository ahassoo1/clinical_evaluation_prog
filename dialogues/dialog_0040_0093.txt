DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Redfern, let's get straight to it. You're 29, healthy-ish looking, though... perhaps a bit too relaxed in your posture. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hm. Relaxed? I suppose. Look, honestly, it's been... a bit of everything lately. Sleep’s been off. Not terrible, just… not right. And I feel like I used to have more… pep, you know? Used to be able to work all day tuning these old instruments without feeling it. Now? It's a struggle. Don't even get me started on trying to lift the bass drums for the school band. It's just… tiring. I figured someone should look at it, before it gets worse.
DOCTOR: "Pep," right. Vague, but we'll work with it. Sleep being "not right" is also… not terribly helpful. Let’s try to be specific. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. How long? See, that's the tricky part. Everything feels a bit… blurry lately. A few months, I guess? Maybe longer. It's hard to say. It wasn’t sudden, more like… a slow fade. And honestly, after… everything… time doesn't really feel the same. Don’t worry about it. It’s just… been a while.
DOCTOR: "A while." Wonderful. Look, Mr. Redfern, I appreciate you’re… dealing with things, but I’m a doctor, not a mind reader. When you say “everything,” are you referring to any specific life events that might be contributing to this… fatigue?
PATIENT: Look, are we really going to go there? It's... personal. But fine. My wife… she passed away about a year ago. Car accident. It was… awful. And now I'm just… well, here. Trying to keep the shop running, trying to… function. I don't see how that has anything to do with feeling tired though. Everyone gets sad when something bad happens, right? It shouldn’t stop me from being able to tune a violin.
DOCTOR: Right, yes, of course. A tragic loss, I'm sure. But grief can manifest in a multitude of ways, Mr. Redfern. Fatigue, sleep disturbances… it’s not uncommon. Still, we need to rule out anything physical. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Ugh. Let me think. I guess… my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I just don't feel hungry much of the time. And sometimes I get… a bit of a headache. Nothing major, just… a dull ache behind the eyes. And I’ve been… clumsy. Dropped a few tools at the shop, which is really annoying. It’s embarrassing, honestly. A professional shouldn’t be dropping perfectly good screwdrivers. It's probably just me being careless.
DOCTOR: Loss of appetite, headaches, clumsiness… alright. Any fever, chills, night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? Definitely not. Night sweats? Look, I live in a perfectly normal house. It gets warm sometimes. I don’t keep track of whether I sweat in my sleep. Honestly, I think I’m just… run down. A bit out of shape. That’s all. This whole thing feels like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. Let's not dismiss things prematurely. I still need to do a basic physical exam, just to be thorough. Blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs… the usual. And perhaps a quick neurological check. Just to rule things out. If you'll just step over here…
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. It's not like I have anything better to do, I suppose. But if you find nothing, I'm telling you, it's just… stress. And maybe I need a new mattress.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is… 130/80. Not terrible. Heart rate is 72, regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. I can see your finger. It’s… a finger. Are we almost done? This is making me feel… strangely vulnerable. I haven't had someone poke and prod me like this in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Reflexes are… a little diminished, actually. Not drastically, but noticeable. And your grip strength seems slightly weaker on this side. Can you squeeze my fingers as hard as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that good enough? Honestly, I’ve been doing a lot of fine work lately, tuning these delicate instruments. Maybe that's weakened my grip? It’s not like I’m a lumberjack. I told you, it's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to order some routine blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function tests… just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And I think an MRI of the brain would be prudent, given the diminished reflexes and slightly weaker grip. It’s best to be thorough, Mr. Redfern. We need to rule out anything serious. This isn’t just about stress or a new mattress.
PATIENT: An MRI? Now you’re just trying to scare me. Look, I appreciate you being… thorough, but this is getting ridiculous. I'm perfectly fine! I just need a vacation, maybe a new set of tools, and a good night's sleep. I think I’ve wasted enough of my time here. And frankly, yours. I'm not doing an MRI. It sounds… unpleasant. And unnecessary. I think I'll just… manage on my own, thank you very much. .
