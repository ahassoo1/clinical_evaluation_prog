DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Giganti, you say? Yes, right. Well, it’s… something about a check-up. For… work. Something to do with acting, I think. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. They just sent me over here. Hope it won't take too long. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. A work physical, then. No problem at all. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. To start, could you tell me a little more about the type of acting you do?
PATIENT: Acting… well, I mostly… usher. And take tickets. Sometimes I help people find their seats in the lobby. It’s not… glamorous, I suppose. But it keeps me busy. Been doing it a long time. A very long time. Honestly, I can’t quite recall how long.
DOCTOR: That sounds like important work, Mr. Krahn – ensuring everyone has a good experience at the theatre is vital! And it’s perfectly alright if recalling details is difficult. We’ll take things at your pace. To get a better understanding of your overall health for this physical, could you tell me if you’ve had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant… medical problems? Hmm. Let me think. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit foggy. I… I think I had a bad back once? Years ago. And maybe the flu a few times. Nothing… serious, I don’t believe. I try to stay healthy. Eat my vegetables, mostly. Though sometimes I forget if I did eat them.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of back pain and occasional flu. That's helpful. And that's good to hear you prioritize healthy eating. Do you recall if you've ever been hospitalized for anything, or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… surgeries… Oh dear. Now you’re really testing my memory. I… I think maybe I had my tonsils out when I was a child? A very long time ago. But honestly, I couldn’t swear to it. My wife… my ex-wife… she used to keep track of these things. But… well, that was a while ago.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Krahn. We’ll do our best to piece everything together. So, potentially tonsillectomy as a child. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. My ex-wife always said I didn't have a discerning palate. Sorry. Getting off-topic. No, no allergies that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I… I think I take something for my knees? Just a little something. An over-the-counter pain reliever. When they bother me. But I forget the name. And sometimes a multivitamin. But again, I can't recall if I took it today. Honestly, it’s all a bit… disorganized, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. We can often figure these things out. So, an over-the-counter pain reliever as needed for your knees, and occasionally a multivitamin. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, goodness. That’s a tough one. My parents… they lived long lives, I think. But what they died of… I honestly don’t recall. I wasn't very close to my siblings, if I even had any. My ex-wife… she always knew these things, but… It's all very hazy. I'm sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. These things can be difficult to recall. We can proceed without detailed family history for now. Now, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, if you wouldn’t mind. I have… appointments. Things to attend to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. If you could just sit up on the exam table for me, that would be great. Your blood pressure is 145 over 90. That’s a bit elevated. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackling in your lungs, particularly on the lower lobes. Your abdomen is soft, and your reflexes are normal. I’m also noting some slight swelling in your knees, which you mentioned earlier. Okay, Mr. Krahn, that concludes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found, your elevated blood pressure and crackling in your lungs are concerning. The swelling in your knees is also something we need to address.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Concerning, you say? What does that mean? Is it… serious? I knew I should have been taking better care of myself. My ex-wife always told me… What do we need to do, Doctor? Anything I can do?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking, Mr. Krahn. “Concerning” doesn’t necessarily mean “serious,” but it does mean we need to investigate further to understand what’s going on. The elevated blood pressure needs to be managed to prevent potential heart issues. The crackling in your lungs could indicate some fluid buildup, possibly from a mild infection or early heart failure. And the knee swelling suggests some arthritis or other joint issues. I’d like to order a few tests. First, a complete blood count to check for infection, a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and some basic kidney function tests. I’d also like to do an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… More tests. Alright, alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just… how long will it take? And will they be… painful? I don’t do well with needles, if you must know. And who will pay for all of this? I’m… not really insured, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn. The tests shouldn’t take too long – the blood work and EKG can be done here in the clinic, and the chest X-ray can be done at the imaging center across the street – it usually takes about an hour total. The blood draw does involve a needle, but I can assure you our phlebotomist is very skilled and gentle. We can also apply a numbing cream beforehand if that would make you more comfortable. As for the cost, I know you mentioned not being insured. Let me speak with our billing department to see what options are available. We may be able to offer a payment plan, or connect you with resources that can help with the cost. We don’t want financial concerns to prevent you from getting the care you need. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to contrast dye, as the X-ray could require it?
PATIENT: Contrast dye…? Oh dear. I honestly don’t know. I’ve never had an X-ray before, I don’t think. My ex-wife always handled all of these medical things. I… I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, but I couldn't swear to it. Maybe it's best to be safe? What would happen if I was allergic?
DOCTOR: It’s wise to be cautious, Mr. Krahn. If you were to have an allergic reaction to the contrast dye, it could range from mild symptoms like itching and hives to more severe reactions like difficulty breathing. However, severe reactions are rare, and we’re prepared to handle them if they occur. Given your uncertainty, let’s proceed with the blood work and EKG first. We can discuss the chest X-ray later, after we have the results from these tests. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood and set up the EKG. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a low-sodium diet. Reducing your salt intake can help lower your blood pressure. Do you have any difficulty preparing your own meals?
PATIENT: Low-sodium diet… Doctor, I mostly eat whatever’s easiest. Microwaved dinners, takeout… sometimes I forget to eat altogether. I’m not much of a cook, and I live alone now. So preparing meals… is a bit of a challenge. I rely on my son sometimes, but he's very busy with work. I appreciate the thought, though.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. We can work around that. There are many pre-prepared, low-sodium options available at the grocery store, or we can connect you with a nutritionist who can help you with meal planning and grocery shopping. In the meantime, let’s focus on getting these tests done. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. After that, we’ll do the EKG right here in the clinic. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan to address your blood pressure, lung issues, and knee pain. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that covers it. Honestly, Doctor, my head is spinning a bit. So many tests… so much to think about. Just… please, try to be quick. And gentle. I really do appreciate you taking the time. And thank you for being patient with me. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krahn. We’ll take everything at your pace, and I’ll be sure to explain everything clearly. And don’t worry about your memory – we’ll document everything thoroughly. The nurse, Emily, will be right with you. She's very skilled and will make sure you’re comfortable during the blood draw. I’ll leave you in her capable hands for now. Just relax, and we'll get through this together.
PATIENT: .
