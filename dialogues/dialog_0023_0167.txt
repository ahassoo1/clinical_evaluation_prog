DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… my foot. It’s been hurting, and there’s a sore that won’t get better. It’s on my… the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It’s very painful to walk.
DOCTOR: Alright, a foot sore causing you pain with walking. How long has this sore been bothering you, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been… maybe two, three months now? It started small, just a little red spot. I didn’t think much of it at first. But it’s gotten bigger, and now it really hurts. I try to stay off it, but… you know, I still need to get around.
DOCTOR: Two or three months. And has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: Well… I have the sugar sickness, the doctor told me. Maybe that has something to do with it? I try to eat right, but it’s hard sometimes. And… walking barefoot in the yard, maybe? I like to feel the grass. But I guess that's not good, eh?
DOCTOR: You have diabetes, correct. And walking barefoot. Yes, that could certainly be a contributing factor. Do you monitor your blood sugar levels regularly, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I have a little machine. I try to check it every morning, and sometimes before dinner. But… sometimes I forget. Old age, you know. It's not always easy to remember everything. Is that bad? Is that why my foot is hurting?
DOCTOR: It’s not uncommon for foot sores to develop with diabetes, especially if blood sugar isn't well controlled. Now, can you describe the sore to me?
PATIENT: Well… it’s red, of course. And it’s… kind of deep. Not too big, maybe the size of a quarter? It’s not… pus-y, if you know what I mean. Just… raw. And very, very sore when I put weight on it. It feels… warm, too. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Warm to the touch, red, raw… and about the size of a quarter. Have you noticed any drainage from the sore at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No drainage. It’s just… dry, and red. Sometimes it feels a little… numb, too. Not all the time, just sometimes. Is that… serious? I worry sometimes. I don’t want to lose my foot. My wife, she… she passed last year, and I do everything myself now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Stoegbauer. We're going to take a look at it, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. Just… be gentle, please. It really hurts.
DOCTOR: Of course. We will be as gentle as possible. Let’s take a look. Hmm. It is located on the plantar surface, near the metatarsal heads. There’s some erythema and induration. It is tender to palpation, and I do note a slight warmth. No obvious signs of osteomyelitis at this time, but we’ll need to rule that out. It appears to be an ulcer, likely diabetic in nature. We need to assess the depth and circulation. I'm going to perform a monofilament test to check the sensation in your foot.
PATIENT: A… a mono-what now? I don’t understand. Is that going to hurt? You said it’s diabetic? That’s… bad, isn’t it? I’m sorry, Doctor, I’m just getting worried now. My wife always took care of these things.
DOCTOR: The monofilament test is a simple way to check if you have feeling in your foot, Mr. Stoegbauer. It doesn't hurt, it just feels like a gentle pressure. Diabetes can sometimes cause nerve damage, which can lead to loss of sensation in the feet. That's why it's important to check. It can be serious if left untreated, which is why we're addressing it now. See?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. A little pressure. Okay. That doesn’t sound too bad. So… the sugar sickness is making my foot feel numb, and that’s why I didn’t notice the sore right away? And that’s why it got so big? Is there anything… anything we can do to fix it? I really don’t want to lose my foot, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. The neuropathy from the diabetes can decrease sensation, leading to delayed recognition of injuries like this ulcer. And yes, there are things we can do. We need to offload pressure from the ulcer, control your blood sugar, and prevent infection. I'm going to order some blood work to assess your overall health and glucose control. We'll also need to get an X-ray of your foot to rule out any bone infection. I'm going to prescribe a special diabetic shoe and insole to help offload the pressure. And I'm going to refer you to a podiatrist for specialized wound care. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… blood work, X-ray, special shoe… and see a foot doctor. That sounds… like a lot. But if it helps my foot, then yes, that’s good. A podi-what? Is that the foot doctor? Will they… will they have to cut it? Please don’t let them cut my foot, Doctor.
DOCTOR: A podiatrist is a doctor who specializes in foot care, yes. And no, Mr. Stoegbauer, they won't necessarily have to cut it. The goal is to heal the ulcer, not amputate. They will assess the wound and determine the best course of treatment, which may include debridement – removing any dead tissue – but that’s very different from amputation. We'll do everything we can to avoid that. We need to take this seriously, control your blood sugar, and follow the podiatrist’s recommendations. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Blood work, special shoe, see the foot doctor. And try to control the sugar. Okay. My wife, she used to remind me all the time. I miss her. Will the podiatrist… will they call me? And where do I go for the blood work? Is it here? I don’t drive anymore, you see. My son usually takes me.
DOCTOR: Yes, the podiatrist’s office will call you to schedule an appointment. I’ll have the receptionist give you a referral slip with their contact information. And yes, the blood work can be done right here in the lab, just down the hall. I’ll write you a lab order. As for transportation, let me see if my nurse, Maria, can assist you in arranging a ride with a local transportation service. I'm also going to give you a handout with information on diabetic foot care and wound prevention. It's important to keep the wound clean and dry, and to avoid putting pressure on it. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That… that would be very kind of Maria. Thank you. And the handout… yes, that would be good. I forget things so easily now. I think… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for your help. And for being so patient with an old man.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. We'll do everything we can to help you get back on your feet. Maria will be in shortly with the handout and information on transportation. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, controlling your blood sugar is key. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your progress. .
