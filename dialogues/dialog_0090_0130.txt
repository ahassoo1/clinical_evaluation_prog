DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s my family, you see. Lots of… trouble with hearts. My mother, my brother… gone too early. I just… want to make sure I’m okay. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I see. Family history is important, certainly. A lot of people come in with similar concerns. So, you’re primarily here for a check-up, due to concerns about your family’s heart history?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A check-up. To… to be sure. I feel okay, mostly. But you never know, do you? It’s better to be safe. I eat alright, I think. Not much fast food. I walk some too, when the weather is nice.
DOCTOR: “Alright” is… vague, Mr. Schwer. Could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Sorry. Uh… breakfast is usually toast and coffee. Sometimes an egg if I’m feeling hungry. Lunch is a sandwich, maybe. Ham and cheese. Or tuna. And dinner… my daughter brings me something most nights. Leftovers usually. Or sometimes soup. I drink water with my meals. And coffee, of course. Lots of coffee.
DOCTOR: And how many cups of coffee would you say you have in a day, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. That’s a good question. Um… at least four. Maybe five. Sometimes six if I’m… if I’m worried about something. I used to drink more, before my daughter started telling me to slow down. She worries too.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the coffee, any other habits I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Habits? Hmm… Well, I used to smoke. A long time ago. Quit maybe twenty years ago. And I don't drink much alcohol. Just a beer with dinner sometimes, if I'm watching a game. Nothing fancy. Oh, and I worry. A lot. My daughter says so.
DOCTOR: Okay. Twenty years is good. That’s very good. And the worrying… well, that’s not a medical condition, Mr. Schwer, but it’s good you're aware of it. Now, let's talk about any other health problems you’ve had in the past. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! My blood pressure was a little high a few years back. The doctor put me on a pill for it. I took it for a while, but he said it was okay to stop when it went down. And I had my gallbladder out, way back when I was younger. That was… unpleasant. Nothing else, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, like I said, my mother died of a heart attack. Pretty suddenly. My brother too, same thing. He was younger than me, maybe fifty. And my uncle, on my mother's side, he had something with his chest. I think it was… angina? They didn't tell me much. Lots of heart trouble, all around. My daughter is healthy, thank goodness. She worries about me taking after them, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any other significant medical history on either side of the family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had diabetes. Type 2, I think. He had to watch what he ate. And my aunt, my mother’s sister, she had arthritis. Bad arthritis in her hands. It made it hard for her to do things. She needed help with everything. That was… sad to see. Otherwise, I don’t really know much. My family doesn’t really talk about health things much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your family history, and the…vague descriptions of your diet, I think a basic physical exam is in order. We'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a quick look at your reflexes. It’s just a precaution, Mr. Schwer. It won’t take long. Then we can decide if further testing is needed. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. A check-up is good. Better to know, like you said. I’m ready when you are, Doctor. I hope everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back on the examination table, please. I'll start with your blood pressure. It's important to get a good baseline reading. Try to relax. One-forty over ninety. A little elevated. Not alarming, but something we need to keep an eye on. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Murmur. Very faint, but present. And a slightly irregular rhythm. I'm going to document these findings. Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Alright. Let's check your pulse. Seventy-eight. A bit fast, but not excessively so. Now, reflexes. Reflexes are normal. All right. Overall, some concerning findings. We need to run some tests. I’m going to order an EKG, a full lipid panel and a complete blood count. And I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. We may also need to consider an echocardiogram to get a better look at your heart. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… a lot. Tests… and an echo… is that serious, Doctor? Is something wrong? I feel alright, mostly. Just a little worried, I guess.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, I'm not going to alarm you. These tests are precautionary. Given your family history and the findings from this initial exam – the murmur, the irregular rhythm – it’s best to rule out any potential problems. An echocardiogram is simply an ultrasound of the heart. It's non-invasive. We need to see how well your heart is functioning. It doesn't necessarily mean there's anything wrong. But we need data. I understand you feel alright, but that doesn’t always tell the whole story. Ignoring potential issues isn’t going to help anyone. I’m going to prescribe you a low-dose aspirin. It can help thin your blood and reduce your risk of a heart attack or stroke. And I want you to start keeping a log of your symptoms – any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations. Bring that log with you to your follow-up appointment. Now, do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Aspirin… okay. And a log… of symptoms. Alright, I can do that. It’s just… a lot to take in. And the echo… is it expensive? My Medicare… does it cover that? I don’t want to surprise my daughter with a big bill. She’s already worried enough.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, I understand your concerns about the cost. Most Medicare plans do cover echocardiograms, but the coverage details can vary. I will have the office staff verify your specific coverage and provide you with an estimated cost breakdown before scheduling the test. They can also help you understand your out-of-pocket expenses. Don’t worry, we will make sure you’re aware of all the costs involved before proceeding. For now, focus on taking the aspirin as directed and keeping that symptom log. It's important to have accurate information when we review the test results next week. Do you have any other immediate concerns or questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just the aspirin and the log. And… the test. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… explaining things. Even if it’s a little scary.
DOCTOR: Alright. The office staff will contact you to schedule the tests and answer any further questions. Please follow up promptly. And, Mr. Schwer… try to manage your stress levels. It really does impact your heart health. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay. I will. Thank you again, Doctor.
