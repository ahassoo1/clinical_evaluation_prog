DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. To start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s rather obvious, isn’t it? I seem to be…losing my senses. The vision, it comes and goes. And the hearing…it’s not what it used to be. Honestly, I haven’t got all day to explain the painfully obvious.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Julie. It can be frustrating when changes like that happen. While it may seem obvious, getting a detailed understanding of when these changes happen and how they affect you is important to figure out the best course of action. Let's start with the vision. When did you first notice it coming and going?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… I really don't keep track of such things. It was… sometime this past spring, I suppose. Perhaps April? No, maybe May. Honestly, it feels like an eternity ago. It just…started happening. Blurriness, you know? And then it would clear. It's quite bothersome when I'm trying to enjoy my garden. It’s really quite inconvenient, if I may say so.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Sometime this past spring” is helpful. And it’s good you mentioned it happens when you're gardening – does it seem to be related to being outdoors, or is it just when you happen to be in the garden?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I am usually outdoors when I’m gardening. It's not as though I do it indoors! Honestly, are you attempting to be deliberately obtuse? It seems quite simple, really. Bright sunlight, perhaps? It’s always so glaring. I do try to wear a hat, but… well, one can only do so much, can’t one? It’s not like I have a staff to shield me from the sun!
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Julie. I apologize if my questions seem simple; I'm just trying to gather as much information as possible. Sunlight is definitely a good thing to consider. Does the blurriness happen only when you’re in bright sunlight, or do you notice it at other times, too?
PATIENT: Honestly, I can’t recall every single instance, Doctor. I’m not a machine. Sometimes it’s there, sometimes it’s not. It’s more frequent with the sun, yes. But it’s happened indoors, too. When I’m… reading, perhaps? Or looking at… fabrics. I do a lot of needlepoint, you see. It’s terribly frustrating when one can’t see the details. Really, I’m a busy woman. I don’t have time to catalogue every fleeting moment of blurred vision.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Julie. You're very busy, and it's perfectly reasonable that you wouldn't remember every single detail. So, it sounds like the blurriness is more common in bright light, but also happens sometimes when you're focusing on close-up work like needlepoint. Now, let’s talk about the hearing. When did you first notice a change in your hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, now we’re on to the ears. Honestly, it all feels like one long, blurry… everything. It’s been gradual, Doctor. Very gradual. People… mumble, you know? Or they don’t speak clearly. It’s probably them, honestly. I’ve always had excellent hearing. It’s likely they’ve simply deteriorated in their enunciation. But yes, I suppose… I’ve noticed it getting harder to follow conversations. Especially with… younger people. They mumble so dreadfully. Perhaps I should bring a stenographer to social events. Honestly! It was probably around the same time as the vision, I think. Spring, again. Everything happened at once. It’s terribly inconvenient. Really, terribly.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, both the vision and hearing changes started around springtime. And you've noticed difficulty following conversations, especially with younger people. That's helpful to know. Just to clarify, would you say the difficulty with hearing is a constant issue, or does it come and go like the vision?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, really. Must we dissect every minute detail? It's… intermittent, I suppose. Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse. It’s quite random, honestly. It depends on the… noise level, I think. And the person speaking, naturally. Some people just don’t articulate properly. It's not my ears that are the problem. But yes, it comes and goes. Like everything else. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite fatigued from explaining these… obvious things. Can we move on? I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Julie. I apologize if I’m asking seemingly obvious questions; I just want to make sure I have a complete picture. Let’s quickly review some medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're getting to the personal questions? Really, Doctor. I've lived a very full life, and I assure you, I’ve seen the finest doctors money can buy. I’m quite healthy, for my age, thank you very much. I don't require a recitation of potential ailments. I do try to eat a balanced diet, and I get plenty of fresh air. No, I haven’t been “diagnosed” with anything. I simply… experience the natural effects of aging, like anyone else. Is that satisfactory? Honestly, I don't see what this has to do with my vision and hearing. Can we please focus on the actual problem? I have a perfectly good life and don't want it disrupted by unnecessary questioning. It's terribly inconvenient, you see. Really.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Julie. I understand your frustration. Knowing your medical history simply helps me to understand the full picture and rule out potential causes for your vision and hearing changes. Alright, then. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, Doctor. I’ve had a life, you know? A full life. I’ve had… procedures. Minor things. Nothing relevant, I assure you. A little cosmetic work here and there, a removal of… a growth. Things one does to maintain appearances. Really, I don’t see how listing every minor procedure I’ve undergone is going to help you determine why my vision is blurry and my hearing is fading. It’s terribly inconvenient to dredge up such things, you see? I assure you, I'm perfectly healthy otherwise. Can we please move on? My luncheon appointment is fast approaching. Honestly! It's quite rude to keep a lady waiting.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Julie. I apologize for taking up your time. Let’s talk about your family history then. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as vision or hearing loss, heart disease, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to interrogate my ancestors? Honestly, Doctor! My family… they were a perfectly normal family. People lived and died, as they do. There was a great-aunt who was a bit…eccentric. And a grandfather who had a touch of…gout. But nothing relevant, I assure you! Nothing that would explain this. Really, I haven’t the faintest idea what ran in my family's medical history. I was busy living my life, not cataloging ailments! It’s terribly inconvenient to expect me to recall such details. Honestly! Can we please move on? I’m starting to feel quite faint. It's probably the stress of this… interrogation. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Julie. I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t have that information. Let's move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
