DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s about… a team. A sports team. I need… a check-up for it, I think. To try out. It's important, you see. Though, honestly, I don't remember exactly which team. Something with a ball, I believe.
DOCTOR: A team, alright. And you're looking for a check-up to try out… hmm. Important, yes, I understand. So, you’re wanting to make sure you’re physically able to participate. Let's start with this… you said something with a ball?
PATIENT: Yes, a ball. Definitely a ball. Maybe… baseball? Or… football? It’s a throwing sport, I think. It’s… young men, mostly. Not too young, mind you. I used to… well, I think I used to play. My… ex-wife, she always said I was good at throwing. Though she said a lot of things. It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. Is this important? Knowing the kind of ball?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful, yes, but don't worry too much about the specifics right now. Different sports put different demands on the body. Just trying to get a picture here. So, you're thinking about joining a team… and want to ensure you’re fit enough. Have you been doing any sort of training or exercise recently, to prepare?
PATIENT: Training? Doctor, at my age? Not… officially, no. I do some things around the house, lifting… things. You know. Bags of cement. Helping a neighbor with his fence. Is that training? It’s… strenuous, sometimes. Mostly I sit, though. Watching the games. It’s good for morale, I think. Keeps me in the spirit of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, some light physical activity around the house. That’s good. We’ll want to get a better baseline, though. Now, have you been experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Well, my knees. They… complain. Mostly when it rains, or when I stand for too long. And my back. Sometimes I wake up feeling… stiff. It's nothing a little stretching doesn't fix. Old age, I guess. You get aches and pains. It's… normal, isn't it? Is that what you’re asking about? Serious pain? No. Just… discomfort.
DOCTOR: Discomfort is good to know. Let’s take a look at those knees and back. If you don't mind, could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Be careful now, Doctor. These old bones aren’t what they used to be. Though I still move pretty good, for my age. Mostly. Just… don't expect any miracles. Is this the part where you poke and prod? My ex-wife used to say I flinched too much. She was a very observant woman.
DOCTOR: Just a little assessment, Mr. Bartok. We're checking for range of motion and any points of tenderness. Okay, a little discomfort on the inside of the right knee. And how about back?
PATIENT: Ooh, there it is. That's… that's where it usually bothers me. Right about… there. Not sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like a weight pressing down. I don’t usually complain, you know. A man’s gotta be tough. But it’s been a little worse lately. The humidity, maybe? It plays havoc with the joints, my neighbor says. Is this going to take long, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, just a little further if you can. We're seeing how much flexibility you have. Okay, that’s good. A little limited range of motion, but not severely so. And I see some mild tenderness along the spine. Now, standing up straight, can you rotate your torso left and right?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… not as easy as it used to be. There we go. Getting old is no picnic, Doctor, let me tell you. Ooh, that’s… that’s a bit uncomfortable. Feels… tight. Like something's stuck. I don’t think I’ve pulled anything, but it’s definitely… not smooth. My ex-wife would've said I needed more stretching. She was always on my back about… everything. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. We've got some mild limitations in range of motion and some tenderness in the lower back, and some discomfort in the right knee. It sounds like some muscle strain and potentially some mild arthritis is what's going on. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
