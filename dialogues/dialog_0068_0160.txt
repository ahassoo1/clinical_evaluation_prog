DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's this tiredness. It's just…getting worse. And it's embarrassing to even say what else is going on, but here we are. It’s not like I have anything better to do with my time, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, okay. And you said something else was going on… could you elaborate on that for me, please?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. I… I've been eating dirt. Not like, wanting to, you understand? It just… feels good sometimes. Clay, mostly. From the garden. Don't look at me like that! It's not a habit, it just… happens when I'm really tired. And I know it's strange. Don't bother asking why, because I haven’t the faintest idea.
DOCTOR: Eating clay… I see. And this happens when you're feeling particularly fatigued?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. It’s like… a craving. A silly craving, I know. And it’s not like I’m shoveling it in, it’s just… little bits. A spoonful here and there. It’s ridiculous, really. People will think I’ve lost my mind. Are you going to tell someone?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Hardenburgh, I won’t tell anyone. This is a safe space, and I need to understand what’s going on to help you. It's… unusual, certainly, but it's important information. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… let me think. Everything feels… slow. Like wading through mud. And I used to have such a good appetite, but now… nothing really tastes good. Except maybe the dirt. Don't judge me. And my stomach... it's been a bit upset lately, but who doesn't have an upset stomach? It probably just needs a good cleaning. Though I haven't been eating much to clean. It’s a vicious cycle, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Slow feeling, decreased appetite, and some stomach upset… Okay. And how long have you been experiencing these symptoms – the tiredness, the clay eating, the appetite loss, the stomach issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let's see… the tiredness has been creeping up for months now, I’d say at least six. The… the other thing started maybe two months ago. And the appetite… oh, probably a month or so. It all just sort of blended together, to be honest. It’s not like I keep a diary or anything. I have a life to live, you know. A simple one, but a life nonetheless.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to ask a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Well, my clothes are a bit looser, now that you mention it. I haven't stepped on a scale in ages, I threw it out after my hip started acting up. Too depressing to look at numbers, if you ask me. Probably just a few pounds, nothing drastic. I’m not wasting away, if that’s what you’re thinking. Still, it's probably a sign of something awful, isn't it? Everything always is.
DOCTOR: It could be, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything awful. Let's try to get a clearer picture. Do you have any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? No. Not really. Food goes down just fine. Though, like I said, I haven’t been eating much to swallow. It’s all rather pointless when nothing tastes good. And I’m not a glutton, never have been. I prefer a simple life, remember? Small portions, quiet evenings. That sort of thing. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? I have a dentist appointment next week, I don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Alright. One last question for now. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Ugh. Must you ask about everything? Honestly. Well… they’ve been a bit… off. Darker than usual, I suppose. And not as frequent. Though I’m not one to obsess over such things. I haven’t been feeling well, it’s hardly surprising my system is a bit out of whack. Is this all relevant, Doctor? Because frankly, it’s rather unpleasant rehashing all of this. It’s making me feel even worse just talking about it.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Ms. Hardenburgh. I apologize if these questions are unpleasant, but it's important to gather as much information as possible. Now, would you mind if I did a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don't expect miracles. I'm not a complicated case, you know. Just an old woman who's tired and has a silly craving. It’s probably just old age catching up with me. Though, I seem to remember my grandmother living to be ninety-two, so… honestly, I don’t know what to think anymore. Hurry it up, will you?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. I'm going to check your abdomen now. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. No masses noted. And finally, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits for your age.
PATIENT: Well? What does it all mean? Is it something awful? I knew it. I just knew it. Don't tell me I need surgery. I can’t stand the thought of hospitals. They’re full of germs and sad people. Just tell me what's wrong and let me get this over with. I have a casserole to make for the church potluck, and I'm already behind schedule.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, there are a few things we need to investigate. The tiredness, appetite loss, and changes in bowel movements are concerning. The clay eating… that’s unusual, and can sometimes be associated with nutrient deficiencies, particularly iron. The mild tenderness in your abdomen warrants further investigation. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, but I want to rule out a few possibilities. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, iron studies, and a metabolic panel. I also want to get a stool sample to check for any infections or abnormalities.
PATIENT: Blood work? Stool sample? Honestly, it’s all so… invasive. Is it absolutely necessary? I'm not a fan of needles, and the thought of… that… well, let’s just say it’s not appealing. Can’t you just give me something for the tiredness? A vitamin, perhaps? I’ve heard B12 is good for energy. I don't want a lot of fuss, Doctor. I just want to feel like myself again. Is this going to be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know. This is all very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Hardenburgh. It's not pleasant to think about, I agree. However, these tests are important to get a clear picture of what’s going on. We need to rule out some potentially serious causes for your symptoms. As for the cost, I'm aware you don't have insurance. Let me see if we can work with the lab to get you a reduced rate, or see if there are any local resources that can help with the cost. We can discuss options. As for a simple vitamin, while B12 can be helpful, it won’t address the underlying cause of your symptoms. It’s important to find out why you're feeling tired, and why you have these other symptoms. Would you be willing to at least consider the blood work?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood work. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And if it comes back normal, I’m blaming you for wasting my time. And I still don’t want to talk about the… specimen. Can’t we just skip that part? Honestly, it's ridiculous. I've lived a long life, and I've never had to go through all this fuss. Just get it over with, Doctor. And make it quick. I have a casserole to make.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll start with the blood work. I’ll give you the requisition form and instructions for the lab. They’re located just down the street, at 12 Maple Avenue. As for the stool sample, let's hold off on that for now. We’ll see what the blood work shows first. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for next week, once the results are back. We can discuss them then. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool – please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s enough questions for one day. Just… get me out of here. I need a nap. And maybe a strong cup of tea. And I’m still not happy about this whole thing. This is all very inconvenient, you know. Tell them at the lab to be quick. I don’t have all day. And don't bother calling me with good news. I expect bad news. Old age… it’s a curse, I tell you. A curse. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. I understand. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I’ll see you next week. Have a good day.
