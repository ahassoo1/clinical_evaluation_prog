DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, it’s my legs. They just…gave out. Not completely, but they feel terribly weak. It started a few days after I had a really nasty cold. Just…gone, almost. It's rather inconvenient, you know? I do a lot of walking for my job.
DOCTOR: Weakness, you say. And it started shortly after a cold… alright. Can you describe what you mean by “gave out”?
PATIENT: It's not like I collapsed or anything dramatic. More like…when I stand up, it takes a lot more effort than usual. And my knees feel wobbly. Like jelly, almost. And walking…well, I have to concentrate so hard not to stumble. It’s embarrassing, frankly. I used to be able to walk for miles without a second thought. Now? I feel like an old woman. I’m not even sure how I’d handle a tour group like this.
DOCTOR: I see. So, increased effort to stand, wobbliness, and difficulty with prolonged walking. And this is a change from your normal activity level. When you say a "nasty cold," did you have fever, cough, congestion…any other symptoms you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely a fever. A proper one, kept me in bed for two days. Awful cough, too – hacking and wheezing. Stuffed nose, sore throat…the whole nine yards, really. It was a thorough cold. Thankfully, the fever broke after a couple days and the cough is mostly gone now, but these legs…they just won't cooperate. I took some over-the-counter cold medicine, you know, the usual stuff. Helped a bit with the other symptoms, but nothing touched this weakness.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when did you notice the weakness specifically after the cold started to improve?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. The fever broke on Monday, I believe. And I started noticing the weakness on Wednesday. So, about two days after I started feeling…less sick, generally. Though I was still a bit tired, mind you. Not back to normal yet. But definitely after the worst of the cold was over. It wasn't like I woke up one morning and poof – weak legs. It was more gradual, creeping up on me. It's just…so annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. And just to clarify, you’ve had no injuries to your legs recently?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I'm very careful, you know? I need my legs for my job! No falls, no twists, no bumps…nothing. I haven’t done anything to cause this. It just…happened. It’s a bit frustrating, honestly. I'm usually quite robust. This is very unlike me. I take good care of myself, too. A good diet, plenty of water…this isn’t like me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… well, now that you mention it, my hands have been a bit tingly lately. Not constantly, but on and off. It’s hard to describe. Just a sort of…pins and needles feeling. And I've felt…a little more tired than usual, even without the cold. But honestly, that could just be stress, you know? Running a business, dealing with tourists…it's exhausting work. I’m not sure if it's related. It's just…a lot all at once.
DOCTOR: Tingling in your hands, and increased fatigue… alright. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let's see. No, nothing like that. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but it came down with diet and exercise. Perfectly normal now, the doctor said. Other than that…no, I’ve always been quite healthy, to be frank. I don’t take any regular medications, either. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, you know. I pride myself on being in good shape. It’s just…this weakness is so baffling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been very fortunate in that regard. I’ve always avoided them, if possible. I don’t like the idea of being under the knife. I’m not a fan of hospitals, to be honest. I prefer to take care of myself naturally, when I can. No surgeries, no major illnesses…that's why this is so strange. It just doesn’t make any sense. It’s a waste of time, really, me being here with this silly weakness. I have tours to plan, you know? People are relying on me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your frustration, and I appreciate you sharing your concerns. While it may seem "silly," any new symptom warrants investigation. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. Right. Well, my mother had arthritis, quite badly, towards the end of her life. And my father…he had heart trouble. He had a stroke, actually, about ten years ago. And my brother has high blood pressure. It runs in the family, I suppose. Not that I expected to get it, mind you. I always thought I was…different. Healthier. It's just…well, you know. You never know what you're going to get. It's rather unsettling, isn't it? Having to worry about these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask a few more personal questions, if you don’t mind. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. I would never. I don't touch a drop of alcohol, and I certainly don't smoke. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I'm a professional, you know? I have a reputation to uphold. I take very good care of myself. I eat a healthy diet, I get plenty of exercise, and I avoid anything that could jeopardize my health. I don’t understand why you'd even ask, frankly. It’s a bit insulting, isn't it? I've worked very hard to maintain my health and wellbeing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. I understand. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs, as well as listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I suppose so. But please don't keep me too long. I really do have things to do. And I hope you'll be gentle. I don't want to make this worse. I'm just…concerned, you know? All this poking and prodding. I still think it's probably just a lingering effect of the cold, but alright. Do what you need to do. Just…be quick about it, if you would.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit on the examination table, please. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in…and out…again…Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes in your legs. Alright…reflexes are present, but a little diminished. Now, I'm going to test your strength. Can you please push down on my hand with your legs, one at a time?
PATIENT: Alright. Honestly, I don't see what good this is doing. But very well. Here. Is that enough? It's…a little difficult, you know? This leg feels so weak. And… …that actually feels a bit more difficult than it should. Now the other one. There. Is that satisfactory? I really do have to get back to work. This is taking up a lot of time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your strength is slightly diminished in both legs, as you noted. Now, I’m going to check sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I lightly touch your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can feel it. Though it's…not quite as sharp as it usually is. It’s a bit…muffled, I suppose. Like wearing gloves, but thinner. It’s hard to explain. It’s not numb, exactly, but it’s…less. You’re touching it, aren't you? Yes, there. And…there. It's just…subtle. Honestly, I'm not sure you'd even notice it if you weren't looking for it. It's just…a slight reduction in feeling. I don't understand why this is happening. It's very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, it appears you have some weakness and diminished sensation in your legs, along with slightly diminished reflexes. Your history of a recent viral illness, the tingling in your hands, and your family history are also relevant. It’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing this without further investigation. It could be a post-viral neuropathy – damage to the nerves caused by the cold – but other possibilities need to be ruled out.
PATIENT: Neu-what-now? Damage to the nerves? Honestly, that sounds…frightening. I just had a cold! A nasty one, yes, but just a cold. I don’t understand why this would be so…serious. Are you telling me this could be permanent? I need my legs for my job! I can't afford to be laid up in bed, or worse. And what “other possibilities” are you talking about? Don’t tell me it’s something dreadful. I have responsibilities, you know. People are relying on me. This is…unacceptable. What do you suggest?
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, please try not to worry. While it’s important to take this seriously, it doesn’t necessarily mean something dreadful. Post-viral neuropathies can often resolve on their own, but it’s best to get a clear diagnosis to rule out other causes and ensure appropriate management. To do that, I recommend a few tests. First, a blood test to check your vitamin levels – particularly B12 – and rule out any underlying deficiencies. Second, a nerve conduction study, which measures the electrical activity in your nerves to assess the extent of any damage. And finally, an MRI of your lower back to rule out any spinal cord compression or other structural issues. Would you be willing to undergo these tests?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests. Of course. That’s just what I needed. More time wasted, more money spent. Honestly, this is ridiculous. A vitamin deficiency? Spinal cord compression? Are you seriously suggesting I have something wrong with my spine? I’ve never had any back pain! I feel perfectly fine, except for these wretched legs. But alright. If it will put my mind at ease, I suppose I can do the blood test. But I’m not so sure about this…nerve conduction study and MRI. They sound…invasive. And what if they find something dreadful? I don't want to know. But alright. Do what you must. Just…please be quick about it. I have tours to plan, you know. This is truly inconvenient. Can I at least get a referral to a good lab and imaging center? And how long will all this take?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do my best to expedite the process. I'm going to write you a referral to a reputable lab for the blood tests – it will measure your B12, vitamin D, and other relevant levels. And I'll also write a referral for an MRI of your lower back. It’s non-invasive, meaning it doesn’t involve any needles or incisions; you’ll simply lie inside a large machine while images are taken. The nerve conduction study does involve some small electrical stimulation, but it’s generally well-tolerated and shouldn’t be painful. I'll also provide you with a list of imaging centers and nerve conduction study facilities in the area. The results typically take a few days to come back, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once I have them. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that aggravates your leg weakness. And if you experience any new symptoms, such as severe pain, numbness, or bowel/bladder dysfunction, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions about the referrals or the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Alright. Very well. I suppose that’s…something. Bowel/bladder dysfunction? Honestly, now you’re just frightening me. I feel perfectly fine, apart from the wretched legs. But alright. I'll schedule the tests. Though I'm not sure when I'll have time. And what if they can't find anything wrong? Will I be stuck going around in circles forever, with these legs getting weaker and weaker? This is…unacceptable. Honestly, I don’t understand why this is happening to me. I take good care of myself, you know. A good diet, plenty of water…everything the doctor tells me. But alright. I’ll schedule the tests. And please…try not to find anything dreadful. It's just…a cold, after all. No? What do I do with this then?
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, the purpose of these tests is to determine the cause of your weakness, not necessarily to find something “dreadful.” While it’s important to consider all possibilities, it’s just as likely that we’ll find a simple explanation – a vitamin deficiency, a mild nerve irritation, or even lingering inflammation from the cold. The printout contains contact information for the lab and imaging center. You can call them directly to schedule appointments at your convenience. They’ll likely need a referral from me, which I’ve already provided. Once you’ve scheduled the tests, please let my office know so we can follow up on the results. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, or develop any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We're here to help. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s enough for now. Honestly, this has been…a waste of time. But alright. I'll schedule the tests. And I expect good results. A simple explanation. No dreadful findings. Is that understood? Thank you, Doctor. I’m going to go now. I have tours to plan, you know. People are relying on me. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye, Ms. Firestone. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns.
