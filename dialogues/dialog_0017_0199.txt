DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Chayer. I am Dr. Blim. So, let's get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It's… it's my breathing. It's been, well, harder lately. I get really short of breath, even when I'm not doing much. Honestly, it’s a little scary. I don’t really… remember exactly when it started, just that it’s been getting worse.
DOCTOR: "Getting worse," you say. Vague descriptions are… unhelpful, Mr. Chayer. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Right, sorry. It’s just… things are a bit fuzzy. Okay, um… maybe a month ago? No, wait… two months? I was working, at the plant, and I just felt… winded. Like I’d run a marathon, but I hadn’t. Then it started happening when I was just walking around the house, even. It’s definitely more frequent now. Does that make more sense? I wish I could be more precise. My wife keeps telling me I need to pay attention to these things.
DOCTOR: A month or two… still not ideal, but marginally better. And you work at a plant?
PATIENT: Yeah, a water and wastewater treatment plant. It’s… physical work, sometimes. Lots of walking, checking equipment, that sort of thing. It wasn’t a problem before. I mean, I’m in okay shape, I think. Not a runner or anything, but I’m used to being on my feet. It’s just… this is different. It feels like I can’t get enough air, you know? Even resting doesn’t always help.
DOCTOR: “Physical work… possible occupational exposure.” Are you exposed to any dust, fumes, or chemicals at this plant, Mr. Chayer?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely. It’s… a plant. There’s chlorine, sometimes. And… other stuff. I don’t really know the names, honestly. We wear masks sometimes, when we’re dealing with certain things, but not all the time. It’s pretty standard, I think? My coworkers and I… we’ve just always done it that way. I don't know if that's good or bad, though. I really don’t.
DOCTOR: “Standard” is rarely a substitute for proper safety protocols, Mr. Chayer. Alright. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t smoke, and my wife… she wouldn’t allow it, even if I wanted to. She’s very health-conscious. We both are, generally. That's why I'm worried about this breathing thing. It just doesn't fit with the rest of it.
DOCTOR: Any family history of lung problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My… my grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had… something with his lungs. I think. He coughed a lot, especially when he got older. But I don't really know what it was. It was a long time ago. My mom… she doesn’t remember the details either, sadly. I don’t think anyone else had anything serious. But like I said, my memory isn’t the greatest.
DOCTOR: “Something with his lungs” is hardly a useful medical history, Mr. Chayer. Very well. Now, are you experiencing any chest pain, wheezing, or coughing?
PATIENT: No chest pain, thankfully. But… yeah, I do cough sometimes. Not a constant thing, but it’s been happening more lately. It's usually a dry cough, and it doesn’t bring anything up. And… I think I wheeze a little when I try to breathe deeply. Or, my wife says I do, anyway. I don’t always notice it myself. It’s kind of… subtle. Is that… bad? I’m probably just making things worse by not being able to describe it properly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's proceed with a physical examination, Mr. Chayer. Please remove your shirt, and I will listen to your lungs. I need a clear assessment before we speculate further.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if you need anything. It’s… a little warm in here. I hope I'm not making this more difficult than it needs to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Chayer. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… Good. I detect some mild wheezing bilaterally, primarily in the lower lobes. Decreased breath sounds are also present. Your respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 20 breaths per minute. Heart sounds are regular. No edema present in extremities. We’ll need to run some tests to determine the cause of this, but preliminary findings suggest possible airway obstruction. I’m ordering a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, um… allergies. I don’t think so. Nothing I know of, anyway. My wife usually handles the medical stuff, so I'd have to defer to her. She's the one who keeps track of all that. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. But she'd be the one to ask, really. Are those tests… expensive? I don't have insurance, so… I'm worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: That is… unfortunate. The X-ray will be approximately $150, and the pulmonary function test is around $200. These are standard rates. We can discuss payment options with the billing department after the tests. For now, let's focus on obtaining a diagnosis. I’m also going to order a complete blood count to rule out infection. Do you currently take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… vitamins, sometimes. Nothing regular. A multivitamin, occasionally. And when I have a headache, I take ibuprofen. That's it. My wife is really big on natural remedies, so we try to avoid medication whenever possible. She makes teas and stuff. I think it’s mostly placebo, but it makes her happy, so… I just want to know what's going on with my breathing. I’m starting to get worried about going back to work.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll write the orders for the X-ray, pulmonary function test, and CBC. The radiology technician is down the hall, and the pulmonary function test can be completed in the lab adjacent to my office. After you've had these tests completed, please return to me with the results. Until then, I advise you to limit strenuous activity and avoid any potential irritants, such as dust or fumes. We will proceed from there. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, even if I wasn't very helpful with the details. Hopefully, we can figure out what’s going on. Where do I go to get these tests done?
DOCTOR: Radiology is the first door on the left. The lab is immediately adjacent. The technicians will explain the procedures. I expect the results within 24 hours. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with my office as soon as they become available. I have other patients waiting, Mr. Chayer. Do not delay. .
PATIENT: .
