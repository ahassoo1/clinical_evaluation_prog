DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Schneer, is it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's right. Betty, actually. Though folks sometimes get it mixed up. Don't mind me, happens all the time. Been Betty my whole life, really.
DOCTOR: Details, details. Alright, Betty. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, now… it's my ears, I think. Things just ain't as clear as they used to be. Hard to hear what people are sayin', especially the young ones. They mumble, ya know? Though, maybe that's just me gettin' old. It’s been gradual, I suppose. Not a sudden thing.
DOCTOR: Gradual, you say. And how long has it been… gradual?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. Seems like… a good few years, I reckon. Maybe five? Ten? Time just slips away, doesn’t it? I used to be able to hear a pin drop, my mother always said. Now… well, now I have to ask folks to repeat themselves a lot. Especially on the phone. That’s the worst.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Hmm… sometimes. A sort of… shhh sound. Not all the time, though. Mostly when it’s quiet, I think. Or when I’m tired. It doesn’t bother me too much, just… there. Is that bad? I don't really pay it much mind, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It can be. Have you been exposed to any loud noises recently, or in the past?
PATIENT: Loud noises… oh, my. Well, I worked in a shoe factory for… goodness, almost fifty years. All them machines clatterin’ and bangin’ all day long. That was noisy, alright. Though, it was just… part of life, ya know? You got used to it. Can't rightly say I wore earplugs or anything fancy like that back then. Just… dealt with it.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… certainly something. Any family history of hearing loss?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… I think she had trouble hearin' towards the end, but she was a bit like me, always forgettin' things. Coulda been the hearin', coulda been somethin' else. My father... I don't really remember him bein' too bothered by it, though he was gone when I was young. It wasn't somethin' we talked about much, family things, ya know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a quick look in your ears. Just need to take a peek, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds… sensible. Never had much trouble with my ears before, aside from the hearin' gettin' a bit fuzzy. Hope it’s not nothin’ too serious. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There's some wax buildup, which is common. Nothing alarming. I'm going to perform a quick hearing test, just to get a baseline. It won’t take long. It's a simple tone test, you just indicate when you hear something. Sound good?
PATIENT: Oh, a test? Alright, that sounds… manageable. I’m not very good with gadgets, but I can listen for tones, I reckon. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll give it my best shot. What happens when I do hear somethin'? Press a button, or…?
DOCTOR: Yes, press the button when you hear the tone. Simple. We'll do each ear separately. Just focus, and let me know when you hear anything at all, even a faint beep. Don't worry if you don’t hear everything; it just gives us a better idea of what's going on. Okay?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Button when I hear a beep. Seems straightforward enough. You just let me know when to start, Doctor. I’ll try my best not to mess it up. I'm a bit slow these days, mind you, but I’ll pay attention.
DOCTOR: Right. We’ll start with your right ear. I'm going to put these headphones on. Just relax. Now, I’m going to play a series of tones. Press the button every time you hear something. Don’t hesitate. Ready?
PATIENT: Okay, headphones on. Ready as I’ll ever be. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll listen real careful. Don't mind me if I flinch a bit, sometimes these things are a bit loud, ya know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. As expected. Significant hearing loss in both ears, particularly in the higher frequencies. The wax buildup isn't helping, but that's only a minor factor. It’s likely age-related hearing loss, but given your history of working in a noisy environment, that certainly contributed. We can discuss options. A hearing aid would likely improve your quality of life considerably. And we can clean out the wax, of course. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Hearing aid, ya say? That sounds… serious. I always thought those were for folks who were really deaf. I manage alright, mostly. Just have to ask folks to speak up. I don't know... cleaning the wax sounds sensible, but a hearing aid? Seems a bit… much. What would it involve? Is it painful? Expensive? I’m on Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: It's not "serious", it's common. And it doesn't mean you're "really deaf". It simply amplifies sounds so you can hear them more clearly. Medicare does cover a portion of the cost, but there's often a copay. As for pain, no, it's not painful. A specialist audiologist would assess your hearing further and fit you with an appropriate device. It involves a mold of your ear and some adjustments. It's a process. We can start with the wax removal, and then you can consider a referral. Does that sound… reasonable?
PATIENT: Wax removal sounds good, yes. Sensible. Let’s start with that, then. No rush on the… other thing. I need to think about it, I suppose. Talk to a few folks. I don't want to go changin' things if I don't have to, ya know? Can we do the wax removal today, then?
DOCTOR: Alright. We can do that. It's a quick procedure. Just lie back, and I’ll use a small irrigation system to gently remove the wax. It might be a bit uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. After that, we'll see if that improves your hearing at all. And I'll give you a referral to a local audiologist, just in case you decide to explore hearing aids further. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect. Lie back and get on with it, then. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to be able to hear my stories again, ya know? My granddaughter keeps complainin’ I ask her to repeat everything. That's a bit embarrassing. Let’s get this over with, then.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax, and let me know if you feel any discomfort. This might take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, that's a bit… cool. Not painful, just… unexpected. Feels like water in my ear, which I suppose it is. Alright, carry on.
DOCTOR: Alright, that should do it. Let's see… There, that’s a significant improvement. Still some wax remaining, but a noticeable difference. Let's test your hearing again, quickly. Hmm. Slightly improved, as expected. Not a miracle, but certainly better. Here's the referral to the audiologist. Give them a call, and they can assess your hearing properly and discuss your options. Any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, well, that was… not too bad, all things considered. Slightly better is good enough for now, I suppose. I’ll give them a ring, maybe. Thank you, Doctor. You were very… thorough. I suppose that's all for now. No, I don't think I have any other questions. Just need to get home and have a nice cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take care, Betty. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Stop.
