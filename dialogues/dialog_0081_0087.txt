DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. The usual. Honestly, I don't really keep track of these things anymore. Medicare sent something, and well, here I am. Quick as you can, if you please.
DOCTOR: “The usual” can be quite vague, Mr. Croonquist. It’s important to understand why Medicare is requesting these tests. Do you have any idea what they might be looking for?
PATIENT: Looking for…? Gosh. Not a clue, Doctor. Something about… numbers? I used to work at the power plant, you know. Lots of dials and gauges… maybe it's like that? I just want to get it done and be on my way, if that’s alright. It’s a long drive back home.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's pull up your electronic health record and see what's been ordered and why. It appears you had a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel and a Lipid Panel ordered. The CMP checks things like your kidney function, liver function, and electrolytes. The Lipid Panel checks your cholesterol levels. These are fairly standard tests for someone your age, particularly with a history like yours—power plant work often requires regular health monitoring. Do you have any known conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart trouble, anything like that?
PATIENT: Power plant… right. That was a while ago. Conditions… hmm. Doc, honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. I think… the doctor before this one mentioned something about my… what was it… levels being a bit off, maybe? But I can’t rightly recall what that meant. I don’t think it was serious. Nothing I ever had to do about. Just… numbers again.
DOCTOR: “Numbers” are quite important, Mr. Croonquist. We need to understand which numbers, and what they signify. It’s frustrating when patients don't take a more active role in their own healthcare. Let’s start with a basic review of systems. Have you experienced any unusual fatigue lately?
PATIENT: Fatigue… Well, I'm 73, Doc. Everything is a bit fatiguing these days! But… no more than usual, I suppose. I get tired after doing things. Gardening mostly. And… walking the dog. Yes, walking the dog tires me out sometimes. Is that what you mean? Not like… sick tired. Just… old tired.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Appetite… I eat. When I’m hungry. Not a big eater, never have been. Weight… probably lost a little? Hard to say. The scales are old. I haven’t been keeping track of it, Doc. I really just want to get these tests done. It’s a whole day thing with the drive and all.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with the physical exam, then. It will be brief, but necessary to assess your overall condition before interpreting the lab results. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and briefly examine your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Examination… alright. Just… try to be quick, Doctor. This table isn’t the most… forgiving.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds… regular rate and rhythm, but a slight murmur present. Not particularly concerning given your age, but we’ll note it. Lungs are clear bilaterally, good air entry. Blood pressure is 148/92. A little elevated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Alright. Blood pressure is slightly high, and there’s a murmur, but otherwise, the exam is relatively unremarkable. Now, we’ll send off those lab samples and see what the results reveal. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. Not that I know of. The doctor before this one gave me something for my knees a few years back, and that was alright. But… honestly, Doc, it’s been so long I can’t rightly remember. I don't take much in the way of medicine. Can we just get this done?
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. We'll proceed cautiously with any future medications, then. Let’s draw those blood samples now. The phlebotomist will be in shortly. Once the results are back – typically within a few days – we'll discuss them and determine if any further action is needed. And Mr. Croonquist, I strongly recommend keeping a more detailed record of your medical history and medications moving forward. It will significantly aid in your care.
PATIENT: Right, right. Details. Just… let me know when it's all done, Doc. I’m ready when you are. This table really isn’t comfortable. .
