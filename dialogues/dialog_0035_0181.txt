DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Alzoubi. The pleasure is all mine. I requested a general wellness check, if you will. Just wanting to see how things are holding up, you know? At my age, it’s always best to be certain. I believe the paperwork I filled out details everything, but I'm happy to discuss it further.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that here. A good idea to stay on top of things. And the paperwork does give me a good start. Just to be thorough, let’s go over a few things. You mentioned wanting a general wellness check – are there any specific concerns you have, or anything new that's been bothering you lately?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing specific, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Nothing that keeps me from working, thankfully. I still enjoy my construction work, keeps me moving. I’ve been quite fortunate, really, to remain healthy for as long as I have. It’s more about preventative measures at this point, I think. Making sure everything continues to be alright.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear. Staying active is half the battle! Alright, let's do a quick review of your medical history, just to make sure I have everything accurate. The form says you have no major medical problems, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. No major problems, no. A bit of high blood pressure, managed with medication, as you'll see. And some arthritis in my knees, but again, nothing that prevents me from doing what I need to do. The usual wear and tear, I suppose. I've always been a fairly robust individual, if I may say so myself. I've been very lucky with my health overall.
DOCTOR: Good. So, you're currently taking medication for the blood pressure - do you know the name of that medication, and how often you take it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s Lisinopril, I believe. And I take 20 milligrams every morning, with breakfast. I haven’t missed a dose in… well, it must be close to ten years now. My wife, Elena, is very diligent about making sure I stay on schedule. She’s a wonderful woman.
DOCTOR: That's fantastic – consistency is key with blood pressure medication. And it sounds like you have excellent support at home. Now, are you currently experiencing any side effects from the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. Elena always asks me if I’m feeling alright, but I haven’t noticed anything untoward. Perhaps a little bit of a dry cough sometimes, but that could just be the climate here, you know? It gets very dry in the summer. Nothing I would attribute directly to the medication, certainly. I’ve been taking it for so long, I’m used to it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a particularly sensitive constitution, thankfully. I can eat most anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to a medication. My wife has some sensitivities, but I do not share them. She’s quite careful about checking labels, though, just in case. A very cautious woman, my Elena.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. On my mother’s side, there was a history of diabetes, although it was the later-onset type, as I understand it. She lived to be 85, despite it. My father… he had heart trouble, unfortunately. Passed away when he was 72. And on my wife’s side, her mother had high blood pressure, similar to myself. Nothing too alarming on either side, really. Mostly just the usual ailments that come with age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I’ve had plenty of examinations in my life, so I’m quite used to it. I trust your expertise completely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m just going to have you sit back and relax. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Hmm, I hear a slight murmur. Nothing to be overly concerned about at this point, but I’ll make a note of it. Your lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We can monitor that. Ears look clear. And your throat looks good as well. Now, I'd like to check your pulse in your extremities and do a basic neurological exam, just to be thorough. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly fine. Proceed as you see fit. I want to be certain everything is as it should be, and I appreciate your thoroughness. Elena always says I’m too relaxed about these things, but I trust your judgment implicitly.
DOCTOR: Pulses are strong, although a bit diminished in your feet. That’s not uncommon at your age, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Reflexes are normal, strength is good in all limbs, and sensation is intact. Everything seems to be functioning well neurologically. Finally, I’d like to listen to your abdomen. Abdomen sounds normal. No unusual noises. Everything seems to be within normal limits, Mr. Mombrun, but given the slight murmur and diminished pulses in your feet, I would like to order a simple EKG and a vascular ultrasound of your legs just to be on the safe side. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Better safe than sorry, as they say. Elena would certainly agree. An EKG and ultrasound sound prudent. I trust your professional opinion completely. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll take care of it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse will schedule those for you before you leave. In the meantime, let's discuss your current medications. You mentioned Lisinopril for blood pressure. Are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Just the Lisinopril, primarily. However, I do take a daily multivitamin, just a standard one for men over fifty. And sometimes, when my knees are acting up, I’ll take some ibuprofen. Nothing regular, mind you, just as needed. Perhaps two or three times a week, when the arthritis flares up. And sometimes, a small glass of red wine with dinner, for medicinal purposes, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Ibuprofen occasionally is fine, but long-term use can have some side effects, so we'll keep that in mind. And a small glass of red wine… well, I won’t discourage a little enjoyment in life! Now, before we wrap up, do you have any questions for me, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve answered all my concerns. I appreciate your attention to detail, and your kind manner. It puts me at ease. I'm confident we're on the right track, and I’ll be sure to schedule those tests as soon as possible. Thank you again for your time and expertise.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. The nurse will be in shortly to discuss the test results and scheduling, and she’ll also provide you with a summary of our visit today. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, Mr. Mombrun.
