DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s my waterworks, you see. They’ve been… troublesome. I keep getting… a bad feeling when I need to go, and it comes back often. It's been happening for… a while now, I suppose. Not sure exactly how long. It's just… annoying, really.
DOCTOR: "Annoying," is it?
PATIENT: Yes, very. It's… disruptive. I don't like being disruptive. And it's… uncomfortable, of course. I keep having to… well, you understand. I just want it gone, Doctor. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: "Gone," as in… completely resolved?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Completely. If that's… achievable. I don't… I don't really understand all the medical things, you see. Just… not having to worry about it all the time would be lovely. It keeps me from… enjoying my hobbies. And travelling. I like travelling.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's attempt to ascertain the nature of this… inconvenience. How often would you say you are experiencing this "trouble"?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Often… Let me think. Hmm. Every few days, maybe? Sometimes more. It's… irregular. I haven't kept a proper count, if that's what you’re asking. It’s not like a clock, you see. It just… happens. A few times a month, perhaps? I really don't know. It’s very frustrating to not be certain.
DOCTOR: "Irregular," of course. And can you describe this "feeling" when you need to go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… a burning. Yes, a burning sensation. And a… pressure. A very uncomfortable pressure. It comes on quite suddenly, sometimes. And then… well, you know. It's quite unpleasant, Doctor. Really. And it’s not just when I need to go, it sometimes lingers afterwards, a little bit. It’s a nuisance.
DOCTOR: And is there any pain associated with this… burning and pressure?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not exactly pain, not like a broken bone or anything. It’s more… discomfort. A sharp discomfort, sometimes, but… fleeting. It's hard to explain. It's not constant. It's just… irritating. And it makes me worry. Is that silly? I do worry a lot.
DOCTOR: Worry is… common. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear. No, I don't think so. I haven't… looked closely, if that makes sense. I try not to. It wouldn't be very pleasant, would it? No, I don’t recall seeing any blood. But… I suppose I don't always pay close attention. It’s just… a private matter, you see. I don’t inspect things too closely.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? Oh my. Is that… relevant? I… I suppose they are regular enough. Nothing unusual. I eat my fruits and vegetables, you see. I try to. I don’t think that has anything to do with… my waterworks. Is it? I'm just confused now, Doctor. Perhaps I should just… stay home?
DOCTOR: It could be relevant, Ms. Wease. Constipation can, at times, exacerbate… these types of issues. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower back pain recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no fever or chills, no. No shivering at all. And my back… well, it aches a little sometimes, but that’s just old age, I think. I’m 66, you see. It’s to be expected. Not a sharp pain, just a… dull ache. Not related to… this trouble. I don’t think. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good at remembering these things. It all feels very… vague. Perhaps I’m just getting old and falling apart.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a basic physical examination. I'd like to check your abdomen and perform a quick neurological assessment. If you’ll just lie down on the examination table…
PATIENT: Oh. Lie down? Alright. If you… if you think that’s necessary. It’s been a long time since I’ve had a physical. I hope it won’t be… too undignified. It’s a bit drafty in here, isn’t it? But yes, alright. I'll lie down. Just… tell me what to do, Doctor. I’m not very good at these things.
DOCTOR: Please lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the table. I'll listen to your abdomen first. Breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright. Breathing… yes, breathing. This is… unusual. Are you hearing anything, Doctor? It feels a bit strange to be… listened to like this. I hope I'm not making it difficult for you.
DOCTOR: I'm hearing normal bowel sounds. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh! A little. Yes, a little tenderness. Not… sharp, but… uncomfortable. It's just… there. It feels a bit like… pressure, actually. Like a dull ache. Is that… normal? It's probably nothing, I suppose. I get aches and pains all over these days. Old age, you see. Is it… serious, Doctor? You're not… frowning, are you?
DOCTOR: I detect mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, consistent with possible bladder irritation. We will need to collect a urine sample for analysis. I'll send a nurse in to assist you with that. Please remain on the table.
PATIENT: Oh. A urine sample? Alright. Yes, I can do that. A nurse, you say? Very well. I hope it won't be… too embarrassing. I'm not very good at… these procedures. Is there anything else I need to do, Doctor? Perhaps I should just… wait here quietly? I'll try not to move. .
