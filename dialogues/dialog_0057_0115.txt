DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. It’s nice to meet you. My name is Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… a bit difficult to recall precisely. Something about my coloring, I believe? A yellowing, the young man at the desk mentioned it. It’s… troubling, naturally. I do hope it isn’t anything serious. I’m not a young woman anymore, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if it’s difficult to recall. We’ll figure it out together. So, you noticed some yellowing of your skin, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… quite right. Though, to be honest, I didn’t notice it myself. My neighbor, bless her heart, pointed it out. She said I looked… unwell. I do trust her judgment. It’s mostly in my eyes, I think. And perhaps my skin, but it’s hard to tell with my complexion.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So the yellowing was noticed by your neighbor, primarily in your eyes and potentially your skin. Has this been happening suddenly, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Oh dear… gradual, I believe. It wasn’t… a sudden shock, no. More like… a slow fading in. It’s all rather muddled, you see. I do recall feeling… tired, quite a bit lately. And a bit of discomfort… up under my ribs, on the right side. But honestly, Doctor, at my age, what isn’t aching?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re able to describe that it's been gradual, and that you've noticed some fatigue and discomfort under your right ribs. That discomfort – is it a sharp pain, a dull ache, or something else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not sharp, certainly. More… a heaviness, a fullness. Like… after a very large meal, perhaps? Though I haven’t been eating much lately, truth be told. It just feels… uncomfortable. It comes and goes, mostly. And it doesn’t radiate… does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things, I apologize.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Annelle. A fullness or heaviness is a good way to describe it. And the fact that it comes and goes is important. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the yellowing, fatigue, and discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. There was… a change in my, well, my stool. Darker, I believe. And… a bit sticky. Though, again, I don't pay a great deal of attention to such things. It’s all rather… unpleasant to recall. And I’ve been feeling a bit… nauseous, now that I think of it. Not violently ill, but… queasy, perhaps? I do hope this isn't something dreadful.
DOCTOR: Okay, darker, stickier stools and some nausea. Thank you for sharing all of that, Annelle. It's all very helpful information. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications or any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… I don't believe so. Nothing significant, at least. I've always been rather… robust, you see. As for medical conditions… well, there was something… a liver thing, perhaps? Years ago. A doctor mentioned it, but I don’t recall the specifics. It wasn’t serious enough to… dwell on, I suppose. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a past liver issue, though the details are unclear. That’s important to know. And do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I try to avoid them whenever possible. Too many side effects, you see. Just a bit of chamomile tea before bed, if I’m having trouble sleeping. And occasionally a pain reliever for my arthritis, but it’s only as needed. Nothing regularly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently feel your abdomen to see if we can pinpoint the source of the discomfort you're experiencing. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Go right ahead. Though, please be gentle. My ribs are rather… sensitive, you see. And don’t mind if I flinch a bit. I bruise easily these days.
DOCTOR: Of course, Annelle. I will be as gentle as possible. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Okay, and now I’m feeling your abdomen. I do notice some tenderness on your right side, just under your ribs. It doesn't seem to be a rigid tenderness, but it is definitely sensitive to the touch. Do you feel any pain radiating anywhere when I press there?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s… quite right. It’s tender there. And… a little bit towards my back, perhaps? Not a sharp pain, just… an ache. It's hard to say for certain. And… oh dear, now that you mention it, a bit under my right shoulder blade as well. It's all rather connected, you see? Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness radiating towards your back and right shoulder blade. That is something we need to investigate further. Given your symptoms – the yellowing, fatigue, right-sided abdominal discomfort, dark stools, nausea, and past history of a liver issue – I’m concerned about a possible issue with your liver or gallbladder. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests, including a liver function panel and a complete blood count. I also think a CT scan of your abdomen would be helpful to visualize your liver, gallbladder, and surrounding structures. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… A CT scan… it all sounds rather… serious. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, of course. I want to know what’s happening, even if it’s not good news. I suppose… the sooner we know, the better. Though, I must confess, I am a bit worried about the expense. I'm… not very well off, you see, and I don't have insurance.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Annelle, both about the tests and the cost. It's good we're addressing this now. The tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and create a proper treatment plan. Let’s discuss the financial aspect. Our billing department has options for patients without insurance, including payment plans and potential financial assistance programs. I'll have them contact you directly to explore those options. In the meantime, let’s focus on getting these tests scheduled. I’ll write the orders now, and the receptionist can help you with scheduling and provide you with information about the costs and payment options. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I suppose… just get the tests done, and let’s see what they say. I trust your judgment. And thank you for being so… understanding about the financial matters. It’s a great weight off my mind. I do hope it isn’t anything too dreadful, though.
