DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, honestly? I just need a paper signed. A clearance, they called it. For… something. A procedure. Young man at the shop said I needed to get it checked out by a doctor first. Don’t rightly remember what the procedure is, exactly. Just need the okay so I can get back to work. Don't have time for all this, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. A clearance for a procedure… and you don't recall what the procedure is for?
PATIENT: Look, doctor, I work with towers. Radio stuff, cellular… antennas and wires, all that. It's… complicated. Been doin’ it a long time. They just said somethin’ about… lookin’ better. Somethin’ cosmetic. They handle the details. I just climb the towers. Don’t ask me to remember everything. Is this gonna be a long process? Because I got appointments.
DOCTOR: “Cosmetic”… and it requires medical clearance?
PATIENT: Well, they said so. Some fancy new place. Said I gotta get cleared by a doctor before… before they do whatever it is. Regulations, probably. Young folks and their rules. Look, I’m a practical man, doctor. I don’t mess with paperwork unless I have to. Just tell me what I need to sign and let’s be done with it. My time is valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, I can't simply sign a clearance without knowing what it's for. It's a matter of patient safety, and frankly, it's irresponsible of this "fancy new place" to ask you to seek medical clearance without providing details. Do you recall the name of this place?
PATIENT: Now hold on a minute. Are you implying I'm doing something wrong? I told you they said it was required! And no, I don't recall the name. Some kinda… rejuvenation center. All glass and shiny things. They talk fast, these young folks. Don’t bother me with the specifics. I just want a signature, doctor. Is that too much to ask? I got a tower to climb tomorrow, and I don’t wanna be held up by all this… questioning.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I need to know what this procedure entails before I can authorize anything. It’s not about questioning you, it’s about ensuring your wellbeing. Have you had a physical exam recently?
PATIENT: A physical? Doctor, I climb towers for a livin’! That is my physical. Best shape a man my age can be in. I don't have time for doctors poking and prodding. Look, I haven’t been sick a day in my life, practically. Just need this signed so I can get back to work. Honestly, this is ridiculous. Are you going to sign it or not? I got other things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I appreciate your… robust health. However, even healthy individuals require basic medical screening before undergoing any procedure, regardless of how "cosmetic" it may be. Let's start with a brief review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions—high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Doctor, I told you, I climb towers. I’m too busy working to have chronic conditions. Never been to a doctor in my life, except for maybe a tetanus shot when I was a kid. Look, this is gettin' me nowhere. I’m a simple man. I fix things. I don't have time for all these questions. Is there a different doctor I can see? Someone who doesn't need to know my life story just to sign a piece of paper?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I’m beginning to suspect that you are downplaying the importance of this procedure, or perhaps aren’t fully aware of what it entails. Given your reluctance to provide any medical history, and your insistence on a clearance without knowing the specifics, I am unable to fulfill your request at this time. However, I can perform a basic physical exam to assess your overall health. Would you be willing to allow me to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Now you’re just wastin’ my time. Listen here, doctor. I don’t need a physical. I need a signature. And clearly, you’re not gonna give me one. Fine. I’ll find another doctor. One who understands that a man has work to do. Don’t bother calling me. .
