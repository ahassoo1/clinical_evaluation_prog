DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Rayshun Knabenshue. I am here today regarding a matter with my work. It concerns the requirement to wear masks and other protective equipment. I need to discuss the possibility of an exemption, if that is possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. That’s perfectly reasonable. We can definitely explore that. It’s good you’re addressing this proactively. To understand things better, could you tell me a little more about why you're seeking an exemption?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I work as a protective service worker, and it's…difficult to explain. The masks, they cause a feeling…a disconnect. It’s hard to properly assess situations and connect with the people I’m trying to help when I cannot see their full expressions, and they cannot see mine. It feels…impersonal, and my job requires a great deal of personal connection to be effective. It’s not a comfort thing, it's a work thing. I’ve been doing this work for a long time, and this new requirement feels…counterproductive.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Knabenshue. That makes a lot of sense. The importance of nonverbal communication in your line of work is huge – especially building trust and accurately assessing situations. It’s good you’ve identified that this isn’t about personal discomfort, but a potential impact on your ability to do your job effectively. To get a clearer picture, and to see what options we might have, could you tell me a bit more about when this requirement started?
PATIENT: It began just last month, Doctor. June 15th, to be precise. There was a new directive from the county regarding all in-home service workers. It was a blanket rule, applied to everyone, regardless of the specific nature of their work or the clients they serve. They provided the masks, of course – the standard surgical type, and now they are asking about face shields as well. It was explained as a precaution, with the rise in summer illnesses, but it doesn't seem to account for the difficulties it creates for someone in my position.
DOCTOR: Okay, June 15th. A recent change, and a blanket policy… that's helpful to know. And you're wearing the standard surgical masks provided by the county, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is correct. The standard blue surgical masks. They fit…adequately, I suppose, but they do not allow for much expression, and they tend to fog up when I’m speaking for any length of time. It's more than just the discomfort, though. It's the feeling of being…hidden. It hinders my ability to read the people I assist, and I worry they don’t feel as safe or comfortable with someone they cannot fully see.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you explaining that so thoroughly, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like it's creating a real challenge in your day-to-day work. Have you experienced any specific instances where you felt this impacted your ability to assess a situation or connect with a client?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, there have been a couple of instances. Just last week, I was visiting a family with a young child who was understandably shy. Normally, I can gauge their comfort level by their facial expressions, their body language. With the mask on, it was much harder to tell if they were becoming distressed. I had to rely more on verbal cues, which aren’t always reliable, especially with children. And the week before, with an elderly client, they seemed… unsettled. They kept glancing at my face, and I realized they couldn't see me smiling. It felt like I was less approachable, less trustworthy. I had to constantly explain I was listening and trying to help, which…it shouldn’t have to be explained. It’s a subtle thing, but it felt significant. It takes time to build trust, and the mask feels like a barrier to that.
DOCTOR: Those are very insightful examples, Mr. Knabenshue. It’s clear this isn’t just about your comfort, but a potential impact on the quality of care you provide and the trust you build with vulnerable individuals. To get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any other factors that might be contributing to this, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am generally in good health. I have Medicare, and I see Doctor Evans for my routine check-ups. I haven’t been hospitalized in many years. I do have slightly elevated blood pressure, which I manage with a low-sodium diet and regular exercise. Other than that, no major illnesses or conditions. I do not have any allergies that I am aware of, and I am not currently taking any medications. I used to smoke, years ago, but I quit over fifteen years ago. I’ve always been a fairly active person, spending a lot of time outdoors when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Generally healthy, managed blood pressure, no allergies or medications, and a history of smoking that you successfully quit – excellent. Now, just to be thorough, have you ever experienced any issues with breathing, dizziness, or anxiety that might be exacerbated by wearing a mask?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. I can breathe comfortably enough with the mask on. It's not a physical discomfort, not a shortness of breath or anything like that. I haven't experienced any dizziness or anxiety related to wearing it, either. It’s not a panic-inducing feeling, it’s more…a disconnect, a sense of being less effective. It doesn't make me feel unwell, it just feels wrong, for lack of a better word. It interferes with my work. I’ve always prided myself on my ability to connect with people, and the mask feels like it’s hindering that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. That’s very helpful. So, no underlying respiratory issues, dizziness, or anxiety contributing to your concerns. It sounds like your primary issue is the impact on your ability to perform your job effectively due to the difficulty in nonverbal communication. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure, just to confirm what you've told me. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. I understand the need for a baseline. Please proceed. I appreciate your thoroughness. I’ll do my best to remain still.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs or irregularities noted. Lung sounds are clear and equal bilaterally. Blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but consistent with your history. No signs of respiratory distress or other abnormalities. Everything sounds good, physically. Your exam is unremarkable. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it seems your concerns are primarily related to the impact of mask-wearing on your ability to perform your job effectively. Now, regarding an exemption, these are often difficult to obtain, but not impossible. We can document your concerns, outlining the impact on your ability to build rapport and assess situations, and the potential impact on the clients you serve. We can write a letter to your county outlining these issues. However, they may require further documentation or a specialist evaluation. Would you be open to a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist for a professional evaluation?
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable, Doctor. I understand it won’t be a simple process. I appreciate you being willing to document my concerns and write a letter to the county. It would be helpful to have that support. Regarding a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist… I am a bit hesitant. I don’t feel I am experiencing a mental health issue, and I worry that an evaluation would focus on that aspect, rather than the practical difficulties of my work. Is that a necessary step, or is the letter sufficient to begin with? Perhaps we could try the letter first and see what their response is? I wouldn’t want to unnecessarily involve another specialist if it’s not required.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mr. Knabenshue. You're right to question whether a specialist evaluation is necessary at this stage. And I completely understand your hesitation about focusing on a potential mental health aspect when your concerns are primarily related to job performance. Let's proceed with the letter to the county first. I'll document your concerns thoroughly, outlining the impact on your ability to build rapport, assess situations, and the potential impact on your clients. We'll emphasize that this is a matter of professional practice and the ability to provide effective service. If they require further documentation or a specialist evaluation after receiving the letter, we can revisit that option then. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. I appreciate you being so understanding and willing to work with me on this. I feel much better knowing we have a plan of action. Please let me know if you require any further information from me. I trust your judgement and will follow your guidance. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll get started on the letter today. It will likely take a few business days to complete, and I'll have my staff send it to you for review before submitting it to the county. In the meantime, continue to document any specific instances where you feel the mask-wearing hinders your ability to perform your job effectively. The more detailed information we have, the stronger our case will be. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything. I don't have any further questions at this moment. I truly appreciate your time, your patience, and your willingness to help. I feel much more optimistic now, knowing we are taking action. I will be sure to document any further instances, as you suggested. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or if anything changes. Take care, and have a good day.
