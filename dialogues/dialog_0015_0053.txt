DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’m having trouble… going to the bathroom. Urinating, I suppose you’d call it. It just… doesn't come out easily, you know? It’s been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: A little while… can you be more specific, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, oh, maybe three months ago? It wasn't bad at first, just a little straining. But it’s gotten worse over the past month, I’d say. I find myself… pushing more, and it still doesn’t feel like everything comes out, if you understand. It’s… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable. Okay. And is it difficult to start urinating, or is it more trouble maintaining the stream, or both?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s definitely starting. That’s the hardest part. Like… it takes a good minute or two before anything really comes out. And then, once it does, it’s not a very strong stream. It sort of… sputters, if that makes sense. Not a nice, steady flow like it used to be. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any pain or burning during urination?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not burning, not anything like that. Just… difficult. And like I said, not emptying completely. It doesn’t hurt, just… bothersome. I do find myself going back to the bathroom quite a bit, even shortly after I’ve been, just to see if there’s anything more.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… Hmm. No fever, no chills. I haven’t noticed any blood in my urine. I have been feeling a little more tired than usual, but at my age, who isn’t? And… I don’t know if this is related, but I've been getting up once or twice at night to go to the bathroom. I used to sleep right through.
DOCTOR: Okay, getting up at night. That’s nocturia. And you mentioned feeling more tired than usual… is this a significant change, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. I used to have plenty of energy, you know, for gardening, cleaning… all the usual things. Now, I find myself needing to rest more often. And it's not just from the gardening, I don’t think. It's… a deeper tiredness, if that makes sense. It's hard to explain. It’s just… not like me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, about ten years ago, but the doctor got it under control with medication. I stopped taking the pills maybe five years ago, and it’s been fine ever since. I've never had any problems with my kidneys, not that I know of. And no diabetes. I’ve always been careful with sweets. I had a hysterectomy when I was in my early forties, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Hysterectomy. And any other surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hmm… I broke my wrist when I was a child, climbing a tree – foolish thing to do! And I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. But nothing major since then, not really. A few stitches here and there, but nothing that required a hospital stay. I try to stay healthy, you know? I walk every day, I eat my vegetables… I don’t smoke, never have.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother had arthritis, badly. She was in a wheelchair the last few years of her life. My father… he had heart trouble. He died when he was quite young, in his sixties. And my brother… he’s still alive, thankfully, but he’s had some problems with his prostate, I think. He lives in Lithuania, so I don’t see him very often. He’s mentioned trouble… going to the bathroom, like me. But that’s about it, really. No one else that I can think of had similar problems.
DOCTOR: Prostate issues in your brother. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin. And sometimes, if my joints are bothering me, I take some ibuprofen. But that’s it. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I remember my mother… always had a bottle of something. I don’t like the idea of relying on medication, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, Ms. Yadao, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. We'll start with your abdomen and then I’ll need to do a neurological exam and check a prostate exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A prostate exam? But… I’m a woman. I apologize, I believe there is a misunderstanding. I don't have a prostate. Is this a standard part of the exam for… trouble urinating? Perhaps there is something else you meant to ask.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Yadao. A regrettable error on my part. I was speaking from rote habit and failed to account for your gender. We will, of course, skip that portion of the examination. I will perform an abdominal exam, and a neurological exam to assess your reflexes and sensation. Then, I'd like to check a urine sample. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much better, Doctor. An abdominal exam and a urine sample are perfectly acceptable. I was quite confused about the other… Never mind. I’m glad you clarified. Yes, let’s do those. Where should I… for the urine sample?
DOCTOR: There’s a restroom just down the hall. I’ve left a collection cup inside. Please try to collect a midstream sample – that is, start urinating, then collect a portion in the middle, and finish. And please bring it back to me when you're finished. I’ll be ready when you return.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. A midstream sample. I think I remember how to do that. I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I tried to do it exactly as you said, a midstream sample. Hopefully, it's what you need.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. I’ll send this off to the lab for a urinalysis. That will help rule out infection or other abnormalities. Now, while we wait for the results, let’s discuss your symptoms further. You mentioned fatigue. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… pretty constant, Doctor. It’s not like I suddenly have bursts of energy, then crash. It’s just… always there, a low-level tiredness. It's worse in the afternoons, usually. I used to be able to push through it, but now it’s… harder. Even getting up and walking the garden feels like a big effort. It’s just not like me, you know? I used to be so much more… energetic. I worry a little about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Ms. Yadao, based on your symptoms—the difficulty urinating, nocturia, and particularly the fatigue—and considering your age, there are several possibilities we need to investigate. It could be a simple urinary tract infection, which we’ll know more about once the lab results come back. However, it’s also important to rule out more serious conditions. It could be a bladder issue or even kidney problems. The fatigue is concerning, and we need to see if there's anything else contributing to that. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. These tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and kidney function. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment next week to discuss these results and potentially consider further imaging, such as an ultrasound, if needed. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That… sounds like a lot of tests, Doctor. But… if that's what's needed to find out what's wrong, then yes, that sounds acceptable. I would rather know, even if the news isn't good. An ultrasound… will that show my kidneys? And… will these tests be expensive? I’m on Medicare, so I worry about what it will cover. I appreciate you being thorough, Doctor. It’s… reassuring. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Yes, the ultrasound will show a detailed image of your kidneys and bladder. And I understand your concern about the cost. We'll submit all tests to Medicare, and my staff will assist you with any necessary pre-authorizations or billing inquiries. They are very experienced with Medicare claims. I'm also going to order a PSA test – prostate-specific antigen – just as a baseline, despite the earlier misunderstanding. It's a simple blood test that can provide additional information, even in women. It won't diagnose anything, but it can be helpful for future monitoring. I want to assure you, Ms. Yadao, that we are taking a cautious and thorough approach. It’s important to rule out any potential issues, even if they are unlikely. We’ll take things one step at a time. In the meantime, please drink plenty of fluids, especially water, and try to rest as much as possible. If you develop any fever, chills, or severe pain, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. It's a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I'll try to drink more water and rest. And I'll be sure to call if anything changes. Thank you for being so thorough. And… thank you for apologizing about the… earlier mistake. It’s good to know you listen.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I apologize again for the error. My staff will schedule your follow-up appointment and assist with any lab orders. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
