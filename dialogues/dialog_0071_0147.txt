DOCTOR: Alright, Amy, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Galena. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to talk about, honestly. I’ve noticed a lump in my lower stomach, and it’s been worrying me. It doesn’t hurt all the time, but it’s definitely there.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. A lump in the lower stomach… I understand it's worrying you. It's good you came in to get it checked. Now, when you say "lower stomach," could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… sort of in the middle, a little below my belly button. Not right on my belly button, but… down and in. It’s hard to explain exactly where. It’s on the front, naturally. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. A little below the belly button, center... Alright. And how long have you noticed this lump?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It’s been… maybe six or seven weeks now? It started quite small, and I honestly thought it was just… a bit of weight fluctuation at first. But it hasn’t gone away, and it feels… firmer now, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, firmer is helpful to know. Six or seven weeks… okay. And has the size changed noticeably over those weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, it definitely has. When I first noticed it, I could barely feel it. Now… well, now it's quite obvious when I lie down. It hasn’t gotten huge, but it’s… bigger. Perhaps the size of a plum now? I’m not very good at judging sizes, sorry.
DOCTOR: No, that gives me a good idea. Plum-sized… alright. Has there been any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: It’s not constant pain, Doctor. Sometimes I get a dull ache, sort of a pressure, especially if I’ve been standing for a long time or if I’ve been… exerting myself. But it’s not sharp, and it goes away. It’s more of an annoyance than actual pain, really. And it doesn’t radiate anywhere.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache with standing or exertion… good to know. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: That’s a… personal question, Doctor. I… no, not really. Everything has been pretty normal on that front, thankfully. Perhaps a little constipation here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary for me. I eat a lot of rice, so that sometimes happens.
DOCTOR: Right, alright. Constipation with a rice-heavy diet is common. No blood in your stool, or changes in the color?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Everything looks… normal, as far as I can tell. I always check, honestly, just to be safe. No blood, no black or tarry stools, nothing different in color. Just… regular. I hope that's reassuring.
DOCTOR: It is reassuring, thank you. Now, have you noticed any other changes, like weight loss, fatigue, fever, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. My weight has been pretty stable, I think. I haven't been feeling more tired than usual, and no fever or night sweats, thankfully. I've been keeping busy with choreography, so I'd probably notice if I was feeling unwell. It's quite physical work, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good. Choreography, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm a choreographer. Mostly contemporary dance. It keeps me active, as I said. But… it’s also quite stressful sometimes, with rehearsals and performances. I don't know if that could be related to anything, but I thought I should mention it. It requires a lot of focus and energy. And travel, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right, I appreciate you mentioning that. Stress and travel can certainly play a role in various things. Now, just to cover some basics... any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no allergies. I can take most medications without any problems, and I don’t have any food allergies either. My wife always double-checks, she worries about these things. She's a nurse, so she's very thorough.
DOCTOR: Good, no allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, nothing regular. I occasionally take ibuprofen for a headache, but that's it. And I try not to do that often, honestly. I prefer to rest when I have a headache, if possible. I don't like taking pills unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let me just ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. I’ve been quite healthy, all things considered. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles – but nothing serious. And I’ve never been hospitalized for anything major. My wife always says I’m too stubborn to get sick. I try to stay active and eat well, so I haven’t really had much need for doctors, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to hear. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Never had any surgeries. I’ve been very fortunate in that regard. My wife… well, she’s had a few, being a nurse, she sometimes jokes about how I’m a medical anomaly. But no, nothing for me. Just the usual check-ups and vaccinations.
DOCTOR: Okay, and family history?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father… he had some stomach problems when he was older, but I don’t know the specifics. He passed away several years ago. And my siblings are all healthy, as far as I know. Nothing major on either side of the family, if that makes sense. It’s not something we talk about much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a better feel for what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. I understand. Please, go ahead. I'm ready when you are. I'm a little nervous, but I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on the examination table, that would be great. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll gently feel for the lump you described. I'll be explaining everything as I go.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please, take your time, Doctor. And yes, explaining as you go would be very helpful. I appreciate that. I'm a little chilly, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Deep breaths, if you would. Breathing normally… good. Everything sounds… normal so far. No unusual sounds. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for the lump. I'll start gently and let me know if anything feels painful. Just tell me if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breaths… yes. It feels… a little tender, just there. Not terribly painful, but… definitely sensitive. It's not painful to press, exactly, but… it feels different than the rest of my stomach. A little firmer, like you said. It feels… round. Ooh, just there, a little bit. That’s… a little more sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. It does feel a bit firm, and about the size of a plum, as you described. Not particularly mobile – it doesn't move around easily when I press on it. And yes, there's a bit of tenderness when I press right there. No rebound tenderness, which is good – that would suggest inflammation. And no guarding – your muscles aren't tightening up involuntarily. Okay. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs just to get a complete picture.
PATIENT: Okay. Listening to my heart and lungs sounds good. It feels… reassuring that you’re being so thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. It’s just… worrying, you know? It's hard to ignore something like this.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything sounds clear. Your heart and lungs are normal. So, to summarize, you have a firm, non-mobile lump in your lower abdomen, about the size of a plum, with some tenderness to the touch. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Everything else sounds normal. Now, this could be a few things. It could be a lipoma – a benign fatty tumor – or it could be something else. To get a better idea, I'd like to order a few tests.
PATIENT: Tests… of course. That makes sense. What kind of tests are we talking about, Doctor? A scan, perhaps? And will they be… painful? I’m not good with needles, if you don’t mind me saying.
DOCTOR: Yes, a scan is likely. I’m thinking a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. That will give us a good view of what’s going on. And a blood test, just to rule out any infection or inflammation. As for the blood test, it’s just a standard draw – a little prick, really. And we’ll try to make it as quick and painless as possible. As for the CT scan, it's non-invasive – you'll just lie on a table while the machine takes pictures. You may need to drink some contrast dye beforehand, which can taste a little metallic, but it’s generally well-tolerated. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no allergies to contrast dye. I haven’t had a scan before, so I'm a little nervous, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. So, a CT scan and a blood test. And then what? Will I need to come back for another appointment to discuss the results? And how long will it take to get them? I have some choreography rehearsals next week, and I’m hoping it won’t interfere too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, I’ll order the CT scan and the blood work right now. The lab is just down the hall, and the scan should be scheduled within the next few days. We’ll get the results back in about three to five business days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as we have them, to discuss what we find and what the next steps should be. I will also send a referral to a general surgeon, just for a second opinion. It’s always good to have another set of eyes on something like this. Now, I don’t want you to worry too much. It’s likely benign, but we need to rule out anything serious. And if it does turn out to be something that needs attention, we’ll have a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very thorough, Doctor. A second opinion is always a good idea. And I appreciate you not dismissing it, or telling me not to worry before we know anything. So, just go to the lab down the hall, and they’ll schedule the scan? Do I need to bring anything with me? And is there anything I should avoid doing before the scan? Thank you, Doctor. I feel… a little less anxious now, knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: Yes, just go to the lab down the hall. They’ll take some blood, and they’ll schedule the CT scan for you. For the scan, they may ask you to drink some contrast dye beforehand, so it’s best to be well-hydrated. And try to avoid eating anything heavy for a few hours before the scan, just in case. Nothing specific you need to avoid otherwise. Here are the papers. The lab will give you instructions for the scan. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’ll get this sorted out. Now, do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've been very thorough and explained everything clearly. Thank you for taking the time to listen and for putting my mind at ease. I appreciate your patience. I'll go to the lab now and get things scheduled. Thank you again, Doctor Galena. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. We'll talk soon. .
