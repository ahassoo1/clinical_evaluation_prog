DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you too. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. I’ve been using one of those machines at night – for sleep apnea, you know – and it helps, it really does. But I’m still awfully tired during the day. It's just… frustrating. I feel like I should be more rested, considering.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Paske. It’s good you’re already using a CPAP machine for the sleep apnea – that’s a very positive step. So, even with the machine, you're still experiencing significant daytime sleepiness. Could you tell me a bit more about this sleepiness?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I'm falling asleep standing up or anything, Doctor. It’s more… a heavy feeling. Like I’m wading through mud all day. And I have trouble concentrating. Reading, even just the newspaper… it takes effort. It’s mostly in the afternoons, I’d say. Mornings are a little better, but not by much. It’s been going on for… oh, I suppose a good six months now, maybe a little longer. It's hard to keep track of time these days! I used to be quite sharp, you know. Taught history for years. It's a bit disheartening.
DOCTOR: I see. A “heavy feeling” and difficulty concentrating, particularly in the afternoons, for about six months. That does sound disheartening, especially given your previous active life as a history teacher. And it's good you’re aware of the change in your cognitive function. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to ask a few more questions. Let's start with your sleep. Besides the CPAP machine, what's your bedtime routine like?
PATIENT: Ah, bedtime… well, I try to be regular. I usually have a cup of chamomile tea around nine, read a bit – mostly historical biographies, still! – and then I try to be in bed by ten. I don't watch television before bed, never did. My late wife, bless her, always said it kept her mind too active. I use the CPAP every night, like the doctor told me to. Sometimes I get up once during the night to use the restroom, but that's it. I don't snore anymore, thankfully, which is why they gave me the machine in the first place. Before the machine, it was a racket! My neighbors probably hated me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Paske. A consistent routine is very good, and you’re diligent about using the CPAP. It's helpful to know you're not snoring since starting the machine. Now, when you wake up in the morning, do you feel refreshed?
PATIENT: Refreshed… that’s a good question. Not exactly. I wake up, of course. I’m not exhausted, but I don’t leap out of bed, eager for the day. It takes me a good hour to really feel… functional. I usually have a cup of coffee, strong, and that helps. But even then, there’s this… lingering tiredness. It's like there's a film over everything, you know? Not a bad headache, just… dullness. Does that make sense? I’m trying to be precise, Doctor. It’s not a simple thing to describe.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Paske. You're describing a lingering tiredness and a sense of dullness despite getting what seems to be adequate sleep and using the CPAP. That’s very helpful information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, I had my prostate taken out years ago, that was a bit of a bother, but that's all settled now. I have a touch of arthritis in my knees, but it’s manageable with some over-the-counter pain relievers. Oh, and I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Other than that… nothing major, I don’t think. I used to be quite healthy, always walked everywhere. I take a daily aspirin, the doctor said it was good for my heart. And… oh! I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years now. Do you need to know what I take? I can write it down, if that helps. I keep a list in my wallet, actually.
DOCTOR: That's very thorough of you, Mr. Paske. Knowing about the prostate surgery, arthritis, pneumonia, aspirin, and well-controlled high blood pressure is all very helpful. Yes, if you wouldn’t mind writing down your current medications, that would be excellent. It's always good to have a complete list. While you're doing that, I'm going to briefly review your EHR information. And then I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Family history… hmm. My father, he had heart trouble, died young, actually. Mother lived to be ninety, quite a robust woman, but she had diabetes towards the end. My brother, he’s still alive, thankfully, but he has asthma. And… my sister, she had some sort of nervous condition, I can’t quite recall what it was, something to do with her memory. It wasn’t Alzheimer’s, I don’t think, but something similar. It’s all a bit hazy, I’m afraid. Here you are.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. This is very helpful. History of heart trouble in your father, diabetes in your mother, asthma in your brother, and a nervous condition affecting your sister’s memory. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I don't drink much alcohol, perhaps a glass of sherry with dinner on special occasions. I don't smoke, never did. I used to be very active, as I said, walked everywhere. But since my knees started bothering me, I’m not quite as mobile. I try to get out for a short walk most days, but it’s not the same. I live alone now, you see, since my wife passed. I enjoy reading, of course, and listening to the radio. I don’t really have any hobbies, aside from history, I suppose. I eat fairly well, mostly vegetables and fish. Nothing too rich. Does that give you a general idea? I try to live a sensible life, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a very good idea, Mr. Paske. A sensible lifestyle, no smoking, limited alcohol, and a good diet. It’s admirable that you continue to be active despite your knee problems. Alright, Mr. Paske, based on everything you’ve told me, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I don't mind a bit of poking and prodding, if that’s what it takes. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I'm not as spry as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. We'll take it slowly and gently. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs auscultated. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Everything appears within normal limits on the physical exam, Mr. Paske. However, given your persistent fatigue despite CPAP use and the family history of a neurological condition, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Blood work, you say? To rule things out… yes, absolutely. Anything to get to the bottom of this tiredness. I'm getting a bit fed up with feeling like a damp rag all the time, to be honest. So yes, please. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I'm happy to comply. And thank you for taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. It’s reassuring to feel like someone is actually trying to help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. It’s my pleasure. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a Vitamin D level. We'll also check your B12 level. These tests will help us to identify any potential deficiencies or underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue. The lab results should be back in about a week. I'll give you a call as soon as they’re available to discuss the results and formulate a plan. In the meantime, if your fatigue worsens or you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: A week, you say… that’s perfectly acceptable. All those tests sound quite thorough, Doctor. I don’t think I have any questions, no. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… thank you again. It’s nice to have a doctor who listens. It’s a rare thing these days. I’ll be sure to call if anything changes. And I look forward to hearing from you next week.
