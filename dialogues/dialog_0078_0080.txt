DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Just need to get some forms filled out, that’s all. Medicare sent me over.
DOCTOR: Of course. We can certainly get that taken care of. While you're completing those, I'd like to gather some information from you directly as well, if you don't mind. It helps me get a better understanding of your overall health. But let's get those forms done first. Take your time, and please let me know if you have any questions. Once you're ready, we can discuss what brought you in today. Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on while we talk?
PATIENT: Sounds good. I don’t really have anything specific I need to focus on, just the forms, like I said. I’m married, and I have Medicare, if that helps with anything. I’m pretty healthy, I think.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, thank you. Medicare details are always good to have upfront, and it’s wonderful to hear you feel generally healthy. Even with feeling well, it’s good to do a check-up and make sure everything is as it should be. Before we move on, just to confirm for my records, can you spell your last name for me, please?
PATIENT: Sure thing. It’s F-A-B-I-N-G. Fabing. And it’s Thyra, T-H-Y-R-A.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Fabing. Now, I see here your height is listed as 171 centimeters and your weight is 70 kilograms. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Yep, that sounds right. About six feet tall, and around 155 pounds, I think. I haven’t weighed myself in a little while, but that feels about right.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, just to get a more complete picture of your health history, could you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, all that. But nothing major, nothing I’ve been told about as an adult, anyway. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. My mom had some trouble with her blood pressure when she got older, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear about your health, Ms. Fabing. And yes, family history is important. We'll definitely note your mother's blood pressure issues. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the childhood illnesses you mentioned?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery, never been in the hospital. Knock on wood! I’ve always been pretty careful, I guess. Mostly just regular check-ups over the years.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Fabing. A clean medical history is always a good thing. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, that’s it. Nothing else. I try to eat pretty healthy, so I don’t really need much.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, never had a reaction. I was stung by a bee once when I was little, but that was just a little painful, didn’t have any trouble breathing or anything.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, none of the above. Never really been interested in any of that. I prefer a good cup of tea, myself. Much healthier, you know?
DOCTOR: I completely agree, Ms. Fabing. Tea is an excellent choice. Now, just a couple more questions about your general well-being. Could you tell me about your typical daily routine?
PATIENT: Well, I work as a control and valve installer, so I’m on my feet a lot. Mostly outdoors, fixing things, making sure everything runs smoothly. It keeps me busy! It’s good, honest work. When I’m not working, I spend time with my husband, and help out around the reservation sometimes. Nothing too fancy.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very active and fulfilling life, Ms. Fabing. And it's wonderful to hear you're involved in your community. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. It'll just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yep, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I haven’t had a full check-up in a while, so it’ll be good to get everything looked at.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is within the normal range. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to take a quick look in your ears. Your ears look clear as well. Now, I will check your throat... Your throat looks healthy, no signs of any inflammation or infection. Everything seems to be in good working order. Now, do you have any concerns or symptoms you’d like to address, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. Like I said, I mostly just needed to get these forms filled out. I haven’t been feeling sick or anything. Everything feels pretty good, actually. I guess I’m good to go?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. Fabing. Based on our conversation and the physical exam, everything appears to be in good health. It sounds like you’re taking very good care of yourself. We’ve documented your current medications, allergies, and family history. I’ll also make a note that you're a control and valve installer, given the physical nature of the work. Given your overall good health, I recommend a routine follow-up in one year. We can repeat the physical exam and review your health status then. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yep, that sounds perfect. A year from now is good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fabing. It was a pleasure meeting you. Our nurse will be in shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment and answer any questions you may have. She can also provide you with a copy of your health summary. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Nope, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Solero. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You have a good day as well, Ms. Fabing. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if any concerns arise before your next appointment.
