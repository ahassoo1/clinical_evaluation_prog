DOCTOR: Good morning, Venus. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure, I suppose. My blood pressure has been… not good. And lately, I have been… forgetting things. Small things, mostly. But it worries me. I want to be quick, if possible. I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venus. We'll try to be as efficient as we can while still making sure we cover everything. High blood pressure and some memory concerns… that's a good place to start. When you say “not good,” do you have any readings you can share with me, or have you been feeling any symptoms because of the high blood pressure – like headaches, dizziness, or blurry vision?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Readings. My… neighbor, she checks it sometimes. She has one of those machines. Last week, it was 160 over… 98, I believe. And sometimes I get a… a heaviness in my head. Not a pain, exactly. And… yes. My vision does blur, sometimes when I stand up quickly. Is that… important? I do not always remember to tell my neighbor when it happens. I forget. That is the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, 160 over 98 is definitely elevated, and the heaviness in your head and blurry vision when standing up – that’s important information, thank you for sharing that. The dizziness or blurriness when you stand is called orthostatic hypotension, and can be related to blood pressure, or other things. You mentioned forgetting things… can you give me a little more detail about that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… frustrating. I forget names, mostly. People I have known for… a long time. And… where I put things. My keys, my glasses. Yesterday, I went to the market and… I could not remember what I went for. I had to go back home to check my list. Small things. But they are… adding up. I worry it is more than just being… old.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Venus. It’s good you’re paying attention to these changes. Forgetting names and misplacing things can be normal as we get older, but it’s always wise to investigate when it starts to bother you or interfere with your daily life. Let’s do a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes. Many years ago, I had… bronchitis. Very bad. And… arthritis, in my hands. It is… painful, sometimes. But that is all, I think. My husband… he was the one who took care of the paperwork. After he… passed, I have not been to the doctor much. I do not like it. I prefer to manage on my own.
DOCTOR: Alright, bronchitis and arthritis. Thank you. And I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. It's understandable you haven't been to the doctor much since then. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never. I… avoided them whenever possible. My mother always said… surgery is a last resort. I have a… very low tolerance for… interventions. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. Ginger tea, things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That’s good to know. And I respect your preference for natural remedies. We can certainly discuss those alongside any other recommendations I might have. Now, thinking about your family... do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had… heart trouble, I believe. She passed when she was… quite old. And my father… he had… diabetes. Yes, that is right. He lost a toe, eventually. And… my brother, he had… problems with his memory, later in life. He was in a home, the last few years. It was… sad. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Venus. That is very relevant, actually. Heart trouble, diabetes, and a brother with memory problems… that gives us some important information to consider. Before we move on, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… aspirin, sometimes. For my hands. When they are very painful. And… a vitamin D supplement, in the winter. The sun is not strong enough here, you see. That is all, Doctor. I do not like taking pills. They… make me feel strange.
DOCTOR: Alright, just aspirin as needed and a vitamin D supplement. That’s helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. I do not think so. I have… eaten many things in my life. And I have never had a… reaction. I do not recall any allergies. My neighbor… she is allergic to cats. But I am not. I like cats. They are… comforting. Is that relevant? I do not want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Venus. Knowing you don’t have any allergies is helpful. And no, your fondness for cats isn’t directly relevant, but thank you for sharing. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. My mother… she did. But I… refused. It smelled… terrible. And it is… unhealthy. I always preferred fresh air. I walk, sometimes. To the market. It is… good exercise. But my hands… they are often painful. It is difficult to hold things.
DOCTOR: Good. Never smoking is excellent. And walking is great exercise, even with some hand pain. Do you drink alcohol, Venus?
PATIENT: A little. Sometimes. Red wine, with my dinner. One glass, perhaps. On special occasions. Or when I am… feeling lonely. It helps me… relax. But not every day. I am not a… heavy drinker. I assure you. My husband… he preferred vodka. But I do not.
DOCTOR: Alright, one glass of red wine occasionally. That’s good to know. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your living situation?
PATIENT: I live… alone. In a small house. It is… quiet. Too quiet, sometimes. I have a garden. I grow tomatoes. And… flowers. I used to have visitors. But… now it is mostly just me. I manage on my own. But it is… difficult. Sometimes I forget things. Like where I put the watering can. Or if I locked the door. It worries me. I do not want to be a burden. I just want to… remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It sounds like you're very independent, and it's understandable to feel a little worried when you start noticing memory changes. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure again, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes and memory. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that is fine. Please. The quicker, the better. I have… appointments. But I will cooperate. Just… please be gentle with my hands. They are… sensitive. And if I forget something during the exam… please do not be angry. I apologize in advance.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venus. I will be as gentle as possible. And don't worry about forgetting things; it happens. We'll take our time, and I'll help guide you through everything. Okay, your blood pressure is still elevated, but not dramatically different from what your neighbor reported. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart rate is a little quick, but otherwise everything sounds good. Now, I’m going to do a few quick tests to check your reflexes and memory. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes… can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can follow your finger. It is… easy. I used to play this game with my grandson. He is… very clever. He lives… far away now. But he calls sometimes.
DOCTOR: Very good, Venus. Your eye movements are good. Now, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: August… the second? Yes, I believe it is August the second. 2025, is it not? I think so. It is… difficult to keep track. So many things happening. I must write it down later.
DOCTOR: You are correct! August 2nd, 2025. Good. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words, and I’ll ask you to remember them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Yes. Apple… table… penny. Those are… simple words. I hope I remember them. My memory… it is not what it used to be. It worries me. I do not want to be… helpless.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes with this little hammer. This might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just relax your arm. Okay, your reflexes are a little slower than usual, but that can be normal with age. Now, let’s see if you can remember the three words I asked you earlier. What were they?
PATIENT: Um… apple… and… table… and… oh dear. I… I cannot remember the third word. I know there was… something about metal. A coin, perhaps? I am… so sorry. I should have written them down. It is… frustrating. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Venus. It’s very common to have some difficulty with short-term recall. Don’t apologize. The fact that you remembered two of them is good. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam I’ve done, your high blood pressure is definitely something we need to address. And the memory concerns warrant further investigation. I’d like to order some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to get a better look at what’s going on and rule out any structural problems.
PATIENT: MRI? Is that… dangerous? I do not like being… confined. And I have read things… about those machines. I prefer… simpler solutions. Perhaps a pill? Or… ginger tea? I do not want to be… poked and prodded. What will the blood work show? Just… the pressure, is it not? I worry. This is… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Venus. An MRI is very safe. It uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain, and it doesn't involve any radiation. You won't be poked or prodded. You will lie on a table inside a tunnel-like machine, and it can feel a little confining, but we can arrange for you to have some mild sedation if that makes you feel more comfortable. The blood work will give us a much broader picture of your overall health. It can help us identify things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or other medical conditions that could be contributing to your memory issues. It's not just about the pressure, it's about making sure we're looking at the whole picture. I’m not suggesting a pill is the only solution, but it’s important to have all the information before we make any decisions. Would you be open to discussing the possibility of the blood work and the MRI in more detail?
PATIENT: Very well. Blood work… I suppose that is… acceptable. As long as it does not take too long. And I do not have to drink anything… unpleasant. But the MRI… I am very hesitant. Perhaps… we can talk about it. What exactly will it show? And what if… something is wrong? I do not want to know… bad news. I just want to… remember. Is it possible to… postpone it? Just for now? I need to think. This is all… too much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venus. We can definitely postpone the MRI. There’s no need to rush into anything you’re not comfortable with. We’ll start with the blood work, and we can discuss the MRI again after we have the results. The MRI will give us detailed images of your brain, which can help us identify any structural problems, such as small strokes, tumors, or other abnormalities that could be contributing to your memory issues. But it’s important to remember that most of the time, these tests come back normal. I'll write you a prescription for the blood work. You can go to any lab that accepts your insurance – or, given your situation, I can help you find a more affordable option. And I'll give you a list of resources for memory support groups and organizations that can provide additional information and assistance. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes. That… sounds much better. Blood work first. And then… we will see. Thank you, Doctor. For being… patient with me. And for not… pushing me too hard. I appreciate it. Perhaps… a cup of tea would help. But I will manage on my own. Just… the blood work. And the list. Thank you again. I believe… that is all for now? I have appointments, you see. I must… be going.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venus. You've had a lot to process today. I’ll have the lab requisition and the list of resources ready for you. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take your time, and don't worry about rushing. I'll see you again after the blood work results are back. Take care, Venus. And remember, we'll tackle this one step at a time.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
