DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Skarbek. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it's about getting some shots, I reckon. My granddaughter… she’s trying to get her husband’s family over here from… well, not America. And I understand there's certain things they need to have done before they can really come, you know? For the visa and all. I’m helping her sort it out, and she thought I should come talk to a doctor about what's required. I’m a bit lost on where to even start, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right, vaccinations… yes, a common issue. It is rather complicated, honestly. So, these family members… where are they coming from exactly?
PATIENT: They're from… let me see… Ukraine. That's right, Ukraine. It's been a bit of a worry, with everything going on over there. My granddaughter, bless her heart, she’s just trying to get them to safety. She thinks they need proof of certain vaccinations, and a check-up, maybe? I just want to be sure we get everything right, so there aren't any problems later on.
DOCTOR: Ukraine… yes, that adds a layer of complexity. Okay. Well, for visa purposes, and given the current situation, there are specific requirements. Let's start with the basics. Have they had any vaccinations at all?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Honestly, I don't rightly know. They haven’t been to America before, and my granddaughter hasn’t been over there in years. She said something about a little card they have… but I haven’t seen it. It's mostly been phone calls and emails, trying to figure things out from so far away. Do you think we need to find this card, or will they need to start over completely? I’m not very good with these kinds of things, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: A card… potentially. It’s always best to have records, of course. But realistically, documentation from Ukraine might be… difficult to verify here. We may need to assume they haven't had anything, and start from scratch. It’s a pain, but better safe than sorry. Do you have a record of your vaccinations?
PATIENT: Well, now that's a question. I’ve had my shots over the years, of course… tetanus, flu shots, that sort of thing. But I don’t think I have a little card. It was a long time ago, Doctor. Back when things weren’t kept so meticulously. Would that matter? Do I need to get boosters, just to be on the safe side, since I'm helping with all this? I just want to make sure everything's right for my granddaughter's family. They’ve been through enough already.
DOCTOR: It's… ideal to have a record, yes. But for you, it’s not the primary concern. We're focusing on the requirements for the family members coming from Ukraine. We’ll need to determine what vaccinations they require based on their age and any potential exposure risks. Let me pull up the CDC guidelines… Now, do you know their ages and genders?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Let me see… there’s her husband, Dimitri, he’s 42. And their daughter, Anya, she’s 16. And their son, Boris, he’s 8. Dimitri is male, of course, and Anya and Boris are both female. They haven’t been sick with anything serious, not that I’ve heard, but it’s hard to keep track with the time difference and everything. Is that enough information to start? I do apologize for being so… disorganized.
DOCTOR: Okay, 42, 16, and 8. Good. Given their ages and origin, they will likely need a full panel – MMR, varicella, DTaP/Tdap boosters, polio, hepatitis A and B… and a tuberculosis test is absolutely necessary. And influenza, obviously. We also need to consider their medical history. Have they had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: That's quite a list! My granddaughter said something about a TB test, yes. As far as serious illnesses… Dimitri had a bad bout of the flu a couple of years back, but nothing else that I know of. Anya and Boris are generally healthy children, thank goodness. They've had the usual childhood scrapes and colds, but nothing major. Surgeries? No, I don't believe so. My granddaughter hasn't mentioned anything about surgeries. She's a very thorough girl, so if they had any, I’m sure she would have said something. Is that enough information, Doctor? I feel so helpless, trying to sort all this out from so far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major illnesses or surgeries. Good. Now, for the tuberculosis test, we’ll need to do a skin test here in the office. It requires two visits – one to administer the test, and another two to three days later to read the results. It's very important that they follow up for the second visit. Have they ever had a TB test before?
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable, Doctor. Two visits… my granddaughter can definitely arrange that. As for whether they've had a TB test before… honestly, I don’t know. They haven’t had much medical care, not like here in America. Things are… different over there. She hasn't mentioned it, so I assume not, but I wouldn't swear to it. Is it alright if we just go ahead and do it, just to be safe? I’m willing to do whatever it takes to get them here safely. It's just… a lot to keep track of.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll proceed with the TB test for all three. It’s the most prudent course of action, given the circumstances. Now, let's talk about the vaccinations. We can administer several of them today, depending on availability. However, some may require multiple doses spaced out over several weeks. Do they have any known allergies, specifically to vaccines?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. The sooner we get started, the better. Allergies… let me think. My granddaughter said Anya had a bit of a reaction to a common cold shot when she was little, a little fever and fussiness, but nothing serious. Dimitri and Boris, as far as she knows, have never had any allergic reactions to anything. She’ll double-check with her mother, just to be sure, but I believe that’s correct. Is a little fever a reason to be worried? I just want to be certain we’re not overlooking anything.
DOCTOR: A mild fever after a vaccine is relatively common, and usually not a cause for concern. However, we'll still need to ask detailed questions about any previous reactions before administering anything. Alright, let’s start with the physical exam. I'll need to check their vital signs and listen to their hearts and lungs, just to get a baseline. Do you have all three with you today, or will we need to schedule separate appointments?
PATIENT: Oh, bless you for explaining that, Doctor. It's good to know a little fever isn't a sign of something terrible. And no, I don’t have them with me today. I wish I did, but they're still in Ukraine. I'm just here to gather information and get things started. My granddaughter will bring them in as soon as she can, once we have a plan in place. She’s a very responsible girl, she’ll handle it. So, you'll need to see them separately, is that right? That's alright, I understand. I just want to be prepared for whatever needs to be done.
DOCTOR: Alright, separate appointments then. That complicates things further, but it’s… manageable. In the meantime, I'll prepare a list of the recommended vaccinations and the TB test requirements, along with a questionnaire about their medical history and allergies. It’s important that your granddaughter completes this questionnaire thoroughly before each appointment. Do you have a reliable email address where I can send this information?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be wonderful. My granddaughter, Olena, handles all the emails for the family. Her address is olena.kovalenko@emaildomain.com. She checks it constantly, so she'll see it right away. And thank you for being so patient with me. I feel a little overwhelmed, to be honest. It's just… so much to keep track of, and I want to be sure we do everything right for her family. I appreciate your help more than I can say.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve sent the information to olena.kovalenko@emaildomain.com. She should receive it shortly. Now, one final thing. Given their origin and travel history, it’s prudent to inquire about any symptoms of infectious diseases – fever, cough, diarrhea, rash… anything unusual. Please ask your granddaughter to monitor them closely for any such symptoms before their appointments. If they experience any symptoms, it's crucial to notify us immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly clear. We will definitely ask Olena to keep a close watch for any symptoms, and she will notify you right away if anything seems off. Fever, cough, diarrhea, rash… we’ll be very careful. I’ll make sure she understands how important that is. Is there anything else I need to do or know at this point? I don't want to forget anything. I truly appreciate your thoroughness and patience with me.
DOCTOR: No, I believe that covers the essential information for now. Just ensure Olena completes the questionnaire thoroughly, and monitors them closely for any symptoms. Once she has scheduled the appointments, please have her bring all available medical records, if any, to the first appointment. Thank you for your cooperation. I understand this is a stressful situation, and we will do our best to assist you and her family. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor Osterholm. You’ve been a tremendous help. I feel a little less overwhelmed now, knowing we have a plan in place. We really appreciate your kindness and willingness to help. I will make sure Olena contacts the clinic if we have any questions. You have a good day as well. And thank you again.
