DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Fabing. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Dr. Soodeen, it’s good to meet you too. Just need to get some forms filled out, I think. Medicare sent me over, said I needed to update some things. Not feeling sick or anything, thankfully!
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s perfectly alright, Ms. Fabing. We can certainly take care of that for you. Just to confirm, you aren't experiencing any current health concerns or symptoms that prompted this visit beyond the Medicare update?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that at all. Just the forms. Everything’s been pretty good, actually. Trying to stay on top of things, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear. While we are updating your forms, it is standard practice for me to ask a few routine questions to get a general understanding of your health history. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, that’s fine. Sounds good. Ask away. I don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. My grandma had some trouble with her blood sugar, but I haven’t had any problems like that myself. I had pneumonia when I was a little girl, but I was pretty young, and I recovered just fine. Nothing major since then, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chronic conditions reported, and a history of pneumonia in childhood. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries. And I haven’t been back in the hospital since that pneumonia when I was little. Just the usual doctor’s visits for check-ups and stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations aside from the childhood pneumonia. And how about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tough one. My mom’s side, there was… a lot of heart trouble, I think. And my dad’s side, my grandpa had some issues with his lungs, but I’m not sure what exactly. It wasn’t something we talked about much. It was kind of… kept quiet, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Family medical history can be difficult to piece together. Knowing about heart trouble and lung issues on both sides is helpful, though. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Okay… Well, I’ve lived here on the reservation most of my life. I'm married, been with my husband, Ben, for fifteen years now. We don't have any kids. I work as a control and valve installer, so I’m pretty active during the day. Don’t do a lot of drinking or smoking, and I don’t use any drugs. Just a pretty normal life, I guess.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Very active occupation, non-smoker, and no substance use. Now, just to complete the basic history, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t ever had a reaction to any medicine. I’ve taken a few different things over the years for colds and flu, but nothing bad happened. I’m pretty lucky that way, I think.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That completes the basic medical history. Now, just to be thorough, I’d like to do a brief physical exam – just to check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, that’s fine. Sounds good. I don’t mind at all. I figure it’s always good to get checked out, even if I’m not feeling sick.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Please have a seat, and I'll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 128 over 76. That’s within the normal range. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Heart rate is 72 and regular. Respiration is 16 and unlabored. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Everything sounds good so far. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not really. Sometimes my back gets a little stiff after a long day at work, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. It's just part of the job, I think. Lifting heavy stuff all day.
DOCTOR: Occasional back stiffness related to occupation. No acute pain reported. All right, Ms. Fabing, based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, you appear to be in good health. Given your current health status, we can proceed with updating your Medicare forms. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds good. I appreciate you checking everything out even though I was just here for the forms. You’ve been really thorough. I guess we can just get started on those forms then?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fabing. I always prefer to have a complete picture, even for routine updates. Let's get started. I’ll just need you to verify some information, and then we’ll submit everything. .
