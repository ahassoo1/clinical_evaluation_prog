DOCTOR: Right, next. So, you're Mikeisha?
PATIENT: Yes, that is me. Mikeisha Boham. It is good to meet you, Doctor… Osga, yes?
DOCTOR: Just Sam. Look, I have a very full schedule today, so let's get straight to it. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, um… right. Sorry. It’s… my sinuses. They are bothering me. A lot of pressure, you see. It feels…full. It has been going on for… a little while now. I don’t remember exactly how long, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "A little while." Right. That’s… helpful. Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever? Um… I don't think so. I haven't checked. I feel… warm sometimes, but I always feel a little warm, you know? It’s hard to say. I don’t feel sick, like with the chills, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about… nasal discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A lot of it. Clear, mostly. Sometimes… a little yellow, I think. It runs all the time. I use many tissues. It’s… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Yellow discharge… Lovely. Any pain?
PATIENT: Yes, some pain. Mostly… here. It feels like pressure, but also… achey. Like a headache, but in my face. It gets worse when I bend over. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Let's have a quick look. Open wide.
PATIENT: Oh, um… okay. Is something… is something wrong, Doctor? It feels… strange when I try to explain it. I forget things easily.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Throat looks…fine. Red, naturally, everyone's throat is red. Now, let me listen to your chest. Breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Okay, I am breathing. Is that… good? I am trying to breathe as you ask. It feels… a little tight in my chest sometimes, but I thought that was from… work. It is hard work, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Chest is…clear. Look, it sounds like a basic sinus infection. Probably a virus, you'll be fine. I'll give you something for the congestion. Try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. Take it as directed. And try not to stress so much. It makes everything worse.
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Thank you, Doctor. Rest… and drink fluids. Yes, I can do that. Will this… help the pain? In my face? And… how much does this cost? I… I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: It'll help the symptoms. As for the cost…I don't handle billing. The front desk will sort that out. And frankly, it’s a simple infection. Don’t make it into something it isn't. Next!
PATIENT: Oh… I see. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate your help. .
