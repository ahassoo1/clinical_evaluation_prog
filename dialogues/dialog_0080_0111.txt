DOCTOR: Hi Pierce, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, well. It's about my… complexion. It’s darkened, you see. And I tire so easily these days. A dreadful combination, really. I haven’t the time for these… ailments. I have work to do. Important work. Rebar, you understand. Let’s just get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Darkened complexion and fatigue… and you feel like this is interfering with your work. We'll try to get to the bottom of this as quickly as we can. When did you first notice the darkening of your skin?
PATIENT: Good. Efficient. Now, when… hmm. That’s a difficult question. Time… it slips away, doesn’t it? Perhaps… several months ago? It wasn’t sudden, you understand. A gradual… dulling of the usual tone. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to such things. My wife, she mentioned it. She’s always noticing things. It's probably nothing. Just the sun, I suppose. Though I do wear a hat.
DOCTOR: Several months ago, a gradual darkening, noticed by your wife. And you do wear a hat, which is good. Has the darkening been all over, or is it more in certain areas?
PATIENT: Certain areas, definitely. Not… uniform. Mostly on my hands, I think. And my face, a bit. Though it's hard to tell with the… wrinkles. Yes, my hands, especially. They’re the tools of my trade, you understand. Constant work. It's probably just… dirt. Or something. Honestly, I haven't given it much thought.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly on your hands and face, and you suspect it might be related to your work. We’ll definitely investigate. Besides the darkening, have you noticed any other changes with your skin?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm. Let me see… No, not really. It feels… normal, I suppose. Perhaps a bit… rougher. From the cement, naturally. And it… itches sometimes. Not constantly, just… occasionally. A minor irritation. Nothing to concern oneself with, I assure you. Are we nearly done?
DOCTOR: Okay, roughness and occasional itching along with the darkening. That's helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Well, I'm 85 years old, doctor. What isn't ailing me? Nothing… serious. A bit of arthritis, naturally. Old age, you understand. And my knees, they give me trouble sometimes. But I manage. I have to manage. I don’t have time for… weakness. Beyond that, I suppose not. I’ve always been… robust. Until recently, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in general and some trouble with your knees. You've generally been robust until recently. And you said you've been feeling more fatigued. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Heavens, no. Never. I’ve always avoided doctors, if I’m honest. A waste of time, mostly. I’ve always been able to… self-treat. A bit of rest, a bit of… willpower. That's all one needs. My wife insisted on coming today. She worries needlessly. Honestly, I suspect it's just… old age catching up with me. A perfectly natural phenomenon.
DOCTOR: I understand. No hospitalizations, and you've generally preferred to manage things yourself. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Very few. Just… a small pill for my blood pressure, occasionally. My wife reminds me to take it. And sometimes, a bit of… something for my arthritis. A white pill, I think. Honestly, I don't pay much attention. They come and go. Vitamins? Perhaps. My wife gives me those as well. A multivitamin, I believe. She’s very insistent on… preventative measures. Really, it's nothing significant.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small pill for blood pressure, something white for arthritis, and a multivitamin, all taken as prescribed by your wife. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any. I eat everything. Everything my wife puts in front of me, at least. She’s a good cook. And I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not in all my years. A strong constitution, you understand. Is this taking much longer? I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Finally, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmm. My parents… they lived long lives, both of them. My father had… heart trouble, I believe. Towards the end. And my mother… she had arthritis, like me. Nothing terribly serious. Beyond that… I don’t really know. My siblings, they’ve all passed on now. We weren’t a family for… dwelling on such things. Really, doctor, I doubt it’s relevant. Old age is the great equalizer, you understand. It gets us all in the end.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart trouble in your father and arthritis in your mother. Alright, Pierce. Thank you for that information. Now, would you mind if I took a quick look at your hands and face?
PATIENT: Hands and face? Very well. But make it quick, please. I haven’t got all day. And try not to poke too much. I need these for work, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm noting some hyperpigmentation—that’s the darkening of the skin—on your hands and face. The texture is slightly rough, which you've already mentioned. I don’t see any obvious rashes or lesions. Is it painful to move your hands or fingers?
PATIENT: Painful? No. Not particularly. A bit stiff sometimes, especially in the mornings. But that’s just the arthritis, you understand. It's always worse when it’s cold. The discomfort is… tolerable. I’ve learned to live with it. Though it does make some tasks… difficult. Like gripping the rebar. It requires a certain… strength. Which, admittedly, is diminishing. I just need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, just some stiffness, especially in the mornings. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, and then we can discuss some possible causes and next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Quickly, you said? Yes, very well. I haven’t got all day, you understand. Just… get it over with. The sooner I can get back to work, the better. I have things to do. Important things. Rebar doesn't reinforce itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart sounds are a little quiet, but regular. Your lungs sound clear. Given everything you've told me—the darkening of the skin, fatigue, slight stiffness, and your work with rebar—there are a few possibilities we need to consider. One is simply prolonged sun exposure, even with a hat, combined with the physical demands of your work. But the fatigue and diminished heart sounds make me want to rule out a few other things. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? No. Not that I’ve noticed. My wife… she might have. She notices everything. But I haven’t seen any. I wear boots, you understand. They cover everything. Really, doctor, I suspect it's just… old age catching up with me. A perfectly natural phenomenon. And all this… poking and prodding isn’t helping. I need to get back to work. Soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, no noticeable swelling. Given your age and the fatigue, and to be on the safe side, I’d like to order a couple of blood tests. These will help us check your overall health, kidney function, and rule out any underlying deficiencies or conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms. We can also check your vitamin D levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Honestly, doctor, that sounds… unnecessary. I’ve never had blood tests in my life. I feel perfectly fine, aside from… the usual aches and pains of old age. But… if you insist. I suppose I can’t argue with a doctor. Though I assure you, it's a waste of time. And I will need a form for work. I can't be away for too long. Just get it over with, quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your hesitation. But it's better to be thorough, especially given your fatigue and diminished heart sounds. It will give us peace of mind. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood tests. The lab is just down the hall. It shouldn't take long. And yes, I’ll also provide you with a note for work, stating that you've been seen by a doctor and are undergoing some routine testing. While you're at the lab, could you also have your height and weight measured?
PATIENT: Height and weight? Really, doctor. I know my own height and weight. I'm… well, I'm tall. And I've lost a bit of weight recently, admittedly. But very well. I suppose if you insist. Just… get this over with quickly. I have work to do. And the sooner I can get back to it, the better. Let’s just get this over with. Now, where is this lab?
DOCTOR: The lab is right down the hall, first door on the left. The technician will take care of you. Once you've had the blood tests, you can come back and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant swelling in your legs, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Chest pain? Heavens, no. I'm perfectly fine. Just… tired. Old age, you understand. No, I don't have any questions. Just… get me out of here. And thank you, I suppose. But honestly, I suspect this whole thing is a waste of time. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Pierce. You take care now. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
