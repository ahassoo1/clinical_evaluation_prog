DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Abady, nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I guess. It’s been… not great. Like, a lot of… diarrhea. It's been going on for a little while now, and it's just… persistent. I'm not even sure why, honestly. I feel okay otherwise, just… running to the bathroom a lot. Sorry to be so vague!
DOCTOR: Not at all, Jase. It’s good you’re able to describe it, even if it feels vague. “Persistent diarrhea” is a perfectly valid starting point. Let's try to get a little more specific. When did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Honestly, I'm really bad with dates. It feels like… a few weeks, maybe? Or was it longer? I think it started gradually, just a bit looser than usual, and then got… more frequent. I’m so sorry, I wish I could be more helpful! I just don't really remember when it specifically started being a problem. My husband might remember, he’s usually the one keeping track of things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jase. It’s very common to not remember exact dates when it comes to these things. A few weeks is helpful to know. And it's perfectly fine that your husband might have a better recollection. We can certainly ask him if needed. You mentioned it started gradually. Has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Oh, um… not really. I eat pretty much the same things all the time. Mostly Pakistani food, you know, curries, rice, roti… nothing new, I don't think. My mother-in-law sends us a lot of food, actually, so it's usually whatever she's cooked. I haven’t changed anything myself, and I haven't eaten anything unusual that I can recall. I did have some street food when I went to visit my sister last month, but that was ages ago. Could that be it?
DOCTOR: It's possible, Jase. Street food can sometimes be a culprit, even if it was a month ago. We'll keep that in mind. Now, you said you feel okay otherwise?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. No fever or anything like that. No stomach pain, exactly, just… discomfort, you know? Like, I feel a bit weak sometimes, and tired, but I just assumed that was because I'm running to the bathroom all the time. It hasn't been severe, nothing that's stopped me from doing things, just… annoying. And a little worrying, obviously. My husband said I should come see someone, because it's been going on for so long.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Weakness and tiredness can certainly be a result of persistent diarrhea. It's good your husband encouraged you to come in. We want to rule out anything more serious. Now, let's talk a little more broadly. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… um… that’s a bit… personal. I… I don’t think so. I haven't really looked, if that makes sense. I just… rush to clean up, you know? I haven’t noticed anything obvious, but I honestly haven't paid close attention. Is that bad? I'm so sorry, this is all a bit embarrassing.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to feel embarrassed, Jase, and you shouldn't apologize at all. It's actually quite common. You're doing the right thing by coming in to get this checked out, and it’s okay if you haven’t specifically looked. We just need to ask to be thorough. Let’s move on then. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or cramping along with this diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, not really. No vomiting at all. Sometimes a little bit of… like, a rumbling in my stomach, but not proper cramping. And no nausea, thankfully. Just the… the constant running, and the tiredness. I feel a bit bloated sometimes too, I guess. Like, my stomach feels full of air. But no pain, no throwing up, no proper cramps. That's why I'm so confused! It just feels… off.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you traveled anywhere recently, besides visiting your sister?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. Just the visit to my sister last month. Before that… not for a long time. I mostly stay around here. We did have a family friend visiting from Pakistan a few months ago, but they weren't sick or anything. Just family visiting, that's all. I don’t think I’ve been anywhere that would cause this. Honestly, I feel like I'm rambling. I'm trying to remember everything, but… it’s hard.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Jase. You're providing helpful information, and it’s good you’re trying to remember everything. No, staying local makes things a little simpler. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… well, my doctor told me a few years ago that I might have something with my stomach… something about it being sensitive? He said it could be IBD or… celiac, maybe? He sent me for some tests, but I… I don't really remember the results. I think it was something that he said wasn't too serious, and just meant I should be careful what I eat. I haven't really seen him since then, though. Honestly, I'm terrible with keeping track of medical stuff. My husband usually handles all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. It sounds like there was some investigation into possible inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease. We will definitely want to look into those results, and I’ll make a note to check your medical records. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just some vitamins sometimes, but nothing prescribed by a doctor. And sometimes I take something for headaches, but that's it. Mostly I try to avoid medication if I can. My husband always says I'm stubborn, but I just don't like taking pills if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. My mother-in-law is a fantastic cook, and she uses all sorts of spices. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything she's made, and she’s been cooking for me for years! I haven't had any problems with any medication either, the few times I've taken something. Actually, wait… I think I felt a little itchy once after taking an antibiotic a few years ago, but it wasn't too bad. Just a little bit of a rash. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And finally, do you have any family history of digestive issues, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: Um… that’s a good question. My grandmother, on my mother's side, she used to have a lot of stomach problems. She was always complaining about feeling sick and having diarrhea, but I don’t know what it was specifically. She never really went to the doctor much. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he has something with his stomach too, I think… something about it being inflamed? But I don't know the details. Nobody really talks about medical stuff in my family. It’s just… not something we do.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jase. It's common for families to not discuss these things openly. Okay, I think I have a good picture of things for now. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on, honestly. It's just… tiring dealing with this all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let’s start with listening to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table, if you'd be so kind. Okay, Jase, I’m going to listen to your abdomen now. Take a few deep breaths for me. Your abdomen sounds normal. I don’t hear any unusual noises. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness or pain. Okay, no significant tenderness there. Your abdomen feels a little… soft, but not concerning. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Everything feels relatively normal to palpation. Your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – are also within normal limits.
PATIENT: Okay, good. I was worried it was something serious. So… what do we do now? I mean, everything feels normal, but I’m still having diarrhea all the time. What could it be?
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Jase. The physical exam was reassuring, but as you said, the persistent diarrhea is still concerning and needs investigation. Given your history of possible sensitivity issues, the previous investigation for IBD and celiac disease, and the prolonged nature of your symptoms, I'd like to order some blood tests. We'll check for inflammation, rule out infection, and repeat the celiac panel. We should also collect a stool sample to check for any parasites or bacteria. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to get this sorted out, honestly. I'm happy to do whatever I need to do. Where do I go to get those tests done? And… will they be expensive? I don’t have the best insurance.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. We’ll get everything sorted out. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They'll be able to draw the blood for you. The stool sample collection kit is also available there, and the lab technician can explain how to collect it properly. Regarding the cost, it depends on your specific insurance coverage, but we can check with your insurance provider beforehand to estimate the out-of-pocket expenses. My nurse, Sarah, will assist you with that. She’s excellent at navigating insurance claims and can also help you explore any financial assistance programs that might be available. We want to make sure cost isn’t a barrier to getting the care you need. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you so much for explaining everything so clearly, and for offering to help with the insurance. It’s a big relief to know someone is going to help me sort it out. I was really worried about the cost, so that’s a huge weight off my mind. So, I just go to room 203 and ask for the tests? And… roughly how long will it take to get the results back? I’m just trying to plan things.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Just go to room 203 and tell them Dr. Abady ordered blood tests and a stool sample for Jase Nahrwold. They will take care of everything. Typically, the blood test results take about 3-5 business days to come back. The stool sample can take a little longer, around 5-7 business days, as they need to analyze it for parasites and bacteria. My office will contact you as soon as the results are available to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, continue to stay hydrated, and eat a bland diet. Avoid dairy, caffeine, and sugary drinks, as they can worsen diarrhea. If you experience any severe dehydration symptoms – such as dizziness, lightheadedness, or decreased urination – or if you see blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Jase?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve explained everything so well, and I feel a lot better knowing we’re finally getting to the bottom of this. Thank you so much, Dr. Abady. You’ve been really helpful. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could help. Remember, don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. My nurse, Sarah, and I are here to support you. Please take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
