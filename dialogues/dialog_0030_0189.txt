DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you. Rowbottom. Arbie Rowbottom. And don't bother with the "lovely to meet you" business. Just get on with it. I’ve got things to do, you know. It’s… well, it’s in my stool. Blood. Not a little bit, either. Quite unsettling, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. Blood in the stool can certainly be concerning, and I appreciate you letting me know. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? What more is there to say? It's blood, Doctor. Red blood. Sometimes it’s just a streak, other times… well, let's just say it's noticeable. And it's not like I enjoy talking about this, you know. I haven’t been feeling quite right lately either, a bit weak, but I figured it was just my age catching up with me. Though, I do eat pretty well, always have. Mostly fish, when I can get it. Good, Haida fish. Not this farmed nonsense.
DOCTOR: I understand this is not a comfortable topic, Mr. Rowbottom, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. When did you first notice the blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you want dates? Honestly, young lady, do you expect an old man to remember every… detail? Let me think… it's been… a few weeks, maybe? A month? It started after I went on that fishing trip with old Manuela. She makes a mean smoked salmon, but her cabin's right near the river… could be something in the water, I suppose. Everything's contaminated these days. Though, I did feel a bit off during the trip. A little stomach upset, but nothing serious. I thought it was just the boat rocking.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few weeks is helpful, Mr. Rowbottom. And it’s good to know about the fishing trip and the stomach upset you experienced then. To get a clearer picture, can you describe the stool itself, aside from the blood?
PATIENT: Describe it? What am I supposed to say, Doctor? It's… well, it's stool. Brown, mostly. Sometimes a bit loose, other times… firmer. Like everything else, it's not what it used to be. Honestly, I don’t spend my days examining my… waste products. It’s rather impolite to ask, don’t you think? A proper doctor should be able to tell what's wrong without needing a detailed report on the consistency of my… business. It’s probably nothing, just old age. Everything's falling apart.
DOCTOR: You’re right to point that out, Mr. Rowbottom. I apologize if I was being overly detailed. It's just that these details can sometimes be helpful. Let’s move on then. Have you noticed any pain or cramping in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm. Not really… pain, pain. More of a… discomfort. A dull ache, low down. Comes and goes, mostly after I eat something heavy. Like Manuela’s smoked salmon, actually. Probably just indigestion. I used to be able to eat anything, you know. Anything at all. Now… everything seems to upset me. And I haven’t been sleeping well either. Waking up in the middle of the night. Probably just my age. Everything aches. Don’t bother with that fancy equipment, I bet it's nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Rowbottom, and I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. While it may be "just your age," we should still investigate to ensure nothing serious is going on. I would like to ask about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Goodness. Now you’re asking about my whole life story, aren't you? Let me think… I had a bit of trouble with my heart years ago, back in the seventies. They said it was… something with the rhythm. Put me on some pills for a while, but I stopped taking them after a few months. Didn’t seem to be doing much good, and I didn't like the way they made me feel. And I broke my leg once, falling off a ladder while fixing the roof. That was a long time ago, though. Other than that… nothing much. I’ve always been a pretty healthy man, despite what you might think. Haida blood, you know. We’re a strong people. Though, things are falling apart now. Don't expect much from that equipment. It's probably just old age.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. That's helpful information. And I understand your skepticism, but I do think it's important to rule out any potential causes for your symptoms. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. Not to anything. I can eat shellfish, I can eat peanuts, I can eat whatever Manuela throws at me. I’ve always been able to eat anything. Though… I did get a bit of a rash once, years ago, after using some new soap. But it went away on its own. Probably just a reaction to something in the water. Everything’s contaminated these days, you know. Don't bother with the fancy tests, I bet it's just old age. I've lived a long life.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don't take anything. Never have. I told you, I don't like taking pills. They just make me feel worse. I prefer to rely on my own strength. And a good bit of fish, when I can get it. Don't bother with the equipment, I bet it’s just old age. I've lived a long life and I’m ready to go when my time comes. Don’t waste your time on me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your reluctance, and I respect your wishes. However, given your symptoms – the blood in your stool, the discomfort, and the change in your bowel habits – I do believe a physical examination and some simple blood work would be prudent. It’s not about wasting my time; it’s about ensuring we’re not missing something that could be easily addressed. Would you allow me to at least listen to your abdomen and check your vitals?
PATIENT: Hmph. Listen to my abdomen? Check my vitals? Honestly, young lady, are you even listening to me? I’ve told you repeatedly, it's just old age. Everything's falling apart. What good will poking and prodding do? It won’t change anything. I’ve lived a long life. A good life. I’m ready to go when my time comes. Don’t bother with the equipment. Don't waste your time. I'm not interested in being poked and prodded. It's a waste of both our time. Just let me go home. I'm tired. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your wishes, and I respect them. However, I am ethically obligated to ensure I’ve done everything I can to assess your condition. While I respect your decision not to undergo a physical exam or blood work at this time, I strongly recommend you consider seeing a specialist, a gastroenterologist, for further evaluation. They can provide more specialized care and address your concerns. I can provide you with a referral, if you’d like. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or significant bleeding – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you want a referral to a gastroenterologist?
