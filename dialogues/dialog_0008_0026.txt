DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just so tired all the time. It’s not like I do much these days, you know? My husband, he does most everything. It’s just… draining. I don’t even have the energy to… well, never mind. It’s just tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling tired all the time, even without much activity. That's certainly something we want to look into. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: More about it? Hmm. Well, it comes and goes, I suppose. Some days are worse than others. And it’s not just… sleepy tiredness. It's like my muscles are heavy, you know? Like I’ve been lifting rocks all day, even when I haven’t. It’s… unpleasant. And it’s been going on for a while now. Months, at least. I can’t rightly say how long, exactly. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a fatigue that comes and goes, with muscle heaviness, and has been present for several months. You mentioned your memory isn’t what it used to be – has that been a recent change, or has that been ongoing as well?
PATIENT: Oh, the memory… that’s been… a while now, too. Not just lately. It’s frustrating, honestly. My husband has to remind me of things constantly. Simple things! Like what day it is, sometimes. It’s… embarrassing. But the tiredness… that feels newer. Or maybe it’s just worse now. It's hard to say, really. Everything just feels… muddled these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so both the fatigue and memory issues have been present for some time, but the fatigue feels more pronounced recently. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the tiredness and memory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… Well, my legs ache sometimes, especially at night. And I get winded easily, even walking to the mailbox. Not a lot of walking, mind you! Just… shorter of breath than I used to be. And… I’ve been a bit clumsy lately. Dropping things, bumping into furniture. My husband keeps telling me to watch my step. He worries, you know. Always worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, leg aches, especially at night, shortness of breath with minimal exertion, and some clumsiness. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I still eat, though maybe not as much as I used to. And my weight… well, I haven’t weighed myself in ages. My husband brings me food, so I just eat what he gives me. I suppose I haven’t noticed any big changes. I’m a small woman, always have been. Not much to lose or gain, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant changes in appetite or weight. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just a little something for my blood pressure. A small white pill, once a day. And… oh, and a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I wasn't getting enough sun. Allergies… not that I know of. Never had any reactions to anything. Though, I don’t eat much shellfish. Doesn’t agree with me, but that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… dislike.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a medication for blood pressure and a vitamin D supplement. No known allergies, just a dislike of shellfish. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… oh dear. That's a long time ago. I had a bit of trouble with my gallbladder years ago. Had it taken out, must be thirty years ago now. And I broke my wrist when I was a girl, climbing a tree. Silly thing to do. Other than that… not much. I've always been a healthy woman, until recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago and a broken wrist in childhood. And family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had something with her heart, I think. She was always tired, like me. And my brother… he had diabetes, I believe. He wasn't a healthy man. But that was a long time ago, and I don't remember the details. We didn't talk about such things much in those days. It's… unpleasant to think about.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mother with heart issues and a brother with diabetes. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that even mean? Oh… you mean… my life? Well, I was born in Bhutan, a long, long time ago. Came to this country when I was young with my husband. We worked hard, raised a family. I used to do a lot of gardening, but I can’t do much of that anymore. Now, mostly I stay home. Read a bit, watch television. It’s a quiet life. A very quiet life. And I don’t really… go out much.
DOCTOR: Okay, you were born in Bhutan, came to this country many years ago, and now live a quiet life at home. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it's necessary. I don't like doctors poking and prodding, but… I suppose I trust you. Just be gentle, please. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ardelle, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/82. Your heart sounds are a little diminished, but no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but you do seem a bit breathless with minimal exertion. Reflexes are a little sluggish. And I noticed some mild swelling in your ankles. Do you usually have swollen ankles?
PATIENT: Swollen ankles… hmm. I hadn't really noticed, to be honest. My husband might have said something once or twice. But I don’t pay much attention to such things. I figured it was just… old age. Everything aches and swells when you get old, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned that. Now, based on what you've told me and the physical exam findings—the fatigue, muscle weakness, shortness of breath, sluggish reflexes, and ankle swelling—there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. It could be related to your heart condition, or it could be something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. We'll also do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. More tests? All this poking and prodding… I don't like it, Doctor. But… if you think it's necessary. I just want to feel better. I want to be able to… well, just do things again. Alright. Do the tests. But please, be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ardelle. I understand your concern, and we’ll get this done as quickly and efficiently as possible. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood samples right away, and we’ll get the EKG done shortly after. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend you try to get some gentle exercise—short walks if you're able—and make sure you're staying well-hydrated. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan to get you feeling better. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. No, I don't think so. Just… when will I know the results? I don't like waiting. And will it be… painful? These tests, I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, we should have the results back within 3-5 business days. The blood draw will be a brief pinch, and the EKG is completely painless—it involves placing some sticky pads on your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity. The nurse will explain everything thoroughly before proceeding. I'll call you as soon as I have the results, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Is there a good number for you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The number is 555-123-4567. My husband usually answers it. He’s very good with these things. Just… please, don’t keep me waiting too long. I just want to know what's wrong, and what we can do about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, 555-123-4567. I'll make sure to get back to you as soon as possible with the results. And please, don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms in the meantime. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening to me. It's… nice to have someone take me seriously.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ardelle. I'm glad I could help. We'll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully get you feeling better soon. I’ll have the nurse come in now. Have a good day.
