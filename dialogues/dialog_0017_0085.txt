DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… this discoloration on my skin. It’s rather unsightly, really. I noticed it a few weeks ago and it just hasn’t… resolved itself. I keep hoping it will, but it hasn't. It's on my arms, mostly.
DOCTOR: "Unsightly," is it?
PATIENT: Yes, well, I have standards, Doctor. It’s not something one wants to draw attention to. It's… patchy, you see? Not a uniform tan or anything. It looks… careless. And I assure you, my grooming is anything but.
DOCTOR: Right. Patchy discoloration. And you’ve been… observing this for a few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Perhaps four? It's difficult to say exactly. I don't spend all day scrutinizing my skin, you know. I just noticed it when I was… getting ready for a garden party. One has to look presentable. And it hasn’t gotten better, which is frankly the most disturbing part. It’s not as if I haven't been moisturizing religiously.
DOCTOR: "Religiously," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Twice daily. A very expensive cream, imported, actually. It's supposed to be… restorative. One wouldn't think that would be necessary, given the quality of the product, but here we are. It hasn't done a thing. Absolutely nothing. I’m beginning to suspect it’s a counterfeit. Honestly, the audacity.
DOCTOR: Twice daily, expensive imported cream… Hmm. And has anything changed recently, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: Changed? Well… let me think. Not particularly. The garden is new, I suppose. We had it professionally landscaped. Lots of… exotic flowers. Could it be something to do with the soil? Though I do wear gloves when I’m tending it. Proper gardening gloves, of course. Not just any gloves.
DOCTOR: Proper gardening gloves…Right. And beyond the garden, anything at all?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. Everything has been quite routine. The usual social engagements, a bit of reading… my husband handles all the finances, so I haven't had any undue stress over that. I did try a new brand of tea, but I stopped drinking it when I realized it didn’t have the proper aroma. It simply wasn’t up to standard. Really, Doctor, I keep a very consistent life. That’s why this is so… perplexing.
DOCTOR: A consistent life… Very well. I suppose we should have a look at these “patches.” Please, extend your arms. I'd like to examine the affected areas.
PATIENT: There you are. Do be gentle, please. And try not to make a mess of my sleeves. They’re silk, you know. You can see it's… uneven. And a bit… dull, wouldn’t you say? It’s not a healthy color at all. I really did think it would have faded by now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. Patchy hypopigmentation. Bilateral, affecting the extensor surfaces primarily. No scaling, no erythema, no obvious lesions. Palpation is normal. Have you experienced any pruritus, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: Pruritus? Oh, goodness, Doctor. You’re using such… technical language. Do you mean… is it itchy? No, not particularly. A slight… tingling sensation sometimes, but nothing a good moisturizer can’t handle. It’s more the appearance of it all that's bothersome, frankly. It’s just… not refined. Do you think it's serious? Though I suppose if it were serious, I would know, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: “Refined” is not a medical term, Ms. Bartock. And while you may think you would know, that is precisely why you are here. Do you have any family history of similar skin conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… Well, my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… rather freckled arms. Though those were always considered charming, of course. She was a peasant woman. It was quite different then. I don’t recall anyone having anything… unpleasant like this. My mother was always very careful about sun protection. She was a woman of impeccable complexion, you see. She used a cream made by a local apothecary. A very trusted apothecary. This… this is quite unlike anything I’ve ever encountered. It’s really quite… disturbing.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Local apothecary… Right. And have you recently travelled anywhere?
PATIENT: Travelled? Oh, no. Not at all. We went to the country last month, but that’s hardly travelling. A quiet estate, with a lovely rose garden. It's a family friend's place. We simply wanted a change of scenery. My husband prefers to stay close to the city, you see. He has… obligations. Though I did pick up a rather lovely hat. It's imported, of course. From Paris. But that couldn't possibly be related to this, could it? It's perfectly lined. Silk, naturally.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, with all due respect, are there any changes in your routine, environment, or health – however minor – that you haven't mentioned?
PATIENT: Doctor, I assure you, my life is remarkably stable. I have a routine, and I adhere to it. I monitor my intake, my appearance, my social engagements… Everything is carefully considered. I simply can't imagine what could be causing this. Honestly, it's starting to feel…personal. Perhaps it's the humidity? It has been rather dreadful lately. It plays havoc with my hair. I simply don’t understand why I’m being subjected to this.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given your…consistent lifestyle and the lack of any clear etiology, my preliminary assessment suggests a possible case of idiopathic hypopigmentation. We can order a skin biopsy to rule out other conditions, but frankly, I doubt it will be illuminating. I'm going to prescribe a topical corticosteroid, low potency, to be applied twice daily for four weeks. And I suggest you discontinue the…expensive cream. It clearly isn’t helping. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I'm quite careful about what I ingest. I only drink bottled water, you know. And I'm rather selective about my soaps. Though… I did try a new laundry detergent recently. It claimed to have a lovely scent. Lavender, I believe. But I stopped using it when I realized it wasn’t…subtle enough. Perhaps that’s it? Though it seems rather… far-fetched. A laundry detergent causing this? It’s simply preposterous. But… very well. I suppose it's worth considering. And a biopsy? Oh, dear. I do hope it won't be too…invasive. Will it leave a scar?
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, with all due respect, I am a physician. You came here seeking a diagnosis, and I am attempting to provide one. Whether a laundry detergent is the culprit is immaterial. I will write the prescription and the referral for the biopsy. If you’d prefer to simply discontinue the expensive cream and hope it resolves on its own, you are, of course, free to do so. Do you have any questions regarding the potential side effects of the corticosteroid?
PATIENT: Side effects? Oh, goodness. I suppose I should ask. Very well. Are there… complications with topical application? Will it discolor my clothing? I simply must know. And will it…thin my skin? I read something about that once. It’s a dreadful prospect. I prefer a…robust complexion. A delicate constitution, perhaps, but certainly not fragile skin. And will it interfere with my sunbathing? I do enjoy a light tan, you know. A healthy glow. It simply enhances one’s appearance. Though I always use a high SPF, naturally.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, prolonged use of topical corticosteroids can lead to skin thinning, telangiectasias, and, rarely, systemic absorption. It's why I’m prescribing a low potency formulation and recommending a limited course of treatment. As for interfering with sunbathing…yes, it will make your skin more susceptible to sun damage, which is why I strongly advise against it while using the medication, and even for several weeks afterwards. Now, are there any other…cosmetic concerns you would like me to address, or shall we proceed with the biopsy referral?
PATIENT: Cosmetic concerns? Doctor, I came to you with a medical problem! Though... my hair has been rather lackluster lately. And perhaps a recommendation for a good facialist? One who understands delicate skin, naturally. But let’s not get distracted. The discoloration is the priority. Very well. Please proceed with the biopsy referral. Though I do hope it won’t be too… traumatic. And will it interfere with my bridge game next week? It’s a rather important tournament. .
DOCTOR: The biopsy should not interfere with your… bridge game. The referral is being sent to Dr. Abernathy; their office will schedule an appointment at your convenience. I believe that concludes our consultation, Ms. Bartock. I have documented all your concerns and provided the necessary recommendations. Good day.
