DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me—in as concise a manner as possible—what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly? It's about...preventing HIV. A friend suggested I look into something, a pill you can take, and I figured I should just get checked out to see if it's even right for me. I don't want to take up too much of your time, so that's the short of it.
DOCTOR: Preventing HIV…right. A preventative measure. Very well. To be perfectly clear, are you engaging in behaviors that would necessitate such a precaution?
PATIENT: Oh. Um...look, Doctor, it's a little personal, isn’t it? But yes. I…date. And I'm not always…meticulous about everything. I'm trying to be smarter about things now, and that's why I'm here. I just want to know if this pill is a good idea for someone like me. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: “Meticulous,” you say. I see. And you’re referring to pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, I presume?
PATIENT: PrEP? Is that what it's called? Yes, that sounds right. My friend just said "a pill." I don't really know all the fancy names, Doctor. I just know she said it helps keep you safe. Is it...difficult to take? Or are there a lot of side effects? Because I’m not really one for a lot of…complications.
DOCTOR: “Complications.” It requires a daily pill, Ms. Trefren, and, naturally, there are potential side effects. Most patients tolerate it well, but nausea, headache, and fatigue are possible. More importantly, however, it necessitates regular blood work to monitor your kidney function and screen for sexually transmitted infections. Are you prepared for that level of…commitment?
PATIENT: Regular blood work...okay. That’s…more than I thought. I can handle a pill, even every day. But blood work regularly? Hmm. I suppose I could, if it’s important. But how often is “regularly”? And what kind of STI screening are we talking about? Because, look, I’m careful most of the time, you know? I don't want to feel judged. Is this going to be a whole lecture?
DOCTOR: Ms. Trefren, I assure you, I am not here to lecture. However, PrEP does not eliminate the need for safe practices, and regular STI screening is crucial. We would need to conduct tests every three months for the first year, then every six to twelve months thereafter, provided your results remain negative. It’s simply…responsible medicine. Now, before we proceed any further, let's review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: Okay, three months…that is a lot. But if that’s what’s needed, I guess. Alright. Chronic illnesses…let me think. No, not really. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it came down with diet and exercise. And…arthritis in my hands, a little bit, but nothing serious. I’m on Medicare, if that matters. And I take a vitamin D supplement. Does that cover it? I really hope this isn’t going to be a long process.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, resolved with lifestyle modifications. And arthritis. Medicare is noted. Vitamin D supplement is…unremarkable. Now, have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A couple of times, actually. Once, maybe five years ago, just to be safe. And again, about two years ago, when I…started dating again. Both times came back negative, thankfully. I remember being really nervous both times, though. It’s not a fun test to take. Honestly, that's part of why I was hoping this pill would be…easier. Is there any chance it interacts with anything? I take a small dose of ibuprofen sometimes, for the arthritis. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen is unlikely to pose a significant interaction, though excessive use should be avoided. It’s the frequent testing, Ms. Trefren, that is non-negotiable. Now, to be absolutely thorough, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Not even penicillin, which I’ve taken a few times for sinus infections. My mother always said I was lucky. Look, I’m starting to feel like I’m being interrogated here. Is this pill even worth all this fuss? I mean, if it requires so much…monitoring, and so many tests, maybe I should just forget about it. I just wanted something simple. Is there anything else I need to tell you before you decide I’m not a good candidate?
DOCTOR: “Simple.” Ms. Trefren, preventative medicine, by its very nature, requires diligence. Frankly, your reluctance to adhere to standard protocols is…concerning. However, we can proceed with a baseline HIV test and blood work to assess your overall health and kidney function. Do not engage in any unprotected sexual activity until we have received the results. Now, if you will excuse me, I need to input this information into the system. I will call you with the results in approximately one week.
