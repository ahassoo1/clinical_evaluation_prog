DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's Lindsey, please. And honestly, it’s this cholesterol business. My daughter, bless her heart, kept on me about getting checked, and sure enough, it came back high. I don't really know what that means, but she said I ought to talk to someone.
DOCTOR: Right, Lindsey. High cholesterol. Yes, I see the results here… hmm. Okay. And your daughter is concerned, understandably. It's good she's looking out for you. Now, when she says "high," do you know roughly what the numbers were, if she told you?
PATIENT: No, not a bit. She just said something about numbers being too high and something about… LDL? HDL? It was all Greek to me, honestly. She just kept saying it wasn't good and I needed to see a doctor. I'm afraid I don't remember the actual numbers, if she even said them. My memory isn't what it used to be, but I remember she was quite worried.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s perfectly alright. We can certainly look it up here. Ah, yes… LDL 165, HDL 38, Total Cholesterol 240. Yes, those are elevated. Now, cholesterol… think of it like a fat in your blood. There are different types. The LDL is what we call “bad” cholesterol – it can build up in your arteries. The HDL is “good” cholesterol, it helps remove the bad stuff. So, yours is a little unbalanced. Have you had this checked before, as far as you recall?
PATIENT: No, never before. Not that I remember, anyway. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, I don’t even know how long. Just for checkups, nothing serious. I always figured I felt alright, so I didn't bother. But my daughter, she's a sensible girl, said it's good to catch these things early, even if you feel fine. So, that’s why I’m here, I suppose. Is it… serious? Is this something I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: It’s good you're here, Lindsey, and it is good your daughter encouraged you to come in. It’s not necessarily something to panic about, but elevated cholesterol can increase your risk of heart problems down the line – things like heart attack or stroke. That's why we want to address it. Now, first, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. Tried it once when I was a young man, didn’t care for it at all. My father smoked, and he always smelled awful, so I just didn't have any interest. I did enjoy a good beer with dinner sometimes, but I cut back on that a good few years ago. It started giving me heartburn. What about food? Is that what you're getting at? I used to love my wife's cooking, she made a lovely Swedish meatball, but she’s been gone these last ten years. I mostly just eat what’s easy these days, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, that’s good. And moderate alcohol use… and the Swedish meatballs… I understand. It's easy to fall into routines. So, "easy" food… could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Well, let's see… Breakfast is usually just a cup of coffee and maybe a piece of toast if I’m feeling up to it. Lunch is often a sandwich – ham and cheese, maybe – or a can of soup. And dinner… that depends. Sometimes I'll heat up a frozen meal, like Salisbury steak or something. Other times I’ll make myself scrambled eggs. I don't really cook much anymore. And I do enjoy a little ice cream with dessert now and then. Nothing fancy, just vanilla. Is that… bad? I feel like everything's bad these days!
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad,” Lindsey, but those are all foods relatively high in saturated fat and cholesterol. That can contribute to elevated levels. Now, we're going to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Nothing to worry about, just standard procedure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go right ahead. I haven't had a proper checkup in… well, I don’t even remember. It’s probably a good thing I came when my daughter insisted. This whole thing is a bit frightening, though, to be honest. I always thought I was a healthy fellow. Is there anything I should be really worried about? I know you said not to panic, but… a fellow gets to thinking, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Lindsey. It's natural to be concerned when you learn something new about your health. Your heart sounds regular so far… good. Blood pressure is 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning at this point. Pulse is 72, also within normal limits. Now, are you experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any pain in your legs when you walk?
PATIENT: No, not a bit. No chest pain, no trouble breathing, and my legs are fine. I walk to the store most days, it’s not far, and I don't have any trouble at all. Though, now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little tired lately. Just a general weariness, you know? I figured it was just getting old. Is that… could that have something to do with this cholesterol business? Everything seems to be connected these days. I'm starting to feel like an old machine falling apart. Sorry, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Lindsey. Fatigue can be a symptom of a number of things, and it could be related. It’s good you mentioned it. We'll want to consider that. Now, before we talk about a plan, let's quickly review your medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, not a one. I try to avoid them if I can. I don’t like the thought of putting all those chemicals in my body. Just a little aspirin now and then if I get a bad headache, but that's it. And I don’t have any allergies that I know of. Never had any trouble with pollen or anything like that. I always thought my wife was the one who needed to watch out for allergies, not me. She was terribly sensitive to dust.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or allergies. That simplifies things. Now, Lindsey, given your cholesterol levels, your diet, and your mild fatigue, I recommend we start with lifestyle modifications. Primarily, a diet lower in saturated and trans fats, more fruits and vegetables, and regular, moderate exercise, like walking. We can also consider a trial of over-the-counter fish oil supplements – those can help lower cholesterol. I want you to repeat the cholesterol test in three months to see if there is a change. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: That… sounds manageable, I suppose. More walking I can do, and I suppose I could try to eat a bit healthier. It’s just… my wife always did the cooking. It’s hard to get motivated when you're used to someone else taking care of things. Fish oil, you say? I’ll have to look into that. And three months to repeat the test… that sounds fair. Will these lifestyle changes really make a difference? I just feel so… old and worn out, I’m afraid it might be too late to change things at my age.
DOCTOR: It’s never too late to make a positive change, Lindsey. Your body is remarkably resilient, and even small changes can have a significant impact, especially when it comes to heart health. I understand losing your wife makes things harder, but there are resources available to help with meal planning and healthy cooking – even simple recipes can make a difference. The fish oil is just an adjunct, it won't do all the work for you. It's the changes to your diet and activity levels that will be most important. I’m going to give you a handout with some basic information about a heart-healthy diet and some easy exercise tips. Also, I will give you a referral to a nutritionist who can help you develop a meal plan that fits your needs and preferences. We’ll check in again in three months, repeat the cholesterol test, and see how you’re doing. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you, Doctor, thank you. A nutritionist… that sounds helpful. I'm afraid I don’t know the first thing about healthy eating these days. Yes, I think I will take you up on that referral. I do have one question, though. You said these changes might help, but… is there a chance I might need medication eventually? I'm just trying to get a picture of what to expect. I don’t like the idea of taking pills, but I also don’t want to ignore something serious. I know I'm rambling again, sorry. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Lindsey. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about that. It's possible that lifestyle modifications alone may not be enough to lower your cholesterol to the desired level. If that’s the case, we can discuss medication options. Statins are the most common type of medication used to lower cholesterol, and they've been shown to be very effective. But we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. We’ll start with the lifestyle changes, see how you respond, and then make a decision together. We'll reassess your cholesterol in three months and see what the new results are. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Start with the changes and see what happens. And if it doesn’t work, then we'll talk about the pills. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little, even if it's a bit frightening. I appreciate you taking the time to explain things so clearly. I suppose I should get started on those changes then. More walking and… healthier food. It's going to be a challenge, but I’ll try.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's all that I ask. Remember, small steps add up. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Here is the referral for the nutritionist. We'll see you back in three months. Take care of yourself, Lindsey. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You have a good day too. I will keep you posted. .
