DOCTOR: Hi Tarin, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Hernandez. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg. It’s… a rather persistent sensation, and I thought it best to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent numbness… that's good you came in to get it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It began approximately three weeks ago, I believe – August 7th, if my recollection serves. It started in my left foot, a sort of tingling, and has gradually worked its way up my leg. Now, the numbness itself is primarily on the outside of my lower leg, though I do still feel occasional tingling in my foot. It isn’t constant, but it’s frequent enough to be concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, so starting around August 7th, tingling in the left foot progressing to numbness on the outside of the lower leg. And it’s not constant, but frequent. Is it worse with any particular activity, or at a specific time of day?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I’ve noticed it seems to be a bit more pronounced after I’ve been on my feet for extended periods – like after a long day working on set. Though, to be honest, it doesn’t entirely disappear when I’m resting either. It's… just always there, to varying degrees. I haven’t pinpointed a specific time of day where it’s significantly worse, no. It feels… random in that respect.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s exacerbated by being on your feet, but doesn’t fully resolve with rest, and isn’t tied to a specific time of day. You mentioned “working on set” – what kind of work do you do on set?
PATIENT: I’m a special effects artist and animator. It's a fairly physical job, actually. A lot of setting up equipment – cameras, rigs, lighting – and then operating those things. I do a fair bit of walking, climbing, and lifting. And recently, we’ve been doing quite a lot of motion capture work, which involves wearing a suit and acting out scenes. It's demanding, to say the least. I suppose it’s possible the work itself is contributing to the issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a much better picture. A physically demanding job, lots of walking, climbing, lifting, and motion capture. Have you noticed any weakness in your leg, along with the numbness?
PATIENT: That’s a thoughtful question, Doctor. Weakness… hmm. It’s difficult to say definitively. I haven’t tripped or anything, and my balance seems alright. However, I have noticed a slight… clumsiness, perhaps, when I’m walking longer distances. Like I’m not quite lifting my left foot as high as I usually do. It’s subtle, mind you, but it’s there. I haven't thought much of it until now, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some subtle clumsiness and a feeling of not lifting your foot as high. Have you experienced any pain – shooting pain, burning, aching – anywhere in your leg, foot, or back?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no pain at all. Not shooting, burning, aching, or anything of the sort. Just the numbness and that occasional tingling. That’s what makes it so perplexing, really. It’s not a particularly uncomfortable sensation, but it’s certainly worrying, and I’d rather be safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, just the numbness and tingling. That's good to know. Now, let’s go through a little bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any previous injuries to your legs or back?
PATIENT: Certainly. I have not had any significant injuries to either my legs or my back, no. I did sprain my ankle rather badly when I was a teenager – playing basketball, I believe – but that was over fifteen years ago and fully healed. Otherwise, I’ve been quite fortunate in that regard. I try to be careful with my physical well-being, given the nature of my profession.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant injuries other than a fully healed ankle sprain. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, and I haven't been hospitalized for anything, no. I’ve always been relatively healthy, thankfully. Just the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I've had all my vaccinations, if that's relevant.
DOCTOR: Good. And do you have any medical conditions that you are currently being treated for – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any medical conditions that I am currently being treated for. My last physical examination, approximately six months ago, showed all my vitals were within the normal range. I maintain a fairly healthy diet and get regular exercise when my schedule allows. I'm rather diligent about my health, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s all good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or neuropathy?
PATIENT: That’s a fair question. My maternal grandmother had diabetes, type 2, I believe, but she managed it well for many years. My father’s side of the family… hm. There was an aunt, quite distantly related, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in her early thirties. Beyond that… nothing immediately springs to mind. I haven’t inquired extensively about the medical history of more distant relatives, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a grandmother with type 2 diabetes and a distant aunt with multiple sclerosis. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies to medications, food, or anything else, Doctor. I've never experienced an allergic reaction of any kind. I’m quite fortunate in that regard as well. I have a fairly straightforward constitution, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I am not currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter. I also do not take any supplements. I prefer to maintain my health through diet and exercise whenever possible, rather than relying on external aids. Though I do occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but very infrequently – perhaps once or twice a year.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam of your leg. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed at your convenience, Doctor. I'll do my best to remain still and cooperative.
DOCTOR: Great. If you can lie on your back on the examination table, that would be ideal. Okay, first, let’s check your reflexes. I'm going to tap on your knee and ankle with this little hammer. This won’t hurt, but let me know if it’s uncomfortable. Okay, reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let's check your strength. Can you resist me as I try to push your foot up, and then down?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m lying down now. No discomfort at all with the reflex testing. Yes, of course. I'll resist as best I can. Please let me know when you’d like me to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, strength is 5/5 bilaterally – good strength. Now, I’m going to check your sensation. I’m going to lightly touch different areas of your leg and foot with this cotton swab. Tell me when you feel it. Okay, sensation is intact to light touch bilaterally. Now, I’m going to palpate your leg – just feel around for any areas of tenderness or muscle spasms. Alright, everything feels normal on palpation. Now, let's take a look at your foot. I’m going to check your pulses. Pulses are 2+ bilaterally, good. Everything seems normal, but given your symptoms, I think it's prudent to order an MRI of your lower leg just to rule out any nerve compression or other structural issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. An MRI seems a reasonable precaution, given my description of the numbness and my profession. Yes, I am perfectly agreeable to ordering an MRI. I trust your judgment. Are there any preparations I should make before the scan?
DOCTOR: Good. No, there aren't any specific preparations for an MRI in this case. Just let the technician know if you have any metal implants, and they'll go from there. They’ll give you instructions when they schedule the scan. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you some Vitamin B12. Sometimes, nerve issues can be related to a B12 deficiency. It's a simple supplement, and it’s worth trying while we wait for the MRI results. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Vitamin B12 seems a prudent course of action, and I’m happy to try it. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly and thoroughly. I feel considerably more reassured knowing we’re taking proactive steps to address the issue. What dosage do you recommend?
DOCTOR: Great. I'll prescribe you 1000 micrograms of Methylcobalamin daily, taken orally. It's best absorbed that way. While we’re waiting for the MRI, try to avoid prolonged standing or walking if possible, and if you do need to be on your feet for extended periods, take frequent breaks. I’ll also send you a referral to a neurologist, just to have another set of eyes on this. It's always good to get a second opinion, especially with nerve issues. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: That’s very considerate of you, Doctor – the referral to a neurologist is a welcome suggestion. 1000 micrograms of Methylcobalamin daily, noted. I'll endeavor to limit prolonged standing as much as my profession allows. No, I believe that covers everything, actually. You’ve been exceptionally thorough and have addressed all my concerns. I appreciate your time and expertise. Thank you again. Could you please let me know how long it typically takes to schedule an MRI appointment with the recommended facility?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Glad I could help. Typically, with the facility I'm referring you to, it takes about a week to get an MRI appointment scheduled, but it can sometimes be a little longer depending on their availability. The scheduler will contact you directly to set up a time. They’ll need your insurance information, of course. I'll also send over a work note to your employer, just in case you need to take some time off for the appointment. I’ll see you back in a week to discuss the MRI results. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen—if you develop any weakness, pain, or changes in bowel or bladder function—please don't hesitate to call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is perfectly comprehensive. I appreciate you thinking ahead and providing the work note – that will be very helpful. And I will certainly contact the office immediately should my symptoms worsen, as you advised. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel much more at ease knowing we have a plan in place. I look forward to discussing the MRI results with you next week. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Get some rest, and I'll see you next week. Have a good day!
