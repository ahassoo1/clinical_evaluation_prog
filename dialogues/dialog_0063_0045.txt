DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… the flushing. My face gets very red. Happens sometimes. Not always, you see. It’s… embarrassing, mostly.
DOCTOR: Flushing, you say. And… “sometimes”?
PATIENT: Yes. Not every day. Maybe… two, three times a week? Sometimes more if… if I eat spicy food. Or get a little warm. It’s hard to say exactly why. It just… happens. Like a hot flash, but on my face. You understand?
DOCTOR: Spicy food… and warmth. Very insightful. Now, is this a recent development, Mr. Withycombe, or has this been… occurring for some time?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Years, I think. Maybe five years? It got worse after… after my wife passed. But it was happening a little before that too. Not so bad then, just… a little color. Now it’s… noticeable. People ask if I am sick. Which, of course, I am not. Just… flushed.
DOCTOR: Five years… and exacerbated by… emotional distress. Hmm. Are you experiencing any other symptoms concurrently with this flushing, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… sometimes my heart beats a little fast when it happens. Not like… racing, just… aware of it more. And… I get a little shaky, sometimes. My hands. Not all the time, just… when it’s a bad flush. Is that important? I don’t… I don’t usually pay much attention.
DOCTOR: A rapid heartbeat and tremors. Yes, those could be relevant. Have you noticed any sweating, dizziness, or headaches accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: Sweating… yes, a little. Not a lot, but my forehead gets damp. And… sometimes a little dizzy. Like when you stand up too fast. Not every time, just… sometimes. Headaches… no. Not usually. Not with the flushing, anyway. I get regular headaches sometimes, but not connected to this. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: Adequate, I suppose. Now, Mr. Withycombe, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Pre-existing… hmm. Nothing much. I had high blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor said it was okay now. Just watch the salt, he said. And… arthritis in my knees. Old age, you know. Nothing serious. I don’t take anything for it. I can still walk, mostly. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed… and arthritis. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had one. And… I was in the hospital once, a long time ago, when I was a boy. Just… sick. Bad fever. But that was… sixty years ago, maybe? It doesn’t matter now, I think. It was just a fever. Not… serious. I don't remember much about it.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about family history, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a difficult question. My parents… they both passed away a long time ago. Heart trouble, I think. My father, definitely. My mother… I don’t remember exactly. She didn't talk much about it. And I don't have any… siblings, so there’s not much to go on. Just… heart trouble, maybe. On both sides? I really don't know. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, do you take any medications currently, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills. Never have. Just… a little something for my knees sometimes, when it’s very bad. A cream, you know? But not… regularly. I try to avoid medicine if I can. Is that… bad? I don’t want to become dependent on it.
DOCTOR: No, it is not necessarily "bad". Allergies, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I think… dust, maybe? Makes me sneeze a little. And… sometimes bee stings, when I was younger. But not now. I haven't been stung in years. Nothing… serious. Just… a little swelling. Nothing that needs a doctor, you see? Is that what you mean by allergies?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is sufficient. Very well. Let's perform a brief physical examination, Mr. Withycombe. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. And perhaps we’ll take a look at your skin. It’s hardly a comprehensive assessment, but it's a starting point.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Is it… is it going to hurt? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles, Mr. Withycombe. Just listening. Please, lie down. Now, I am listening to your heart now. Heart sounds are… regular, though a bit rapid. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is elevated: 145/90. Skin appears unremarkable, though there is some mild flushing present on the cheeks. Now, based on your history and this brief examination, it appears you may be experiencing rosacea exacerbated by triggers such as spicy foods and emotional stress. The elevated blood pressure is also of concern.
PATIENT: Rosacea? What… what is that? And my blood pressure… is that bad? I don’t understand. Is it something serious? I just want to know what’s wrong with me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Rosacea is a chronic skin condition that causes redness and visible blood vessels. It can be managed, but not cured. Your blood pressure is elevated, meaning it is higher than the optimal range. It can be serious if left unmanaged, leading to heart disease and stroke. Now, I will prescribe a topical cream for the rosacea and recommend a low-sodium diet and stress reduction techniques for the blood pressure. I also advise a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist to evaluate your cardiovascular risk. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Another doctor? And… a low-sodium diet? I like salt. And stress reduction… how do I do that? I’m just an old man, Doctor. This sounds… complicated. Will the cream help my face? That’s what I came for, mostly. Is it expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: The cream may help reduce the redness, but it requires consistent use. The cardiologist will assess your overall heart health and recommend further treatment if necessary. As for stress reduction… avoid stressful situations, engage in relaxing activities, get adequate sleep. The cost of the cream varies. You will need to check with your pharmacy. As for a referral to a cardiologist… I will write you a note. However, I must be frank, Mr. Withycombe, without insurance, managing your health will be… challenging. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… and more doctors… I don’t know, Doctor. It all sounds so… much. I just wanted something for my face. I… I think I need a moment to sit down. Is it okay if I just… think about it for a bit? And… what if I just… avoid spicy food? Would that be enough?
DOCTOR: Avoiding spicy food may offer some temporary relief, Mr. Withycombe, but it is unlikely to resolve the underlying issue. However, if you prefer, you can delay further investigation. I will provide you with written instructions outlining the recommendations we discussed. I must advise, however, that procrastination could have negative consequences. Now, if you have no further immediate concerns, I believe our consultation is complete. .
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you… I think. I’ll… I’ll think about it.
