DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, it’s about… starting a family. Or, trying to. My, uh… friend and I, we want to have a baby. Someone told me it was good to talk to a doctor before we try, just to… make sure everything is okay. I don't remember who exactly said it, but it sounded important.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of you both. It absolutely is important to discuss this with a doctor beforehand. It allows us to assess your overall health and identify any potential issues that might affect conception or the pregnancy. So, let’s start with a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any current medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions… let me think. I get a little bit of aches and pains, you know, being my age. But nothing… serious. No doctor has ever told me I have anything bad. I used to have problems with my… stomach, a long time ago, but that cleared up. I don't really… go to the doctor much, if I’m honest. I don't even remember the last time.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s okay. We can work with that. When you say stomach problems, could you describe those a little bit?
PATIENT: Uh… it was a long time ago. I was… younger, definitely. It was… pain. A lot of pain in my belly. And… things coming up. I don't want to be too… graphic. They gave me some pills. And then it stopped. I think. It was so long ago, I don’t remember the details very well.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you may have experienced some form of gastroenteritis or potentially something else. We don’t need to dwell on the details right now if it’s uncomfortable. Now, thinking about past surgeries, have you ever had any operations or procedures?
PATIENT: Operations… let me see. I… I think so. When I was a boy, I had my… tonsils out. That's all I remember, really. A hospital bed, and a sore throat. It was a long time ago, when things were… different. I don’t think I’ve had anything since. No, I’m pretty sure I haven't.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child. And no other surgeries. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a tough one. My… mother, she had problems with her heart, I think. She was sick for a long time when I was growing up. And my father… he just got old, you know? He just… stopped being well. I don’t think either of them had anything… specific. No one talked much about sickness, really. It was just… how things were.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with heart problems. That's helpful. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. I eat… most things. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy, but that’s just from… being old, I think. No, I don't think I have any serious allergies. Never had to go to the hospital for anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s good. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. No, not really. Just… sometimes I take something for my… aches and pains. But it's just… over the counter stuff. You can buy it at the shop. A painkiller. Nothing a doctor prescribed. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional over-the-counter pain relievers. Do you recall the name of the pain reliever you use?
PATIENT: Uh… let me see… it’s… it’s a blue one. A little blue pill. I think it has… ‘pam’ in the name. Or something like that. It helps my back, mostly. I buy it at… the big shop. You know, the one with everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you know the full name of the medication, or perhaps the dosage you usually take?
PATIENT: No, I don't. I just ask for a painkiller for my back at the shop, and they give me these little blue pills. They don’t ask any questions, and I don't ask any. I just take one or two when my back is really bad. I probably shouldn’t be taking it, should I? It feels like I'm doing something wrong.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It's good you're telling me. Many people obtain medications this way. I understand you weren't aware you needed to ask specific questions. We need to figure out exactly what you're taking to ensure it's safe, especially given your plans. Let’s try this. Would you happen to have the bottle with you?
PATIENT: No, I don't. I finished it last week, I think. I just… threw it away. I usually just get a new one when I need it. I feel bad now. I didn't know it was important to keep the bottle.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Verrall. Don't worry about it. We’ll do our best without the bottle. I'm going to ask you a few more questions about your symptoms, then we will conduct a physical exam. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. I’ll try and remember anything I can. I just want to make sure everything is okay. My friend… she wants a baby very much. And I want to make her happy.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. And that's exactly what we’re here for. Now, let's start with your overall health. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I eat about the same, I think. Maybe a little less sometimes. And my energy… well, I'm an old man. I get tired easily. But that’s just… normal. Nothing has changed much, really. I haven’t been feeling sick or anything. I have been a little bit… stressed lately. Thinking about everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Stress is understandable in your situation. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or urinary function recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… let me think. No, I think everything is normal there. Same as always. And… urinary function? Is that about… going to the toilet? Yes, that’s normal too. No problems. I’m not very good at talking about these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. We don't have to go into detail if you're not comfortable. Now, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, none of that. My chest is fine. I can breathe alright. And… palpitations? Is that like… my heart beating fast? No, that doesn't happen. My heart feels… okay. Sometimes it feels a little bit… weak, but that’s just because I'm old.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's move on to a brief physical examination. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I hope everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just listening to your heart and lungs now. Take some deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, 88 beats per minute. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, but a little diminished. Blood pressure is 140/90. Slightly elevated. Abdomen is soft, but I do feel some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. No masses or organomegaly detected. Everything seems within normal limits, though your blood pressure is a little high. We will need to monitor that.
PATIENT: Oh. High blood pressure? Is that bad? My father had high blood pressure too, I think. Does that mean I'm going to get sick?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily a cause for immediate concern, Mr. Verrall, but it's something we want to address. Elevated blood pressure can increase your risk for heart disease and stroke, but it's often manageable with lifestyle changes or medication. And just because your father had it doesn’t automatically mean you’ll develop serious problems. We'll need to investigate further to determine the cause and severity. Given your plans for starting a family and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend some further testing. We should do a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a urinalysis. We should also do an EKG to assess your heart function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best. I just want to make sure everything is okay. My friend… she's been wanting this for so long. I'll do whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Verrall. That's a very good attitude. I’m glad you're willing to proceed with testing. We'll schedule those tests for you today. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your salt intake, exercising regularly, and managing your stress levels as much as possible. Given your history of taking an over-the-counter pain reliever without knowing the specific medication, and the potential impact on pre-conception, I also recommend stopping that medication until we determine what it is. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Stopping the painkiller… yes, alright. I can do that. I don’t really need it that often anyway. Um… well, is there anything else I should be doing? Anything at all? My friend, she’s very healthy, but I want to make sure I’m doing everything right too. Should I be taking any vitamins? Or… eating anything special?
DOCTOR: That’s a great question, Mr. Verrall. Before starting a family, it’s good to optimize your overall health. I recommend taking a multivitamin with at least 400 micrograms of folic acid. Folic acid is crucial for preventing neural tube defects in the developing baby. It's also a good idea to eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Avoid alcohol and smoking, and limit your caffeine intake. These can all negatively impact fertility and pregnancy. Finally, and this is important, it’s best to avoid any unnecessary medications, including over-the-counter pain relievers, until we have a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Folic acid… I’ll remember that. I think I’ve heard of that. No alcohol, no smoking… I don't smoke. I drink sometimes, but I can stop. Um… my friend, she sometimes gets stressed too. Is there anything she should be doing? Vitamins for her too?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. It’s good that you're thinking about her as well. She should also start taking a prenatal vitamin with at least 400 micrograms of folic acid. It's best to start taking it at least one to three months before trying to conceive. She should also avoid alcohol and smoking, and limit her caffeine intake. Managing stress is important for both of you. Regular exercise, relaxation techniques, and getting enough sleep can all help. We’ll discuss all of this in more detail once we have the results of your tests. In the meantime, I’m going to have my assistant schedule those tests for you and provide you with some informational pamphlets about pre-conception health. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little bit better now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verrall. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we're here to support you both throughout this process. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get those tests scheduled for you right away. And I’ll have my assistant provide you with those informational pamphlets. We'll see you soon, and I wish you both all the best.
