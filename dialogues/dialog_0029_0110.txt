DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I’m Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, I feel…stuck. Like an old engine that needs a bit of a tune-up, you know? I’m hoping you can help me feel a bit more like myself again. I’ve just been…lacking energy, and not enjoying things as much as I used to. I suppose I’m looking for a reset, or a jumpstart, as I’ve been calling it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Stuck” and lacking energy… that’s a good way to describe it. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Let’s try to figure out what’s going on. To start, can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. When did it start… It wasn’t sudden, not like a cold or anything. It’s been…gradual, I think. Perhaps six months ago? Maybe a little longer. It started with just feeling a bit more tired than usual, and now it feels…well, like it’s getting harder to do the things I enjoy. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly, though. I’ve been retired for a while now, and things just sort of…blend together, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Gradual onset can make it harder to pinpoint. Six months… alright. And has this tiredness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly constant, I’d say. But some days are definitely worse than others. Mornings are the hardest. It takes a long time to feel…awake, even after I’ve had my coffee. And evenings…well, I used to enjoy a little gardening in the cool of the evening, but now I mostly just want to sit. It’s not a bad tiredness, not like being sick, just…a heavy one. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy and worse in the mornings. And you've noticed it's impacting your ability to do things you enjoy, like gardening. Have you noticed any other changes along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Thinking about it…my appetite hasn't been the best. I used to love to cook, Chamorro food especially, but now…it feels like a chore. I eat, of course, I have to, but I don’t enjoy it like I used to. And my memory…it’s not what it used to be, naturally, at my age, but it feels a bit…foggy sometimes. Little things, you know? Forgetting names, or where I put my glasses. It’s probably just old age, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, decreased appetite and some memory issues. Those are important things to note. Now, have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven't been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. But I think…yes, perhaps a little. My clothes feel a bit looser than they used to. Not a significant amount, but enough that I’ve noticed. I don’t actively try to lose weight, not at all. I used to be quite proud of my cooking, and keeping a good figure, but…things change.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unintentional weight loss. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, Doctor, that’s a rather personal question, isn’t it? Let me see…it’s been…a little irregular, perhaps? Not anything alarming, just…not as regular as it used to be. Nothing painful, thankfully. And not frequent, just…different. Is that what you were asking? I hope I’m not being too…vague. It’s difficult to talk about such things.
DOCTOR: No, you're not being vague at all, Ms. McNabb. It's important for me to get a complete picture, and these questions help me do that. Irregular bowel habits, alright. Now, let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any fever, chills, night sweats, or any new aches or pains?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, none of those. No fever, no chills, no night sweats. And my joints ache a little, as they always do with the weather, but nothing new or unusual. I get a bit creaky in the mornings, but that’s just old age, I suspect. I've always said I can predict the rain with my knees. But honestly, Doctor, nothing new in that department. I feel mostly…tired and a bit…dimmed, if that makes sense. Not sick, just…not myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, night sweats, or new aches and pains. Just the tiredness and feeling "dimmed." Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me see. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for many years now. And I had a bit of arthritis, as I mentioned, mostly in my knees and hands. Other than that…nothing major. I’ve been quite lucky, actually. I always ate a good Chamorro diet, lots of fish and vegetables, and tried to stay active. My husband, God rest his soul, always said I was a tough old bird. He was right, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, well-controlled hypertension and arthritis. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, perhaps thirty years ago? And I was hospitalized once with pneumonia when I was quite young, but that was a very long time ago. Nothing since then, thankfully. I’ve always tried to avoid doctors as much as possible, unless absolutely necessary. I always preferred to take care of myself at home.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a bout of pneumonia a long time ago. And now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I know. I can take most things without any trouble. My husband used to joke that I had a cast iron stomach, and he was probably right. He always said I could eat anything and never get sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take a medication for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And I take a daily multivitamin, just to keep things topped up. And…oh, yes, I take calcium supplements for my bones. The doctor recommended them a few years ago, to help with the arthritis. That’s all, I think. Unless…oh, no, that was just a temporary pain reliever for my knees, and I stopped taking that months ago. Just the Lisinopril, the multivitamin, and the calcium.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, a multivitamin, and calcium supplements. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, like me, and she also had arthritis. My father was a strong man, very healthy, but he did develop diabetes later in life. And…oh, yes, my sister had some heart trouble, but she didn't take care of herself like she should have. She smoked too much and didn't eat right. It's a shame. Other than that, nothing major that I can think of. Mostly just the usual aches and pains of getting older.
DOCTOR: Alright, hypertension, arthritis, and diabetes in the family. And finally, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never smoked a day in my life. My husband used to smoke, but I always made him go outside. And I don't drink alcohol, either. Never liked the taste of it. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I was raised better than that. I've always been a very sensible woman. I get enough excitement just tending to my garden and spending time with my grandchildren.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Thank you, Ms. McNabb, that was very thorough. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a few other basic things. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding, though I don't particularly enjoy it! I suppose it’s necessary. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath for me, Ms. McNabb. And another one… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the lower quadrants. No masses or organomegaly. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Pulses are weak but present. Some mild swelling and tenderness in your hands, consistent with arthritis. Okay, Ms. McNabb, everything seems relatively normal, but your heart sounds are a little faint and your pulses are weak. These findings, along with your symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and decreased appetite, are concerning. I'd like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on. We’ll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and a few other things. It will help rule out any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. It’s good to know you’re taking things seriously. I’ve been feeling…off for a while now, and it’s a relief to finally be getting some answers. Blood work sounds sensible. Is there anything else I need to do? Fasting, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Yes, good question. For the most accurate results, I’d like you to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks, except for water. We can schedule the blood draw for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn't take too long. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, please try to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. I’ll also write you a prescription for a calcium and vitamin D supplement to help support your bones. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Ms. McNabb?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Fasting until tomorrow morning, calcium and vitamin D supplements… I can manage that. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and for taking my concerns seriously. It’s a weight off my shoulders, honestly. Is there anything you need from me before I leave?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. McNabb, you've given me all the information I need for now. Just remember to follow the fasting instructions for the blood draw tomorrow. The lab will send the results to me, and my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they’re available. Here’s the referral for the blood work. And this is the prescription for the supplement. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We are here to help. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. McNabb. I hope we can get to the bottom of this and get you feeling like yourself again. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness and attention. I will follow your instructions carefully. And I will be sure to call if anything changes. Have a good day. I’ll see you soon.
