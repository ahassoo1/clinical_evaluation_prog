DOCTOR: Hi Reneisha, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve gained a lot of weight, quite suddenly, and I haven’t changed anything about my diet or exercise. It’s concerning me, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is concerning, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. It's definitely not something to ignore. “Suddenly” is important – can you give me a timeframe for how long you’ve noticed this weight gain?
PATIENT: Let me see… it began, I believe, around late February. Perhaps early March. It wasn’t much at first, just feeling a bit… snugger in my clothes. But it’s been steadily increasing since then. I’d say… fifteen pounds, at least, possibly more. It’s difficult to be precise.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly six months of progressive weight gain, around fifteen pounds or more. And you haven’t made any changes to your usual diet or exercise routine during that time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I eat the same foods I always have – mostly traditional Lithuanian dishes, I suppose. And I walk every day, like I always do. About thirty minutes, usually. It’s very… unsettling, to be gaining weight when nothing has changed.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern – that is unsettling. Alright, let’s dig a little deeper. Besides the weight gain, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. Except… perhaps I’ve been a bit more tired lately. Not debilitatingly so, just… more easily fatigued. And I seem to be… colder than usual. Even when the weather is warm. Is that… relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is relevant, thank you for mentioning that. Fatigue and feeling cold can sometimes be connected to what's going on. Do you have any trouble sleeping, or have you noticed any changes in your skin or hair?
PATIENT: My sleep… it’s been a little disrupted, yes. Not every night, but I wake up more easily. And… now that you mention it, my hair is rather dry, I suppose. And it’s falling out more than usual, when I brush it. I hadn't connected those things, but yes, you are right. It is falling out more. It’s a small thing, but… concerning nonetheless.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we've got weight gain, fatigue, feeling cold, disrupted sleep, and increased hair shedding. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – thyroid problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I’ve always been quite healthy, honestly. A bit… stout, perhaps, but otherwise perfectly well. My parents were both healthy, too. My mother lived to be eighty-nine, and my father… eighty-two. No major illnesses in the family, as far as I know. I have had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I broke my arm when I was a child – a rather silly accident involving a tree, I’m afraid – but that was the only time I’ve ever been to the hospital. Just a simple fracture, quickly healed. No surgeries, no serious illnesses, nothing like that. I pride myself on being… resilient. It’s just… this weight gain is so baffling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations besides the childhood fracture. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. A bit of herbal tea, perhaps, for a cold, but nothing regularly. My husband sometimes tries to give me vitamins, but I usually refuse. I believe in a good diet and fresh air, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t believe so. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of foods, I’ve never had any sensitivities. No allergies to pollen, no reactions to insect bites… I’m quite fortunate, in that regard. A simple constitution, I suppose. Though it seems to be failing me now, with this… weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: My… social history? I'm not sure what you mean, Doctor. I’ve been married to my husband, Kazimieras, for thirty years. We live in a small village, and mostly keep to ourselves. I have a sister who lives in Vilnius, but we don’t see each other very often. I enjoy gardening, cooking, and reading. Is that what you meant? It’s a rather quiet life, but a peaceful one.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Just checking on things like smoking, alcohol consumption, or recreational drug use, if any. And a little bit about your typical diet – you mentioned traditional Lithuanian dishes, could you describe what that generally involves?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I only drink a small glass of wine with dinner, perhaps three times a week. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I am a respectable woman. As for my diet… well, it’s very hearty. Lots of potatoes, of course. Cepelinai, kugelis, šaltibarščiai in the summer. We eat a lot of pork, and dairy products. My husband makes excellent smoked meats. It’s… traditional fare. Very filling, very comforting. But perhaps not… healthy, now that I think about it. I just never considered it a problem before.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. Alright, Reneisha, based on what you’ve told me, the weight gain, fatigue, feeling cold, hair loss, and disrupted sleep are concerning. It could be a number of things, but one possibility that comes to mind is hypothyroidism – an underactive thyroid. To investigate further, I’d like to do a physical exam, and then order some blood tests, including a thyroid panel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. That sounds… sensible. Anything to find out what is causing this. I trust your judgement. Blood tests, a physical exam… yes, please. I just want to feel like myself again. This is… unsettling, as you said. Please, do whatever you think is necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Alright, let's start with the physical exam. If you don't mind, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your thyroid gland in your neck, and check your reflexes. I’ll also measure your blood pressure and pulse. It’s a fairly standard exam, nothing to worry about. Would you like to change into a gown?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A gown would be… appropriate. Please, show me where the changing room is. I’m ready when you are. I confess, I am a little nervous, but I trust you to do what is best. It’s just… all this talk of the thyroid… my aunt had something similar, many years ago. It wasn’t a pleasant experience. But I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: The changing room is just over there. There’s a gown in there, and a private space to get changed. Take your time, and come out when you're ready. I’ll be right here. And don't worry, we'll figure this out together.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness.
