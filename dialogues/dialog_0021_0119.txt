DOCTOR: Right, Jinnie Wartick. Fifty-seven… Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor… it’s a bit embarrassing, to be frank. But I’ve noticed… a discharge. A… leakage, if you will. From… down there. It’s not right, and I wanted to get it checked. It started a few weeks ago, and it’s… persistent. It’s just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Persistent, you say. Hmm. Well, “down there” issues are why people come to see me, so don’t feel embarrassed. A few weeks… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I suppose. Not all the time, thankfully. But… more often now. It’s worse after… well, after I’ve been… active. Though, frankly, at my age, "active" is a strong word. It’s just… worrying. And it doesn’t smell nice, if you must know. A proper nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Worse with activity… and an unpleasant odor. Right. Okay. Let’s try to get a little more specific. What color is the discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a delicate question. It's… yellowish, I think. Not bright yellow, more… a sort of faded, dirty yellow. And… sometimes there are little flecks in it. I haven't examined it closely, if you understand. It's not something one wants to look at, really. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Dirty yellow with flecks… Alright. And is there any itching, burning, or pain associated with it?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Not really. A bit of discomfort, perhaps, after… well, after things are finished. But no actual pain. And no itching. It’s mostly just… the discharge itself. And the smell, naturally. It’s rather… off-putting. It makes me feel… unclean, really. A respectable woman shouldn't have to worry about such things.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, no itching. Just the discharge and odor. Have you noticed any changes in your… usual bathroom habits?
PATIENT: Bathroom habits? What do you mean, exactly? I haven't… I haven't had any trouble going to the bathroom, if that’s what you’re asking. Regular as clockwork, I always have been. My mother always said a proper diet is key, and I've always taken care of myself. Are you suggesting something… else? Because frankly, doctor, I find that a bit impertinent.
DOCTOR: Impertinent?
PATIENT: Well, yes! I mean, you're a doctor, I understand you need to ask questions. But to imply… to imply something is wrong with my… regularity… when all I’ve brought up is a discharge! It's rather rude, if you ask me. I’ve always taken pride in my… internal health, thank you very much. A proper Spanish woman knows how to maintain herself.
DOCTOR: Right. Of course. Let’s move on. Have you had any fevers, chills, or lower abdominal pain recently?
PATIENT: No, no fevers or chills. And no abdominal pain, thank goodness. Everything above the waist is perfectly fine. It's just… down there that's causing all the trouble. Really, it's most inconvenient. I had a perfectly lovely garden party planned for next week, and now… I don't know if I'll even be able to attend. One simply can't socialize with… these sorts of issues. It’s embarrassing enough knowing about it, let alone anyone else.
DOCTOR: Garden party… Alright. And have you been sexually active recently?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really! What a terribly personal question! I am a respectable woman, you know. I don't discuss such things with… with anyone, let alone a… a young woman I’ve just met. I find that question quite offensive, frankly. Are you attempting to… to insinuate something? This is outrageous!
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I apologize if I’ve offended you. It’s simply a standard part of the assessment. Let's just say... no new partners recently?
PATIENT: I have no partners, doctor. Recent or otherwise. I am single, and have been for… a considerable time. And frankly, I fail to see how my personal life is relevant to a simple discharge. I have always maintained my… principles. And to even ask… it’s a disgrace! I think I’ve answered quite enough personal questions for one day. Perhaps you should focus on the actual problem and less on my… private affairs.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just move on then. Have you tried anything to treat it yourself?
PATIENT: Well, I did try a bit of chamomile tea. My grandmother always said chamomile is good for… everything. But it didn’t seem to make much difference. And I’ve been… rather diligent with my hygiene, naturally. Everything is very clean. But this… this persists. It’s quite frustrating. I really thought a good wash would take care of it. I'm starting to think I need something stronger. Something a doctor prescribes. That’s why I came here, after all. Not to be interrogated about my personal life.
DOCTOR: Chamomile… Alright. Well, let’s take a look. If you don't mind. I'll need to do a quick exam.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But please be quick, doctor. And… discreet. This is most unpleasant, you know. And I have a garden party to plan. Though, at this rate… Do let me know if you need anything… further. But I truly hope this won't take long.
DOCTOR: If you could lie down on the table, that would be great. I'll just take a quick look. Please let me know if anything is uncomfortable. And I assure you, I'll be as quick and discreet as possible.
PATIENT: Very well. But please… be gentle. And do hurry. This is most… undignified. Get on with it, then. I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some mild redness. No obvious sores or blisters. Discharge is yellowish, as you described. It doesn’t have a particularly foul odor, thankfully. It’s difficult to say exactly what it is without further testing. It could be a simple bacterial vaginosis, or a yeast infection. But to be sure, I'd like to send a sample to the lab. It's a quick and painless procedure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A sample? Yes, yes, that sounds… reasonable. As long as it’s quick and painless, as you say. I haven’t got time for anything complicated, you know. A garden party awaits. Will it be… uncomfortable? And will it take long to get the results? I really need to know soon, so I can… make arrangements. Perhaps cancel the party altogether, if necessary. Just get it over with, then. The sooner it’s done, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. It will be a quick swab, just a few seconds. You may feel a slight pressure. It should take about three to five business days to get the results back. I’ll call you as soon as they are in. Alright, that’s all done. I’ll send the sample to the lab now. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding douching or using any scented feminine products. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I felt that. Not pleasant. No douching, no scented products… I always use plain soap and water. I’m a very sensible woman, you know. Three to five business days? That’s an awfully long time! What if it’s something… serious? You’ll call, you said? As soon as you know? Do make sure you do, doctor. I need to know what I’m dealing with. This is causing me a great deal of stress, you know. A garden party is at stake!
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll call you as soon as the results are in. It’s likely just a minor infection, nothing to worry about. But we need to rule out anything more serious, which is why we’re doing the test. In the meantime, try not to stress. Worrying won’t help. I’ll also prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic, just in case. It’s better to be safe than sorry. This should cover most common bacterial infections. Take it as directed, even if you start feeling better. Here you go. Any questions?
PATIENT: A broad-spectrum antibiotic… Is that… safe? I don’t like taking unnecessary medication, you know. My grandmother always said antibiotics are bad for your system. And what if it isn’t a bacterial infection? Will the antibiotic be harmful then? And what if it’s something… worse? Something… serious? You said it’s likely just a minor infection, but… are you sure? Really sure? A garden party is at stake, doctor! And my reputation!
DOCTOR: Look, it’s a precautionary measure. The antibiotic covers a wide range of infections, and it's unlikely to cause any serious side effects. If it turns out you don’t need it, your body will simply excrete it. Worrying about it won't change anything. The best thing you can do is to wait for the results and follow my instructions. I've done all I can for now. I'll call you as soon as the lab results are in. Any other questions?
PATIENT: No… no, I suppose not. Just… please call as soon as you can, doctor. Really. A garden party… and my reputation… depend on it. Very well. Thank you… I think. I’ll be waiting for your call.
