DOCTOR: Right. Nixon Kreckel, 18 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Well, my left leg is quite swollen. It’s been getting bigger for a few days now, and it’s a bit uncomfortable. I… I have a heart thing, the doctor told me about it before. Something about it not beating right? Atrial… something? I forget the full name.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, likely. It’s… common. And the leg swelling?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Atrial fibrillation. It’s… well, it just feels like a flutter sometimes. And the swelling… it’s mostly in my calf, I think. It feels tight, and it looks bigger than my other leg, of course. It doesn’t hurt badly, but it’s not comfortable when I walk.
DOCTOR: Right. So, leg swelling, primarily in the calf, associated with a history of atrial fibrillation. Any recent trauma to the leg?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I haven’t bumped it or anything. I’ve just been… normal, I suppose. Going to work, and… well, just usual things. I don’t think I’ve done anything to cause it.
DOCTOR: And you said this started a few days ago?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Maybe three or four days now? It was just a little bit bigger at first, and then it just… kept growing. It’s not painful, exactly, but it feels… heavy. And a bit warm, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Warm, you say. Alright. Let's have a look at it. If you could just sit on the examination table for me.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Here we are. Do you need me to… lift my leg up or anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, if you could extend your leg for me. I'll need to palpate it and check for any tenderness or other abnormalities. And I’ll measure the circumference, just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Is this alright? Just let me know if I need to do anything different. It feels a bit silly, lying here with just one leg out.
DOCTOR: There's mild pitting edema present, and some warmth to the touch. No obvious signs of injury. Circumference is… 38 centimeters on the left calf, and 34 centimeters on the right. So, a 4-centimeter difference. We’ll need to consider a few things. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, four centimeters… that sounds like a lot. No, I don’t take any regular medications, no. The doctor… the one who told me about my heart… he didn’t give me anything to take every day. Just told me to… watch for things, I think. It was a while ago now.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications. Any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat… well, most things. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I've never had a problem with food or anything.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a bit tricky. My mum… she had some heart trouble, I think. Something about needing a pacemaker when she was older. And my grandfather… he had high blood pressure, I think. But I’m not really sure of the details. We don’t really talk about health much, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history of heart trouble and hypertension. And… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, none of those. I don't smoke, I very rarely drink, and I certainly don’t take drugs. I work at the school, you see. It wouldn’t be appropriate.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no drug use. And you work at the school. Okay. Given your history of atrial fibrillation and the unilateral leg swelling, we need to rule out a few things. I’m suspecting a possible deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. It's important to take this seriously. We’ll need to order a Doppler ultrasound to assess the blood flow in your leg.
PATIENT: Oh… a DVT? That sounds… bad. A Doppler ultrasound? What does that… involve? And is it… serious? I’m getting a bit worried now. I don’t want anything to be too serious.
DOCTOR: It can be serious if left untreated. The ultrasound is non-invasive; a technician will simply apply a gel to your leg and use a probe to create images of the veins. It doesn't hurt. It’s just to see if there’s a clot. I’ll write you a referral to the imaging center. They should be able to get you in today. And I’m going to order a D-dimer blood test as well, just for further evaluation. I want to rule this out quickly. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Non-invasive is good. A blood test too… So, if it is a clot… what happens then? And will the school… will I need to take time off work? I have responsibilities, you see. I teach the little ones. They need me.
DOCTOR: If it is a clot, you may require anticoagulation therapy – blood thinners – to prevent it from growing and causing further complications. The duration of treatment depends on the cause of the clot. As for work, that will depend on the severity and your response to treatment. I'll need to see the ultrasound results first. I'm writing a note for your school indicating a possible medical issue requiring evaluation. They will need to understand I cannot fully assess the situation without the imaging results. Do you have insurance to cover these tests?
PATIENT: Oh… blood thinners… that sounds… scary. And time off work… no, I don’t have insurance. I… I haven’t been able to afford it. That’s why I didn’t mention it earlier. Will it be very expensive? I don’t have much money saved. I really need to keep my job.
DOCTOR: Alright. Unfortunately, without insurance, the costs can be significant. I'll have my staff look into potential financial assistance programs for you. In the meantime, I'll order the tests, and we’ll discuss options once we have the results. It’s important to get this evaluated, regardless of the cost. I can't provide specific cost estimates, but my staff can direct you to resources. I'll also recommend you discuss this situation with the school administration immediately. They may be able to offer some support. Do you have any further questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Financial assistance… that would be very helpful. And I will talk to the school. I think… I think that’s all for now. Thank you for… trying to help. I’m just very worried. It just feels… wrong. .
DOCTOR: Alright. My staff will be in touch regarding the referral and financial assistance. Get the ultrasound done as soon as possible. I’ll see you when we have the results. .
