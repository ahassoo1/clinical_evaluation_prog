DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this pain in my side again, mostly on my left. And…I seem to be getting urinary tract infections quite often now. It’s been happening for a while, and it’s getting a bit tiresome, to be honest. I believe the last time I was here, we talked about my kidneys…something about cysts?
DOCTOR: Yes, I recall. Kidney cysts, right. And this pain…on the left side specifically. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm…it's not a sharp pain, not usually. More of a dull ache, a pressure, really. It comes and goes, but when it is there, it’s…uncomfortable. It doesn’t radiate, it stays right around there, on my left side. Sometimes, it feels a bit worse after I eat. Not always, though. And with the infections…well, they just feel like the usual burning and needing to go all the time. It's just… frequent, you see.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, localized to the left side, sometimes worse after eating. And these urinary tract infections…how frequently are we talking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I’d say, on average, every two or three months, maybe? It feels like it's getting closer to every month now, though. It's a bit difficult to keep track exactly, but it’s definitely more often than it used to be. My daughter, she helps me remember sometimes. It’s… inconvenient, and a bit worrying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Every two to three months, possibly trending closer to monthly…That is frequent, Mr. Espinueva. Now, let’s go through some other things. Do you have any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or any blood in your urine with these infections?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills, Doctor. I haven't been sick to my stomach, no vomiting. And thankfully, no blood in my urine, not that I’ve noticed. Just the burning and the constant urge to go. It’s more…irritation, I suppose, than anything else. Although, I do feel a bit tired, generally. But that could just be my age, you see. I'm not as spry as I once was.
DOCTOR: No fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or hematuria, just dysuria and frequency. Fatigue, possibly age-related. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in… my bowel habits? Hmm. Well… now that you mention it, I suppose they've been a little… irregular lately. Not a big change, mind you. Just not as regular as they used to be. A bit more…constipation, perhaps. Nothing severe, but noticeable. I drink plenty of water, though. I always have.
DOCTOR: Irregular bowel habits, some constipation… Alright. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides the kidney cysts we discussed?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on some medicine for it, and it seems to be under control now. And my knees… they give me trouble sometimes, arthritis, you know. Nothing major. Oh, and I was diagnosed with diabetes a few years back, but it’s managed with diet and a little pill each morning. That's about it, I believe.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, controlled with medication. Osteoarthritis. Diabetes, managed with diet and medication. And are you currently taking any other medications besides those for your blood pressure and diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me see… Just a little something for my knees when they really bother me, a pain reliever. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. I don’t take it every day, just when I need to. And sometimes, a mild laxative for the constipation, but not often. That's it, I'm pretty sure. I try not to take too many pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. Years ago, when I was much younger, I had my appendix taken out. And… oh yes! I had a hernia operation a long time back as well. But that was… well, decades ago. That’s about it, I think. Nothing recent, certainly.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy, hernia repair… decades ago. And finally, Mr. Espinueva, any family history of kidney problems, urinary tract issues, or diabetes?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. My mother… she had diabetes, yes. And my older brother, he had problems with his kidneys later in life, though I don’t know exactly what. It wasn’t cysts, I don’t believe. He just… wasn’t well. And my sister, she had frequent urinary tract infections, like me, when she got older. But that's about all I can remember, to be honest. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about these things as much back then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Thank you for that thorough history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination. We'll start with listening to your abdomen and checking for tenderness. Then I’ll check your vitals. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Go ahead, please. I’m ready when you are. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, that’s alright there, Doctor. A little pressure, but no real discomfort. Oh… yes, there. That’s a bit tender. Not painful, but… I can feel it. Right about here, on my left side. It's the same area where the ache is usually.
DOCTOR: Yes, I detect some tenderness there as well. Not acute, but certainly present. Blood pressure is 140/85. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I'd like to order a urinalysis and a complete blood count to get a better understanding of what's going on. Given your history of frequent UTIs, I also want to order a renal ultrasound to reassess the kidney cysts and look for any other abnormalities. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable. Whatever you think is best. A urinalysis, blood work, and that scan… yes, please. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this. I just want to feel better. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. I've ordered the tests. The lab will draw the blood now, and the ultrasound can be scheduled for later this week. We’ll get the results as quickly as possible. Based on your history and the exam, I’m suspecting a possible recurrent UTI, but the ultrasound is important to rule out any complications or changes in the kidney structure. I also want to discuss some preventative measures while we wait for the results, such as increased fluid intake and ensuring complete bladder emptying with each urination. We can review those in detail once we have the test results. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Increased water, empty the bladder… yes, I can manage that. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and doing all the tests. I feel a bit more reassured now. Thank you again.
