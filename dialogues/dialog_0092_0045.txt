DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, I’ve been getting…flushed. Like, my face gets really red. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Not sure exactly when. It just…happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. You mentioned your face gets really red, and this started a few weeks ago. Can you describe when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm…when it happens…that’s a good question. It doesn’t seem to be after eating anything special. And not after being out in the sun, either. Sometimes when I talk to people…but not always. It’s very strange. I don’t know why it happens. It just…does. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mr. Withycombe. It sounds a bit unpredictable. When you say “when you talk to people,” can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate…you mean, like, what kind of people? It’s…hard to say. Sometimes it's just the cashier at the store. Other times, it's…well, people I know better. Like, if I have to…talk about something important. Not always, though. It's just…sometimes. I'm not sure what triggers it, Doctor. It’s very embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite frustrating and understandably embarrassing. So, it seems to be more associated with social interaction, particularly when you're feeling a bit stressed or discussing something important, but it isn’t consistent. To help me get a clearer picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the flushing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me see… No, not really. I don’t feel hot. No sweating. No…heart racing. Nothing like that. Just…red face. And sometimes…a little bit of worry before it happens, I guess. But that's probably because I know my face will turn red. It’s a circle, you know? It worries me, then it happens, then I worry more.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. That sounds like a difficult cycle. No fever, no palpitations, no sweating – that’s helpful to know. Let’s move on to a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any current medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Not really. I was…sad for a long time after my wife passed. I talked to someone about it. For a while. But nothing…nothing the doctor ever gave me a name for. Just…sadness. I’m feeling better now, mostly. I take care of myself. Eat okay. Try to walk a little. That's all. No pills. No regular doctor visits.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. It takes a great deal of strength to cope with such a loss, and it's good to hear you're focusing on your well-being. Okay, so no current diagnosed medical conditions, and you haven’t been taking any medications regularly. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Hmm…let me see. When I was a little boy, I had my tonsils out. A very long time ago. And…once, I fell and broke my arm. But that was also when I was young. Other than that…no. Never been in the hospital for anything serious. Just…that little bit. A long, long time ago. Nothing recent. I promise.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and a broken arm in childhood – that’s good to know. No recent surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, can you tell me a bit about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family history…? That’s…difficult. My wife’s family, I knew a little bit. Her mother had…problems with her heart. But my family…they all lived in India. I haven’t seen them in many, many years. We don’t talk much. I don’t know if anyone had…problems. It’s been so long. I wish I knew more. But I don’t.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Withycombe. It’s not always easy to have access to that information, especially with family living far away. No significant known family history, then. Just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No, not that I know of. I eat everything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Sometimes…my skin gets a little itchy when I wear wool. But that’s just itchy skin. Not…a real allergy. I don't take any allergy medicine. Never have. I’m a pretty simple man, Doctor. Not much bothers me. Just…this red face.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. So, to summarize, you've been experiencing facial flushing for a few weeks, seemingly triggered sometimes by social interaction, with no other associated symptoms like fever or palpitations. You have no known medical conditions, take no medications, have had a tonsillectomy and a broken arm in childhood, limited knowledge of family medical history, and no known allergies. I see here that your weight is 121 pounds and your height is 167 centimeters. It also indicates you are uninsured. Would you mind if I performed a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: No, go ahead. That’s fine. A physical examination…that sounds good. I trust your judgment, Doctor. And yes, I am uninsured. That’s why I…put it off for so long. I’m hoping it’s nothing serious. Please, go ahead. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Both your blood pressure and pulse are within a normal range. Your heart sounds are regular and lungs are clear. I’m observing some mild redness to your cheeks and forehead. There's no rash or visible skin irritation. Your lymph nodes are not enlarged. Your ears, nose, and throat appear normal. Everything seems within normal limits on the initial examination, Mr. Withycombe. However, to rule out any underlying causes for your flushing, I’d like to order some basic blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… That sounds…expensive. But if you think it’s necessary, then yes. Please, do what you need to do. I just…I don’t have a lot of money, Doctor. Can we talk about the cost? Will my insurance…or lack of it…be a problem? I want to get better, but I also have to be careful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Withycombe. Cost is a very important factor, and I want to be as transparent as possible. Since you are uninsured, we can discuss options for reduced-cost testing at a local laboratory. The tests I'm considering are a complete blood count to check for any underlying inflammation or infection, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level to rule out thyroid issues, which can sometimes cause flushing. These tests typically cost around \$100-\$150 total if we utilize the reduced-cost lab. We can also explore potential financial assistance programs available through the clinic and local health services. Would you like me to provide you with information about these options?
PATIENT: \$100-\$150… Yes, please. Information about those options would be very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. I really appreciate that. It’s…a weight off my shoulders, knowing it's not thousands of dollars. Please, tell me everything I need to know. And thank you for being so understanding. I just want to know if it’s something serious. That’s all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I'm happy to help in any way I can. Here is information about the clinic’s financial assistance program and a list of local laboratories that offer reduced-cost testing. The list also includes contact information. We can also request a discount directly from the lab if you pay in cash. In the meantime, while we await the results of the blood tests, I recommend avoiding potential triggers like stressful situations if possible. Since you’ve described the flushing happening during conversations, practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises may be beneficial. Do you have any questions about this information?
PATIENT: Relaxation techniques… Deep breathing… I suppose I can try that. I used to do that when I was younger. It’s been a long time. The papers are a little…small. But I can read them. Thank you. Will the tests take long? And…what happens if they do find something? What are the possible things it could be? I know I’m asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Mr. Withycombe. It’s important to be informed and understand what’s going on. The blood tests typically take 24-48 hours for the results to come back. As for possible causes, the tests will help rule out a few things. The complete blood count will check for any infection or inflammation that could be causing the flushing. The thyroid test will check if your thyroid gland is functioning properly, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause similar symptoms. Other potential, less common causes we would consider if the tests are normal include rosacea – a skin condition that causes redness and visible blood vessels – or, rarely, a condition called carcinoid syndrome, which involves hormone-releasing tumors. However, given your description and lack of other symptoms, those are less likely. It’s important to remember that most likely, the tests will be normal, and we can then focus on strategies to manage the flushing, like identifying and avoiding triggers. If anything concerning is found, we will discuss the results in detail, explain the next steps, and refer you to a specialist if necessary. I will be here to guide you through the process.
PATIENT: Rosacea… I think I’ve heard of that. So, it might just be something on my skin? That would be…good. I’m glad you’re being thorough, Doctor. It’s scary, not knowing. Okay. I’ll try to relax and…wait for the tests. And I’ll try the deep breathing. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should avoid, besides stressful situations? Any foods or drinks? Should I be wearing sunscreen?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. It’s good to hear you’re feeling a little more reassured. In the meantime, while we await the results, I recommend a few things. Avoid excessive sun exposure and wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher when outdoors, even on cloudy days. Spicy foods and alcohol can sometimes trigger flushing in some individuals, so you may want to limit those as well. Gentle skincare is also important. Avoid harsh soaps, scrubs, and products with strong fragrances. A simple, fragrance-free moisturizer can help keep your skin hydrated. Other than that, just continue to monitor your symptoms and let me know if anything changes or worsens. We'll take it one step at a time, Mr. Withycombe. And remember, I'm here to support you throughout the process. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll try to follow your advice and…wait for the tests. Thank you again for everything. I really appreciate your time and patience. I guess…I’ll see you when the results come back.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
