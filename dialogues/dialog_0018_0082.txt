DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Uh... travel. I need... something for travel. My wife... she would always do this. Make sure everything was okay. Now... I gotta do it. It’s... important.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tayar. It sounds like you’re preparing for a trip and want to ensure you're medically fit to travel. That’s very responsible of you. To best assist you, could you tell me a little more about your travel plans?
PATIENT: Plans? Uh... not many. Just… going back. Back to Nepal. Where I’m from. I haven’t been in… a long time. It’s… complicated. I don’t remember exactly where I’m going, just… the mountains. And… it's hot there now, right? Not cold? My wife… she always checked the weather.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Tayar. It sounds like you’re returning to Nepal after some time away. That’s wonderful. And it's perfectly alright if the details are a bit hazy; we can work through everything. You are correct, it is currently the monsoon season in Nepal, so it will be quite warm and humid with periods of heavy rainfall in many areas. To help me assess your needs for travel, could you tell me about any health concerns you have currently?
PATIENT: Health... huh. I... feel okay, I guess. Old aches, you know? Like everyone. Nothing… special. Except… my stomach. Sometimes it gets… upset. Especially when I eat things I shouldn't. But that happens all the time. Not a big deal. My wife… she had pills for that. But I don’t… remember what they were. Just... little white ones. Probably.
DOCTOR: I see. You’ve mentioned some general aches and pains, and occasional stomach upset, particularly with certain foods. It's good you're aware of what triggers it. And it's understandable you’re having difficulty recalling specifics. Just to clarify, when you say "upset," could you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Like... bad. You eat something and then… everything hurts. And you gotta… run to the bathroom. A lot. It’s… not fun. Usually it goes away on its own. I just… try not to eat spicy things. My wife… she said I shouldn’t. She knew everything. It’s been… a while since it happened bad. Mostly just a little… rumble. But going to Nepal… feels different. I don’t want it to be bad there.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Tayar. It’s wise to be prepared, especially when traveling to a different environment. It sounds like you’re describing symptoms of food intolerance or perhaps traveler’s diarrhea. To get a better understanding, have you noticed any specific foods that consistently trigger these symptoms?
PATIENT: Specific...? No. Not really. Everything is kinda the same. Lots of rice. Maybe… the street food. My wife… she didn’t like me eating street food. Said it wasn’t clean. I liked it, though. Good flavors. But… yeah, maybe that. I don't know. It's just… food. I eat. Sometimes it's okay. Sometimes it's not. It’s not like I can avoid all food, right?
DOCTOR: No, of course not, Mr. Tayar. You shouldn’t have to avoid all food. It’s helpful to know that it may be related to street food. To help me assess your overall health for travel, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have, or any medications you currently take?
PATIENT: Medications... uh... no. Not really. Except… the blood pressure pills. I think. The little red ones. The doctor… back home… gave them to me. Said my blood pressure was… high. But I haven’t taken them in… a long time. I forgot. And they didn’t… seem to do much anyway. My wife… she managed all that stuff. Reminders and… everything. Now I just… try to eat less salt. Does that count?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re trying to manage your salt intake. However, stopping blood pressure medication without a doctor’s guidance can be risky. Do you know when you last had your blood pressure checked?
PATIENT: Checked…? Hmm. A long time ago. Before… well, before everything. Maybe… a year? More? I don’t really… remember. I don’t feel… bad. I get tired sometimes, but everyone gets tired, right? My wife… she always said I needed to rest more. But I was busy. Now… I don’t really do much. It's kinda quiet. You think I should get it checked? I don't want to bother anyone. It's probably fine.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, it’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, and you’re not bothering anyone at all. Given that you were previously prescribed medication for high blood pressure, and haven’t had it checked recently, it would be very prudent to have it assessed before your travel. We can easily check it here today. Would you be comfortable with me taking your blood pressure now?
PATIENT: Yeah... okay. If you think it’s important. I don’t really care, to be honest. Just… do what you think is best. It’s… probably fine. But okay. Do it. I just… hope it doesn’t take long. I have… things to do. Not many, but… things.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Tayar. It will only take a few minutes. I understand you have things to attend to, and I’ll be as efficient as possible. Just relax your arm, please, and take a few deep breaths. This cuff will inflate briefly, and I’ll listen with the stethoscope. No need to worry.
PATIENT: Okay... I think I'm relaxed. Sort of. It's kinda tight. My wife... she was always good at this. Made it easy. I don't like doctors. Too many… things. Just tell me if it's bad, okay? Don't bother with all the fancy words. Just... bad or not bad.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, your blood pressure is elevated. It’s significantly higher than the recommended range. While I understand you prefer a straightforward answer, it is important to explain this further. Your blood pressure reading is 160/95 mmHg. A normal reading is generally considered to be below 120/80 mmHg. This means your heart is working harder than it should to pump blood through your body. This can increase your risk of serious health problems, such as heart attack or stroke. Given this reading, traveling at this time could be risky. We need to address this before you go. Do you have any discomfort currently, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache?
PATIENT: 160...? That sounds... bad. Like really bad. No, I don't feel anything... right now. Just... tired. Always tired. My wife... she always said I needed to slow down. But I couldn't. I had things to do. Now... I don't. What does that mean, though? I need to go. I have to go. Family... waiting. Can't just... stay here. What can you do? Quick, okay? I don’t want to be stuck here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand your need to travel and the importance of seeing your family. However, traveling with uncontrolled high blood pressure could be dangerous. A sudden change in altitude, stress, or limited access to medical care could lead to a serious health crisis. The safest course of action would be to stabilize your blood pressure before you go. We can start with medication to lower it, and I would recommend a cardiac evaluation to rule out any underlying heart problems. Given your urgency, we can explore options for expedited testing and treatment. However, I strongly advise against traveling until your blood pressure is under control. Would you be open to discussing these options further?
PATIENT: Medication…? More pills…? I don’t… I don’t want more pills. My wife… she always said they have side effects. And cardiac evaluation…? That sounds… complicated. Expensive. I don’t have much money. And time… I need to go now. Family… they’re expecting me. They don't understand… the pills, the doctors… Just tell me… can I go? If I… if I just promise to be careful? Eat less salt? Rest more? Is that enough? Please… just tell me if it’s okay.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand your reluctance and your desire to see your family. It’s completely valid to feel overwhelmed by the thought of more medication and testing. However, as your doctor, I have a responsibility to advise you on what is medically safe. Promising to be careful and eating less salt, while helpful, are not enough to address this level of high blood pressure. Traveling with uncontrolled hypertension could lead to stroke, heart attack, or kidney failure. Those are serious risks. I want to help you get to Nepal safely. We can discuss options for affordable testing and explore medication with minimal side effects. I can also help you connect with resources to assist with costs. But, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend that you travel at this time. Would you be open to starting a low dose of medication, and scheduling a quick cardiac evaluation?
PATIENT: ...Low dose…? You promise it won't… make me sick? I’ve heard stories… about side effects. And the cardiac evaluation… how long will that take? I don't have much time. Family… they’re worried. They think I’m… not well. I don’t want to worry them more. Just… how long? If I do the evaluation, and take the pills… how long before I can go? Be honest. Please. I need to know. I just… want to see them. That's all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand your anxiety and your desire for a clear timeline. I promise to be completely honest with you. A low dose of medication may have some mild side effects, such as dizziness or fatigue, but those are usually temporary and manageable. We’ll start with the lowest effective dose and monitor you closely. A quick cardiac evaluation, including an EKG, blood tests, and a consultation with a cardiologist, can typically be completed within 3-5 business days. The cardiologist will review the results and determine if any further testing is needed. If everything is stable, and your blood pressure responds to medication, you could potentially be cleared for travel within one week, perhaps a little longer depending on the cardiologist’s recommendations. I will personally expedite all the referrals and testing to make this happen as quickly as possible. Would you be willing to proceed with that plan?
PATIENT: …One week…? Okay. One week is… better than nothing. I guess. But you promise you’ll make it fast? I don’t want to keep them waiting. They… they’ve been through a lot. Okay. One week. Do what you need to do. Pills… evaluation… whatever. Just… make it fast. And… keep me comfortable. I don’t like feeling sick. And… don’t bother me with too many fancy words, okay? Just tell me what I need to do. Thank you. I think.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tayar. I understand your concerns, and I promise to do everything I can to make this process as smooth and comfortable as possible. I will personally oversee your care and keep you informed every step of the way, using plain language. Let’s start by getting you a prescription for a low dose of Lisinopril, a common blood pressure medication. I'll also schedule you an appointment with a cardiologist for tomorrow morning. I will have the nurse come in shortly to take your vitals and discuss the medication instructions with you. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Lisinopril…? No. No questions. Just… the pills. And the appointment. Tomorrow…? Okay. Will… will the pills make me tired? I need to… be strong. For my family. I want to be able to… help them. That's all. No more questions. Just… please… make it fast. And keep me comfortable.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, Lisinopril can sometimes cause mild fatigue in some patients, but it's usually temporary and subsides as your body adjusts to the medication. We'll start with a low dose to minimize any potential side effects. If you do experience significant fatigue, please let me know immediately, and we can adjust the dosage or explore other options. I understand your desire to be strong for your family, and I will do everything I can to ensure you feel comfortable and prepared for your trip. I'll have the nurse come in now to review the medication instructions and schedule your cardiology appointment. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time before she arrives?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Just… the pills. And the appointment. Thank you. Thank you… for helping me. I… I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tayar. We’re here to help. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions at all.
