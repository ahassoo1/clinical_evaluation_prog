DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning, Doctor. It’s… my tummy. It feels… big. And I don’t want to eat so much anymore. Not like I used to. It just… doesn’t feel right. It’s been like this for… a little while now, I think. Maybe weeks? It’s hard to remember, you know.
DOCTOR: Weeks, alright. And you say it feels big. Can you describe that sensation?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not painful, not exactly. Just… full. Like I ate a very big dinner, but I didn’t. And… hard, maybe? A little bit. I don’t know. It’s… different. I used to be so small, you know? I worked with… people, a long time ago. Studying them. It’s all a little foggy now.
DOCTOR: You mentioned studying people?
PATIENT: Oh yes… Sociologists, that’s what they called us. I traveled a lot, talked to lots of folks. Different… groups, different places. It was… interesting work. But that was a long time ago. Before… well, before everything. It doesn't matter now, does it? My tummy is what feels bad.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know your background, Ms. McConnon, but you’re right, we need to focus on your abdomen. So, this fullness… does anything relieve it?
PATIENT: Relieve it…? Hmm… not really. Maybe… when I lie down? A little bit. But not much. And sometimes… a little walking helps. But then it comes back. I… I don’t know what helps, really. I try different things. I used to have a little garden, you know. That always made me feel better. But I can’t do that anymore. Too much bending.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh dear. That’s… a personal question, isn’t it? Well… not really. Everything feels… slow, maybe? I haven't been… going as much. And when I do… it’s not like it used to be. Harder, you know? I don’t… I don’t know what the right words are. Is something wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s important to be thorough, Ms. McConnon. And yes, that could be relevant. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Blood…? No! No, I don’t think so. I haven’t… I haven’t looked, really. It scares me to think about. I just… I don’t feel good. My tummy is big, I don’t eat much, and now you’re asking about blood… Is it something serious, Doctor? Will I be alright?
DOCTOR: Ms. McConnon, it's good you're telling me all this. We need to rule out several possibilities. I’m going to need to perform a physical exam. That includes listening to your abdomen and gently pressing on it to check for tenderness or anything unusual. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Yes… yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. But please be gentle, Doctor. It’s… sensitive. And don't mind if I flinch. I haven't been feeling like myself lately. What are you looking for? Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: I’m listening for any unusual sounds, and I'll be feeling for any masses or areas of discomfort. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is bad, Ms. McConnon. It's simply part of the process of gathering information. Now, if you could lie back for me, please. And please let me know if anything feels painful. I’m noting some mild distension and resistance in the lower abdomen. No acute tenderness to palpation at this time. Your bowel sounds are… diminished. Alright. I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel, and a stool test to check for occult blood. Also, given your age and symptoms, I think a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis would be prudent to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… blood work… a stool test… and a… CT scan? That sounds… serious, Doctor. What are you looking for? Is it cancer? My friend… my friend Elsie… she had cancer. It was… very bad. I don’t want a scan… I don’t want to know if it’s something terrible. I just want my tummy to feel better. Do you think… do you think it could be something simple?
DOCTOR: Ms. McConnon, I understand your anxiety, but we need to be realistic. I'm not going to speculate. These tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. It could be something simple, or it could be something more serious. Without proper investigation, we simply don’t know. The stool test will check for bleeding, the blood work assesses your overall health, and the CT scan provides detailed images of your abdominal organs. I’m ordering these tests to rule things out, not to confirm a diagnosis. And frankly, delaying these tests will only make things worse if it is something serious. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s necessary… Yes. Yes, I consent. But… will it hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? And… what if it is something bad? Will you… will you tell me everything? Even if it’s… difficult? I don't have family... I just want to know what's happening.
DOCTOR: The blood work will require a small sample, taken from your arm. It shouldn't be painful, just a brief pinch. The stool test is a simple collection; the lab will provide instructions. The CT scan is non-invasive; you’ll lie on a table while the machine takes images. It's a little noisy, but it won't hurt. As for the results, it typically takes 24-48 hours for the blood work and stool test to come back. The CT scan usually takes a little longer, perhaps 3-5 business days, as it needs to be reviewed by a radiologist. I will personally review all the results with you, Ms. McConnon. I understand you don't have family, and I assure you I will explain everything clearly, regardless of the findings. We will discuss all your options, and I will support you every step of the way. The lab is just down the hall, and they can draw your blood immediately. I’ll have the front desk schedule your CT scan for the earliest available appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… good. Thank you, Doctor. No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you for being patient with me. It’s… hard to remember things sometimes. And I get scared easily. I suppose I should go get my blood drawn then? Do you think… do you think I should bring a book? To read while I wait?
DOCTOR: A book is a perfectly acceptable idea, Ms. McConnon. Yes, bring a book. And please don’t hesitate to ask the lab technicians if you have any questions. They're very helpful. And remember, we’re doing this to get you answers. We will figure this out. The lab is just through that door on your left. I'll see you when you return.
