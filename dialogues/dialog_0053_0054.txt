DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Tati, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Rayshon. Just Rayshon is okay. I think… it’s been a while since I’ve been to a doctor, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well. That’s… common. So, what brings you in today, Rayshon?
PATIENT: Ugh, this cough. It… it just won’t go away. And I'm always tired. Like, really tired. And my nose… it gets stuffy and bad, a lot. It feels like a cold that never ends, you know? Maybe a few times a year it gets really bad.
DOCTOR: Right. A persistent cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion… for how long now have you been experiencing this, generally?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time. Honestly, I don’t really keep track. Maybe… a year? More? It comes and goes, but it’s always there, kinda. I don’t know. It’s hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: A year or more… That is a while. And you said it comes and goes, but it’s always there… Is it worse at certain times of the year?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. Maybe… when it’s really hot, or really cold? It feels worse then. And when it rains a lot, too. But honestly, it’s just… always a little bit bad. I just try to ignore it.
DOCTOR: Ignoring things only makes them worse, unfortunately. Do you have any fever, chills, or night sweats with this cough?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes, I think. Not a high one, just… warm. Not really chills, no. And… night sweats? I don’t know what that means? Do you mean… like, I sweat when I sleep? Everyone sweats when they sleep, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, everyone sweats when they sleep, but excessive sweating, soaking your sheets… That's what I meant. Never mind. So, no excessive night sweats. Any shortness of breath, or wheezing when you breathe?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get… out of breath sometimes, when I'm carrying heavy tires at work, but that's just because they're heavy! Not from the cough, I think. And… wheezing? What's that sound like?
DOCTOR: Wheezing is a whistling sound when you breathe. It indicates narrowing of the airways. Okay. Let’s move on. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. I don’t think so. I mean, I work with tires all day, so maybe to rubber? Sometimes my skin gets itchy, but I just thought that was from the dirt and stuff. I don’t get… sneezing or anything, like in the movies.
DOCTOR: The “movies” are rarely a reliable source of medical information, Rayshon. Itching could be an allergic reaction, but let's not jump to conclusions. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing. I don’t really like taking pills. I just drink a lot of water and try to rest when I can. My wife sometimes gives me some herbal tea when I'm really bad, but that's it.
DOCTOR: Right. No medications, just herbal tea. And your wife... is she also your primary caregiver?
PATIENT: Yeah, my wife, Aishah. She takes care of me when I’m sick. She’s a good woman. She worries a lot, though. She tells me I should come to the doctor more often.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s get a quick physical exam done. I need to listen to your lungs and check your vitals. Please sit back and relax. And try not to move around too much.
PATIENT: Okay, sir. Sounds good. I don't like doctors much, you know? But I trust you.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and out… again… alright. Sounds a little congested, as expected. Now I'm going to check your heart rate and blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Heart rate is normal. Now, open your mouth… let me take a look at your throat. Throat’s a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Alright. That's enough for now.
PATIENT: Okay. Is it bad? My lungs? You said something about my blood pressure… Is that… serious? I don't really understand all this doctor talk.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Tati. Your lungs are congested, which explains the cough. The elevated blood pressure isn't ideal, but it’s not immediately life-threatening. It just means we need to monitor it and make some lifestyle adjustments. Frankly, it’s probably a combination of factors – diet, stress, lack of exercise… and likely prolonged exposure to whatever irritants you encounter at work. We’ll need to run some tests to rule out anything more serious – a chest X-ray to get a clearer look at your lungs, and some blood work to check for underlying inflammation and allergies. Do you have insurance?
PATIENT: Insurance…? No, sir. I don’t have insurance. We can’t really afford it. The X-ray… and blood work… is it… expensive? My wife, she works very hard, but…
DOCTOR: Yes, unfortunately, it is. A chest X-ray is roughly $200, and the blood work will be another $150 or so. We can discuss a payment plan with the clinic, but… it won’t be cheap. Look, I'm not going to pretend this is ideal. But ignoring this problem won’t make it go away. We need to get some answers, and that requires testing. We could start with just the chest X-ray, to see if there’s anything glaringly obvious. But without the blood work, we’re operating in the dark. Tell you what, I'll write you a referral to a specialist, Dr. Amina, who might be able to offer a more affordable payment plan. She runs a clinic that sometimes offers assistance to uninsured patients. I can’t guarantee anything, though. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A specialist… and a payment plan… that sounds… okay. I mean, anything is better than just… feeling sick all the time. Dr. Amina… I’ll write down the name. Is there anything I should tell her? About… about the herbal tea, maybe? And that I work with tires?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Tell her about the herbal tea – what kind it is, how often you drink it, and any changes you’ve noticed when you have it. And be very specific about your work environment. The type of tires you handle, the presence of any dust or fumes, how long you've been doing this job… all of it is relevant. Here. This has her contact information and the clinic address. She's quite good, and I believe she'll be able to offer you some guidance. I'll also write a brief summary of my findings for her. Here's the summary for Dr. Amina. Now, I strongly recommend you schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Ignoring this won’t make it better, Mr. Tati. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, sir. For… for explaining things. And for writing down the name of the specialist. I really appreciate it. I'll call Dr. Amina tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Good. See that you do. And Mr. Tati… try to reduce your stress levels. It will only exacerbate the problem. Next! .
PATIENT: .
