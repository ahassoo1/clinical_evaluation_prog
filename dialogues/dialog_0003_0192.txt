DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, Hartness is right. I’m here for… the army thing. The exam. Gotta get this done, you know? It’s… important. Need to be sure everything’s alright before they start yelling at me.
DOCTOR: Right. The army physical. Of course. And when did this… requirement come about, if you don't mind my asking?
PATIENT: Not sure exactly when. They just… said I needed it. July, maybe? Look, I don't spend my time reading army memos, alright? I build things. Good things. Engines, mostly. They just sent a letter. Said I gotta come get checked out. Seems like a lot of bother, honestly. They should just trust I’m in good shape. I feel fine.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. However, the military has certain standards they must adhere to, and a thorough physical examination is simply part of the process. It’s for your safety, as well as the safety of others. So, let’s try to be as efficient as possible. Can you tell me, in your own words, about any current medical issues you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Efficient is good. Look, I don’t have medical issues. None. I told you, I build engines. It keeps a man busy. Maybe a little ache in my back sometimes, from bending over, but that’s just… old age, I guess. Fifty-one years will do that to you. Not like it’s something the army needs to worry about. It's not a problem. I can still lift a good amount. Better than most of these young fellas, probably.
DOCTOR: Right. Back pain. And is this back pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly goes, if you want to know the truth. Happens if I’ve been working on a tricky one all day, bending and twisting. A bit of a stretch, maybe. But I take a hot bath, and it’s alright. Nothing special. I don’t take any pills for it. Don't believe in that stuff, honestly. Just weakness. Need to build up the muscles. That’s what my father always said.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, have you experienced any other pain anywhere else in your body?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. My knees sometimes, after a long day. Not a sharp pain, just… creaky, you know? Like an old door. Again, I just… ignore it. I’ve always been able to push through things. I used to play football, back in school. Took a few knocks, I suppose. Nothing serious enough to bother a doctor about. Look, I’m a practical man. I fix things, I don't complain about them. Is this going somewhere? I got things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Mr. Hartness. It's important to document a full medical history for these evaluations. Just a few more questions, if you'll indulge me. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? No. Never. I told you, I build things. I don’t have things. My wife, she worries a bit, tells me I should get a check-up now and then. But I always say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. And I feel perfectly fine. High blood pressure? Sounds like a fancy way of saying someone gets a little worked up sometimes. I’m a calm man. Mostly. I get frustrated with paperwork, like this. But that's it. Look, is this going to take much longer? My lunch break is almost over. I need to get back to the shop.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospital? No. Not once. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. But my father just set it himself. Splinted it with wood and some cloth. He was a practical man, like I said. Good with his hands. Didn’t need fancy doctors and hospitals. Got better just fine. Never had anything serious enough for a hospital, no. Honestly, the thought of being stuck in one of those places… gives me the shivers. Too many germs, too much waiting. I’d rather fix an engine. Any day. Look, are we nearly done? This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single one. I told you, I don't believe in that stuff. Pills are just a way for doctors to make money. My wife, she takes something for her… arthritis, I think. But I don’t bother with it. I eat a good breakfast, work hard, and that's enough. Vitamins? What do I need vitamins for? I eat plenty of food. Good, solid food. Meat and potatoes, that’s what a man needs. Look, is this all? I’m getting impatient. I got an engine to finish. A very important engine.
DOCTOR: Alright. Last question, Mr. Hartness. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything. Done everything. I'm a Swedish man, we’re built tough. Maybe a bit of hayfever in the spring, but that’s just… pollen. Doesn’t bother me much. I don’t go around sneezing and wheezing like some folks. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I've answered everything you've asked. Can we just get this over with? I need a form or something to show the army. Is that all I need? A piece of paper? Look, I'm wasting valuable time here. A very valuable time. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Hartness. I suppose we can proceed with a brief physical examination then. Please step onto the table and lie down. I will need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. And I will need to measure your height and weight. It's standard procedure, even if you feel perfectly fine. Please remove your shirt.
