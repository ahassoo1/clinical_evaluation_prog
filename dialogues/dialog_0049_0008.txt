DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolopez. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Right. Well, it’s my ear, you see. Feels… full. Like something’s blocking it. Not painful, exactly, just… there. Been like that for a bit now, I think. Honestly, time gets away from me. It's hard to say how long, exactly. A few weeks, maybe? I just wanted to get it checked.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, alright. And just to clarify, it’s only one ear that feels full, or is it both?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I believe it’s just the left one. Yes, definitely the left. The right ear seems fine. Though, to be honest, I don’t really listen to either one much these days. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. And has anything caused this feeling, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Caused it? Oh, dear. That’s a good question. Nothing springs to mind, no. I’ve been, you know, mostly just… working. The farm, mostly. No loud noises, no sudden injuries… nothing I can recall. Perhaps it just… happened? I really don't know. It's been a long time since… well, never mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the fullness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… No dizziness, no ringing… I haven’t noticed any trouble with my balance. My hearing seems… normal. Maybe a little muffled in that left ear, but I figured that was just because it feels full. No pain, like I said. Honestly, it’s just… annoying, more than anything.
DOCTOR: No dizziness, ringing, or balance issues. Just the fullness and a slight muffling of sound. Have you experienced any drainage from the ear?
PATIENT: Drainage? No, no drainage. Not that I've noticed. I… I clean my ears regularly, I think. Well, my wife used to remind me to, anyway. Sorry. Old habits. But no, no leakage or anything like that. Just the fullness. Is that… unusual?
DOCTOR: It can be. Alright. Let’s have a quick look. Could you sit up and face me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just let me know if you need me to… do anything. I’m not very good at… medical things. Honestly, I just want to get this sorted and get back to work, if possible. The haying is behind schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll see what we can see. This might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t hurt. Just relax. Hmm… Yes. I do see some cerumen buildup. Significant buildup, actually. It’s obstructing the ear canal. That’s likely the cause of the fullness. No sign of infection or anything more serious, thankfully. Your right ear looks perfectly normal.
PATIENT: Oh. Cerumen… That’s… wax, is it? I suppose I should have thought of that. My wife always took care of things like that. Sorry to bother you for nothing, then. Is it… hard to remove? Can you just… dig it out? I really do need to get back to the farm, if possible. Is there a quick fix?
DOCTOR: It is wax buildup. And while it’s not a serious condition, it does need to be addressed. We can certainly remove it. I prefer to use irrigation, it’s the safest method. It's a simple procedure, but it might feel a little strange. We'll use body-temperature water. It shouldn't take long. Do you have any allergies to soaps or anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I'm aware of. My wife did all the shopping. I mostly just… used things. No reactions to anything, as far as I recall. Irrigation… that sounds… wet. Is it messy? Because I have a long drive back and I don’t really want to be dripping all over the car. I'm really hoping it doesn’t take too long. The hay won’t bale itself, you know.
DOCTOR: It's not messy, Mr. Guerrerolopez. A small amount of water will be involved, but I will provide you with some tissues. It will only take a few minutes. And frankly, neglecting this could lead to temporary hearing loss. I assure you, this is a quicker solution than dealing with that. Let's get started then. I’ll need you to lean forward a bit…
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Just… be gentle, please. And quick. I really do appreciate you squeezing me in, Doctor. I haven’t been feeling very well lately, since… well, never mind. Just… get it done, if you can. I trust you. Just, please, be quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax. I’m using body temperature water, it might feel a little cool initially. Let me know if you feel any discomfort. Do you feel any pain or pressure at all?
PATIENT: It’s… cold. And a little strange. A bit like being underwater, I suppose. No pain, exactly… just… unsettling. And yes, a bit of pressure, but not terrible. Is it… working? I can’t really feel anything happening. I can hear a sort of… bubbling sound. Is that good? .
DOCTOR: Yes, that bubbling sound is good. It means we’re flushing out the wax. There we go. A significant amount. Alright, it looks much clearer now. I’m going to irrigate just one more time to ensure we’ve removed everything. Can you tell me if your hearing has improved at all?
