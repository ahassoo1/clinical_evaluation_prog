DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett. So, you’re here… why exactly are you here today?
PATIENT: Well, Doc, the nurse just told me somethin’ about my cholesterol bein’ high. Hyper… hyper-something, she called it. I don't rightly remember all the fancy words. But she said it wasn't good. I figured I should come see you about it. Been feelin’ alright, though, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia. It’s… elevated cholesterol. Happens to the best of us, or, well, most of us as we get older. "Feelin' alright" isn't always the whole story, you know. But alright. So, you’re 88… and you say you feel fine. Have you had this checked before?
PATIENT: No, Doc, never had it checked before. Not that I recall, anyway. I don't go to the doctor much, to be honest with you. Always been a pretty healthy fella, up until… well, now, I guess. Mostly just aches and pains like you'd expect at my age. But nothin’ serious enough to bother the doctor about. My wife, bless her heart, she always took care of all that. It’s been five years since she passed, and… well, I just haven’t kept up with it.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… unfortunate. Family history then?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother… she had a bad heart, I remember that. Always tired, couldn't walk too far. She died when I was still a young man, maybe… sixty? Sixty-five? Something like that. And my father… he lived a long life, but he had high blood pressure, I think. They always told him to watch his salt. That’s about all I know, to be honest. We didn't talk much about health back then, not really. It just wasn’t somethin’ men did, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. So, some heart trouble on the maternal side, hypertension on the paternal… typical. Any smoking, drinking, or other… habits we should discuss?
PATIENT: Well now, that's a fair question, Doc. Smoked a bit when I was young, during the war, you see. Maybe a pack a day, for a few years. Quit that… oh, sixty years ago, I’d say. And I used to enjoy a beer or two with dinner, but I haven’t touched a drop in… well, since my wife passed, like I said. Didn’t seem right, drinkin’ without her. I try to eat sensible, mostly. My daughter sends me casseroles sometimes, though… and those aren’t always the healthiest!
DOCTOR: Right. History of smoking, now quit for… a considerable time. Minimal alcohol. Casseroles… noted. Any medications you're taking, Mr. Bohnett?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis, Doc. Keeps the joints from achin’ too bad. It’s called… hmm, let me think… Naproxen, I believe. And sometimes a little cream for my skin, gets awful dry this time of year. But that’s it. Nothing for my heart, or blood pressure, or anything like that. Never needed anythin’ before.
DOCTOR: Alright. Naproxen. Okay. Look, Mr. Bohnett, let’s not get bogged down in details. You’re 88. We're going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Then we'll talk about… options. Don't expect miracles. If you'll just hop up there.
PATIENT: Sounds fair enough, Doc. Miracles ain’t somethin’ I’m expectin’ at my age! Just try not to poke around too much, alright? Old bones, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just a listen to your heart and lungs. Blood pressure, naturally. I'll check your extremities. Don’t worry, I'm not trying to cause any pain. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Blood pressure is… elevated. Not surprising. Heart sounds are… regular, but somewhat diminished. Lungs are clear. Pulses are present, but weak. Some edema in the ankles. Alright. Everything seems… consistent with your age and history. We'll need some blood work. Cholesterol levels, naturally, but also a basic metabolic panel. Just to get a full picture. The nurse will draw the samples. It’ll be a few days until we get the results. We'll go from there.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds reasonable, Doc. I’ll let the nurse poke at me, then. It’s not my favorite thing, but… I reckon I can handle it. So, you think it's just old age, then? That's what my daughter figures, anyway. She says I should be grateful I'm still kickin’ at eighty-eight!
DOCTOR: "Old age" is… a factor. It's rarely just one thing. We'll look at the numbers. If the cholesterol is significantly elevated, we'll discuss… options. Medication is often necessary, but lifestyle changes are also important. Diet, exercise… the usual. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment. Don't expect a quick fix, Mr. Bohnett. This is a long-term process. Any questions?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not really, Doc. I reckon I know what you mean about the long-term process. Been livin’ a long time, seen a few things. I just hope I can still enjoy my casseroles! Thank you for your time, Doc. I’ll let the nurse know I’m ready for the blood work. Tell your nurse I appreciate her patience, too. Old veins aren't always cooperative, you know. .
DOCTOR: Alright. See you… at your follow-up. .
