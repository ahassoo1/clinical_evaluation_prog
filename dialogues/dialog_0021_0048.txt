DOCTOR: Alright, Colt. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… it’s hard to explain, really. It’s like… moments. Just little moments where I don’t… know where I am. Or what I’m doing. My wife, Srey, she’s been worried. Says I ask the same questions twice in an hour sometimes. It’s not… a lot, but it’s enough to bother her, and frankly, it’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes. Well, these things happen as people get older, you know. Memory isn’t what it used to be. But we should probably get a bit more detail, just to be thorough. You said “little moments.” Can you give me an example?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t patronize me. I know what happens when people get older. My mother got older. It’s not just forgetting where I put my glasses, doctor. This is… different. Let me think… just last week, I was in the garden, pruning the bougainvillea – lovely blooms this year, by the way – and I just… stopped. Couldn’t remember what I was doing mid-snip. Had the shears in my hand, staring at the bush, like I’d never seen one before. Srey found me just standing there. Said I asked her what I was supposed to be doing, even though I’d just been talking about it.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a brief period of confusion while gardening. And your wife noticed you repeating questions. Has this been happening frequently?
PATIENT: Frequently? No, not constantly. That would be ridiculous. But enough to make Srey anxious. She worries about everything, that woman. It’s maybe once or twice a week. Sometimes it’s just a feeling… like I’m not quite present. Like I’m watching myself do something, rather than doing it. And then it passes. It’s… frustrating, more than anything. I’ve always been a sharp man. Still am, I expect.
DOCTOR: “Not quite present,” you say. Hmm. And how long have these episodes been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started… maybe six months ago? Around the time the rainy season really started last year. It’s hard to say exactly, because at first I didn’t even notice. Srey pointed it out. Said I was asking about our grandson’s birthday three times in one day. I thought she was exaggerating, frankly. She always does. But then it happened a few more times, and… well, here I am.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from these moments of confusion, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? You’re asking a lot of vague questions, doctor. I feel perfectly fine, otherwise. A little tired sometimes, but that’s to be expected. I still go to the market every day, still do all the work in the garden, still cook for Srey. I haven’t fallen or anything. My hands are still steady enough to tile a bathroom, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Right. Steady hands. Good. Have you had any trouble with your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? No, not really. A little blurry sometimes, like everyone my age. I have the reading glasses Srey keeps nagging me to wear. But that's it. Nothing dramatic. I can still see well enough to thread a needle, if that’s what you’re asking. I’m a tile setter, remember? I need good eyes for detail.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any difficulty with speech?
PATIENT: Speech? What are you implying, doctor? I’m speaking perfectly clearly, aren’t I? I haven’t slurred a word in my life. Srey might say I talk too much, but that’s a different matter entirely.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Just covering all the bases. Now, have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Not really. Had a bit of a cold last winter, but nothing a little ginger tea couldn’t fix. And Srey made me rest, of course. She always overreacts. No hospital visits, no serious infections, nothing like that. I’m a strong man, doctor. I don’t get sick easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little something for my blood pressure. The doctor at the clinic down the street prescribed it a few years back. A small white pill. I take it every morning with my coffee. That’s it. Nothing else. I don’t believe in filling myself with unnecessary chemicals.
DOCTOR: Alright. And allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Now you're just grasping at straws, doctor. I've lived in Cambodia my whole life. I'm allergic to nothing. Maybe a bit of dust when I’m working with the tiles, but that’s hardly an allergy. A little sneeze, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a quick look at you. Just a basic neurological exam, to see if anything obvious is going on. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Follow your finger? Really? Is that necessary? I told you, I feel perfectly fine. But… alright. Fine. Go ahead. Just don’t keep me all day. I have bougainvillea to prune, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. And can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: There. Strong as an ox, see? Always have been. Even Srey says so. Though she also says I squeeze too hard sometimes. Women.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: There. Perfectly steady. No wobbling, no stumbling. I told you I’m fine. Though my knees do creak a bit in the mornings. That’s just age, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Now, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date? Honestly, doctor, are you trying to insult me? It’s… … it’s… August… the second? Yes, August the second. 2025, of course. Though why you ask me such a silly question is beyond me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you spell "world" for me?
PATIENT: W… O… R… L… D. Yes. W-O-R-L-D. Perfectly correct. I always did excel at spelling. Even Srey says so. Though she also corrects my grammar sometimes. Honestly, women.
DOCTOR: Alright, Colt. Based on what you’ve told me and this brief exam, I think we need to investigate this a little further. It sounds like you're experiencing some cognitive changes, and while it could be a number of things, we need to rule out anything serious. I'm going to order some blood work, and I’d like you to get a brain scan, just to be safe. And I'm going to refer you to a neurologist.
PATIENT: A neurologist? A brain scan? Now hold on just a minute! This is ridiculous. I came in here because I forget what I’m doing for a few seconds, and now you want to poke around in my brain? I told you, I’m perfectly fine! This is just… unnecessary. And expensive, I suspect. Srey will have a fit. I don’t like this one bit. Are you sure this is necessary, doctor? I feel like you’re overreacting. I’m a tile setter, not a… a complicated case!
DOCTOR: Colt, I understand your concerns. And I assure you, I'm not trying to alarm you. But these changes, however subtle, warrant investigation. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Early detection is key with many conditions. We need to rule out things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or even early signs of dementia. The blood work is simple, and the scan is non-invasive. Look, I’m not saying you have anything serious. But we owe it to you to find out for sure. And frankly, dismissing it as just “getting older” isn’t good enough. I'm recommending this based on my professional judgment. I'll have the nurse draw the blood, and we'll schedule the scan for next week. I'll also prepare a referral for Dr. Chen, a neurologist at the hospital. Would you like me to explain the process in more detail?
PATIENT: Dr. Chen, you say? I’ve heard… things. About neurologists. All poking and prodding and asking silly questions. And a scan… I don’t like being confined in small spaces. Fine. Fine, you win. But I’m telling you, this is a waste of time and money. And Srey is going to be furious. But… alright. Do the blood work. But I want a full explanation of this scan before I agree to anything. What exactly does it involve? And what are you looking for, specifically? I don’t want any surprises. And if it turns out to be nothing, I expect an apology. A full apology.
DOCTOR: Very well. The blood work will check for common deficiencies and any underlying medical issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. As for the scan, it’s a simple MRI. You’ll lie on a table, and it uses magnetic fields to create detailed images of your brain. It’s painless, but it can be a bit noisy, and you'll need to remain very still for about 30-40 minutes. We’re looking for any structural abnormalities, signs of stroke, or areas of reduced blood flow. It’s a standard diagnostic tool. I understand your concerns about confinement, and we can discuss options for managing any anxiety you might have. I'll have the nurse come in to explain the process in more detail and answer any further questions you have. She can also schedule the appointment for you. And as I said, I’m not dismissing anything, Colt. We’re simply being thorough. We’ll review the results together, and I’ll explain everything fully. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable? It’s… less than ideal. But alright. Do what you have to do. Just… please, make it quick. And tell the nurse to be gentle. I don’t want any surprises, and I don't want to be stuck in that machine all day. And one more thing. If it turns out to be nothing… if this is all just a waste of time, I want a second opinion. From someone not affiliated with this hospital. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Understood. A second opinion, if the results are inconclusive. That is perfectly reasonable. I’ll make a note of that as well. Nurse Patel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
