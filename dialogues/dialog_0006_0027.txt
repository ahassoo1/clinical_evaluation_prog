DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I'm Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, it's this… stuff. Coming up. All the time. It's disgusting, frankly. And it’s been going on for… well, a long time now. I just want it fixed. I don't have all day to talk about it, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. “Stuff” coming up… Is that… vomiting?
PATIENT: Vomiting? Goodness, no. It's not vomiting. It’s… more like a regurgitation. A less… forceful expulsion, shall we say? Honestly, do you even know what vomiting is? It’s very unpleasant. And it’s not that, I assure you. It just… comes up. After I eat, mostly. It’s just… irritating.
DOCTOR: Right, regurgitation. Okay. And how long has this been happening, this…irritating regurgitation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years. Years, I tell you. Probably… fifteen years, at least. Maybe longer. It comes and goes, you know? Worse when I… well, when I eat richer foods. Like a good kielbasa. But even then. It just… happens. I don't keep a log of my regurgitation, Doctor. Do you expect me to?
DOCTOR: Fifteen years… okay. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Everything changes, Doctor. The price of kielbasa, for one. No, nothing specific. It’s just… been getting a little more frequent lately, maybe. And the heartburn is… fiercer. Honestly, I thought a good antacid would solve it, but it hasn't. That's why I’m here, wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Frequent regurgitation, worsening heartburn… any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Swallowing? No, I swallow just fine. I’ve been swallowing for sixty-seven years, Doctor. I think I’d notice if I couldn’t swallow. It’s the after part that’s the problem. The coming up. Honestly, are you listening to me at all? It's quite simple, really. Food goes down, then some of it comes up. Is that so hard to understand?
DOCTOR: Right, right. Coming up after swallowing. No difficulty swallowing itself. And any weight loss, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No! Absolutely not. I enjoy a good appetite, Doctor. Always have. My wife makes sure of that. I’m a solid man, you can see that. Weight loss would be… preposterous. Though, perhaps my trousers feel a little looser. But that’s just good tailoring, I assure you. It's not a medical condition.
DOCTOR: Okay. No weight loss… trousers feeling looser, but not intentional. Any nausea or vomiting with the regurgitation?
PATIENT: Doctor, we’ve been over this! No vomiting. Just… regurgitation. And no, I don’t feel sick to my stomach when it happens. It's just… unpleasant. A burning sensation, mostly. And then… it comes up. Honestly, this is a complete waste of my time. Are we getting anywhere or should I just go home and suffer in silence?
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. No nausea, no vomiting, just regurgitation with heartburn. Let’s just do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don't expect miracles, Doctor. I've had this for fifteen years. A quick poke around isn't going to solve a decade and a half of… stuff coming up. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just going to listen to your stomach and feel around a bit. Deep breath in… and out. Anything tender here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, there! Right… there. A little to the left. That’s… uncomfortable. It’s always been a little tender there, actually. Though, my wife says I’m just sensitive. Probably just gas, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness to the left side of your abdomen. Heartburn… and the regurgitation. Sounds like possible GERD – gastroesophageal reflux disease. Basically, acid coming up from your stomach. We can try some medication to reduce the acid. A proton pump inhibitor.
PATIENT: GERD? Proton pump… what? Is that some kind of fancy pill? Look, Doctor, I don't need a fancy name for it. I just want it fixed. Will this pill stop the… stuff from coming up? And will it give me terrible side effects? Because I've heard about those pills. My neighbor, Mrs. Kowalski, she took one, and she… well, let's just say it wasn’t pretty.
DOCTOR: Proton pump inhibitors reduce the amount of acid your stomach makes. Common side effects are usually mild – diarrhea, headache, things like that. Mrs. Kowalski's situation might have been unrelated. We'll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If it doesn't help or you have side effects, we can explore other options. I'm going to prescribe you omeprazole, 20 milligrams, once daily, for two weeks. Let's see if that makes a difference.
PATIENT: Fine. Omeprazole. Two weeks. Just don't expect miracles, Doctor. And if I start feeling terrible, I'm blaming you. Honestly, fifteen years of suffering and all I get is a pill? Is that the best you can do? I suppose I’ll try it. But don't call me if it doesn't work. I have better things to do than spend my day talking about regurgitation.
DOCTOR: Alright, well, I'll see you back in two weeks, then. If it doesn't improve, or if you have any side effects, please call the office. Fifteen years… they never come in early enough.
