DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: My heart... it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s beating too fast, but not always. It’s hard to explain. It’s been happening for… a little while now, maybe a month? Not every day, though.
DOCTOR: “A little while now…” Right. And when you say "funny," can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm... not like pain, you know? More like… flapping? Like a bird inside my chest. And sometimes it feels like it skips a beat. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds. Then it’s okay again. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It's… descriptive. Flapping. Okay. And does this happen when you’re doing anything specific?
PATIENT: Not really. Sometimes when I'm just sitting, sometimes when I walk… I was working, fixing a pipe, and it happened then too. It doesn’t seem to care what I’m doing. It just… happens. My wife, she worries, but I don’t feel sick, you know? Just… weird.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it's unpredictable. And no other symptoms accompany this… flapping sensation?
PATIENT: No. No dizzy or anything like that. I don’t get short of breath. No pain in my chest, just… the heart thing. I eat normal, sleep normal. Everything else is okay. I just… feel it sometimes. It worries my wife a lot more than it worries me, to be honest. She says I should come see someone.
DOCTOR: Well, your wife is prudent to suggest it. Regardless of your level of concern, we should investigate. Have you ever had your heart checked before?
PATIENT: No, never. I’m not… I don’t get sick often. I work with the machines, you know? Chemical stuff, so I try to be careful. But I’ve never had a doctor look at my heart before. Just regular check-ups when I was a kid, I think. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any family history of heart problems?
PATIENT: My… my father, he had some issues. I don’t remember exactly what. He lived back in Yemen, and we didn’t… talk about it much. Something with his chest, I think. He was older when it happened, though. I was young. My mother… she was healthy. She lived a long time. I don’t know. It wasn't something we talked about a lot. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's… less than ideal. Okay. Well, we’ll need to do a basic EKG to start. And I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, given your history and the fact you’re uninsured, I think a referral to a cardiologist is necessary. We need someone who can do a more thorough workup. I can write you a note explaining everything, and perhaps we can discuss payment options with the specialist's office. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any trouble with any medicine. That sounds… good. A specialist, okay. I don't want to cause any trouble with money. I can… I can work extra. But I don’t want my wife worrying too much about it. Is the EKG… does it hurt? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't involve needles. It's just some sticky pads placed on your chest, arms, and legs. It records the electrical activity of your heart. Quick and painless. Let’s get that done first, then we’ll talk about the referral. Please lie down on the table, and I’ll get it set up.
PATIENT: Okay. Sticky pads. That sounds… not bad. I hope it tells you what’s going on. My wife will be very happy to know we are doing this.
DOCTOR: Good. We'll have some preliminary information shortly. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but it's always best to be thorough. And please try to remain still during the recording. Now, just relax.
PATIENT: Okay, I'm trying to relax. It feels… cold. I think about fixing the pipes. That's relaxing. Is this thing… recording now? I hope it's not too much trouble. I don't want to take up your time.
DOCTOR: It is recording. And no, you’re not taking up my time. Though, frankly, I have other patients waiting. Alright. Here’s the printout. It shows some minor irregularities, but nothing immediately concerning. Still, given your symptoms and your family history, the referral to a cardiologist is the appropriate course of action. I’ll write the referral now and give you the necessary paperwork. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Irregularities… Is that bad? A cardiologist… that sounds… serious. Is it something I should worry about right now? I just want to make sure my wife doesn’t worry too much. She gets very… upset.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Puder. "Irregularities" is a broad term. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. That's why we're sending you to a specialist. A cardiologist can perform further testing – an echocardiogram, perhaps a stress test – to get a more accurate diagnosis. And no, you shouldn’t panic. It's unlikely to be an emergency. But I am not a cardiologist, and I recommend you seek their opinion as soon as possible. I will also write a note detailing your symptoms and this preliminary EKG finding for them. Do you have a preferred cardiologist, or would you like me to suggest someone nearby?
PATIENT: No, I don't know any. If you have a good one… nearby would be best. My wife can't drive very far. And… is there anything I should do now? Like, should I stop working? Or… avoid something? I don't want it to get worse before I see the specialist.
DOCTOR: Dr. Anya Volkov. She's a very competent cardiologist about fifteen minutes from here. Here's her contact information. As for what you should do now… Avoid strenuous activity until you’ve been evaluated by Dr. Volkov. Continue with your normal diet and sleep schedule. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. But, realistically, I doubt that will be necessary. Do you have any further questions, or are we finished?
PATIENT: No, I think… that's all. Dr. Volkov… I'll call her tomorrow. And I'll tell my wife to… not worry too much. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have Dr. Volkov’s office schedule you for an appointment as soon as possible. And don’t delay. Next. Next patient! .
PATIENT: .
