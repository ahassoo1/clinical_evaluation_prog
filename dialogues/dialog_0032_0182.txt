DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Pipkorn, you say? Right. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s just get on with it. I need to be cleared for a little… touch-up. Cosmetic surgery. My daughter insisted I get a check-up first. Seems they want one these days, doesn't it? Waste of time, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re scheduled for an elective procedure, Mr. Orwin, and your daughter has understandably requested a medical clearance to ensure your optimal health for it. While I appreciate your time is valuable, a thorough assessment is standard practice and, quite frankly, beneficial to your well-being, regardless of the procedure’s nature. It allows us to identify any potential risks and optimize your outcome. To begin, could you tell me a bit more about this “touch-up”?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… a face lift. There, happy? I’m not getting any younger, and it’s starting to show. My daughter says I look “tired.” Tired! I’ve lived a full life, of course I look a little worn. It’s not like I’ve been lounging about doing nothing. I built things. Real things. Terrazzo, you know. Beautiful floors. Not everyone sits behind a desk all day. And frankly, it's my face.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. A facelift is a significant procedure, and it’s wise to consider all aspects of your health beforehand. You mentioned building terrazzo floors – a physically demanding profession, I imagine?
PATIENT: Demanding? You have no idea. Heavy work, precise work. Years of it. Back aches, knee problems, you name it. I was on my feet all day, every day, for fifty years. Fifty years! And don’t think it’s just lifting and carrying. It’s the dust, the bending, the constant attention to detail. People think it’s just putting pretty tiles down, but it’s skilled work. Skilled. Now, are we going to talk about the surgery or my life story? I have an appointment after this, you know.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my line of questioning feels intrusive, Mr. Orwin. Your detailed account is, in fact, quite helpful in understanding your overall physical condition. It’s important to assess the cumulative effects of your profession, particularly concerning your musculoskeletal system. To proceed, could you elaborate on any current pain, stiffness, or limitations you are experiencing in your back, knees, or elsewhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Of course there's pain. I’m eighty-one years old! What do you expect, a spring in my step? My knees ache when it rains, my back gets stiff in the morning, and sometimes my hands get a bit…creaky. It’s old age, plain and simple. Not some dramatic injury. I've taken a few pills here and there over the years, mostly for the arthritis, but nothing regular. It’s just… getting older. Now, is this going to affect whether I can get this surgery or not? Because I really don't want to waste any more time on this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. It’s helpful to have a clearer picture of your symptoms. “Creaky” hands, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, creaky. Like an old door. They don't bend like they used to, especially in the mornings. Makes it hard to grip things sometimes. I used to be able to work with my hands for hours, perfectly precise. Now… well, it takes a bit longer, and I need to stretch them out. Not a big deal, really. I still manage. It's my hands that made me who I am. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Indeed, Mr. Orwin, it’s clear your hands are incredibly important to you and your life's work. To clarify, is this stiffness and reduced grip strength affecting your daily activities beyond your profession?
PATIENT: Well… it makes opening jars a bit tricky sometimes. And buttoning my shirt. Small things, really. My daughter helps with the buttons, mostly. She fusses over me. I can still hold a cup of coffee, and I still enjoy reading the paper, though I need my reading glasses. Honestly, it’s not that bad. But it’s getting worse, slowly. And I want to get this surgery before it gets completely impossible, if you understand. I don’t want to end up completely helpless.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder out years ago. No problems with that since. High blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. A small dose, nothing to worry about. Oh, and a touch of arthritis, as I said. The doctor keeps an eye on it. I think that’s it. I’ve been fairly healthy for an old man, if you ask me. Never smoked, barely drank. Solid Norwegian stock, you see.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure and arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me see… for the blood pressure, it's Lisinopril, I think. Small dose, ten milligrams. And for the arthritis, I take Ibuprofen as needed. Usually just a couple when my knees are acting up. Nothing regular, like I said. My daughter handles the refills, mostly. She’s very organized. I don't bother with remembering all those names. I just take what she gives me. Is this important? Because really, I'm not sure all this detail is necessary.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Orwin, as some medications can interact with anesthesia or affect the healing process. Just to be certain, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I had a bit of a rash once when I was a boy, from poison ivy, but that was ages ago. Nothing serious. No reactions to any medications, as far as I know. My daughter always checks when she gets my prescriptions. Honestly, I feel like I’m being interrogated here. This is a simple surgery, not a heart transplant. Is this going to delay things?
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration. I assure you, I am simply attempting to gather a complete medical history to ensure your safety and optimal outcome with your elective procedure. Now, would you be amenable to a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Really? At my age? What exactly are you hoping to find? I’m not a young athlete, you know. But… alright, fine. Get it over with. But don’t expect miracles. I’m a bit… creaky, as we’ve established. Let’s just hurry it up, shall we? I have a lunch date.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you would please lie down on the examination table, we’ll begin with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then I’ll listen to your lungs and briefly assess your joints and reflexes. Please remove your shirt.
PATIENT: Now, this is a bit much, isn’t it? I'm not that old. And what does my chest have to do with a face lift? But fine, fine. Get on with it. Just be quick about it. And try not to poke around too much.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 138/82, heart rate is 72 and regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I note some crepitus in both knees with range of motion. Mild tenderness to palpation, but no significant swelling or effusion. Range of motion is slightly limited. Grip strength is reduced bilaterally, approximately 3/5. Some stiffness noted in the finger joints, with limited range of motion. I also note some mild Heberden's nodes on the distal interphalangeal joints. Do you experience any pain with these movements?
PATIENT: A bit, yes. Especially in the mornings. It’s a dull ache, mostly. And when I grip something tightly, like a steering wheel. It’s not a sharp pain, but it's… bothersome. And the stiffness, that's the worst part. Makes it hard to get things done. And those nodes… I've had those for years. The doctor said it's just arthritis. Nothing to worry about, he said. But it makes my hands look… old.
DOCTOR: Your back reveals some mild tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine. No significant muscle spasm noted. Range of motion is slightly limited, with some discomfort upon extension. Alright, Mr. Orwin. Based on my examination and your medical history, you have controlled hypertension, mild osteoarthritis affecting your knees, hands, and lower back, and reduced grip strength. Your Heberden's nodes are consistent with osteoarthritis. Given your age and these findings, it is my recommendation that you consult with a cardiologist prior to undergoing elective surgery to ensure your heart is adequately prepared. I also recommend a consultation with a physical therapist to optimize your strength and range of motion, which may aid in your post-operative recovery.
PATIENT: A cardiologist? A physical therapist? Are you serious? I came here for a simple face lift, not a full medical overhaul. This is ridiculous. I feel perfectly fine, aside from a few aches and pains. Look, I appreciate your thoroughness, I suppose. But I'm not going to run around getting consultations from every specialist under the sun. I just want to know if I can get this surgery or not. Is it safe? Will it work? I’m eighty-one years old. I’ve lived a full life. I don’t have time for all this. Just tell me what you think. Is it worth the risk?
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration. However, my primary responsibility is to ensure your safety. Elective surgery, even a facelift, carries inherent risks, and it is my ethical obligation to mitigate those risks as much as possible. Given your hypertension and osteoarthritis, a cardiologist’s evaluation will help determine if your heart can tolerate the stress of anesthesia and surgery. A physical therapist can strengthen your muscles and improve your range of motion, aiding in post-operative recovery and minimizing complications. Based on my assessment, I cannot definitively clear you for surgery without these consultations. Proceeding without them would be irresponsible and potentially detrimental to your health. I understand this may not be the answer you were hoping for, but it is the best course of action. I can provide you with referrals to qualified specialists in the area. Would you like me to do so?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, you win. Referrals. Give me the referrals. I suppose I have no choice. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And if those doctors give me a hard time, I'm blaming you. Just get it over with. The faster I get this done, the faster I can get on with my life. And frankly, if this delays the surgery for too long… well, I might just forget about it altogether.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. I understand your concerns. I will provide you with referrals to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a cardiologist specializing in geriatric patients, and Ms. Anya Sharma, a physical therapist with extensive experience in post-surgical rehabilitation. Here are the contact details and relevant information for both specialists. I will also send a summary of my findings to their offices for your convenience. I recommend scheduling appointments with both specialists as soon as possible. Once they have evaluated you, please bring their reports back to me, and we can discuss your surgical candidacy further. I understand this is a lot to take in, Mr. Orwin. However, prioritizing your health and well-being is paramount. I am here to answer any questions or concerns you may have throughout this process. Do you have any immediate questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get me out of here. I have a lunch date, remember? And honestly, I need a strong drink. Thank you… I suppose. Though I’m not sure “thank you” is the appropriate sentiment in this situation. Just… goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. Have a pleasant lunch. And please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. .
