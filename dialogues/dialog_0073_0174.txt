DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly? It’s… well, it’s been a bit difficult lately. I don’t quite have the energy to explain everything, but I suppose I’ve just been feeling very… down. Not myself, you understand? I hope we can be quick about this. I have a few appointments after this one.
DOCTOR: “Down,” you say. Right. It’s always helpful to be specific, but I understand you're busy. Let's try this. How long have you been feeling this way – this… lack of energy, as you put it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Specific… that's a good point. Let me think. It’s not been a sudden thing, not like a cold catching up on you. More… gradual. Probably the last few months, yes. Maybe three, four months? It’s hard to say exactly. Things just… started to feel heavier.
DOCTOR: A few months… alright. And has anything happened in those few months?
PATIENT: Something happened? Well… my divorce was finalized around then. We’d been separated for a while, of course, but the paperwork… it makes it real, doesn’t it? And my son, he doesn’t call as often as he used to. But… life happens, doesn’t it? I don't know if that’s the cause. I just feel… empty.
DOCTOR: Divorce finalized… and less frequent contact with your son. That could certainly be contributing. Empty… alright. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep. Yes. I sleep… too much, sometimes. And then I can't sleep at all. It’s a very strange cycle. As for appetite… not much. I force myself to eat, but it doesn’t feel enjoyable, you know? Food tastes… bland. Like cardboard, almost. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: It can be, Ms. Derasmo. It certainly fits the picture. Are you having any difficulty concentrating?
PATIENT: Concentrating… yes, actually. I used to love my crossword puzzles, kept my mind very sharp. Now? I start a word, and… it just slips away. I forget what I was even trying to solve. It’s frustrating. Very frustrating. And…I've been rather irritable, I suppose. Snapping at people for no reason. Not myself at all.
DOCTOR: Loss of concentration, irritability… alright. Now, have you been experiencing any feelings of hopelessness, or thoughts of… well, not wanting to be here?
PATIENT: Hopelessness… yes. That feels… accurate. Everything just seems so… grey. And… sometimes, I just don’t see the point. Not in a dramatic way, you understand. Just… a quiet feeling that it wouldn't matter if I weren't here. I haven't thought of doing anything, if that's what you're asking. But the feeling… it’s unsettling. Is this… serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Ms. Derasmo, it sounds like you're describing symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder. It is serious, and I’m glad you’re telling me about this. We need to do a few things to get a clearer picture. I'm going to ask you a few more questions, then I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to rule out any other potential causes. And then we can discuss some treatment options. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. As long as we don’t take too long, please. I have that bridge game this evening. But yes, let’s get to the bottom of this. Ask away. I suppose I should have come sooner.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but that's been controlled with medication for years. And arthritis in my knees, naturally. Comes with the age, I suppose. Other than that… no, not really. I've been generally healthy, all things considered. I used to be very active, you know. Skiing, swimming… lifeguard work kept me quite fit. But these days… not so much.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, controlled with medication. Arthritis in knees. Alright. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. A few broken bones when I was a child, falling out of trees, you know. Typical childhood things. And I had the flu a few times, but nothing that required a hospital stay. Nothing serious, I assure you. I've always been rather sturdy. Or, was rather sturdy. I'm not so sure anymore.
DOCTOR: No surgeries or hospitalizations. Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or arthritis?
PATIENT: Yes, for the blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it is. A small dose, every morning. And ibuprofen, as needed, for the knees. Not every day, just when they flare up. I try to avoid it when I can. It’s not good for the stomach, you know.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, ibuprofen as needed. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. No, not that I know of. I eat most things. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. A bit sensitive to pollen in the spring, makes me sneeze, but that’s all. No serious allergies. Thank goodness for small mercies.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No, my parents passed away many years ago. My mother died when I was quite young, a long illness. And my father… he passed away peacefully in his sleep when I was in my thirties. A good man. He always encouraged my swimming.
DOCTOR: Both parents deceased. Alright. Did either of your parents have any history of mental health issues, such as depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: That's a difficult question. My mother… she was always very quiet, very reserved. I suppose you could say she was a bit melancholy. But back then, people didn’t talk about these things, you know? They just… suffered in silence. My father seemed very strong, very stoic. I don't know if he ever struggled with anything like that. Perhaps… a bit of worry, but that's just being a father, isn't it? I really couldn't say for sure. It wasn’t something we discussed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Are you married, divorced, widowed?
PATIENT: Divorced. Finalized a few months ago, as I mentioned. After a very long marriage. It… wasn’t a happy ending, I’m afraid. But that’s neither here nor there now. It’s done. I just try to focus on the present. Though, admittedly, the present isn’t much better.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes. I have a lovely little apartment, very comfortable. But… quiet. Too quiet, sometimes. I used to enjoy having company, you know? A husband, children visiting… Now it's just me and the television. I do have a few friends, but they all have their own lives, their own families. I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And alcohol… a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally, that’s all. Nothing excessive. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I was always a very sensible woman, you see. Always believed in moderation. Still do, I suppose. Though, admittedly, moderation isn't doing me much good at the moment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. That’s a good deal of information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to rule out any other potential causes for how you're feeling. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long, please. I really should be going soon. I have my bridge game this evening, you know. But yes, go ahead. I suppose it can't hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please sit back and relax. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. And I'll just check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Finally, I'm going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears are clear, throat is normal. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. No immediate red flags. But to be thorough, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, thyroid panel, and vitamin D level. That will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. As long as it doesn't take too long to get the results. I really need to know what's going on. And, honestly, if it's nothing physical… well, then I suppose we can talk about the… other things. The feelings. But please, let's get the blood work done quickly. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Derasmo. We'll get the blood work ordered right away. The lab results usually take a few days. In the meantime, based on what you've told me and the unremarkable physical exam, I'm leaning towards a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. But we need the blood work to rule out other possibilities. While we wait for the results, would you be open to discussing some initial treatment options?
PATIENT: Treatment options… I suppose. I’ve never been one for… pills. But I'm not getting any younger, and I’m tired of feeling this way. What are my options, Doctor? Please be brief. I have a feeling this is going to be a long conversation. And, again, I really need to be going soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, briefly. The main options are medication, therapy, or a combination of both. Medication – typically antidepressants – can help regulate the chemicals in your brain that affect mood. Therapy – talk therapy – can help you process your feelings and develop coping mechanisms. Many people find a combination of both to be the most effective. We can start with medication if you're willing, and I can refer you to a therapist if you're interested. There are different types of antidepressants, with varying side effects. We would start with a low dose and monitor your response. Alternatively, we can focus on therapy alone. What are your initial thoughts?
PATIENT: Pills… I really don’t like the idea of pills. Side effects… I’ve heard horror stories. Therapy… I suppose I could try that. Talking about my feelings… it’s not something I’m used to. But perhaps… perhaps it’s worth a try. Is there a good therapist you recommend? Someone who is… discreet? I don't want everyone knowing my business. And how long does therapy usually last? I don’t have a lot of time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. I recommend Dr. Eleanor Vance. She specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy and is very discreet. Many of my patients have had positive experiences with her. She’s located just a few blocks from here. As for how long therapy lasts… it varies. Typically, it’s several months, once a week. But it depends on your individual needs and progress. We can start with a few sessions and see how it goes. I will write you a referral, and her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I will order the blood work and we can discuss the results when they come back. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… manageable. Dr. Vance, you said? I will try her. And the blood work, of course. Thank you. I think… I think that’s all I can handle for today. I really must be going now. It has been… informative. I appreciate your help, Doctor Korrell. I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Derasmo. We will. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. And here is the referral for Dr. Vance. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We will be in touch as soon as the blood work results are available. Take care, and try to be kind to yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And I will try. Goodbye.
