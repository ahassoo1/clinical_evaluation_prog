DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Lahn. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Bigger is the name. They sent me here… something about checking me up after working in that… hole. Not feeling sick, mind you. Just… checking. Waste of time, if you ask me. But my son insisted.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. It’s good of your son to be so attentive to your health. Even if you aren’t feeling sick, a check-up can be helpful to get a baseline and make sure everything is as it should be. And it’s good you’re here. When you say “that hole,” could you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Hole? You mean the mine, of course! What else would I be talking about? Been down there… oh, goodness… forty years, maybe more. Digging things out of the ground. Coal, mostly. Dirty work. Very dirty. Always dust everywhere. Used to come home looking like a ghost. Not like these young people today, complaining about a little bit of dirt. We worked back then.
DOCTOR: Forty years is a long time, Mr. Bigger. That’s a significant amount of exposure to dust and… well, the mine environment. It’s good to know that’s what you were referring to. Okay. And you said you’re not currently feeling sick?
PATIENT: Sick? No! I’m eighty-six years old! What do you expect? A few aches and pains, sure. But nothing to do with that… place. They just want to be sure, I guess. My son keeps reading things on the internet, says the dust… does things. I don’t understand all that fancy talk. I breathe, I eat, I sleep. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for people who’ve worked in environments with dust exposure for a long time to be concerned about potential lung issues, and your son is right to be proactive. We'll do a thorough check-up, and if necessary, we can talk about some tests to get a clearer picture of your lung health. Just to be complete, are you experiencing any coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath currently?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Sometimes. But that’s just from walking up these hills! This town is built on hills, you know. Everything is up or down. Old man’s lungs, that’s all. Not from the mine. I climb the stairs to my house just fine, though. Slow, maybe. But fine. Coughing… sometimes a little tickle in my throat. Everyone coughs, Doctor. It’s called living.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know you can manage the stairs. And you’re right, a little tickle in the throat is common. Just to clarify, has that cough changed at all recently?
PATIENT: Changed? How would I know if it changed? It's a cough! You cough when you need to cough. It’s not like it has a little bell on it, telling me when it’s different. Honestly, Doctor, all this asking… It’s like you’re looking for something that isn’t there. I feel fine. Mostly. Just… old.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem excessive, Mr. Bigger. I just want to gather as much information as possible to ensure we're providing the best care. It's true, sometimes a cough is just a cough. Let’s switch gears a bit then. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor back in Lagos told me something about that, years ago. Gave me a little pill. I took it for a while, then I ran out. Didn't seem to make much difference, so I stopped. Heart… nothing wrong with my heart. Still beating, isn’t it? I walk, I work in the garden… good enough for me. Never had any trouble with… sweets or anything like that either. Not a big fan.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that wasn't consistently treated, and no history of diabetes. That’s helpful to know. And you said you don’t have any trouble with sweets, so no family history of diabetes that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Family? All gone now, Doctor. Mother, father… all passed. Long ago. They didn't bother with doctors much either. Strong people, my family. Worked hard, ate what they grew. No fancy foods, no sweets… maybe a little fruit sometimes. Didn’t need doctors. This whole thing… feels like a waste of my time, honestly. I have a garden to tend. Tomatoes are almost ready.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bigger. It sounds like you come from a strong, resilient family who valued hard work and self-reliance. We appreciate that, and we want to honor that while also making sure we address any potential health concerns. Now, let's talk about medications. Besides the blood pressure pill you took years ago, are you currently taking any other prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? What are those? Vitamins, maybe? My son gives me something sometimes… a little white pill. Says it’s good for my bones. I take it. He worries too much, that boy. Other than that… nothing. Just water. And sometimes tea. A little ginger tea when my stomach feels funny. That's it. No fancy pills, no powders… nothing. Plain and simple. Like me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a vitamin supplement your son provides, and ginger tea for your stomach. We'll make a note of those. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any. I eat everything. Goat meat, yam, plantain… everything. Used to eat insects when I was a boy, even! If it moves, I ate it. No problems. No itching, no swelling… nothing. Strong stomach, I told you. This is all very silly, you know. I’ve lived eighty-six years eating everything, doing everything… I think I’d know if I was allergic to something.
DOCTOR: You certainly sound like you do, Mr. Bigger. Okay, no known allergies. That’s excellent. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Disgusting habit. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Always smelled bad, too. My father… he used to chase people away if they smoked near him. Said it was bad for the lungs. Irony, isn't it? I worked in a mine for forty years, and I never smoked. Makes no sense, all this fuss about a little dust when people are deliberately filling their lungs with smoke.
DOCTOR: It is ironic, Mr. Bigger, and you're right to point that out. Okay, never smoked. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? A little beer sometimes. Back in Lagos, we’d have a little palm wine with our friends. Nothing much. Not every day, mind you. Just on special occasions. A little celebration. Nothing to get drunk on. Not a drinker. Never liked it much, truth be told. Makes my head feel funny.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little palm wine occasionally, but not a regular drinker. That's good to know. Now, one final set of questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Could you tell me a little about your daily activities?
PATIENT: Daily activities? I wake up, pray to God. Eat breakfast – yam and egg, usually. Work in the garden – tomatoes, peppers, okra. Sometimes I visit my neighbors, help them with their chores. Read the newspaper. Pray again. Eat dinner. Go to bed. Simple life. Not much excitement. Keeps me busy, though. And keeps me out of trouble. What more could an old man want?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very fulfilling life, Mr. Bigger. Very healthy, and I commend you for staying so active. Alright, if you’re agreeable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. It shouldn’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Go ahead. Get it over with. I have tomatoes waiting. But don’t take too long, Doctor. They’ll be overripe if I’m not careful. And my son will have my hide if I let them go bad. He thinks they're going to make a fancy sauce.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bigger. I’ll be as quick as I can. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, which isn't entirely surprising given your age and recent activity. We can discuss that further later. Your heart sounds good – regular rhythm, no unusual sounds. Your lungs sound a bit quiet, which can also be normal with age. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Your ears look a little waxy, but nothing concerning. Your throat looks fine. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems generally okay, but given your history of working in the mine and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and some blood tests just to get a more complete picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood tests? Waste of money, if you ask me. But… my son would want me to, wouldn’t he? He’s always reading things on that internet. Alright, go ahead. Do what you think you need to do. But if it delays me getting back to my tomatoes… And make it quick, please. My bones are getting old.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bigger. I understand your concerns. It’s a good idea to get these tests done to have a baseline, and it will help to put your son’s mind at ease too. The tests will give us a better understanding of your lung health and overall condition. I’ll write up the orders for the chest X-ray and blood tests now. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood, and she can give you instructions on where to go for the X-ray. It shouldn’t take too long. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? No. You’ve taken enough of my time already. Just get it over with. Tell my son everything is fine, and let me get back to my garden. That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bigger. I will do my best to expedite the process and will share the results with your son as soon as they are available. I will also let him know that we've discussed everything. I will document everything we discussed today, including your concerns, your lifestyle, and the exam findings, to ensure the best care for you. The nurse will be in shortly. In the meantime, are you experiencing any pain anywhere at all?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes my knees ache when the weather changes. Old man’s knees, you know. And my back… gets a little stiff after working in the garden. Nothing to worry about. I’ve had aches and pains all my life. It just comes with being eighty-six years old. Don't write down too much. It’ll just be another pile of papers.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. It’s good to know you’re aware of your aches and pains, and that you're managing them. I’ll note that you experience occasional knee and back discomfort related to the weather and gardening. It’s important to document these things to get a complete picture of your health, so we can tailor the care plan accordingly. Alright, I think that covers everything for now. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll write up the orders for the X-ray as well. Thank you for your patience and for sharing your concerns with me. I’ll see you again once we have the test results. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Do you have any further questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No. Just get it over with, Doctor. My tomatoes are waiting. .
