DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well… it’s my… water. I have trouble… getting it all out, when I need to go. It just… stops sometimes. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a couple months.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hilber. You're experiencing difficulty completely emptying your bladder, and this has been ongoing for about two months. Could you describe a typical instance of this happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I start to go, feels normal enough. Then… it just slows down. Feels like there’s still some left, but I can’t push it out. I have to… try again later. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. Just… frustrating. It makes me worry a little, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I completely understand your concern, Mr. Hilber. It's good you're paying attention to this. So, it doesn't cause you pain, but rather a sensation of incomplete emptying. Has this difficulty been consistent, or does it vary depending on the time of day, or perhaps after certain activities?
PATIENT: It seems to be… worse in the mornings, when I first wake up. And sometimes after I drink a lot of tea. I like my tea. But yeah, mornings are the worst. The rest of the day… it’s not always bad. Some days I have no trouble at all. It’s just… unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Hilber. That’s helpful. And tea, you said. How much tea would you typically drink in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Probably… three or four big mugs. Maybe more on a cold day. It’s a habit, you know? Been drinking tea since I was a little boy, helping my grandma in the kitchen. She always said it was good for what ails ya.
DOCTOR: That’s a lovely tradition, Mr. Hilber. Tea certainly has a long history. Now, let’s explore this a little further. Have you noticed any changes in your urine stream itself – for instance, is it weak, or does it start and stop?
PATIENT: Well… it feels normal when it starts. Not weak, not really. It just… stops before I feel like I’m completely empty. It doesn’t spray like it used to, maybe? I don’t know if that makes sense. I haven’t been paying that close of attention, to be honest. I just know it’s not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Hilber. It’s very common not to be focused on these details unless something changes. So, it sounds like the initial stream is good, but the completeness of emptying is reduced. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain alongside this difficulty?
PATIENT: No, sir. No fever, no chills, and no pain in my belly. Nothing like that. Just the… frustration, like I said. And worrying. It's just… it's not a good feeling, not being able to… fully empty.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Hilber. It’s good that you haven’t experienced any fever or pain. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago. And I broke my arm when I was a young man, working on a boat. Other than that… not much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I try to eat good, get a little exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Hilber. That’s helpful to know. And no other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing that I know of. Just the usual old man aches and pains, you know? My knees bother me sometimes, but that’s just from being on my feet so long at work. I’ve been a shoe machine operator for… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: I understand. And, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a little something for my blood pressure, a small pill. And sometimes, when my knees are really bad, I take ibuprofen. That’s about it. Oh, and I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, ‘cause the sun doesn’t shine much then.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hilber. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much whatever I want, thankfully. My grandma always said a good appetite was a blessing.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Hilber. Now, finally, could you briefly tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Well… my mother had… problems with her kidneys when she was older. Needed dialysis for a while, before she passed. And my father… he had high blood pressure, like me. Other than that… not much that I know of. My family wasn’t big on talking about health, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hilber. That's helpful information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. We’ll start with checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll gently examine your abdomen, and perform a neurological exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I haven’t been feeling right, so I’m happy to let you check things out.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber. Everything sounds normal when listening to your heart and lungs. I did note your bladder feels a little full, and it’s slightly enlarged, which can be common with difficulty emptying. Your neurological exam is normal, which is reassuring. Based on your history and this examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing urinary retention – difficulty emptying your bladder completely. However, we need to run some tests to confirm this and rule out other possible causes. I’d like to order a urinalysis and a post-void residual volume test. The PVR test measures the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That sounds… sensible. Whatever tests you think are best. I’m happy to do them. I just want to know what’s going on, and what we can do about it.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Hilber. I completely understand. I'll write the orders for the urinalysis and PVR test now. The nurse will come in shortly to collect a urine sample from you, and then we’ll have you empty your bladder as completely as possible. The PVR test will be done right after that. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I recommend you try to avoid drinking excessive amounts of fluids, especially caffeinated beverages like tea, and try to urinate regularly, even if you don't feel a strong urge. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That sounds… doable. I can cut back on the tea, I suppose. It’ll be hard, but I can try. And I’ll try to go to the bathroom more often. Just… a little worrying, having to think about it all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hilber. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when dealing with a health issue. We'll get to the bottom of this, and I’ll explain everything every step of the way. The nurse will be in shortly with instructions for the urine sample. Do you have any questions for me at this time before she arrives?
PATIENT: Hmm… Just one. How long do you think it’ll be before we get the results? I don’t like waiting, if I’m honest. And is this… serious? Is it something to really worry about?
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly reasonable question, Mr. Hilber. The results should be available within a couple of hours. The nurse will let you know as soon as they are. As for whether it's serious… It could be. Urinary retention can sometimes lead to complications like urinary tract infections or bladder damage if left untreated. However, it's also often caused by benign issues like an enlarged prostate or medication side effects. That’s why these tests are important – to determine the cause of the retention. We will work to find the underlying reason and develop an appropriate plan. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, lower abdominal pain, or inability to urinate at all, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that help to ease your worries a little?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That… does help. Knowing what to look for, and knowing we’re finding out what’s causing it… that’s good. Thank you. I appreciate you explaining things so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. That’s my job. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. The nurse should be with you shortly. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to let me or any of the staff know if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll be right down the hall if you need anything.
