DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s these hiccups, you see. They just won’t stop. Been going on for… oh, let me think… nearly three days now, I’d say. It’s a bit ridiculous, really. Not painful, just… annoying. Like a little jump inside me every few minutes.
DOCTOR: Three days, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, three days. Started right after I had a lovely lunch with my granddaughter, Lani. We went to that little cafe down by the harbor, the one with the good fish and chips. Though, I don't think it was the fish and chips… I ate there before with no trouble. It just… started later that afternoon. Funny things, bodies, aren't they?
DOCTOR: Well, bodies are funny things. Alright, let's get some more details. Besides starting after lunch with your granddaughter, have you noticed anything else happening around the same time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… except… oh! I started a new medication, just a few days before lunch with Lani. For my… well, it’s for my nerves, a little bit. Dr. Sharma thought it might help with the… you know, the little worries. It’s a small blue pill. I can’t remember the name right now, but I have the bottle at home. Does that sound like it could be anything to do with it?
DOCTOR: A new medication… yes, that's pertinent information. What was the medication for, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit of anxiety, dear. Nothing major, you understand. Just… feeling a bit restless sometimes, especially at night. Dr. Sharma said it would help me sleep better. He said a lot of older folks get a bit like that. I haven’t really noticed a huge difference with the sleeping, to be honest, but I haven’t been terribly bothered with it lately, so maybe it is working. It's just... these hiccups started soon after. Do you think it could be that?
DOCTOR: It’s possible. Some medications can have hiccups as a side effect. Though it's not a common one, certainly. Let's go through a little more detail about the hiccups themselves. Are they constant, or do they come and go in bursts?
PATIENT: They come and go, definitely. Not constant, thank goodness. It’s usually a few hiccups, then nothing for… oh, maybe half an hour or so, and then they’ll start up again. Sometimes just a couple, sometimes a whole little flurry. It doesn't seem to be tied to anything in particular, either. I’ve tried drinking water, like you’re supposed to, and holding my breath… doesn't seem to make a bit of difference. It's just… irritating, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… no, not really. I feel perfectly fine otherwise. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no nausea… just the hiccups! I’ve been eating normally, sleeping… well, like I said, the sleeping hasn’t been great, but that’s been going on a while. No fever, no cough… Honestly, Doctor, if it wasn’t for these darn hiccups, I’d say I was feeling pretty good for my age. Do you need to know anything else?
DOCTOR: No, that's helpful. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to make sure everything else is as you say. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, just a standard check. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement completely. Go right ahead. Don't mind me, I've had doctors poke and prod at me for years!
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, Ms. Sucich… and exhale. Good. And again… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Everything seems normal on the initial exam, which is good. Now, tell me about any allergies you may have?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. Well, I don’t think I have any serious allergies, not to food or anything. I get a little bit itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but that’s been since I was a little girl. Nothing life-threatening, you understand. And no allergies to medications that I know of. Dr. Sharma asked me about that when he prescribed the new pills, and I told him I hadn’t had any trouble before. Does that help at all? It’s just… these hiccups are driving me a bit batty!
DOCTOR: No known drug allergies… alright. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your nerves?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I am. Let me see… I have something for my blood pressure, a little white pill. And something for my cholesterol, a small yellow one. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take a little something for that too. Oh, and a vitamin D supplement, Dr. Sharma said I was a bit low. Is that too many? I try to keep up with everything, but sometimes it's a bit of a struggle, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s see… Lisinopril for blood pressure, Atorvastatin for cholesterol, and a multivitamin with Vitamin D… It's not too many, Ms. Sucich, but it's good to have a complete list. Now, I suspect the hiccups may be a side effect of the medication for your nerves. It’s not common, but it’s possible. We can try a few things. We could stop the medication for a few days to see if the hiccups resolve, or we could switch you to a different medication. However, given your other medical conditions, I’d prefer to be cautious. For now, let's continue the medication and see if the hiccups subside on their own. I’ll also recommend an over-the-counter antacid. Sometimes that can help with hiccups.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, dear. I’m happy to try that. I don't want to start switching pills willy-nilly, you understand. An antacid… alright. What kind should I look for? I go to the pharmacy down by the harbor, the one Mr. Henderson owns. He’s a good man, very helpful. And… is there anything else I should be doing? Any special breathing exercises, or anything like that? I've heard all sorts of things, you know.
DOCTOR: There are a lot of home remedies, yes. But those are usually more anecdotal than effective. For now, I wouldn't bother with those. Just the antacid will do. Something like Tums or Maalox. Take two tablets as needed, up to four times a day. If the hiccups persist for more than a week, or if they worsen, or if you develop any other symptoms, please call the office immediately. And if you experience any difficulty breathing or chest pain, go to the nearest emergency room. It's unlikely, but we need to be cautious. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds very sensible, dear. Antacid… check. Watch for worse symptoms… check. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I was getting quite worried, you see. It’s just… annoying, these hiccups! Well, thank you again, Doctor Fourney. I feel much better now. I’ll go and get the antacid tomorrow and see if that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sucich. That's what we’ll do. If they continue, or get worse, don't hesitate to call. And yes, they are annoying. Take care now. .
