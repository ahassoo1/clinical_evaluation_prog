DOCTOR: Hi San, welcome to San SCIARROTTA. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, but please call me Chriselda. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Chriselda. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to be frank, I need to get a card so I can keep driving. You know, for ride-sharing…and taxis, sometimes. It’s just…the regulations. I think it’s a commercial driver thing now? I just want to make sure I’m still allowed to do it. I really don't want any trouble with the law.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like you need a medical evaluation to ensure you meet the requirements for a commercial driver’s license – or in your case, to continue ride-sharing and using taxis legally. That’s perfectly alright, we do these evaluations frequently. Just to clarify, have you been actively driving for ride-sharing or using a taxi service recently, or is this more preventative to ensure you can continue?
PATIENT: Oh, actively, yes. Very actively. I've been doing it for…oh, goodness, almost three years now. It helps keep me busy, you know? And the money's good. It’s not a huge amount, but enough. So, it’s not preventative. I am currently driving, and I need this to keep doing it legally. I had a checkup last year with my regular doctor, but I don’t think it covered all this commercial driving stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, three years of active driving – good to know. And you're right, a standard checkup often doesn’t cover the specific requirements for commercial driving. No worries, we'll go through everything needed today. To start, can you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Hmm…overall health. Well, I’m seventy, so things are…creaky, naturally. My knees bother me sometimes, especially when it’s cold. And I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, but it doesn’t stop me from driving. I also get a little tired more easily than I used to, but I take breaks when I need to. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been controlled with medication for about five years now. Does that…cover it? Is there something specific you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s a really helpful start, thank you. Creaky joints, arthritis, fatigue, and controlled high blood pressure. We’ll definitely explore those a bit more. Let's start with the high blood pressure. What medication are you currently taking for that, and what’s the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think…it’s Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril. And the dosage……twenty milligrams, I think. Yes, twenty milligrams, once a day. I get it refilled at the pharmacy every month, so they should have a record of it. I haven’t changed the dosage in a long time. It seems to be working okay. My regular doctor checks it at my yearly appointments.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. That’s good information. And you said you get it refilled monthly. Have you had any side effects from the Lisinopril, or any other medications you're taking?
PATIENT: No, none that I’ve noticed, really. Sometimes, if I stand up too quickly, I get a little dizzy, but I just take it easy and it goes away. I don’t think that's from the medication, though. Just old age, probably! I don't take any other medications regularly, just some over-the-counter pain relievers for my arthritis when it really flares up. Nothing consistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional dizziness with quick movements, and over-the-counter pain relievers as needed for arthritis. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your arthritis for a moment. Where specifically do you experience the most discomfort, and how would you rate the pain on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my hands, my fingers mostly. It makes gripping things a little difficult sometimes, but not…terrible. And my wrists, a little. As for the pain level…hmm. On a good day, it’s maybe a 2 or 3. On a bad day, when it’s cold or I’ve been doing a lot of driving, it can get up to a 6 or 7. It doesn’t stop me from driving, but it’s definitely there. I try to use those little grippy things to open jars, you know? Helps a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, hands and wrists, with pain ranging from 2-7 depending on the day. That makes sense. And you've been using adaptive tools to help with gripping. That’s good proactive management. Now, shifting gears a little, have you had any vision changes recently?
PATIENT: Oh, vision. Hmm. Not really. I wear glasses, of course. I’ve had them for…oh, goodness, almost twenty years now. My prescription hasn’t changed much in the last few years. I had my eyes checked last year, and the doctor said they were fine. Sometimes things are a little blurry when I wake up, but that’s normal for me. I don't have any trouble seeing the road when I'm driving. I can read the signs just fine. I just… sometimes, at night, the glare from other cars is a little bothersome. Is that what you were asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I was asking. Glare at night is helpful to know. So, glasses, stable prescription, occasional glare. Before we move on to a quick physical exam, are there any other medical conditions you've been diagnosed with, or any surgeries you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder removed…oh, about thirty years ago, I think. And I had a hysterectomy when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. No other major surgeries. As for medical conditions… I was diagnosed with mild osteoporosis a few years ago, but I haven’t been on any treatment for it. My doctor said it wasn’t severe enough yet. And…oh, I had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but that cleared up with antibiotics. Does that cover it? I’m trying to remember everything. It’s…a lot.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, it is a lot to remember! Gallbladder removal, hysterectomy, mild osteoporosis, and bronchitis last winter. Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we move onto a quick physical exam, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. No, not really. I've never had a serious allergic reaction to anything. I might get a little itchy sometimes if I'm around cats, but that's just a mild sensitivity, not a true allergy. And no food allergies. I can eat anything. I'm pretty lucky that way. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Alright, San, let’s move onto a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. It won’t take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I don't mind. I've had plenty of physical exams in my life. Just let me know if anything feels…strange. I'm a little nervous about all this, to be honest, but I know it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I'll explain everything as I go, and please let me know if anything does feel strange. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your reflexes are good, and your coordination seems fine. Overall, everything sounds and looks good so far. I just want to check your vision briefly, using a Snellen chart. Do you have your glasses with you?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here they are. I wear these for everything, you know? Distance and reading. They're fairly new, I think. I hope they haven't gotten smudged. I try to keep them clean. I'm a little worried about failing the vision test, to be honest. That would be…a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, San, your vision is 20/30 with your glasses on, which is good. That meets the requirements for driving. Everything is looking very good so far. Now, just one final thing: I'm going to check your range of motion in your neck, shoulders, and arms. Just let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Your range of motion is a little stiff in your neck, but overall, it seems adequate. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate that. So…what does this all mean? Am I still allowed to drive? I really need to know, you understand? I rely on that income.
DOCTOR: Okay, San, based on the information you’ve provided and the results of the physical exam, I’m happy to tell you that you do meet the medical requirements to continue driving. Your vision is adequate, your neurological function is normal, and while you have some mild stiffness in your neck, it doesn’t pose a safety risk. I will complete the necessary paperwork for the Department of Motor Vehicles. I do recommend keeping up with regular checkups with your primary care physician to monitor your blood pressure and overall health. And managing any arthritis pain to maintain good range of motion. But as of today, you are medically cleared to continue driving. Does that relieve some of your worries?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness! Yes, that relieves a tremendous amount of worry. Thank you so much, Chriselda. You’ve been wonderful. I was so afraid I would lose my license. It’s not just the money, you know? It keeps me busy, it keeps me social. It gives me purpose. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. And for being so understanding. Can I…do I need to fill out any more forms? Or is this it?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, San. I'm glad I could reassure you. It’s important to me that my patients feel comfortable and safe. As for forms, I just need you to sign a couple of documents acknowledging that you understand the requirements for commercial driving and that you've truthfully answered all of my questions. They’re fairly straightforward. I’ll be right here if you have any questions while you're filling them out. After that, I’ll submit the paperwork to the DMV on your behalf. It usually takes a few weeks for them to process it. And again, please keep up with regular checkups with your primary care physician. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Okay, wonderful. This looks straightforward enough. Yes, I definitely will keep up with my checkups. I’ve been meaning to schedule one anyway. Here you go. I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Chriselda. You’ve been a lifesaver. I can go now, right? I don’t want to take up any more of your time.
DOCTOR: Perfect, everything looks good. Yes, you’re all set. I’ll submit these to the DMV right away. It will take a few weeks for them to process, and they may contact you directly if they need any further information. It was a pleasure meeting you, San. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the future. And drive safely! .
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you too, Chriselda. And thank you for everything. I will! I appreciate your kindness. Goodbye now! .
