DOCTOR: Good morning, Zelina. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, so let's just get this over with. It’s my breath. It smells…bad. Really bad, apparently. My ex-husband definitely made it clear.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s frustrating to have something like that bother you, and especially when it’s brought to your attention so directly. “Bad breath,” or halitosis, can have a lot of causes. To get a better idea of what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Look, I work on the highway. It's not exactly a perfume factory out there, okay? I’m around…stuff. Diesel, dirt, people who don’t exactly prioritize dental hygiene. I brush, sometimes. Is that what you need to know? I don't really see how I'm supposed to fix this when my job is, like, actively making my breath worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me some useful context. Working on the highway certainly exposes you to things that could contribute to this. And yes, it's helpful to know you do brush, even if it’s not every day. When you say "sometimes," roughly how often do you brush your teeth?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't quiz me, okay? It depends. When I remember. Maybe three or four times a week? Look, I have a lot on my plate. It’s not like I have time for a whole oral hygiene routine. And honestly? It didn't seem like a big deal until he started complaining.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four times a week. And it sounds like this has become more of a concern recently. Do you notice the bad breath consistently, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's pretty consistent, honestly. Though, after a long shift, especially if it's hot out, it's…noticeable. Like, really noticeable. People avoid me, which, honestly, isn't always a bad thing, but still. It’s embarrassing. Is there a pill or something I can just take? I don't have time for fancy mouthwashes and floss.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent, and worse after long shifts, especially in the heat. I understand you’re looking for something quick and easy. There aren’t really pills to eliminate bad breath, unfortunately. We need to figure out the cause to address it effectively. Besides brushing, do you do anything else for your teeth – use mouthwash, floss, see a dentist regularly?
PATIENT: See a dentist? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you worked on a highway? I don’t have money for dentists, okay? And no, I don't use mouthwash or floss. Waste of time and money. Look, I'm a highway worker, not a beauty queen. I need something practical. Is there like, a spray or something? Something I can just…use?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your situation. And I appreciate you being honest with me. A spray might offer some temporary relief, but it won't solve the underlying problem. Let's think through some possibilities. Sometimes bad breath can be related to things like dry mouth, or even sinus issues. Do you often feel like your mouth is dry?
PATIENT: Dry mouth? I guess so. It’s hot out there, like, all the time. We're wearing masks a lot of the day too, which, you know, doesn’t help. Plus, I drink a lot of coffee to stay awake. Is coffee bad for your breath? Seriously, just tell me what I need to stop doing, okay? I don’t need a lecture.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hot weather, masks, and a lot of coffee. Coffee can contribute to dry mouth and bad breath, yes. Masks can also dry out your mouth. Dry mouth is a very common cause of bad breath. I’d like to do a quick exam, if you’re okay with that. Just to check your mouth and throat, and make sure there’s nothing obvious going on. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don't expect me to be comfortable with a tongue depressor or anything. I’ve had a long day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. We’ll take it slow, and I'll explain everything as I go. First, let's just take a look inside your mouth. Please open wide for me. I'm just looking for any signs of dryness, inflammation, or anything unusual. Okay. Your gums look a little dry and slightly inflamed, but nothing immediately concerning. Your tongue appears coated. And I do notice a bit of dryness overall. This is consistent with what you've told me about the heat, masks, and coffee. Now, I'm going to gently feel around your jawline and neck, just to check for any swollen lymph nodes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…be quick. I’ve got things to do. And don't poke around too much. Honestly, this feels unnecessary. I’m a grown woman, I know when my breath smells bad. I don’t need you to tell me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. And you're right, you're perfectly capable of knowing when your breath smells bad. I’m just trying to rule out other possibilities. I don’t feel any swollen lymph nodes. Okay, everything seems relatively normal, aside from the dryness. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like your bad breath is likely due to a combination of dry mouth from the heat, masks, and coffee, and possibly a lack of frequent oral hygiene. It’s not something serious, but it can be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: So, what do I do? Stop drinking coffee? I need coffee to function. And I can’t just…not wear a mask at work. This is ridiculous. Is there a mouthwash that actually works? A really, really strong one? I’m willing to try it, I guess. But no floss. Absolutely no floss.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stopping coffee or masks isn’t realistic. We’ll work around that. A very strong mouthwash can offer some temporary relief, but it won't fix the underlying problem. It will mask the odor, but it won’t address the dryness. Here’s what I recommend. First, try to increase your water intake throughout the day. Staying hydrated will help combat the dry mouth. Second, look for a mouthwash specifically designed for dry mouth. They usually contain ingredients that help lubricate the mouth and neutralize odors. And third, even though you’re not keen on it, try to brush your teeth at least twice a day, especially after your shifts. As for the floss, it is important to remove food particles and plaque from between your teeth, but I understand your reluctance. We can focus on consistent brushing for now. Would you be willing to try these steps?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Water, dry mouth mouthwash, and brush more. I can do that, I guess. It’s better than nothing. Do you have any samples of this “dry mouth mouthwash”? I don't want to buy a whole bottle if it tastes terrible. And honestly, if it doesn’t work, I’m not coming back. I have better things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your hesitation. Here are a couple of samples. One is alcohol-free, which tends to be less drying, and the other has a slightly minty flavor. Try them both and see which one you prefer. If you don’t see any improvement after a week or so, we can discuss other options, such as a referral to a dentist. However, let's try these steps first and see if they make a difference. Do you have any questions about using the mouthwash or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No. I think I got it. Water, mouthwash, brush. Don't expect miracles, okay? I’m a highway worker, not a princess. Just…thanks, I guess. I’m gonna go now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Zelina. And I understand perfectly. Just remember to stay hydrated and be consistent with the oral hygiene. If you don’t see any improvement, or if you develop any other concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, and stay safe out there.
