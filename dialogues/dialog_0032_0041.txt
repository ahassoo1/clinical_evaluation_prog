DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Pipkorn. It is good to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s been getting worse, you see. It started slow, but now… now it’s harder to do things. Just… harder. I have been told it is something called Multiple Sclerosis. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Multiple Sclerosis, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s what the other doctors told me. A long time ago, now. I forget the name of the doctor who first told me… but it’s been with me a while. It's just… getting harder to walk, mostly. And my hands… they get tired easy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Astore, but I must say, relying on a diagnosis from a long time ago without reviewing records is… less than ideal. We need to confirm that diagnosis before proceeding. Tell me, have you had any recent imaging – MRIs, perhaps – or neurological evaluations?
PATIENT: Oh. Imaging… MRIs… I… I don’t think so. It was a long time ago, Doctor. And I’ve seen many doctors over the years. They did tests, of course, but I don’t remember what kind. I have Medicare, so I’ve been to a few places. It's all a bit… blurry, if you understand. I mostly just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Astore. It’s common for details to become less clear over time. Alright. Let's start with a thorough examination, and then we'll discuss ordering some updated imaging to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I know of, really. Just… old age, I suppose! My wife, Leilani, she worries about my blood pressure sometimes, but I don’t take any medicine for it. Just try to eat good food, you know? Nothing much else. I have been pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: “Pretty healthy” is good to hear, Mr. Astore, but even those who are generally well need regular check-ups. And uncontrolled blood pressure can certainly contribute to weakness. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam, are you currently experiencing any pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no real pain. Sometimes a little stiffness, especially in the mornings, but not pain. Just… tired. Very tired. And clumsy, I suppose. I dropped my coffee cup yesterday, made a big mess. Leilani wasn’t too happy! It's mostly the weakness and the tiredness, that’s what bothers me the most.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's begin with a neurological exam. I’ll be checking your reflexes, strength, coordination, and balance. It will involve some simple movements and responses. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. If you could sit here for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds alright. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I’ll try my best. I am not as quick as I used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore. First, let’s check your reflexes. Please relax your legs, and I’ll gently tap a few points on your knees and ankles. Just let your legs fall loose, don’t tense up. Now the other leg…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Oh! That tickles a bit. And… feels a little strange. Is that normal? I don't think I have had this done in a long time. It makes my leg jump. Is that what is supposed to happen?
DOCTOR: It is normal to feel a slight tap and for your leg to jump, Mr. Astore. The response is a little diminished, which isn’t necessarily cause for immediate concern, but we'll need to investigate further. Now, could you please interlock your fingers and pull against my resistance?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can do that. It’s… a little harder than it used to be. My hands… they get tired so quickly. I don’t know if I am pulling as hard as I should. Are you feeling any resistance?
DOCTOR: I am, Mr. Astore, but it’s considerably less than expected for someone your age. We'll need to document this. Now, let's check your coordination. Could you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger with yours?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Oh dear. That’s… not as smooth as it used to be. My hands are shaking a little bit, you see? Is that bad? I am trying my best, but it’s difficult.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Astore. You’re doing fine. We simply need to gather as much information as possible. Now, I’d like you to stand up slowly, if you’re able. And I'm going to observe your balance. Please take your time.
PATIENT: Oh… whoa. It’s a little… wobbly, Doctor. I don’t have as good of balance as I used to. It makes me nervous, you see. I am afraid of falling. It’s better when I am sitting down.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Astore. It’s perfectly alright to be cautious. Please, sit back down. Based on this initial examination, your weakness, diminished reflexes, and instability are concerning. While it’s possible this is related to a previous diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, we need to rule out other potential causes. I recommend we order an MRI of the brain and spine, and a comprehensive blood panel. This will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood work… Yes, that sounds… thorough. Will the MRI tell us what is wrong? And will the blood work help? I just want to know what is going on, you see. And I want to feel better. My wife, Leilani, she worries a lot. Is this going to be expensive? My Medicare… will it cover all of this?
DOCTOR: The MRI will provide detailed images of your brain and spinal cord, which can help us identify any structural abnormalities or lesions. The blood work will assess your overall health and rule out other potential causes of your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies or inflammatory conditions. Regarding cost, Medicare should cover the majority of these tests, but there may be a copay or deductible. Our billing department will review your coverage and provide you with an estimated cost breakdown before proceeding. I will also submit a referral to Neurology to get their expert opinion. It’s important to get a comprehensive evaluation to ensure we’re providing you with the best possible care. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… good. Neurology… that makes sense. More experts… that’s a good idea. And if Medicare covers it, that is a relief. I just want to get this figured out, you see. And I want to be able to spend time with my wife, Leilani. She does so much for me. So, what do we need to do now? Do I need to make an appointment for the MRI? And should I fast for the blood work?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Astore. We'll get this sorted out. Yes, you will need to schedule an appointment for the MRI. I will provide you with a written order and a list of local imaging centers. As for the blood work, yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours beforehand. No food or drink except water. I will also give you a separate form for that. My nurse, Maria, will be in shortly to provide you with those forms and schedule those appointments. She's very efficient and will explain everything in detail. In the meantime, I’ll write up my findings and send the referral to Neurology. Do you have any questions for me before Maria arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience. It’s a relief to finally be getting some answers. I am sure Maria will be very helpful. Thank you. And thank you for listening to me. It’s been a long time since someone really listened.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Astore. It’s my job to listen. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if any questions arise. I'll have Maria come in now. Maria, could you please come in here for a moment?
