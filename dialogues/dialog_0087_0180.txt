DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantorán. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it's... it's a long story, and frankly, I don't have a lot of time for stories. I'm just... tired. Really tired. And I... I eat dirt. Okay? Is that enough? I just want something to fix it, you know? Don't need a whole life story.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantorán. I understand you're feeling very tired, and you've been ingesting dirt. We can certainly address that. To help me understand what's going on and find the best way to help, I will need to ask a few questions, even if it feels like a story. It's important for me to get a clear picture. First, when you say "dirt," could you describe what kind of dirt?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't know. It's… brown. Earthy. From the garden, mostly. Sometimes... I don't even think about it. I just… feel like I need it. It's stupid, I know! Don't look at me like that. It's not like I want to eat dirt, it's just... a feeling. A craving. And it started… a while ago. I don't remember exactly when. A few months, maybe? Before… before my husband. Things are all a bit blurry now.
DOCTOR: Okay. It doesn’t sound stupid at all, Ms. Cantorán. It's good you’re telling me this. And it's alright that you don't remember the exact timing. We'll try to sort through it. This craving for dirt… does it happen at a specific time of day, or is it random?
PATIENT: Random. Mostly. Sometimes when I'm really… stressed, I guess. Or tired, like now. It’s not like a schedule. I don't wake up and think, “Oh, time for some dirt.” It just... happens. I feel weak, and then... I need it. It's hard to explain. Look, are we getting anywhere? I have things to do, you know. I don't just sit around eating dirt all day. Though, clearly, I do some of the time. But not on purpose!
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Cantorán, we are getting somewhere. It sounds like the cravings may be related to stress and fatigue. I want to rule out any underlying medical causes for both the cravings and the fatigue. I'm going to ask you some quick questions – just a series of 'yes' or 'no' questions, if that's alright. It will help me narrow down what might be going on. And then we’ll do a quick physical exam. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh, more questions? Fine, whatever. Just… get it over with. Yes or no, right? That’s good. Simple. Just… hurry, please. I really don’t have all day. And try not to make me think too hard. My head's been fuzzy lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. First question: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, besides the cravings for dirt?
PATIENT: Changes? Well... I don't really try to eat much, if I’m honest. Food just... doesn’t taste like much anymore. I eat enough to get by, I suppose. But no, no big changes. It’s not like I’m starving or anything. Just… bland. Everything tastes bland. Does that count as a change? Look, can we just skip the food questions? They’re not important. I eat dirt, remember? That’s the problem!
DOCTOR: Right, you eat dirt. Noted. And we will address that. Alright. Next question: Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Ugh, weight loss? Honestly, I don’t know. I don’t weigh myself. Why would I? Look at me, do I look like I’ve lost weight? Probably not. I’ve always been… this size. A little… round. I haven't been feeling well enough to even think about weighing myself, frankly. Just… skip it. It’s a waste of time. Are we getting closer to a solution yet? I need something for this tiredness. And maybe something to stop me from... you know. This dirt thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantorán. I’m going to move on, then. Have you noticed any bleeding, bruising, or unusual spots on your skin?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Bruising? No. Not really. Maybe a little… I bump into things a lot. I’m clumsy, okay? Always have been. But no unusual spots, no. Nothing that I’ve noticed, anyway. Look, can we just… skip the body questions? I don’t like thinking about all this. It’s depressing. And honestly, I’m not sure I’d even notice a little bruise. I don’t pay much attention to… details. Just fix me, okay? That's all I want.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can skip the detailed questions for now. I’m going to perform a quick physical exam. This will include checking your heart rate, blood pressure, listening to your lungs, and feeling your abdomen. I'll also take a look at your hands and skin. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… be gentle, okay? My joints ache. And don't poke around too much. Honestly, I really hate doctors. Always poking and prodding. But… I suppose I need to do this, if it's going to get me fixed. Just… hurry. Please. I have errands to run. And I really don’t want to spend the whole day in here.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible, Ms. Cantorán. I understand your discomfort. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Heart rate is a little elevated at 92, and lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90. Now I'm going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant, no guarding or rebound tenderness. Now let's take a look at your hands… Any pain with these movements?
PATIENT: Ugh, my hands always ache. Especially when it’s cold. And that… upper right thing? That always bothers me. Just… a dull ache. It’s been like that for years, honestly. I just assumed it was… old age. Or stress. I don’t know. Everything aches these days. Don't poke too hard, please! Are you seeing anything? Just tell me if it’s bad. I don't need a whole explanation. Just… fix it. That’s all I care about. I don’t have time for medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantorán. I've finished the quick exam. I noticed some mild swelling in your hands and some tenderness in your upper right quadrant as you mentioned. Your skin appears slightly pale. Given your fatigue, cravings for dirt – which is a condition called pica – and the findings of my exam, I'd like to order some blood work to check for iron deficiency anemia, vitamin deficiencies, and liver function. I also want to rule out any other underlying causes for your symptoms. Do you have any allergies to medications, or are you currently taking any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, blood work? Fantastic. Just what I needed. No allergies, no. And… vitamins? I don't think so. I had some fish oil a while back, but I stopped taking it. It didn’t seem to do anything. Honestly, I don’t bother with all that stuff. It’s just… a waste of money. So… just the blood work, right? How long is that going to take? And will it make me even more tired? I can barely keep my eyes open as it is. And can we please, please get to the part where you tell me what's wrong and what I can do about it? I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. The blood work will take approximately 30-45 minutes to process. It may cause a little bit of fatigue, but it should be minimal. Once I have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, given your history of craving dirt and your fatigue, I recommend temporarily increasing your iron intake with an over-the-counter iron supplement. However, please do not start taking anything until we review your blood work results, as too much iron can be harmful. We'll also need to discuss the potential underlying causes for your pica. Pica can be associated with several factors, including iron deficiency, nutritional deficiencies, stress, and underlying mental health conditions. We may need to consider a referral to a mental health professional, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh, more waiting? This is ridiculous! So, no dirt, no iron... just sit here and be tired? Look, I’m not going to a mental health professional. That's… that’s just silly. I'm not crazy! I just eat dirt sometimes. It's a habit, okay? A bad habit. Don’t make it into something bigger than it is. So… just the blood work, then? And I’ll wait? Fine. But if this takes too long, I'm leaving. Honestly, I have better things to do. And please, just tell me when the results are back. Don't bother with the explanations, okay? Just tell me what to do. Simple. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Cantorán, that’s not too much to ask. I'll let you know as soon as the results are back. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take care of you. I understand your frustration and desire for a quick solution, and I assure you I’ll do my best to provide one as soon as possible. Once the results are in, we will discuss them, and I will outline a plan of action. In the meantime, please try to rest and avoid eating dirt. And please, don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening symptoms. Here’s the form. Let me know if you need any help finding the lab. .
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Thanks. . .
