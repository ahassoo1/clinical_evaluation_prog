DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a…reset, you know? A jumpstart to feeling better. I’m not really sure how to explain it beyond that. I just haven’t been myself lately.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Feeling stuck" can be a very valid reason to seek medical attention. It sounds like you're experiencing a general sense of not feeling well. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about how you haven't been yourself lately?
PATIENT: Yes, that's a good way to put it. It’s hard to pinpoint. I have less energy, certainly. And…I used to really enjoy my work, shaping things, creating…but even that feels like a chore now. It’s not a physical tiredness, exactly, more…mental, I suppose. Like the joy is gone from things. I also haven’t been sleeping well, though I wouldn’t say I’m insomniac. Just…restless. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Reduced energy, loss of interest in activities you previously enjoyed, and restless sleep are all important details. It sounds like we need to explore this further. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about the sleep issue?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t wake up feeling tired, not necessarily. It's more that I toss and turn a lot. I find myself thinking…a lot. About work, about family… just things. And it takes me a while to drift off. Sometimes I’ll get up and read for a bit, and then fall asleep. It’s not every night, but it’s happening more and more frequently. I don't really worry about counting sheep or anything, it just…happens. Is there a particular type of question you're hoping to ask? I want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Pitzel. No, I don’t have a specific question at this moment. I am simply trying to gather as much information as possible. Let’s move on to other areas. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: That's alright. I'm glad I can help. As for my appetite… it’s diminished, I suppose. I used to enjoy cooking, and a good meal with my husband. Now…it feels like effort. I don’t really crave anything. I eat, because I know I should, more than because I want to. I haven’t lost a significant amount of weight, if that’s what you’re wondering, but it’s definitely less than usual. My husband has mentioned it a few times.
DOCTOR: Thank you. A decrease in appetite and a loss of enjoyment in previously pleasurable activities are both relevant. Now, I'm going to ask about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Nothing major, really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing lasting. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been well-managed with medication. Otherwise…no. I’ve always been quite healthy, to be honest. And I'm on Medicare, so I do try to keep up with my check-ups. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does. I see here you are indeed being treated for hypertension. And you mentioned being on medication for that, could you please list the medications you are currently taking, including dosages?
PATIENT: Certainly. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once daily. And…that’s it. Just the Lisinopril. I’ve been on the same dose for about five years now, and it seems to be doing its job. My doctor monitors it regularly. I don't take any vitamins, herbal supplements or anything else. I prefer to stick to what's prescribed.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything a doctor has given me. I sometimes get a bit of a rash with certain soaps, but that's hardly a medical allergy, is it? I haven’t had anything serious. I don’t even get stung by mosquitoes very often. Lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had diabetes, type 2, later in life. And my father…he had heart problems, a weak heart, I think. He passed away when I was still fairly young. My husband’s side…his mother had arthritis, I believe. Nothing terribly alarming, really. A lot of the usual things, perhaps. We weren't a particularly close family, so I don't know a lot of the details. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Diabetes and heart disease are important to know. Finally, before we move on to a physical examination, could you briefly describe your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I'm married, as I mentioned. My husband and I live in a quiet rural area, we've been here for almost thirty years. I used to be very involved in the local crafting community, but…to be honest, I haven’t been as active lately. I enjoy reading, and spending time with my family when they visit. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. Mostly, we keep to ourselves. A quiet life. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: No, that provides a good overview. Thank you. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then I’d like to quickly assess your reflexes and neurological function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Please proceed. I understand that's part of the process. I trust your judgment, of course. Just let me know if anything feels…unusual. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Blood pressure is 138/82. That's slightly elevated, but not dramatically so, given your history. Auscultating lungs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Auscultating heart. Heart rate is regular, no murmurs noted. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. No sensory deficits noted. Neurologically, everything appears intact. Overall, the physical exam doesn’t reveal any acute concerns. However, given your symptoms – the fatigue, loss of interest, restless sleep, diminished appetite – and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems like a good idea. Anything that might help to figure out what's going on. I'm happy to do whatever is necessary. What kind of blood work are we talking about? Just so I have an idea of what to expect.
DOCTOR: I’m going to order a Complete Blood Count to check for anemia and infection, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel to assess your kidney and liver function, thyroid stimulating hormone to rule out thyroid issues, Vitamin D level, and a basic lipid panel. We'll also check your HbA1c to get a better picture of your average blood sugar levels over the past few months. It's a fairly standard panel, and should give us a good starting point. You can have this done at the lab just down the street. They’re open until 5:00 PM today. Once the results are back, usually within a few days, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very reasonable. A standard panel is perfectly fine. I’m happy to get that done. Down the street is convenient as well. A few days is perfectly acceptable for the results. And then we'll schedule a follow-up, to discuss everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. I feel a bit better already, just having a plan in place. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any particular foods I should avoid or anything?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I'm glad you feel better having a plan. In the meantime, I wouldn’t make any significant dietary changes just yet. Focus on maintaining a healthy diet, staying hydrated, and getting regular, moderate exercise if you're able. Continue to monitor your symptoms, and if anything worsens or you develop new concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the office. And most importantly, try to get some rest. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’ll have my nurse schedule that follow-up appointment for you now. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything. You've been very helpful, and I truly appreciate your time and attention. Please do let my nurse schedule that follow-up, and I'll wait to hear from you. Thank you again, and have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. It was a pleasure meeting you. I’ll let my nurse know to call you with an appointment time. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Have a good day as well, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up. .
