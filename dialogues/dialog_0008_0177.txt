DOCTOR: Good morning, Jimmi. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… well, it's a problem down there. A little leaky, you know? Not good. I don't usually talk about these things, but it’s been happening for a bit now. It's…discharge. That’s what the nice lady at the front desk said to call it, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Down there” – you mean vaginal discharge?
PATIENT: Vaginal? No, no, not vaginal. Men have… different parts. It’s… from him. From the… you know. The thing you pee with. It’s not right, leaking like that. I haven't been with anyone for… a long, long time, so it shouldn't be happening. Does that make sense? I don’t really understand all the medical words.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're referring to discharge from your urethra – the tube you urinate through. And you're right to be concerned about it happening when you haven't been sexually active recently. That’s… unusual. To help me understand what’s going on, can you describe the discharge?
PATIENT: Describe it? Hmm… well, it's… wet. Obviously. And… kinda yellowish. Not a bright yellow, more… faded. Like old straw, maybe? And it doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it feels…icky. Sticky, you know? And there's a smell… not a bad smell, but not… fresh. I'm not good at explaining. It's just… not normal for a man, is it? I keep cleaning it, but it just comes back.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish discharge, not painful but “icky” and sticky, with a noticeable odor. You're right, that's not typical for a man. It sounds like we need to investigate this further. Have you noticed any burning or pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: Burning? No, not really. It feels… normal when I go. A little slow sometimes, now that I think about it, but not painful. I thought I was just getting old, you know? Old men things. I don’t have much trouble holding it, just takes a bit longer to get going. And no fever, no chills, nothing like that. Just… the leakin’. It's embarrassing, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no burning, no fever, no chills, just a slower stream and the discharge. Alright. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What do you mean? Like… going to the bathroom? Everything’s pretty much the same down there, honestly. Maybe a little constipated sometimes, but that’s just from not eating enough fruit. Why are you asking about that? Is it related to the leakin’? It all feels very… connected, if you know what I mean. Like one problem is causing another. I just want it fixed, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jimmi, and you're right to wonder if everything is connected. I ask about bowel habits because sometimes issues with the prostate can cause both urinary and bowel symptoms. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Hmm… let me think. Old age, mostly! I had a bad knee a few years back, had to have a shot for it. And the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once, but he just told me to eat less salt. That’s about it, really. I haven’t been to the doctor much. I try to stay healthy. I paint a lot, keeps me busy. And I don’t really believe in all these fancy tests and diagnoses. Just fix what's broken, that's what I always say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of knee pain and borderline high blood pressure, but generally healthy. No major medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Oh! Yes, I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. A long, long time ago. And… I think I had a mole removed from my back once, but I don't remember much about it. It was just a little thing. That’s it, I think. No big operations or anything. Nothing recent, anyway. Why does all this matter, Doctor? Is it going to take a long time to fix the leakin’? I have a painting to finish, you know. It’s a landscape, very important.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and a mole removal. Just routine things. I ask about your history to get a complete picture of your health, Jimmi. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I can eat anything. I like spicy food, actually. And I haven't taken any medicine in years, except for a little pain reliever for my knee sometimes. Just the over-the-counter kind. Nothing fancy. I’m not a sickly person, Doctor. I really don’t understand why this is happening to me. It’s embarrassing, and I just want it gone. Can’t you just give me something to stop the leakin’? Something simple?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jimmi. I wish I could just give you something to fix it immediately, but it’s important to figure out why it’s happening first. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I don’t believe in all that stuff. Vitamins and supplements… just a waste of money, if you ask me. I get all my nutrients from my food. I eat plenty of fish, lots of fruit, and I drink water. I try to stay natural, you know? No pills, no powders, no anything. Just good, healthy living. Why do you keep asking about these things, Doctor? It's just the leakin'! It's not complicated.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Okay. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Oh… goodness. What does that involve? I haven't had one of those in… well, a very long time. Will it be… uncomfortable? I don't like being poked and prodded. And are you going to need to… you know… look down there? Honestly, Doctor, I’m getting a little nervous now. Is there anything else you need to know before you start?
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Jimmi. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. The exam will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and then a brief examination of the genital area. It will involve looking at the area and gently feeling it. It shouldn’t be painful, but you might feel some mild discomfort. We need to check for any signs of infection or inflammation. It’s important to rule out anything serious. I'll explain everything as I go, and you can tell me to stop at any time. Would you like me to step out and get a chaperone to be with us during the exam?
PATIENT: Oh… a chaperone? That sounds… better. Yes, please. That would make me feel much more comfortable. I don’t like the idea of… everything being so exposed. And please, explain everything before you touch anything. I need to know what you’re doing. I just… I’m an old woman, Doctor. I don't like surprises. It's embarrassing enough as it is. Can you get the chaperone first? Then we can talk about what you’re going to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. That’s perfectly reasonable. Let me get a nurse to come in with us. One moment, please.
