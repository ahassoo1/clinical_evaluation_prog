DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's this…itchiness. Everywhere, really. It's been going on for a few weeks now, and it's driving me a bit crazy. Not painful, just…constantly itchy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A persistent itch can certainly be very bothersome. A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, about three weeks now, I think. Maybe a little longer. It started gradually, just little spots here and there, and now…well, it’s all over. My arms, my back, even my legs. I keep thinking it’s just dry skin, but lotion doesn't seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is the itch constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's pretty constant, to be honest. Some times it's worse than others, but it’s always there, nagging at me. Especially at night, that’s when it really gets bad. Keeps me up sometimes. I’ve tried different soaps, thinking maybe I’m reacting to something new, but nothing seems to make a difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And have you noticed any changes in your skin besides the itchiness?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… well, there was a bit of redness at first, where it started. But that faded pretty quickly. Now it's mostly just…normal looking skin, but itchy. No bumps, no blisters, no oozing… nothing like that. Just red when I scratch, naturally. I haven’t noticed anything else, no. I really don't think so.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you traveled anywhere recently, or been exposed to anything unusual – new plants, detergents, anything like that?
PATIENT: No traveling, Doctor. I haven’t left this town in…oh, must be close to a year now. And no new plants, no. I keep a small garden, mostly tomatoes and cucumbers, same as always. Detergent… well, my wife used to do the laundry, God rest her soul. I just use whatever’s in the bottle now, haven't switched brands or anything. It’s the same stuff she always used.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney disease, or liver problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I was always pretty healthy, thankfully. High blood pressure, the doctor had me on a little pill for that for a while, but that’s it. Nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose. I haven't seen a doctor regularly since…well, since my wife passed. It's been about five years now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. And are you currently taking any medications, besides that blood pressure pill you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, not anymore. The doctor took me off the blood pressure pill a couple of years ago. Said I was doing well enough on my own. Just a daily multivitamin, if that counts. And occasionally some ibuprofen for my knees, when they’re acting up. But that's it. Really. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to help my wife with her baking, and she used all sorts of things, and I never had any trouble. I eat pretty much everything. No known allergies at all. I don’t think so, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you have a family history of skin conditions, like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother, she had… something with her skin, when she was older. It wasn't bad, just a bit of dryness, mostly in the winter. The doctor said it was just old age, I think. My father, he was always perfectly healthy. No, I don't think anyone else in the family had anything serious with their skin. Just my mother’s dryness, really. It wasn't anything contagious or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. That will involve taking a look at your skin, of course, and perhaps listening to your heart and lungs, just to get a general picture of your health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Absolutely. Whatever you need to do. I'm ready whenever you are. I just want to get this itch figured out. It's really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you don't mind, please remove your shirt and we'll take a look. I will need to examine your back, arms, and legs. I'll try to be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, Mr. Ferneding. I’m not seeing any obvious rash, bumps, or lesions. Your skin appears generally normal in color and texture, except for some very subtle excoriations – small scratches – likely from the itching. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Do you feel any tenderness anywhere on your body?
PATIENT: No tenderness, Doctor. Not at all. Just…itchy. Everywhere. It doesn't hurt when I touch it, just…irritated. Like a constant prickling sensation. It's hard to describe. You don't see anything obvious, huh? I was worried it might be something serious.
DOCTOR: No, I don't see anything that immediately indicates a serious condition. However, that doesn’t mean we can’t figure out what’s causing this. Given your history, the lack of any visible rash, and the widespread nature of the itch, there are a few possibilities we should explore. It could be something as simple as dry skin exacerbated by a change in environment, though you mentioned lotion isn’t helping. It could also be a reaction to something subtle, a new laundry detergent ingredient, or even stress. Rarely, it could be something internal, like kidney or liver issues, but given your good health history, that’s less likely. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order some basic blood work. It will check your kidney and liver function, as well as rule out any underlying inflammation. I also recommend a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood work is fine. I’d rather be sure than not, you know? It’s just… I’m not a fan of doctors, to be honest. But I understand you’re just trying to figure it out. If you think it’s a good idea, let’s do the blood work. Medicare should cover that, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare should cover the necessary tests. I will send the order to the lab downstairs, and they'll draw a few vials of blood. It typically takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to moisturize your skin twice a day, even if it doesn’t provide much relief. Avoid harsh soaps and detergents, and try to wear loose-fitting clothing made of breathable fabrics like cotton. Also, try to manage any stress you might be experiencing. While we wait for the results, if the itching becomes significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms – such as fever, fatigue, or changes in your urine or stool – please contact the clinic immediately. We want to rule out anything serious. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Moisturize, loose clothes, avoid stress… easier said than done, but I’ll try. And I’ll be sure to contact you if anything changes. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure out a plan. It's reassuring to know we're doing something. Thank you. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or any paperwork I need to fill out?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Let me just print out a lab requisition form for you to take downstairs. It includes instructions on how to prepare for the blood draw – mostly just being well-hydrated. And here's a handout with some general tips on managing chronic itch, including information on potential triggers and soothing measures. There is no paperwork to fill out beyond this, as I have everything I need already. Once you've had the blood work done, let the lab know to send the results directly to our clinic. The receptionist will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the next steps. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate your time and your patience. I’ll head down to the lab now and get the blood work done. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes up before your follow-up appointment. I hope you find some relief soon. Have a good day.
