DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Andraca. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Andraca, you said? Right. Well, it’s this… shaking. In my hands, mostly. Been happening for a bit now, I guess. Honestly, time gets away from me these days. It's just… annoying, mostly. Makes things difficult. I don’t know what it is, that's why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik. Annoying shaking, you said, mostly in your hands. And you've noticed it happening for a little while now. Can you tell me more about when it started?
PATIENT: When it started… Hmm. That’s a tough one. Probably… last year, maybe? Or the year before? It came on slowly, you see. Didn't just happen one day. Just… got worse over time. It’s hard to pinpoint. I don’t really keep track of those things.
DOCTOR: I understand, it's perfectly alright if you don’t have an exact date. “Slowly getting worse” is helpful to know. And is the shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Definitely. It's worse when I… try to do something precise. Like, buttoning my coat, or using a screwdriver. Things like that. When I’m just sitting, it’s usually not so bad. But then I’ll reach for something and… whoop. There it is again. It's frustrating, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can imagine that's very frustrating. So it seems to be exacerbated by activities requiring fine motor skills. Does anything else seem to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Better… not really. Nothing I’ve noticed, anyway. Coffee doesn't seem to make it worse, but it doesn't help, if that makes sense. Stress, maybe? I feel it when I’m agitated, but I’m always a little agitated these days, so it’s hard to tell. Honestly, I just try not to think about it. Easier that way.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Mr. Jezik. It’s good you’ve noticed it doesn’t seem to be affected by caffeine, and that stress might play a role – even if it’s hard to pinpoint. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. My handwriting's gotten worse, I suppose. Always was messy, but now… it’s almost illegible. And sometimes… sometimes my muscles feel a little stiff. Mostly in my arms, I think. But it’s not constant, like the shaking. Just… comes and goes. Is that what you mean by symptoms?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean. Worsening handwriting and occasional muscle stiffness are helpful to know. Now, let's talk a little about your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Well, I had the usual things, I suppose. High blood pressure, years ago. They gave me some pills for it. Stopped taking them after a while, didn’t seem to be doing much good. And… I had my gallbladder out, must be twenty years ago now. Other than that… not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that was treated with medication, and gallbladder removal twenty years ago. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications right now. Stopped the blood pressure pills a long time ago, like I said. And I don't really bother with vitamins or supplements. Waste of money, if you ask me. Just eat a sensible diet, that’s what my mother always said. Though, I haven't been eating so sensibly lately…
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… nope. Not that I know of, anyway. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve always been pretty lucky, health-wise. Though, like I said, this shaking is a new one. Makes me wonder what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know you don’t have any known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family. Do you have any family history of similar symptoms – like tremors or shaking – or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Neurological conditions… Hmm. My mother’s brother, my Uncle Jan… he had some problems with his balance, later in life. Kept falling, you see. They said it was something with his… nerves, I think. And my cousin, on my wife’s side… she had Parkinson’s, but she lived in Czechoslovakia and I didn’t see her much. Other than that… not that I recall. My family… we mostly died of old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of balance problems in your mother’s brother and Parkinson’s disease in a cousin on your wife's side. That's helpful information. And finally, let's briefly touch on your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… I used to enjoy a glass of beer with dinner sometimes, but that was years ago. Haven’t had a drink in… oh, must be ten years now. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. Never been interested in any of that nonsense. I'm a simple man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical examination. I’ll check your reflexes, coordination, and look for any other signs that might help us understand what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Examination… alright, I suppose. Get it over with, right? The sooner we figure out what's going on, the better. Just… be gentle, please. My hands are a bit sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, so I'm seeing a tremor in your hands, even at rest. It seems to be more prominent when you extend your arms. Now, can you tap your finger to your thumb repeatedly as quickly as possible?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… not easy. Feels like I’m fighting against it. It's getting worse just doing this, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. The tremor is present and seems to be exacerbated with attempted movement. Now, let’s check your coordination. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: I'm trying… it's a little difficult to keep my eyes steady. And my neck's starting to ache.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I'll gently tap on your knee and ask you to relax your leg. And that one… and this one. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, but still present. Now, let's check your muscle tone. Can you gently squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: There. Not as strong as they used to be, I’m afraid. Everything’s getting a bit… frail.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me and the findings of the examination – the tremor, diminished reflexes, and mild weakness – there are several possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to age, essential tremor, or potentially something else. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, like thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. And, I would also like to order a neurological consultation. A neurologist can perform more specialized tests to help determine the exact cause of your tremor. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and a neurologist… sounds… thorough, I suppose. Anything to get to the bottom of it. Reasonable. Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Just… how long will all this take? I don't have a lot of time to spare, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Jezik. The blood tests should be processed within a few days, and I’ll call you as soon as the results are available. Getting an appointment with a neurologist can take a bit longer, perhaps a few weeks, but I’ll do my best to expedite the process. I'll have my assistant schedule that for you. In the meantime, I recommend trying to avoid any activities that significantly worsen your tremor. Try to get enough rest and maintain a healthy diet, as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything pretty clearly. Just… try to hurry, alright? I appreciate that. And thank you, Doctor. For taking the time to listen. It’s… reassuring, to finally be doing something about it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Jezik. I understand your desire to get things moving quickly, and I’ll do everything I can. My assistant, Sarah, will come in shortly to schedule the appointment and draw the blood samples. Here's a copy of the lab order for you. If you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – like difficulty walking, speech changes, or severe weakness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. It was nice meeting you, and I hope we can get some answers soon. Take care, Mr. Jezik.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
