DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kovtun, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Billman. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Just the results, please. I got the email saying they were ready, and I wanted to go over them while they’re fresh in my head. I don’t have time to rehash everything, if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's... efficient. It is generally helpful for me to understand the context, but if you’re certain… Let me pull up your results here. Okay. So, your complete blood count, metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests are back. Frankly, it looks…pretty unremarkable. Everything is within normal limits. Your cholesterol is a little high, but honestly, that's not uncommon for someone your age. Do you have any questions about specific numbers, or were you just wanting me to confirm they were…fine?
PATIENT: Okay, good. “Fine” is good. Cholesterol…how high is “a little high”? And is that something I need to…deal with now, or is it a “keep an eye on it” kind of thing? I'd rather not start any medications if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Well, "a little high" is 220 milligrams per deciliter. Ideal is under 200. It’s not alarming, Ms. Kovtun, but it is something we should address. Look, genetics play a role, diet plays a role… being Tahitian, you might be predisposed to it. We could start with lifestyle modifications. Diet – cut back on saturated fats, more fiber. Exercise. And honestly, losing a few pounds wouldn't hurt. Let's try that for three months and retest. If it hasn’t improved, then we can discuss medication. I don't like to jump straight to pills when it's avoidable. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, I get it. Diet and exercise. I can do that. Three months. Is there anything else? Because honestly, my schedule is pretty tight.
DOCTOR: Well, your blood pressure was slightly elevated in the office today – 138/85. It could be white coat syndrome, or simply stress. We should monitor that at home. I’ll have the nurse print out a blood pressure log for you. Keep track for a week and bring it in with your next visit. And frankly, given your height and weight, you’re a little overweight. Not critically, but it contributes to both the blood pressure and the cholesterol. So, diet and exercise aren’t just good ideas, they're…necessary. Any family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes, by the way?
PATIENT: Um… my grandmother on my mother’s side had high blood pressure, I think. And my uncle… he had type 2 diabetes, but he didn’t really take care of himself. Smoked a lot. Is that everything? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Okay. Family history is… relevant. That increases your risk. Here’s the blood pressure log, and this is a handout on dietary modifications for lowering cholesterol and blood pressure. It’s fairly straightforward. So, to recap: monitor your blood pressure, improve your diet, and… consider some exercise. Come back in three months with the log and we'll retest your cholesterol. If it’s not improving, then we'll talk about medication. Any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Thank you. I appreciate you not wasting my time. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye, Ms. Kovtun. Try to take better care of yourself. .
