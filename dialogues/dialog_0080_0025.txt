DOCTOR: Hi Laury, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I want to know more about where my family come from, long time ago. I hear you can do a test with spit... to find out? About ancestors.
DOCTOR: That's right, Laury. We can absolutely do a genetic ancestry test with a saliva sample. It can give you a fascinating look at your origins and trace your family's history. It's become quite popular. Before we proceed with that, though, I just want to make sure I have a good understanding of your overall health. Sometimes ancestry tests can reveal information that might have medical implications, so it’s good to be prepared. First, have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly good. Old bones get a little achy sometimes, you know? But nothing bad. I still work with wood, make little boats. Keeps me busy. I eat fish, mostly. And taro. Is that okay? For the test?
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Laury – staying active is wonderful! And yes, eating fish and taro is perfectly fine. Neither of those will interfere with the test at all. "Old bones getting a little achy" is pretty common, of course. Do you have any pain anywhere specifically?
PATIENT: My knees, mostly. When it rains, they get worse. And my back… sometimes when I bend to pick up wood. But I manage. I take some pills sometimes, the white ones… the doctor gave me before. I forget the name.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees and back pain, worse with the rain. That's helpful information. And you're taking white pills for it, that you got from a previous doctor. Do you remember approximately when you started taking those pills?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Maybe... two years ago? Or maybe three? I see Doctor Miller before, but he moved away. He gave me the pills. Small white ones. I just keep getting more from the pharmacy when I run out. I don’t think about the date much, Doctor. Everything feels slow these days.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Laury, it’s perfectly normal to not remember exact dates. "Small white pills" isn't quite enough information to know what they are, but we can look that up in your records. Do you have any allergies to any medications, or to anything else, like foods or bee stings?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. I grew up on the island, you know? We ate what we could get. Never had any trouble with anything. Bee sting… maybe once, when I was little, but nothing bad. Just a little hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. And you have Medicare insurance, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Medicare. They cover most things, I think. I get the card every year. Everything is a little confusing, though. So many papers! Is the ancestry test covered?
DOCTOR: You’re right, the paperwork can be a bit overwhelming! Unfortunately, ancestry tests are generally not covered by Medicare, as they’re considered elective, not medically necessary. But we can definitely discuss the cost and options. Before we go further with the ancestry test, I’d like to quickly review your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious conditions, like heart problems, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… Doctor Miller, he checked my blood pressure once. Said it was a little high, but he gave me some pills for that too. Small blue ones. I take those every day. I think that’s all. Never had any heart trouble. And no… not diabetes. I don’t eat much sugar. Just the fruit sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take small blue pills for high blood pressure. That's helpful. And no history of diabetes or heart problems. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm... when I was a young man, I cut my leg bad on some coral. They fixed it at the hospital, but it was a long time ago. Just that one time. Everything else, I take care of myself. I’m a strong man, even now! It was just a little cut, really. Not a big deal. They cleaned it and wrapped it. Then I went back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, a leg injury that required a hospital visit when you were younger. Good to know. Now, do you have any family members—parents, siblings, children—who have had any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: My mother… she got sick when she was old. Weakness, mostly. She died a long time ago. My father was strong, lived a long life. Never sick. I had a brother, but he moved to America a long time ago. I don’t hear from him much. He might have… something, I don’t know. We don’t talk about these things. Everything is far away now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Laury. It's common for families to not always share detailed medical information. Okay, last few questions, then we can talk about the ancestry test. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no. Never smoke. Maybe a little beer sometimes, with friends. Just a little. And no drugs. Never liked those. Just beer, sometimes. And only a little bit. Not every day, you know? Just when I'm with my friends, talking stories.
DOCTOR: Okay, very light alcohol use. That's good to know. So, to summarize: you’re generally feeling well, with some knee and back pain, managed with white pills, and you take blue pills for high blood pressure. You have no known allergies, and a history of a leg injury. You have a family history of weakness in your mother, and light alcohol use. Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. You remembered everything! That’s good, Doctor. You’re a good listener. Okay, so about the test... how does it work? Do I have to give a lot of spit? And how long does it take to get the answers? I’m a patient man, but I’m also old! I don’t want to wait forever.
DOCTOR: I’m glad I could listen carefully, Laury. It’s important to me. The test itself is very simple. We just need a small saliva sample – about the size of a teaspoon. It comes with a little tube you spit into, and then we send it off to the lab. It doesn't hurt at all! As for the results… it typically takes about 6-8 weeks to get them back. The lab has to analyze your DNA, and it takes some time. We’ll get a detailed report outlining your ancestral origins, and we can go over it together when it arrives. Do you think that’s something you’d like to proceed with?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Six to eight weeks... that's okay. Better than forever. And it doesn't hurt? Good. I want to know where my family come from, you know? For my grandchildren. They ask me about the island, but I don’t know much about before. Okay, let's do it. What do I have to do now? Do I sign something? Is it expensive?
DOCTOR: Great! I'm happy to help you with this, Laury. Yes, we’ll need you to sign a consent form—it explains the test, what it looks like, and how the data will be used. And there is a cost of $199 for the test, which covers the lab analysis and the detailed report. We can process a payment here at the clinic. Here’s the consent form. Take your time reading it over, and please let me know if you have any questions. I'll be right here if you need me.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This is a lot of words… I will try to read it. Is it okay if I take my time? My eyes aren’t so good anymore. Maybe I should call my granddaughter, she can read it for me later. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Of course, Laury. Absolutely. Take all the time you need. And yes, it's perfectly fine to ask your granddaughter to help you read it over. It's important you understand everything before signing. There's no rush at all. I'm here if you have any questions, and we can go over it together if you'd like. Just let me know.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. My granddaughter will be here tomorrow afternoon. She is very good with computers. She can probably explain all this better than me. I hope it doesn’t cost too much to send the spit… It sounds funny, sending your spit away. But it’s important to know where you come from, isn’t it?
