DOCTOR: Bula and hello, Mr. Scobie. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… I want to know more about where my family come from. Long, long time ago. I hear you can do… test with spit? To find out?
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful question, Mr. Scobie! And yes, that’s right – we can actually do a spit test, or what we call a buccal swab, to look at your genetic ancestry. It won’t tell you everything about your family history, but it can give you some clues about where your ancestors may have come from. It sounds like you're interested in learning more about your Marshallese heritage. Is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that right. Marshallese. My whole family from Marshall Islands. But… before that? My grandma… she talk about people come on boat. Long, long time ago. I want to know about them. Is spit test help with that?
DOCTOR: That’s a fascinating question, Mr. Scobie. Your grandma’s stories sound really interesting. It's wonderful that she shared those with you. The spit test can sometimes give us clues about broader ancestral origins, even beyond the Marshall Islands. It looks at markers in your DNA that can suggest connections to different populations around the world. However, it’s important to remember it won’t pinpoint exactly who those people on the boat were. It can give us probabilities and general regions. It's also worth noting that migration patterns are complex, and DNA tests aren't always perfect. We can look at some family history information alongside the test results to get a more complete picture. Before we proceed with the test, let’s talk a little more about your family history, if you’re comfortable. Do you know anything about where in the Marshall Islands your family is originally from?
PATIENT: Hmm… that… okay. I understand. Not perfect. Good. My family… Majuro. Most from Majuro, the big island. But my grandma… she from little island. Arno, I think it was. Very small. She say… people always move around. Fishing. Trade. Before that… she not say much. Just boat people. Different skin. Different talk.
DOCTOR: Okay, Majuro and Arno—that's helpful to know. It's very common for families to move around within the islands for fishing and trade, as you said. And it sounds like your grandma's stories are really the key here—those "boat people" are what you're most interested in understanding. To help me understand if a genetic test might be useful, let's talk a bit more about your medical history, if you don’t mind. It's not directly related to your ancestry question, but it's standard practice when meeting a new patient. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. Sorry. I forget sometimes. No big sickness. Old man problems. Knees hurt. Back hurt. Little bit of sugar problem, doctor tell me. Take pills for that. No surgery. Never have surgery. Just old.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. It's very common to have aches and pains as we get older – knees, back... and a little bit of sugar problem is something we can definitely manage with pills. It’s good you’re already working with a doctor on that. So, just to clarify, you're taking medication for diabetes?
PATIENT: Yes. For sugar. Metformin, I think it called. Small white pill. Take one every morning. And… sometimes knees hurt bad. Take other pill for that too. White one, but bigger.
DOCTOR: Okay, metformin and a pain pill for your knees—that's good information. Do you know the name of the pain pill you’re taking?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I give it to my daughter, she remember. She take me to doctor. Hmm… Ibuprofen? Is that right? Maybe Naproxen? One of those. White, small pill. I not good with names.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen or naproxen—those are both common pain relievers for knees. No worries at all, it's perfectly alright if you don't remember the exact names. We can always double-check with your daughter or your doctor’s office. Now, going back to your initial question about your ancestry… given your family's history in Majuro and Arno, and your interest in those "boat people" your grandmother spoke of, a genetic test could be a starting point. It might give us some clues about broader ancestral origins, beyond the Marshall Islands. However, it’s important to remember it won't give us definitive answers, and it might not be able to tell us much about specifically who those boat people were. Would you like me to explain the test in more detail – what it involves, what it costs, and what kind of results you can expect?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain. What it cost? And… how long to get answer? I not hurry, but… good to know. And what kind of answer? Just… number? Or… names of people?
DOCTOR: Okay, let me explain. The test itself involves a simple cheek swab – we gently rub a cotton swab inside your cheek to collect a small sample of saliva. It doesn't hurt at all. The cost of the test is around \$200, and that usually covers the basic analysis. There are more detailed analyses available for a higher price, but we can start with the basic one. Medicare may cover a portion of the cost, but we'd need to check your specific plan to be sure. It typically takes about 4-6 weeks to get the results back from the lab. Now, regarding the type of answer you'll get… it's not as simple as a list of names, unfortunately. The results are presented as percentages. For example, it might show something like: 60% Marshallese, 20% Polynesian, 10% East Asian, and 10% other. It gives you an estimate of your genetic ancestry based on comparisons to populations around the world. It will also provide you with a report outlining the regions associated with those percentages. It won’t tell you the names of specific individuals or tribes. It's more about broad origins than pinpointing specific ancestors. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmm… 200 dollar. Maybe. I need to think. 4-6 weeks… okay. Not so long. Percentage… not names. I understand. Little bit sad, but… okay. So… if I do test… you send spit to lab… then lab tell you what percentage? Then we talk about that? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ve got it exactly right. You decide if you want to proceed with the test. If you do, I’ll give you a kit to collect the spit sample. You send the sample to the lab, and they’ll analyze it. Then, in about 4-6 weeks, you’ll receive a report showing your estimated genetic ancestry percentages. We’ll then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results together and see if it provides any useful information. I can also give you some resources about genetic testing and ancestry research if you’re interested. It’s important to remember that these tests are just one piece of the puzzle. Family stories, historical records, and cultural knowledge are all important too. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that all. 200 dollar. And 4-6 weeks. I need to talk to my daughter. She good with numbers. And she remember things. Thank you, Doctor. You explain very good.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I'm glad I could help. It’s completely understandable to want to talk to your daughter before making a decision. She sounds like a great resource. Here’s my card with the clinic’s number. Feel free to call if you have any further questions. And if you decide to proceed, just let us know. It was lovely meeting you today. Please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you Doctor. You too.
DOCTOR: Bula, Mr. Scobie. Have a wonderful day, and I hope you and your daughter have a good conversation.
