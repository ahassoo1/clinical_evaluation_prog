DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it's… a delicate matter, really. Something a man doesn’t typically discuss so freely. My wife insisted, of course. She gets quite… concerned. There’s been… a discharge. Yes, a discharge. It’s… unpleasant. I don’t recall exactly when it started, to be honest. Things blur as one gets older, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I certainly do understand. It can be difficult to keep track of things. Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Krok. It takes courage to discuss these issues, and I appreciate you being open with me. When you say “discharge,” can you describe what it looks like?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I'm not entirely sure how descriptive one ought to be. It’s… not a clear fluid, if that makes any sense. More… thick. And yellowish, I suppose. A bit… smelly, if I'm being frank. It’s certainly not… normal. I haven’t noticed any pain, thankfully. Just… the discharge. And my wife’s worrying, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that information, Mr. Krok. “Thick and yellowish, a bit smelly,” and no pain. That’s helpful. And it's good to hear you haven't experienced any pain. Now, has this discharge been constant since it started, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that is a good question. I believe… it comes and goes. Yes. It’s not… every single day. Some days it’s perfectly fine, and other days… well, other days it’s quite noticeable. I haven't kept a precise log, you understand. I’m a farmer, not a… a record keeper of such things. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Krok. No need to apologize for not having a detailed record. "Comes and goes" is very helpful information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. No, I don’t believe so. No burning when… well, when I relieve myself. No itching. No… sores, thank goodness. Just the discharge. My wife keeps asking if I have a fever, but I feel perfectly fine, temperature-wise. She worries about everything, that woman. A good woman, mind you, but… worrisome.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Krok. No burning, itching, sores, or fever. Okay. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Now that's a rather… personal question, Doctor. I… I was a young man once, you know. Before I met my wife, of course. There were… indiscretions. But I assure you, nothing serious. I haven’t had any… tests done in… decades. I simply don't recall any specific diagnoses. It was a long time ago, and frankly, I prefer not to dwell on such matters.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. You're not obligated to share anything you’re not comfortable with, and I apologize if I made you uncomfortable. It’s just important for me to gather a complete medical history to best understand what’s going on. Okay, we can move on. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Ah, surgeries. Yes, a few. Mostly related to my farming, you see. Ruptured appendix when I was a boy, and I had my knee replaced about ten years ago. A bad fall from the tractor. And… let me think… I had a hernia repaired, oh, maybe fifteen years ago? Nothing major, really. The usual wear and tear of a hard life, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Krok. Appendix, knee replacement ten years ago, and a hernia repair about fifteen years ago. I appreciate you sharing that information. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My father had… high blood pressure, I believe. And my mother… she had some sort of… arthritis, I think. Lots of joint pain. My brother… he had heart trouble, but he didn’t take care of himself. Smoked too much, drank too much. As for anything else… no, not that I recall. We weren't a family that talked much about medical things, you see. More focused on the land, and the harvest.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Krok. High blood pressure in your father and arthritis in your mother. That’s helpful. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your current medications?
PATIENT: Current medications… just the basics, Doctor. I take a small pill for my blood pressure. Amlodipine, I believe it's called. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, you understand. Nothing fancy. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. They don’t agree with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always worries about shellfish, but I've eaten it my whole life without a problem. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to dust, but that's not an allergy, is it? Just… a bit of a cough. No, nothing serious. I’m a fairly robust fellow, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Well, I suppose it's necessary. I'm not overly fond of being poked and prodded, you understand. But if you insist. Just… be gentle, Doctor. I'm an old man, and my bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a look at your abdomen. And finally, I'll need to do a quick exam of the genital area to better understand the source of the discharge. I’ll explain everything as I go, and please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A deep breath… Here we go. I inhale deeply, then exhale slowly. I haven’t smoked in years, you know. My wife wouldn't allow it. Always worried about my health, that woman. I exhale again. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Mr. Krok. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling sounds. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen, just to check for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… a little bit. Just there. I point to the lower left side of my abdomen. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. It’s been a bit tender there lately. Probably just indigestion, to be honest. I ate a rather large meal last night. My wife makes a wonderful lamb stew, but it doesn’t always sit well with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know, Mr. Krok. Now, I need to perform a quick examination of the genital area. I’ll explain everything before I do it, and again, please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table for this part. We'll use a drape to maintain your privacy as much as possible. I’ll be wearing gloves. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sigh. Well, I suppose it's unavoidable. I truly dislike this part. A very private matter, you understand. But… alright. Gloves, you say? Good. And a drape? Yes, please. The less exposure, the better. Just… be quick about it, Doctor. And gentle. Very gentle. I slowly and with some effort begin to sit up, preparing to move to the examination table. This is… most unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Krok, and I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll ensure your privacy is respected throughout the exam. Now, I’m just going to take a look at the area and gently feel for any abnormalities. I'll also be looking for any signs of infection. I may need to collect a small sample for testing. Okay, I’ve collected a sample. The area is slightly inflamed, and the discharge is… yellowish, as you described. There doesn’t appear to be any significant swelling or sores. Okay, that’s all done. Please get dressed, and we can discuss our findings.
PATIENT: Sigh. Well, that was… thoroughly unpleasant. Thank goodness that’s over. What did you find, Doctor? Is it… serious? I truly hope it’s nothing too worrisome. My wife will be quite distraught if it is.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Krok. Based on my examination, it's likely you have a case of urethritis – inflammation of the urethra, the tube that carries urine from your bladder. The yellowish discharge and inflammation are consistent with that. Now, urethritis can have several causes. It could be caused by a bacterial infection, often sexually transmitted, or it could be due to irritation. Given your history, we need to consider both possibilities. To determine the exact cause, we need to send the sample we collected to the lab for testing. This will help us identify any bacteria or other organisms that might be causing the infection. It will also rule out any sexually transmitted infections. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you an antibiotic to treat the possible bacterial infection. It’s important to take the full course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better before you finish them. Does that make sense, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Urethritis… an antibiotic… Yes, I believe I follow you. Sexually transmitted, you say? I shift uncomfortably in my chair. Well, that’s… not ideal. But I suppose it’s better to know, one way or another. A full course of antibiotics, even if I feel better? Yes, I understand the importance of that. My wife always reminds me to finish my medications. She’s very particular about such things. So, what will the test reveal, exactly? And how long will it take to get the results? Will I need to… refrain from certain activities? I hesitate, looking slightly embarrassed.
DOCTOR: The test will identify any bacteria or other organisms present in the sample, allowing us to pinpoint the cause of the infection. It will also screen for common sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhea and chlamydia. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back from the lab. I will call you as soon as they are available. Regarding activities, it's best to abstain from sexual activity until we have the results back and have a clearer understanding of the cause of the infection. This will help prevent spreading anything, should it be an STI. Once we have the results, I can advise you on safe practices and whether any further testing or treatment is necessary. I'm also going to recommend that your wife be tested as well, just to be safe. It’s important to rule out any potential exposure. Do you have any questions about that, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Testing for my wife… yes, I suppose that’s sensible. She’ll likely insist on it anyway. I sigh. It’s… not the news I was hoping for, but I appreciate your candor, Doctor. So, 2-3 business days for the results… and no… ahem… activities until then. I clear my throat awkwardly. Yes, I understand. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any specific symptoms I should watch out for? And will the antibiotic have any side effects? I don't want to be incapacitated, you see. I have the farm to manage.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krok. The antibiotic I’m prescribing is usually well-tolerated, but common side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. If you experience any severe side effects, like an allergic reaction, please contact me immediately. As for symptoms to watch out for, if you develop a fever, pain in your lower abdomen, or notice any blood in your urine, please contact me right away. I also recommend drinking plenty of fluids while you’re on the antibiotic, and avoiding alcohol. Here’s a prescription for the antibiotic. I’m also going to provide you with a referral to a local lab for the testing. I’ll also give you some information about sexually transmitted infections, just so you’re well-informed. Do you have any questions about the prescription, the referral, or the information I’m providing?
PATIENT: Yes, this seems… thorough. Drinking plenty of fluids, avoiding alcohol… very well. I suppose I can manage that. So, I contact the lab to schedule the testing, and I’ll call you when the results are in? I nod slowly. Yes, I understand. I pause, then look at you with a somewhat hesitant expression. Doctor… I appreciate your professionalism and… discretion. This wasn’t an easy conversation, you know. And I thank you for being… gentle, in all respects.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krok. I’m glad I could provide you with some clarity and reassurance. It's my job to provide a safe and comfortable environment for my patients, and I’m always happy to answer any questions you may have. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you experience any concerns or if you have any further questions. I’ll be following up with you in a few days to discuss the lab results. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s all. I appreciate your time and expertise. And again, thank you for your discretion. I offer a small, somewhat hesitant smile. I suppose I’ll be on my way, then. I begin to walk towards the door, pausing briefly before exiting. Good day to you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good day to you as well, Mr. Krok. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
