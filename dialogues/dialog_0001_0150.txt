DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s ridiculous I even have to be here. I’m 51, perfectly healthy – well, as healthy as one can be living in this country – and I want to have a baby. A simple one. No complications. Is that too much to ask? I don’t have time for…problems.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “simple” isn’t really…how these things usually work, Ms. Shteynberg. Fifty-one is…a bit advanced for a first pregnancy, if I’m being frank. We’ll need to do some tests, just to make sure everything is…viable. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you had any major illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh, please. I’ve had the usual. Childhood things, a broken wrist once when I was skiing – badly broken, I might add, the doctors in Hungary were far better – and a hysterectomy when I was…younger. Divorced, you know. Didn’t need it then, certainly don’t need it now. But that was…ages ago. Does that matter? It was removed, not…repaired. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. Strong, even. I cycle every day.
DOCTOR: A hysterectomy…yes, that does matter. Significant history. And the age of the procedure is relevant. Okay. Any family history of…anything?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, my mother lived to be 90, smoked like a chimney and drank pálinka every day. She had…the usual old lady problems. Arthritis, bad knees. My father was a healthy man, died suddenly of a heart attack. Not very helpful, is it? They weren’t exactly…health nuts. We ate what we wanted, when we wanted. And lived long enough, didn’t we? Is this going somewhere, or are you just compiling a list of my ancestors’ vices?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Shteynberg. We need to assess risks. Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I take nothing. I believe in letting the body heal itself. Doctors these days just want to pump you full of pills for every little ache and pain. Waste of money, mostly. And frankly, I don’t trust half of what they prescribe. I had a bad reaction to something once, years ago, but I haven’t the faintest idea what it was. Some sort of antibiotic, I think. But I recovered, didn’t I? Without more pills, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Right. An unspecified reaction to an unspecified antibiotic. Very helpful. And you’re currently taking no medications at all?
PATIENT: None. Absolutely none. Just vitamins, occasionally. A multivitamin, when I remember. Though I doubt they do much good. I eat a fairly balanced diet. Mostly. I have a sweet tooth, admittedly. But who doesn’t? Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I don’t have all day, you know. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I understand your…reservations. But attempting a pregnancy at 51, even with a healthy lifestyle, carries significant risks. We need to do some blood work to assess your hormone levels, check for underlying conditions, and… frankly, see if this is even a possibility. And we'll need to discuss the increased risk of complications for both you and the potential baby. I'm also going to want to get a detailed history of your cycles...although you mentioned a hysterectomy... Were you able to preserve any ovarian tissue?
PATIENT: Ovarian tissue? Are you serious? Look, I had a hysterectomy, not a complete overhaul! They took what needed taking, I wasn't consulting with a fertility specialist then, I just wanted it gone. I certainly didn’t ask them to save…parts! Honestly, the questions you’re asking are…insulting. I'm perfectly capable of having a baby, and I don't need a lecture on the fragility of…things. Just tell me what tests you need to do, and let’s get it over with. The sooner this is finished, the better.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, with all due respect, you're being unrealistic. A hysterectomy typically involves removal of the uterus and ovaries. If your ovaries were removed, natural conception is impossible. We need to confirm this with testing. Blood work, as I mentioned, to check hormone levels, and an ultrasound to visualize your reproductive organs. I'm also going to need you to clarify your medical history. "What needed taking" isn't a diagnosis. It's vague and unhelpful. I strongly suggest you consider a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist. They're better equipped to discuss your options, which may include assisted reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization with donor eggs. But before we go any further, we need facts, not opinions. Shall we proceed with the blood work?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. Blood work. Get it over with. But don't expect miracles. And don't waste my time with talk of…donor eggs. I have my own, thank you very much. Though, after this interrogation, I'm starting to doubt everything. Just…do the tests. And hurry. I have a cycling class in a few hours. And I need to be on time.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the lab technician draw the samples now. It’ll take a few minutes. They’ll need a full panel, including hormone levels, a complete blood count, and a metabolic panel. Once the results are back, we can discuss them. I'll also schedule an ultrasound. In the meantime, please try to relax. And Ms. Shteynberg, I must advise you that attempting a pregnancy at your age is a high-risk endeavor. We need to be realistic about the potential complications.
