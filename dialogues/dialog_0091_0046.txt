DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because I’ve been having some… well, pressure on my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Pressure on your bladder. Could you describe that pressure for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not exactly painful, but it feels… full, even when I haven’t had much to drink. And I find myself needing to go to the bathroom quite often, even at night. It’s just… inconvenient, and I’m starting to worry about it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Frequent urination and a sensation of fullness even after emptying your bladder. Has this been a sudden onset, or has it developed gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It didn’t just happen overnight. Maybe… over the past few months? It started as just needing to go a little more often, and now it’s… this. I didn’t think much of it at first, honestly. Just thought I was drinking more water with the weather being warmer, but it hasn't changed even as things have cooled down.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over several months. And you've noticed it persists even with stable fluid intake. Have you noticed any other changes accompanying this – any pain or burning when you urinate, blood in your urine, fever, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning at all, thankfully. And I haven’t seen any blood. No fever either. My bowel habits are… regular, I suppose. Nothing different there. Just the bladder pressure, and needing to go so often. It’s really the frequency that’s getting to me. It’s disruptive.
DOCTOR: Alright. No associated pain, burning, hematuria, or fever, and stable bowel function. Let’s delve into your medical history a bit, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I do have… well, my husband says I snore a bit, but I’ve never been officially diagnosed with sleep apnea or anything like that. Other than that… no, not much. I have Medicare, so I see the doctor for my annual checkups, but everything’s always been fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy with no prior medical diagnoses aside from reported snoring. And you’re covered by Medicare, with regular annual checkups. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I haven’t had any surgeries at all. I’ve been very lucky in that regard, I suppose. I’ve always been a little… cautious about things like that. I’d rather avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. No prior surgeries. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family medical history?
PATIENT: My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had… well, he had diabetes, later in life. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had arthritis, but that’s about it, as far as I know. No one in my family has ever had any bladder problems that I’m aware of. I’m not sure if any of that is relevant, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis. That is helpful information, thank you. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. I very rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. I work as a graphic designer, so I need to keep a clear head! It's important for my work.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. And you mentioned you work as a graphic designer. Do you find your work stressful?
PATIENT: It can be, sometimes. Deadlines, demanding clients… it’s not always easy. I try to manage it with exercise, and spending time with my husband, but it can be stressful. I sit a lot, too, which I know isn’t good. I’ve been meaning to get more active, honestly. Does that sound… relevant, do you think?
DOCTOR: It absolutely could be relevant, Ms. Creagh. Prolonged sitting can contribute to various health concerns. Now, to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, once a day. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. Otherwise, no. Nothing else at all. I try to avoid taking medication whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. And no known allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My husband always jokes that I could eat anything, but I don’t really test that theory! I think I’m pretty lucky, allergy-wise.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to know. Alright, Ms. Creagh, thank you for providing me with all of that information. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, if you are comfortable with that. This will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your reflexes, and a quick neurological assessment. We’ll also need to obtain a urine sample to rule out any infection. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. Listening and checking… and a urine sample, of course. Please, go ahead. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will explain everything as I go, and please, do not hesitate to let me know if you experience any discomfort at any point. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now. They appear to be normal – active, but not overly exaggerated. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. Just… normal pressure, I suppose. Like when you’re full after a meal. But nothing painful at all. It’s… comfortable, really. You’re being very gentle.
DOCTOR: Good. No significant tenderness noted. Now I'm going to check your neurological reflexes. And finally, I'll check your gait. If you could stand up and walk a few steps for me, please. Just a normal walk is fine. Your reflexes are within normal limits, and your gait appears stable. Now, we just need a urine sample for a urinalysis. There is a private restroom just down the hall. I will provide you with a collection cup and instructions. Please try to collect a midstream sample, if possible.
PATIENT: Alright, that all sounds… manageable. A midstream sample, right. I think I remember how to do that. Just down the hall, and I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. I think I got it. I tried to do a midstream sample like you said.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Creagh. I will send this off to the lab for analysis right away. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes to get the results back. While we wait for the results, let’s revisit your symptoms. You mentioned the pressure on your bladder and the frequent urination. Have you noticed any leakage of urine with coughing, sneezing, or exercise?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I haven't had any leakage at all. That's one thing I haven't experienced. It’s just the pressure, and the constant need to go. That’s really it. It doesn't happen with any activity, just… a constant sensation, even when I shouldn't need to go. It's... frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright, no urinary leakage. That's good to know. Okay, the urinalysis results are back. There's no evidence of infection, and your glucose and protein levels are normal. Your specific gravity is slightly low, which can sometimes indicate that you're drinking excessive amounts of fluids, or that your kidneys aren’t concentrating urine as effectively. However, it’s not significantly abnormal. Based on your history, physical exam, and the urinalysis results, I suspect this may be a case of overactive bladder, or possibly bladder sensitivity. It’s a common condition, particularly in women, and it can be caused by a variety of factors. It doesn't necessarily indicate anything serious.
PATIENT: Overactive bladder… or bladder sensitivity. That doesn’t sound too alarming, thankfully. What does that… mean, exactly? And what can be done about it? Is there medication? I’d prefer to avoid that if possible, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable preference, Ms. Creagh. Overactive bladder essentially means your bladder muscles are contracting more frequently than they should, leading to that urgent need to urinate, even when your bladder isn’t full. Bladder sensitivity implies your bladder nerves are extra-reactive, perceiving fullness when there isn’t much urine present. There are several non-pharmacological approaches we can try first. These include timed voiding – essentially, going to the bathroom on a schedule, even if you don’t feel the urge – fluid management, avoiding caffeine and alcohol which can irritate the bladder, and pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegels, to strengthen the muscles that support the bladder. We can also consider bladder training, which involves gradually increasing the intervals between bathroom visits. If these measures aren’t effective, then we can discuss medication options, but I always prefer to start with conservative approaches. Would you be interested in trying these first?
PATIENT: Those all sound… manageable. Timed voiding, fluid management, pelvic floor exercises… I think I could try those. I definitely drink a fair amount of water, so I could cut back a little. And I’m sure I could learn to do those exercises. Bladder training… sounds a bit intimidating, but I’m willing to give it a try. Could you… perhaps give me some more detailed instructions on how to do the exercises? And maybe a sample schedule for the timed voiding? I’m a bit worried about… making it worse, if I don’t do it correctly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's good you’re thinking proactively. These exercises are very important, and it's perfectly reasonable to want detailed instructions. This handout provides a detailed description of pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegels. It explains how to identify the correct muscles and how to perform the exercises properly. Start with 10-15 repetitions three times a day. It’s best to do them when no one will interrupt you and you are not trying to urinate. As for timed voiding, start by going to the bathroom every two hours, regardless of whether you feel the urge. Gradually increase the interval by 15-30 minutes each week, as long as you don’t experience any leakage. Keep a bladder diary to track your fluid intake and urination frequency. This will help us monitor your progress and adjust the schedule as needed. I recommend avoiding caffeine and alcohol altogether for the first few weeks, to see if that makes a difference. I want you to monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any pain, discomfort, or increased frequency of leakage, stop the exercises and contact me immediately. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to discuss your progress. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: That sounds… very thorough. A handout, a schedule, avoiding caffeine… and a follow-up appointment. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly, Doctor. I’ll definitely keep a diary, and I’ll try my best to follow the instructions. Yes, that sounds like a plan. Four weeks from today, then. Thank you again, Doctor Delacour. I feel much better knowing what’s going on, and what I can do about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Creagh. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance and a plan of action. Remember, consistency is key with these exercises. If you experience any significant changes or develop any concerning symptoms before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Have a good day, Ms. Creagh. I look forward to seeing you in four weeks.
