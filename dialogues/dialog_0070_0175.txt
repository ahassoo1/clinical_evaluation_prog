DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's my back, mostly. It's been…painful, like you asked. Not sure exactly what it is, but it's been bothering me for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of back pain. I understand. To help me get a better picture of what’s going on, could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It's not like a sharp, sudden pain, you know? More of a dull ache, really. It’s mostly in my lower back, but sometimes it feels like it shoots down my leg a little. It’s worse when I bend over, or if I've been standing for a long time. Sitting isn’t great either, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache in the lower back radiating down the leg, worse with bending and prolonged standing, and not entirely relieved by sitting. That gives me a little more to work with. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the pain at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Hmm... at its worst, probably a 6 or 7, I'd say. It doesn't stop me from doing things, but it definitely makes them uncomfortable. Like, I can still walk, but I don't want to walk a long distance, you know? And lifting anything is… tricky.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A 6 or 7 is significant, but the fact that you can still function is helpful to know. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain better?
PATIENT: Well, lying down usually helps. Especially on my side, with a pillow between my knees. And sometimes, if I take it really easy for a day, it feels a little bit better the next day. But it always seems to come back if I do too much. I haven't really tried anything specific to make it better, to be honest. Just trying to avoid making it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down, especially on your side with a pillow between your knees, provides some relief, and rest helps temporarily. That's good information. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. No numbness or tingling. Sometimes my leg feels a little…weak, maybe? But I'm not sure if that's just from getting older, you know? It's hard to say. It’s not a constant thing, definitely.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's helpful to differentiate between weakness and simply feeling a bit tired. We'll keep that in mind. Now, have you had any recent injuries to your back?
PATIENT: No, no recent injuries. Nothing I can think of, anyway. I didn't fall or lift anything heavy or anything like that. It just…started. Gradual, you know? That’s why I didn’t rush to the doctor right away. I figured it would go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent injury, and a gradual onset. That’s useful to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like arthritis, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. No arthritis, no diabetes. My blood pressure's a little high sometimes, the doctor told me, but I haven't been taking any medicine for it. It's usually okay if I watch my salt intake. Other than that… not really. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. I try to be, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, slightly elevated blood pressure but generally healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Nothing like that. Always avoided them if I could. I don’t really like the idea of being under the knife, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Now, let's talk about your family. Do any of your close family members have back problems, or conditions like arthritis?
PATIENT: My mother had arthritis in her knees, pretty bad towards the end. And my brother, he had some issues with his back a few years ago, had to go to physical therapy. But other than that, not really. My father was pretty healthy all his life. That's about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of arthritis in your mother and back issues in your brother. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I'm retired now, so I don’t do any heavy lifting or anything like that. I mostly just spend time with my wife, do a little gardening, watch TV. I try to walk a little bit most days, but lately it's been harder with my back. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Pretty quiet life, all in all.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Way, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your range of motion, reflexes, and see if I can pinpoint the source of the pain. It will involve me having you bend forward, backward, and to the sides, as well as lying down on your back and lifting your legs. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. Whatever you need. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Okay, I'm standing. It's a little stiff getting up, but I'm up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, could you bend forward slowly, and try to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's…that's about as far as I can go, Doctor. It hurts if I try to go any further. It's not a sharp pain, but it's definitely uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That’s helpful. Now, let’s try bending backward, slowly and gently.
PATIENT: No, that’s…that’s really not good, Doctor. It really hurts. I’m stopping right here. That’s a little worse than the other one.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s enough of that. No need to push it. Now, could you please lie down on your back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, I'm lying down. Just let me know what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Way, I’m going to press on your back here. Please tell me if you feel any pain, and where specifically. Does this feel tender?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, right there. That’s…that’s pretty tender. Not a sharp pain, but definitely sore. And…and a little bit to the left of that too, but not as bad. Right around here.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. And now the other leg. Finally, I’m going to ask you to lift each leg straight up while keeping it straight.
PATIENT: Okay, lifting them up… it's a little difficult, Doctor. And it hurts a bit in my back when I do it. Especially the right leg. It feels weaker too, maybe? It's hard to say. It's not a lot of pain, but it's definitely there.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Way. That's all I need for the physical exam for now. Based on your history and the exam, it seems you likely have a lumbar strain, possibly with some muscle spasm. The tenderness and pain with lifting your leg on the right side suggests some nerve involvement, but it's not severe enough to be a clear indication of sciatica. It’s important to rule out anything more serious, however. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Lumbar strain… that sounds about right. I probably just pulled something, huh? Nerve involvement… that sounds a little scary. Is that… serious? And what does that mean exactly? Sciatica… I’ve heard of that. Is that what this might be? I don’t really understand all the medical terms.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to be concerned, Mr. Way, and it’s good that you’re asking questions. A lumbar strain simply means you’ve overstretched or torn the muscles and ligaments in your lower back. It’s a common injury, and most cases resolve with conservative treatment. The nerve involvement I mentioned is a little less clear at this point. The pain radiating down your leg could indicate some irritation of a nerve, but it's not severe enough to be a definitive diagnosis of sciatica. Sciatica is specifically pain that travels down the sciatic nerve, which runs from your lower back down your leg. It’s often caused by a herniated disc pressing on the nerve. We need to rule that out. To do that, I’d like to order an X-ray of your lower back to check for any structural issues. And I’m also going to order some blood work to rule out any other potential causes of your pain, like inflammation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… reasonable. X-ray and blood work… yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out, you know? I don't want it to get worse. It's just… inconvenient, more than anything. How long will it take to get the results? And what happens if it is something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Way. It’s good to be proactive. The lab and X-ray results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. If the results show something more serious, like a herniated disc or a fracture, we'll discuss the best course of action. That could involve a referral to a specialist, like an orthopedist or a neurologist, for further evaluation and treatment. Treatment options could range from physical therapy and pain management to injections or, in rare cases, surgery. However, based on what I’ve seen so far, I don’t believe we’re at that point yet. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend some conservative treatment. I’ll prescribe a muscle relaxant to help with the spasm, and an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or naproxen. It’s also important to rest, avoid heavy lifting, and apply ice to your back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. We'll also discuss some gentle stretching exercises that you can do to help strengthen your back muscles. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Muscle relaxant, pain reliever, rest, ice… stretching exercises… I can do all of that. I’m just glad we’re doing something about it. Are there any side effects to the muscle relaxant I should be aware of? And… how long should I be resting? I don’t want to overdo it, but I also don’t want to be completely inactive.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It's good to be proactive. The muscle relaxant, cyclobenzaprine, can cause some drowsiness, so it’s best to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while you're taking it. Some people also experience dry mouth or constipation. If those side effects become bothersome, let me know, and we can adjust the dosage or try a different medication. As for rest, I recommend avoiding any activities that aggravate your pain for the next few days. Gentle walking is okay, but avoid heavy lifting, bending, twisting, or prolonged sitting. Listen to your body, and don’t push yourself. After a few days, you can gradually start to reintroduce more activities, as long as you’re not experiencing any pain. I'll also give you a handout with some gentle stretching exercises that you can do at home. It’s important to do these exercises regularly to help strengthen your back muscles and prevent future injuries. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and figure out what’s going on. I’ll be sure to follow your instructions and let you know if anything changes. I hope the X-ray and blood work don’t take too long.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Way. I’m glad I could help. I’ll have my nurse schedule the X-ray and blood work for you before you leave. I'll call you as soon as the results are in, usually within 2-3 business days. In the meantime, if your pain gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, numbness, or weakness, please don’t hesitate to contact the office immediately. Here’s the prescription for the muscle relaxant and a handout with the stretching exercises. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
