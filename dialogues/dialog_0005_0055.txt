DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… Ranells, actually. Ellan Ranells. Well, I’ll get right to it. I’ve heard… things are changing, and my daughter, bless her heart, she thinks I should look into this medical marijuana business. Says it’s good for… well, a lot of things. I’m not entirely convinced, but she’s quite insistent. I suppose I’m here to see about getting one of those… certifications, if that's the proper word.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ranells. So you're interested in exploring medical marijuana, primarily at the urging of your daughter. I understand. And you're looking into getting a certification to see if it might be appropriate for you. Just to be clear, are you experiencing any specific symptoms or conditions that you're hoping to address with medical marijuana?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, heavens. At my age, what isn’t ailing me? My knees, of course. They bother me something fierce, especially when the weather changes. And my sleep… well, it’s not what it used to be. I wake up several times a night. But really, those are just… the usual complaints of getting older. I don't know if they qualify as symptoms, exactly. It’s not like I’m in constant pain or anything. My daughter keeps going on about how it helps with… nerves, and anxiety, and all sorts of things. I just want to be able to get a good night’s rest, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, primarily knee discomfort and difficulty sleeping. You mentioned your daughter believes it might help with nerves and anxiety as well. I see. To get a better picture, can you describe the knee pain?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a sharp pain, Doctor. It’s more of a… ache, really. A dull, persistent ache, especially after I’ve been on my feet for too long. Or like I said, when it rains. My daughter thinks it's arthritis, but I haven’t bothered with the doctor for it, honestly. It’s just… old age. I try not to dwell on it. I used to be very active, you know. Dancing, gardening… now, getting up and down the stairs is a bit of an ordeal. And it sometimes swells a little. Not terribly, but enough to notice. Is that… helpful? I’m not sure what sort of information you need.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Ranells. Thank you. The swelling is important to know. And you’re right to mention the activities you used to do; that gives me a baseline. Have you tried any treatments for the knee pain already?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. Years and years of treatments. My late husband, God rest his soul, he insisted on it. Physical therapy, mostly. And those… injections. Cortisone, I think they were. They helped for a while, but it never lasted. Eventually, I just stopped. It seemed… pointless. All that bother for temporary relief. And frankly, I don’t like needles. It’s just… easier to live with it, I suppose. Though, as I said, the sleep isn't helping matters. A tired body aches even more.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’ve tried conservative measures without lasting success, and you’re not keen on further interventions. So, let's talk about the sleep issue. How long have you been experiencing difficulty sleeping?
PATIENT: Oh, it's come and gone over the years, Doctor. But the last… six months or so, it's been consistently bad. I used to be able to fall asleep the moment my head hit the pillow. Now, I toss and turn for hours. Wake up several times during the night, for no reason at all. Sometimes I wake up early and can’t get back to sleep. I’ve tried warm milk, chamomile tea… all the old wives’ remedies, really. Nothing seems to work consistently. And it leaves me feeling so… drained. Just utterly exhausted all the time. It makes everything so much harder.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ranells. So, persistent sleep disturbance for approximately six months, despite trying various over-the-counter remedies. Have you noticed anything specific that seems to trigger the insomnia?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. I don’t know if anything triggers it, exactly. It just… happens. Sometimes it’s after a particularly busy day, sometimes it’s for no reason at all. I do find it harder to sleep if I eat a late dinner. And worrying doesn’t help, of course. But honestly, Doctor, I worry generally. It’s just… part of my nature. I suppose if I had to pinpoint something, it's probably just… old age creeping up on me again. Everything is harder when you get older, you know? And the loneliness doesn't help, now that my husband is gone. It's quiet in the house, too quiet.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot, Ms. Ranells. Not just the physical discomfort, but also the emotional challenges. Now, about the medical marijuana… Before we discuss whether a certification might be appropriate, I need to be clear about a few things. It's not a cure-all, and it has potential risks and side effects. It's also important to understand that research on its long-term effects is still ongoing. And, frankly, given your age and history, it's important to rule out other potential causes for your sleep disturbance before considering this option. Have you had a recent physical exam with blood work?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All those risks and side effects… I suppose I expected as much. My daughter tends to gloss over the unpleasant details. I haven’t had a full physical in… well, it’s been a few years, Doctor. Honestly, I try to avoid doctors if I can. They always want to poke and prod, and they never seem to find anything wrong. Blood work… no, not recently. I just figured it was old age, as usual. I suppose if you think it’s important… I’m willing to consider it. But I don’t want to go through a lot of bother, you understand. I’m not as spry as I used to be. And truthfully, I’m a bit… skeptical about all this marijuana business. It just doesn't seem like something for someone my age. But I’m willing to listen, I suppose. If you think it might help.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ranells. I appreciate your honesty. Given your age and the potential for other underlying causes of your sleep issues, I recommend we start with a comprehensive blood workup and a physical examination. That will help rule out any other medical conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms. We’ll assess your overall health, check for any interactions with potential medications, and then we can have a more informed discussion about whether medical marijuana is an appropriate option for you. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary, I’m willing to go through with it. I don’t particularly want to, but I’m willing. It’s just… a lot of bother, you know? All the poking and prodding… and the waiting, and the appointments. But if it will help me sleep, or at least rule things out, then I suppose I should. When would you like to schedule the appointment? And will it take very long? I have a bridge game on Thursday afternoons, and I wouldn’t want to miss it. It’s the highlight of my week, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll try to make it as quick and efficient as possible. How about Wednesday morning at 10 AM?
PATIENT: Wednesday morning… yes, that should work. I’m free on Wednesday. 10 AM… alright. Do I need to do anything to prepare? Fast beforehand, or anything like that? I always forget these things. And will I need to bring a list of medications? I don't take many, just a little something for my blood pressure, but I suppose I should bring the bottle, just in case. It’s just… all this bother. I’m getting tired just thinking about it. But alright, Wednesday at 10 AM it is. I suppose I should get it over with, then. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, please bring a list of all your medications, including the dosage, and avoid eating or drinking anything after midnight tonight. We’ll also need a recent blood pressure reading, if possible. And please don't worry, we'll make it as comfortable as possible. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough, I must say. And patient with an old woman like me. I appreciate it. I suppose I’ll just… see you Wednesday then. Thank you again for your time. Hopefully, this blood work will reveal something useful. I'm not holding my breath, but one must try, I suppose.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Ranells. It was my pleasure. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of things. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before Wednesday. And please, don't feel overwhelmed. We'll take things one step at a time. Have a good day, and I’ll see you then.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
