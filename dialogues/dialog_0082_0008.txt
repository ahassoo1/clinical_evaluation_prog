DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s… good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, right. My ear. It feels… full. Like something's blocking it, you know? It's been… a bit of a bother. Honestly, I can't really say how long, exactly. Time… slips away, these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, time certainly does. A full feeling in the ear… I understand. And you said it's been bothering you for a bit. Could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Honestly? I… I really can’t pinpoint it. It just is. Maybe… a few weeks? Or longer? I spend a lot of time outdoors, working on farms, inspecting things. Could be something to do with that? Wind, dust… I wouldn’t know. It's not painful, just… annoying. Makes it hard to hear sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, so not painful, just a fullness and difficulty hearing. And you work outdoors, farms… that's helpful information. Do you notice it's worse after being outside, or does it stay pretty consistent?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… yes, I think it is worse after a day in the fields. Especially if it’s windy. Dust gets everywhere, of course. I usually wear a cap, but… it doesn’t seal everything out, does it? It's hard to say for sure, though. I just sort of… live with it, until it gets too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worsening with outdoor exposure, particularly wind and dust. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fullness and hearing difficulty?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No… not really. No pain, like I said. No dizziness. Sometimes… a little bit of ringing, maybe? But it comes and goes, and I’m not even sure if that’s connected. It could just be… my age, you know? Things start to creak and whistle. I honestly wouldn’t know.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional ringing… We’ll make a note of that. No dizziness, no pain. Have you ever had any issues with your ears before?
PATIENT: Issues? Not that I recall. Maybe as a child, ear infections, perhaps? But nothing… serious. It was a long time ago. My wife… she always took care of those things. I don’t… I don’t really remember specifics. Sorry. It's all a bit… hazy.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. These things happen. Alright, let's move on to some other questions then. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Again, my wife did all the… checking. I don’t recall ever having a reaction to anything. I take a blood pressure tablet, that’s all. The usual, I suppose, for someone my age. No other medications.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just the blood pressure medication. Do you mind telling me the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. I… I have no idea. It's a small white pill. I get it refilled regularly from the pharmacy. Honestly, Doctor, I just take it. I don't pay much attention to the names. Could you… ask the pharmacy, perhaps? I feel rather silly not knowing.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It’s very common to not remember medication names. I can certainly check with the pharmacy. Let’s move on for now. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh, yes. Appendicitis, when I was young. A long time ago. And… I had a hernia operation, maybe ten years ago? Something like that. Nothing major recently. That’s all I can remember, off the top of my head. I'm not very good at remembering dates, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy and a hernia repair. And you said those were some time ago. Now, just one more question before we do a quick examination. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… That’s… tricky. My wife’s family was very healthy, as far as I knew. My side… My father had… heart problems, I think. And… an aunt had something with her… joints. Arthritis, maybe? It was a long time ago, and honestly, I wasn’t very close to my family. So I don't know a lot of details. It’s all a bit vague, I'm afraid. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Any information is helpful. Alright, let’s have a quick look at your ear. Could you sit up and face me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please, go ahead. I’m ready. Just… try not to poke too hard, if you don’t mind. It's a bit sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Just relax. Hmm… Alright. I see a little bit of wax buildup, and the eardrum is slightly… dull. Not significantly inflamed, but it’s not as transparent as it should be. And on this side… Similar findings. Some wax buildup, and the eardrum also appears slightly dull. No sign of any infection or fluid. Alright. It looks like you have some wax impaction in both ears, which could be contributing to the fullness and difficulty hearing. It’s not unusual, especially for someone who works outdoors. Does that sound plausible?
PATIENT: Wax… yes, that sounds… reasonable. I do get a lot of dust in my ears, as I said. So that makes sense. Is it… something you can get rid of? Is that why I’ve been feeling like there's something blocking it? It doesn’t hurt, just… annoying. I just want to be able to hear properly again.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very likely the cause of your symptoms, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. The wax buildup can certainly create a feeling of fullness and block sound. And it’s easily treatable. We can remove the wax with a simple procedure called ear irrigation, or I can use a special tool to gently remove it. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: Irrigation… that sounds… wet. And I don’t like things in my ears. If you have that… tool… that sounds better. Gentle, you said? As long as it's gentle. I just want it out, you know? I'm not very good with… procedures. I get a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. We can absolutely use the tool. It’s a very gentle process, and I’ll be very careful. It won’t take long, and it shouldn’t be painful. I'll explain everything as I go. First, I'll use a small camera to get a better look and confirm the wax buildup. Then, I'll use the instrument to carefully remove the wax. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A camera… well, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… please be quick about it. And gentle. I repeat that, just to be sure. I'm not a fan of… poking and prodding. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I understand. Quick and gentle, I promise. Alright, I'm just getting a better look now… Yes, as I suspected, there’s a significant amount of wax buildup in both ears. It’s definitely obstructing the ear canal. I’m going to gently insert this instrument now to loosen and remove the wax. You might feel a little bit of pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Let me know if you feel any discomfort. Okay, just a little bit more… There we go. And now the other side… Alright, I think that’s all of it. Let’s take a look now… Much better. Your ear canals are clear now, and your eardrums look normal. How does that sound?
