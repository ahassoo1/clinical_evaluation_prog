DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Chest… feel funny. And heart… beat too fast sometimes. Blood pressure… wife say high. She make appointment. I no good with… all this doctor stuff. Just want fix, go home.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. “Chest feels funny” and a racing heart… and your wife is concerned about your blood pressure. We can certainly look into that. Now, when you say “funny”, can you describe exactly how it feels?
PATIENT: How it feel? Like… tight. Not always. Sometimes just… flutter. Like bird in chest. Old man heart no supposed to flutter. Is bad, right? I eat kimchi, is that bad? My wife, she worry too much.
DOCTOR: A tightness and a fluttering sensation… I understand. It’s good your wife is looking out for you. Now, the kimchi… while it’s a lovely dish, it can sometimes interact with certain medications. Do you take any medications at all, Mr. Sobkowicz?
PATIENT: Medication? A little pill… for water. Old man, you know? Gotta pee a lot. And… sometimes, for the… you call it… aches? When bones hurt. That all. Small pills. Blue one and white one. Wife give me. I no remember name. Too much name.
DOCTOR: Alright. A medication for frequent urination and something for aches and pains. We'll get the names sorted out shortly. Now, regarding these symptoms… how long have you been experiencing this tightness and the fluttering in your chest?
PATIENT: Hmm… long time. Maybe… few months? Come and go. Not every day. When I… stress. Wife yell at me, then happen. Or when I… garden. Bending down, hard work. Then heart… jump. Not good for old heart.
DOCTOR: A few months, associated with stress or exertion… bending down in the garden. And does anything relieve the feeling?
PATIENT: Relieve? Sit down. Rest. Wife make tea. Ginger tea. Help a little. But still… feel it sometimes. Is annoying. Waste my time. I got things to do. I build birdhouse, you know. Very important work.
DOCTOR: Birdhouses, that is important work. Alright. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this chest discomfort and racing heart?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I… sometimes feel dizzy. When I stand up too fast. And… a little short of breath. When I climb stairs. But who climb stairs? Old man stay on ground. Is better. Not worth it.
DOCTOR: Dizziness upon standing and shortness of breath with exertion… alright. Now, Mr. Sobkowicz, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure – as your wife is concerned about – and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But make it quick. I no like… poking and prodding. Just listen, check, then tell me what wrong. I got birdhouse to finish. Don't need long exam. Old man body is simple.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back and relax. Heart rate is a bit elevated… and there's a slight murmur. Lungs sound clear, but a little diminished breath sounds on the bases. Blood pressure is… elevated, as your wife noted. 150 over 90. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, can you tell me if you've ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Hmph. Long time ago… doctor say… high cholesterol. And something with… sugar. Not good sugar. Wife make me diet. No rice. No noodles. Terrible life. I forget the name. Old man brain no good anymore. Is bad, right? High cholesterol and bad sugar? Is serious? Just want fix heart, not deal with all this.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of high cholesterol and… likely diabetes, or at least elevated blood sugar. These are important things to manage, Mr. Sobkowicz, and they can certainly contribute to your heart symptoms. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Hmph. Long time ago… appendix. When I young. And… maybe for the… gall bladder? Wife say. I no remember. Too much poking and prodding. Bad experience. I no like hospital. Smell bad. Food bad. People yelling. Just want go home. Stop asking about past! Focus on heart! Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We'll focus on your heart. Now, let’s talk about your family. Has anyone in your family – your parents, siblings – had heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmph. Family? My father… he die young. Heart. Wife say. But I no know. I no see him much. Mother… she live long time. But she always… complain. Everything hurt. Maybe she had… high blood pressure? I don't remember. Family… they no talk about… sickness. Is bad luck. Just focus on me now. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Hmph. Never. Wife would kill me. She very strict. Always tell me… bad for health. Bad for heart. I listen to wife. Mostly. She make good kimchi. So I listen. No smoke. Never. Good man, no smoke.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how much alcohol do you drink, if any?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Sometimes. Small glass of… soju. With dinner. Wife allow. Very small. Not much. Just… relax. She say, small amount okay. But she always watch me. Make sure I no drink too much. She very… controlling. Is good, mostly. Keep me healthy. But annoying sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we discuss potential causes and a plan, I want to order a few tests. An EKG to check your heart rhythm, a chest X-ray to rule out any lung problems, and some blood work—a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your sugar and kidney function, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Hmph. More poking and prodding. More waiting. More time wasted. Is that necessary? I just want pill. Fix heart, go home. But… wife say tests good. She always say tests good. So… fine. Do tests. But make it quick. I got birdhouse to finish! And tell me… how long I have to wait for results? Is long wait? I no have time for long wait.
DOCTOR: The lab should have the results within a couple of days, Mr. Sobkowicz. The X-ray results will take a little longer, perhaps three to five business days. In the meantime, I’m going to start you on a low-dose aspirin to help prevent blood clots, and I recommend you continue the diet your wife has implemented. We'll discuss the results and a more comprehensive plan when they come back. And I strongly advise limiting your stress as much as possible. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Aspirin… fine. Diet… fine. Stress… hard. Wife stress me. But… okay. I try. Three to five days… long time. You sure you can’t just… look at heart now? Feel heart? Tell me if bad. No need long wait. But fine. I do as you say. Now… can I go? Birdhouse waiting. Is important work. Don't want birds to get cold. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Sobkowicz, you may go. A nurse will be with you shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment and provide instructions for the lab tests. Please try to rest and minimize stress. And we'll discuss all of this in detail when the results come back. .
