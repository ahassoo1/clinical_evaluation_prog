DOCTOR: Hi Arbin, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hey Dr. Amussen, good to meet you too. It's about my eyes, I think. They've been really bothering me when I’m out in the sun. Like, really bothering me. It started a few weeks back, I'd say.
DOCTOR: Okay, your eyes bothering you in the sun… a few weeks now. Can you describe what "bothering" means exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It's not just feeling brighter, it's… painful, almost. Like a burning sensation. And everything gets blurry for a bit afterwards. It's not constant, only when I'm outside, especially on days like today – really sunny. It makes me squint a lot, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning sensation and blurry vision after sun exposure, worse on bright days, and you’re squinting. That helps. Does it happen immediately when you go outside, or does it take a little while?
PATIENT: It doesn't happen right away. Maybe five or ten minutes after I step out? And it seems to be worse if I haven't been out in a while, you know? Like, if it's been a cloudy day and I suddenly go into bright sunshine, it's much worse than if I’ve been outside a little bit already. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. So, it's more pronounced with sudden exposure after being indoors or in the shade. Have you noticed any redness, discharge, or anything feeling in your eye, like something is gritty?
PATIENT: No, no grit or discharge, thankfully. And I don't think they're red, but it’s hard to tell, honestly. I haven’t really looked closely at them. I just know they hurt when the sun’s on them. I do wear sunglasses most of the time now, which helps a bit, but I still get it sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no redness or discharge. Sunglasses help, which is good. Have you had any changes to your vision other than the blurriness with the sun?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything else seems normal. I had my eyes checked, I think it was… two years ago maybe? Just a regular check-up. Everything was fine then. I don't need glasses or anything. It's really just this sun thing. It's starting to worry me a little, though, because it's getting worse, even with the sunglasses.
DOCTOR: Alright. Two years since your last check-up. Okay, let’s do a quick exam, just to take a look. I'm going to check your visual acuity, and then I'll take a look at your eyes with a light and some magnification. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Amussen. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I’m happy to do whatever tests you need.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, if you could just stand about ten feet away and read the smallest line you can see on this chart, that would be perfect. Cover one eye with your hand, and we’ll do one eye at a time. Let’s start with your right eye.
PATIENT: Okay, right eye. Let's see… um… is that a… F? No, wait… it’s blurry. The line above… is that a B? I'm really having trouble with the small letters. It’s definitely worse than I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information. We'll document that. And now let's try your left eye. Cover your right eye.
PATIENT: Alright. Hmm… it's about the same, actually. Maybe a little worse? I can see the big letters okay, but the small ones are still blurry. I’m getting a headache trying to focus. Is that normal? That the letters get blurry so quickly?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take a quick look inside your eyes. This won't hurt, I just need you to look straight ahead. It’s just a light, so it might be a little bright. I'm going to shine it in each eye. Okay... I see some mild conjunctival injection in both eyes - that's just redness of the white part of the eye. Your pupils are reactive to light, which is good. And your retinas look normal. It’s not immediately concerning, but… I do see some subtle changes in the corneal epithelium – the clear front surface of your eye. It looks like there might be some superficial damage.
PATIENT: Corneal… what now? Is that bad? Is that what's causing the pain? And what does “injection” mean? I’m sorry, I’m not very good with medical terms. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries at all about the terms. “Injection” just means redness, like when your eye is irritated. The corneal epithelium is the clear outer layer of your eye. What I’m seeing suggests some minor damage to that layer, which could explain the pain and blurry vision, especially with sun exposure. It’s likely photokeratitis – essentially a sunburn of the cornea. It's not typically serious in the long term, but it is very uncomfortable. The good news is, it's usually self-limiting, meaning it will heal on its own. But we want to make sure it does, and prevent it from getting worse. Do you work or spend a lot of time outdoors?
PATIENT: Oh, a sunburn of the eye? That sounds awful! Yes, I do… I’m a dental assistant, so I’m inside most of the time, but I walk to work, and sometimes we have outdoor events for the clinic, things like health fairs. And I like to garden on the weekends, when the weather is nice. So, I’m outside a few hours a week, maybe more if it’s a nice summer. I try to wear sunglasses, but… maybe they’re not good enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some outdoor exposure. It sounds like it's likely cumulative sun exposure, rather than one big event. It’s good you’re wearing sunglasses, but not all sunglasses offer adequate UV protection. Here’s what I recommend: First, strict sun avoidance for the next 24-48 hours. Stay indoors as much as possible, and if you must be outside, wear a wide-brimmed hat and wrap-around sunglasses that block 100% of both UVA and UVB rays. I’m going to prescribe you some artificial tears – that’ll help keep your eye lubricated and comfortable. And I want you to follow up with an ophthalmologist – an eye specialist – in a week, just to make sure everything is healing properly. They can do a more thorough evaluation and rule out any other potential issues. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds… manageable. Strict sun avoidance, artificial tears, and see an eye specialist. I can definitely do that. I think I have a pair of wrap-around sunglasses somewhere… I’ll have to dig them out. And I'll ask my primary care doctor for a referral to an ophthalmologist. Will the artificial tears need a prescription from you, or can I get them at the pharmacy? And is there anything else I should be doing? Like, a cool compress or something?
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll send a prescription for the artificial tears to your pharmacy. You should be able to pick them up within a few hours. A cool compress can definitely help with the discomfort – just a clean, cool, damp cloth over your eyes for 15-20 minutes at a time, a few times a day. Avoid rubbing your eyes, as that can worsen the irritation. And really focus on those sunglasses. Look for ones specifically labeled as blocking 100% of UVA and UVB rays. Polarization is also good, but the most important thing is the UV protection. I'm also going to print out some information about photokeratitis to take with you. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: That's perfect, thank you so much, Dr. Amussen! The information sheet sounds helpful, and I’ll definitely look for better sunglasses. You've really put my mind at ease. I think that covers everything. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. Is there anything I need to do before I leave, like schedule the follow-up myself?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome! I’m glad I could help. No, you don’t need to schedule the follow-up yourself; just let your primary care doctor know you’ve seen me and they’ll handle the referral to an ophthalmologist. I’ll send the prescription to [Pharmacy Name], and the information sheet to the patient portal. Just remember, strict sun avoidance and the artificial tears are the most important things right now. If your symptoms worsen despite those measures – if you experience severe pain, vision loss, or any other concerning symptoms – please go to the emergency room immediately. Have a good day, and feel better soon! .
