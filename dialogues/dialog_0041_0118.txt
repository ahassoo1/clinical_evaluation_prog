DOCTOR: Hi Venard, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Polczynski, you say? A… foreign name, isn't it? No matter. I believe it’s something to do with… a certification. My ex-wife handled most of these things. Something about needing to be… up to date for my work. Healthcare, you know. All rather tedious, really. I can't recall the specifics, I’m afraid. Is this about my ears or my eyes? They both feel… adequate, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Right, a certification renewal. Yes, that sounds… plausible. It's alright if you don't recall specifics, we can figure it out. Healthcare is tedious, you're not wrong there. You mentioned your ears and eyes feel adequate... is that the only reason you're here today?
PATIENT: Adequate is… a generous term, perhaps. It’s not that they hurt, you understand. Just… old. I’m sixty, after all. Things wear down. My ex-wife insisted on these regular check-ups. Said something about liability. Always with the liability. I suppose if something were wrong, it would be… inconvenient. So, yes, I am here because she… strongly advised it. Though, honestly, I wouldn’t have bothered otherwise. Is this going to take long? I have a rather important appointment later. Though I can’t for the life of me remember what it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. "Adequate" is good to know. And no worries, I'll try to be as quick as possible. Just want to make sure everything is adequate, as you say. Just to be thorough, even if it’s just a quick check, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Good heavens. What sort of symptoms? I haven’t been ill, not precisely. A little tired, perhaps. But that’s hardly a symptom, is it? Sixty years will do that to a man. And… sometimes things are a bit blurry when I wake up. But that’s just… age. I read the newspaper, I watch television. I manage perfectly well. Honestly, I don't go around listing my… minor discomforts to doctors. Seems rather… undignified. Are you suggesting I have something wrong with me? Because I assure you… I feel quite… functional.
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all. I'm not suggesting anything. Just trying to get a complete picture. "Functional" is good to hear! Tiredness and a little blurriness upon waking are very common at your age, you're right. It's good you’re still managing well. Just to be sure, when you say blurry, is that with both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Ah. Now that’s a good question. I hadn’t actually considered that. Let me think… I believe… both. Yes, I think it’s both. Though I suppose it’s harder to tell, isn’t it? They both seem to… function at roughly the same level of… inadequacy. Perhaps. It’s truly a trivial matter. I maintain my license, I treat patients, and no one has complained. That’s what matters, isn’t it? Practicality. Is this going to involve any… drops in my eyes? I dislike having things put in my eyes. It’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Yes, practicality is very important. And you’re right to point out your successful practice – that’s excellent. We may need to do a quick eye exam, and that could involve a couple of drops, yes. It's just to get a better look, and it doesn’t usually take long. If you’re really averse to them, we can try to minimize it, but it might limit how much we can see. Would you prefer to try the exam without drops first and see how it goes?
PATIENT: Without drops, if you please. Minimizing unpleasantness is always a sound strategy. Honestly, I find the entire process rather… demeaning. Having a doctor poke and prod… it’s hardly dignified. I’ve been a healthcare professional for decades, you know. I’ve examined countless patients. I rather resent being on the other side of the table. So, yes, let’s attempt this… sans drops. Though I have a rather important engagement later, and I’m growing increasingly concerned about the time. What exactly are we looking for, if you don’t mind my asking? Not that I doubt your expertise, you understand. It’s just… I prefer to be informed.
DOCTOR: Of course. Absolutely. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do my best to make this as quick and comfortable as possible. We're just checking your vision and the health of your eyes, making sure everything is working as it should. We'll look for any changes that might explain the blurriness you're experiencing, and ensure there are no underlying issues. It's a standard part of a comprehensive check-up, even if it feels… undignified. If you don't mind, let's start by having you read the letters on that chart over there. Just read the smallest line you can clearly see.
PATIENT: Very well. A chart, you say? I trust this won't take long. I have… commitments. Though I can’t recall what they are, it’s imperative that I be punctual. Now, let's see... is that an E? Or perhaps a P? This is rather small, you know. My eyesight hasn’t been the same since… well, a very long time ago. F… L… Q? No, wait. Is that a B? This is… challenging. Are you certain this chart is calibrated correctly?
DOCTOR: Yes, the chart is calibrated correctly. It’s alright if you’re having trouble – it just helps me get a baseline. Don't strain your eyes. Just read the letters as best you can. It’s perfectly fine to guess, or to tell me if you can't see them. Let's try covering your left eye with your hand, and then we’ll do the same with your right. Just tell me which letters you can see with each eye covered.
PATIENT: Covering eyes, you say? This feels… unusual. But very well. Now, let me see… this is… even more difficult. The letters seem… blurred and indistinct. I believe that’s a… V? No, wait… is that a P again? Good heavens, this is proving to be quite taxing. My brain feels… sluggish. I suspect my ex-wife was correct. Perhaps my eyesight is deteriorating. Though I refuse to admit defeat just yet. This is… quite the ordeal. Is there a comfortable chair available?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Please, have a seat. It's alright to take your time. It seems like you're having some difficulty with your vision in both eyes. Don’t worry, this isn't unusual at your age, but we need to figure out what’s causing it. Just to get a better understanding, have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Good heavens, where does one begin? Well, I suppose things haven't been as… crisp as they once were. It's difficult to pinpoint a specific moment, you understand. Time tends to blur together, especially at my age. But I believe I’ve been struggling to read the newspaper without… straining my eyes. And occasionally, I have a bit of trouble discerning faces from a distance. Though that could simply be due to… poor lighting. Or perhaps my ex-wife’s questionable choice of curtains. She always had… peculiar taste. But a specific change? No, I can't recall anything particularly noteworthy. Just a gradual… decline in overall visual acuity. A perfectly natural process, I assure you. Though I must confess, it’s becoming rather inconvenient. Is this going to require… corrective lenses? I detest wearing glasses. They’re so… unflattering.
DOCTOR: I understand. Corrective lenses are often an option, but we don't have to jump to that conclusion just yet. Let's try a few more tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. Have you noticed any double vision, or any dark spots or floaters in your vision?
PATIENT: Double vision? No, thankfully not. That sounds… most unpleasant. I have enough trouble seeing one version of reality, thank you very much. And dark spots? Occasionally, I see… shimmering shapes when I close my eyes. But I attribute that to… fatigue. Or perhaps indigestion. I had a rather heavy lunch today. My ex-wife always insisted on feeding me enormous portions. Said I was too thin. Honestly, she was… a whirlwind of unsolicited advice. Floaters, you say? No, I haven't noticed anything floating about. Though sometimes, I feel a bit… lightheaded. But that’s simply due to… the stress of being examined by a doctor. It’s rather… invasive, you know. Are you certain all these tests are necessary? This is taking a considerable amount of time. I have… obligations. Though I still can't recall what they are. Perhaps I should simply accept my fate and purchase a pair of glasses. Though I loathe the idea.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. These tests are just to help us determine the best course of action, and to rule out anything serious. We want to make sure we're addressing the underlying cause of your vision changes, not just masking the symptoms. Just one more question for now. Have you noticed any pain or redness in your eyes recently?
PATIENT: Pain? No, absolutely not. My eyes feel… perfectly normal, aside from the… general lack of clarity. Redness? Occasionally, they feel a bit… dry after a long day. But that’s simply due to… staring at a computer screen. I manage countless patient records, you understand. It’s a rather tedious process. Honestly, I prefer reading actual books. But my ex-wife insisted on digitizing everything. Said it was more efficient. She was… relentlessly pragmatic. Honestly, doctor, I’m starting to feel a bit… overwhelmed. All these questions, all these tests… It’s rather exhausting. And my mind is… a bit foggy today. I suspect I’m simply getting old. Perhaps I should simply accept my fate and purchase a pair of glasses. Though I loathe the idea. Is there any possibility this is simply due to… fatigue? Or perhaps a slight vitamin deficiency? I do tend to skip breakfast.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I'm overwhelming you. It's perfectly reasonable to feel tired, especially with everything you've been through. Fatigue and a vitamin deficiency could certainly play a role. However, given your changes in vision, we still need to rule out any other underlying causes. Just to be thorough, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Heavens, no. I maintain a… reasonably healthy diet, despite my ex-wife's attempts to fatten me up. High blood pressure? I haven't been formally diagnosed, but I do tend to get a bit… agitated when discussing her. She was… a force of nature, to put it mildly. Honestly, doctor, I believe my primary medical condition is… exasperation. And perhaps a touch of… forgetfulness. I find it increasingly difficult to recall details. My ex-wife always handled all the medical paperwork. She was… relentlessly organized. I believe I had a rather mild case of the flu a few years ago. But other than that, I've been… reasonably healthy. Though my eyesight has been deteriorating, as we've established. Honestly, I suspect this is simply due to… old age. Is there any possibility this is simply a natural process? Perhaps I should simply accept my fate and purchase a pair of glasses. Though I loathe the idea. And I'm starting to feel quite lightheaded. I believe I need a cup of tea. Or perhaps a lie-down.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel tired and overwhelmed. Given your lightheadedness and concerns about memory issues, let's take a moment. I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse just to be safe, and then we can discuss your options. Perhaps a cup of tea would be a good idea afterwards. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, that's a question I haven't considered in decades. I believe… possibly to penicillin? My ex-wife always insisted on keeping a detailed medical history. She was… obsessively cautious. But honestly, I can't recall definitively. It was a very long time ago. Honestly, doctor, I suspect I’m allergic to… unsolicited advice. And perhaps to… digital paperwork. But those are hardly medical concerns. I believe my primary allergy is to… fatigue. And perhaps to… old age. I do have a slight sensitivity to… strong perfumes. But that’s hardly relevant, is it? Honestly, I suspect my primary sensitivity is to… questioning. And perhaps to… examinations. I believe I need a cup of tea. Immediately. And perhaps a lie-down. This is… exhausting. And my mind is… a bit foggy today. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite lightheaded. And I can’t recall what we were discussing. Perhaps we should simply forget the entire ordeal. And I can’t recall my ex-wife’s name.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you're feeling quite unwell, and it's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. Your memory lapses are concerning, and it's important we address those as well. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. And then, I'm going to recommend we get you a cup of tea and a comfortable place to rest. After that, I think it would be a good idea to do some more thorough testing to determine the cause of your memory issues. Before we proceed, do you have anyone we can contact in case of an emergency?
PATIENT: Emergency? Good heavens, that's a rather… alarming question. Emergency contact? Honestly, I... I’m not certain. My ex-wife… she handled all the… arrangements. She was… relentlessly organized. But we… we are no longer in contact. I have a… a son, perhaps? A distant memory, vaguely recalled. But I haven't spoken to him in… decades. Honestly, I can't recall his name. Or his location. Or his… profession. He was… always a bit distant, if I recall correctly. Honestly, I… I believe I’m alone. Perhaps… perhaps you could just… leave a message? Tell him I… I require assistance? Or simply… tell him I’m thinking of him? Honestly, I can’t recall what I was discussing. And I’m starting to feel quite lightheaded. And I can’t recall my own name. Perhaps we should simply forget the entire ordeal. And I can’t recall what we were discussing. And I can’t recall what we were discussing.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s alright. We’ll do everything we can to help. We'll try to locate your son, and in the meantime, we’ll ensure you’re comfortable and safe. Right now, let’s focus on getting your blood pressure and pulse checked. Then, we’ll get you a cup of tea and a comfortable place to rest. After that, we'll run some tests to determine what’s going on. And we will locate your son. Before we proceed, are you experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or weakness on one side of your body?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, not precisely. A slight… discomfort, perhaps. A tightness, if you will. But it’s… manageable. Shortness of breath? Occasionally, I feel a bit… winded. But that’s simply due to… old age. And weakness? I do feel a bit… fatigued, if you will. But that’s… manageable. Honestly, doctor, I’m starting to feel quite… disoriented. And my mind is… a complete blank. I can’t recall what we were discussing. And I can’t recall my own name. And I can’t recall where I am. And I can’t recall what we were discussing. And I can’t recall what we were discussing. And I can’t recall… anything. Perhaps… perhaps we should simply forget the entire ordeal. And I can’t recall… anything.
DOCTOR: We need assistance in here, stat! Patient is experiencing significant cognitive decline and disorientation. Possible acute medical event. Please bring a crash cart and prepare for transport. It's alright. Help is on the way. Just try to relax. We're here to help you. Don't worry.
