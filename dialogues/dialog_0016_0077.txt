DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, doctor. Bigger is the name. They sent me here... something about the work. I been working down in that mine a long time, you know. Long, long time. They say I need checkin’ even though I feel alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bigger. It sounds like this is a check-up related to your work at the mine, which is good – proactive is always best. Even if you feel alright, it’s important to make sure everything is as it should be, especially with the type of work you do. “Long, long time” is a while! Could you tell me a bit more about what kind of work you've been doing in the mine?
PATIENT: Work? I operate the big machines. The loaders, mostly. Moving rocks, dirt... all that stuff. Underground. Dark down there. Been doin’ it… well, since before you were born, I reckon. Nearly fifty years now. They got new machines now, fancy things. But I know how to handle them all. It's honest work, you know? Hard work. But honest.
DOCTOR: That is a long time, Mr. Bigger! And that sounds like very physically demanding work, even with the newer machines. Honest work is the best kind, I agree. Okay, so nearly fifty years operating machinery underground. Have you noticed any changes recently – any new aches and pains, trouble breathing, or maybe even just feeling more tired than usual?
PATIENT: Aches and pains? Well, I’m eighty-six years old, doctor! Of course I got aches and pains! What eighty-six-year-old doesn’t ache? But nothing… nothing special. Just the old age creepin’ in, you know? Tired? Sometimes. But I sleep good enough. It's not like I’m runnin’ marathons anymore.
DOCTOR: You’re right to point that out, Mr. Bigger! Eighty-six years is a long life, and a few aches and pains are perfectly normal. It’s good to hear you’re sleeping okay. Since you’ve been working in the mine for so long, I’d like to ask a few more specific questions, just to be thorough. Have you ever had any issues with your lungs – like coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath – either now or in the past?
PATIENT: Coughin’? Sometimes, a little. Dust down there, you know? It gets in your lungs. Always has. Everybody coughs. It’s… it’s just the mine. Nothin’ to worry about. I never went to the doctor for it. Men don’t complain about a little cough. We just get on with it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. And I appreciate your honesty. It's true that a little cough is common in that environment. But even a “little cough” can sometimes be a sign of something that needs attention, especially with long-term exposure to dust. To get a better understanding, could you describe the cough for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It’s… dry. Not much phlegm, if any. Mostly in the mornings, when I first wake up. Sometimes after I’ve been… exertin’ myself. Like walkin’ up a hill. But it goes away. It ain’t a bad cough, doctor. Really. Just a… a miner’s cough. They all got it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dry cough, mostly in the mornings and after exertion. “A miner’s cough,” you say. I hear you. It’s helpful to know it’s been a long-term thing. Now, have you ever noticed any black spots or streaks in your sputum , even if it’s just occasionally?
PATIENT: Sputum? You want me to… look for black spots in my cough? Doctor, I don’t spend my days examinin’ what I cough up! That’s… that’s ridiculous! I told you, it’s a dry cough! There ain’t nothin’ to examine! It’s just air.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to point that out, Mr. Bigger. That was a poorly phrased question, and I apologize. I didn't mean to suggest you needed to examine your cough! It was a thoughtless way of asking about potential exposure to coal dust. Let's move on. Have you ever been exposed to any other dusts or chemicals at the mine, besides coal dust?
PATIENT: Chemicals? Well, they spray somethin’ now and again. To keep the dust down, I suppose. Smells kinda funny. But I don’t pay it much mind. I stay outta the way when they spray. It’s not like I’m breathin’ it in on purpose. They got signs up, tellin’ you to move. I read the signs.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some spraying for dust control, and you avoid it when they're doing it. Good. That’s very sensible of you. Now, thinking about your overall health, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor told me somethin’ about that a few years back. Said I needed to watch my salt intake. That’s about all I remember. I don't really go to the doctor much. Ain't nothin' broken, don't fix it, that’s what my daddy always said. Diabetes? No, never heard nothin’ about that. Heart problems… I get a little chest pain sometimes, but that’s just old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, managed with salt intake, and occasional chest pain. That’s helpful to know. “Occasional chest pain” is something we should explore a little further. Could you describe the chest pain for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It’s… a tightness. Like somethin’ squeezin’. Comes and goes. Usually when I been… exertin’ myself. Walkin’ up hills, carryin’ somethin’ heavy. It don't last long, just a few minutes. Then it goes away. It ain’t a bad pain, doctor. More like… discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tightness or discomfort in the chest, brought on by exertion, lasting a few minutes. It’s good you're able to describe it so clearly. Now, I'm going to ask about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… I take a little somethin’ for my joints. The arthritis, you know? Makes ‘em ache less. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take one of them… sleepin’ pills. The little red ones. That’s about it. Nothin’ fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so medication for arthritis and occasional sleeping pills. Do you remember the names of those medications, if possible?
PATIENT: Names? No, doctor. I don’t pay attention to names. My daughter buys ‘em for me. She knows what I need. I just take ‘em when I need ‘em. I ain’t one for rememberin’ fancy names. Red pills for sleepin’, and… somethin’ white for my joints. That’s all I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, red pills for sleep and white pills for your joints. That’s alright, we can often figure it out. Now, a few questions about your past. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason, other than a routine overnight stay?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Hmm… let me see. Not really. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy. But that wasn’t nothin’ serious. Fixed it right up. And… my wife, bless her soul, she was in the hospital a few times. But that was years ago. I haven’t been in a hospital myself, not for anythin’ major.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major hospitalizations. And I’m sorry to hear about your wife. Now, thinking about your family, do you have a family history of any medical conditions, like heart disease, cancer, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Family history… My daddy, he smoked like a chimney his whole life. Ended up with somethin’ bad in his lungs. That’s about all I remember. My mama, she was a strong woman. Lived to be ninety, I think. Didn't have much trouble with nothin’, as far as I know. And my siblings… mostly just old age got to ‘em. Nothin’ fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a father with lung problems from smoking, and a mother who lived to a good age with no major health issues. Now, last few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Doctor, I told you my daddy smoked. I never touched the stuff. Smells awful, bad for you. No, never smoked a day in my life. Never will.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Bigger. And good for you for avoiding it. Now, do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Alcohol? A little somethin’ now and then. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Or a beer with the boys on a Saturday. Nothin’ fancy. Don't go gettin' drunk or nothin'. Just a little somethin’ to relax. I ain’t a big drinker, doctor. Never have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little alcohol – a glass of wine or a beer occasionally. That’s good to know. Alright, Mr. Bigger, that gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to check things out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don’t be pokin’ and proddin’ too much. I ain’t a young man anymore, you know. Just be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bigger. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, Mr. Bigger, your blood pressure is a little elevated. And I noticed some slightly diminished breath sounds and a bit of wheezing when you breathe. I also felt some tenderness in your hands. I want to get some further tests done to see what's going on. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and some blood work, including a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. We'll also do a spirometry test, which measures how well your lungs are working. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests… Seems like all I do is go to the doctor and get tests done. Fine, fine. Do what you gotta do. But I hope it don't take too long. I got things to do, you know? But what exactly are you lookin' for? What’s wrong? You said somethin' about my breathin'.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bigger. I wish we could get a clear picture without tests, but they're important to help me understand what's going on. I noticed some slightly diminished breath sounds and wheezing, which could indicate a number of things. Given your long history of working in the mine, I'm concerned about the possibility of chronic lung disease, such as bronchitis or even pneumoconiosis—sometimes called “black lung disease.” The chest X-ray will help us see if there are any changes in your lungs, and the spirometry test will measure how well you’re able to breathe. The blood work will help me assess your overall health and rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Black lung disease? You think I got black lung? All those years down there… Is it bad? My brother… he got sick, years ago. Couldn’t breathe… ended up in the hospital. Is that what you’re thinkin’?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Bigger. It’s natural to be worried when you hear about a condition like black lung disease, especially given your brother’s experience. It’s too early to say for certain whether you have black lung disease. That's what these tests are for. We need to see the results of the chest X-ray and spirometry test before we can make any diagnosis. Black lung disease, also known as pneumoconiosis, is caused by long-term exposure to coal dust. Symptoms can range from mild coughing and shortness of breath to more severe breathing difficulties. It can be serious, but it’s also manageable, especially if it’s caught early. We’re going to get to the bottom of this, and I'll explain everything to you step-by-step. Once we have the test results, we can discuss your options and create a plan to keep you healthy. Do you want me to go over what the X-ray and spirometry test involves?
PATIENT: Explain it. Tell me what they're gonna do. I don't like bein' in the dark. What does the spirometry… thing… involve? Is it painful?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bigger. I want you to feel as comfortable as possible. The chest X-ray is a quick and painless procedure. You'll simply stand or sit in front of a machine, and a small amount of radiation will pass through your chest to create an image of your lungs and heart. It takes just a few minutes. The spirometry test is a little different. You’ll be asked to breathe deeply into a tube connected to a machine that measures how much air you can inhale and exhale, and how quickly you can do it. You’ll take a few deep breaths in and out, and we’ll repeat the test several times to make sure we get an accurate reading. It's not painful at all, but it does require some effort. You may feel a little lightheaded afterwards, but that's usually temporary. A technician will be right there with you to explain everything and make sure you’re comfortable. Would you like me to have someone from the office explain it to you again, and maybe show you a video of what the procedures look like?
PATIENT: A video… that might be good. I like seein’ things before they do ‘em. Yes, a video would be helpful. And… what if it is black lung? What then?
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ll have the nurse bring in some information about the procedures and a video explaining them. And you're right to ask about what happens if it is black lung disease. If the tests confirm a diagnosis, the treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Mild cases may require monitoring and lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking and avoiding irritants. More severe cases may require oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, or even medication to help you breathe easier. We'd also discuss strategies to manage your symptoms and prevent complications. It's important to remember that even with black lung disease, many people can still lead active and fulfilling lives. We have excellent resources available to help you. I want you to know that I’m here to support you every step of the way. We’ll take things one step at a time and make sure you have all the information you need to make informed decisions about your health. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done and see what the results show. Would you like me to schedule those for you now?
PATIENT: Yes… schedule the tests. Get it over with. The sooner I know, the sooner I can… well, the sooner I can figure things out. Just… try not to keep me waitin' too long for the results, doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bigger. I understand. I’ll schedule the chest X-ray and spirometry test for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. The technician will call you to confirm the appointment. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible, usually within a few days. The nurse will contact you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath or chest pain, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all for now. Just… thank you, doctor. For explainin' things. And… for not makin' me feel like an old fool.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bigger. It’s my job to help you understand your health and feel comfortable. You are absolutely not an old fool, and I appreciate you trusting me with your care. The nurse will be in shortly to give you some written instructions about the tests and answer any further questions you may have. Please take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. Don't hesitate to call if anything comes up. Have a good rest of your day, Mr. Bigger.
