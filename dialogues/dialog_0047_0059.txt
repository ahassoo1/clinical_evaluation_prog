DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s my speech. It’s been… a bit off, I think. Hard to explain, really. It feels slurred sometimes. I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. Just… gradually, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Gradually, you say. And when you say "slurred," can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate… yes. Hmm. It’s like… the words don’t come out clearly, sometimes. Like I’m mumbling, maybe? Or… like I’m trying to say something fast, but it gets all jumbled. It doesn’t happen all the time, though. Mostly when I’m… tired, perhaps? Or stressed. Though, to be honest, I can't really pinpoint it. It's just… there. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. "Sometimes," "when tired," "when stressed"... these are all rather vague. It makes it difficult to get a proper picture. Has anyone else noticed this?
PATIENT: Oh, my husband, definitely. He’s always telling me to slow down and speak clearly. He gets a bit worried, bless him. I… I don’t think I pay much attention to it most of the time. It doesn't feel like a huge deal, you know? Just… annoying. I’m not sure if anyone else has said anything. I work on the construction site, so things are usually pretty loud. It's hard to tell if someone's just shouting over the machinery or if they're telling me to speak up.
DOCTOR: A construction site, right. Well, that certainly complicates things. And how long have you been working on the construction site, Adyn?
PATIENT: Oh… um… let me think. It's been… a while now. About two years, I think? Maybe a little longer. It all blurs together, honestly. I've been a manager there the whole time, mostly paperwork and checking things are done properly, but I’m out on the site quite a bit, making sure everyone’s safe. It’s a busy place. I don’t know if that… if that has anything to do with it.
DOCTOR: Two years. Alright. And before that, what were you doing?
PATIENT: Before that… hmm. That’s a bit of a blur, actually. I… I went to school for business, I think. Then I worked in an office for a little while. It wasn't very interesting, mostly just answering phones and filing. That was… a few years ago. Honestly, it all feels like a different lifetime. Does it matter? I just want to know if this speech thing is something to worry about.
DOCTOR: Everything matters, Adyn. We need to establish a timeline to see if there's any correlation. Office work… was the speech issue present then?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Sorry. No, I don't think so. No, definitely not. I remember my speech being perfectly fine in the office. It was… boring, but clear, if that makes sense? It started, I think, after I started at the construction site. Or… maybe a little while after? It’s just… it’s hard to remember the specifics. Everything felt a bit… stressful settling into the new job, if that helps. It was a big change.
DOCTOR: A significant change. Alright. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this slurred speech?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No, not really. No headaches, no dizziness. My arms and legs feel fine. I haven’t noticed any weakness or anything like that. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but I put that down to the long hours. And, honestly, I just thought I was getting old. Is that silly? I’m only nineteen, but… life is busy.
DOCTOR: Nineteen is hardly "old", Adyn. However, fatigue is a non-specific symptom. Let’s move on. Do you have any past medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Past medical history… no, not really. I haven’t been sick much. Just the usual childhood things – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. Nothing serious. I had my tonsils out when I was little, but that was ages ago. No allergies that I know of. I get Medicare, so… I suppose if there was anything major, they’d know about it. Sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful. I just don’t remember much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s see what Medicare has on file. … Hmm. No significant medical history listed. Tonsillectomy at age five, as you said. No allergies recorded. And you are currently taking no medications, correct?
PATIENT: No medications. Correct. Never have. I don't like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Everything feels alright otherwise, honestly. Just… this speech thing. It’s probably nothing, isn't it? A bit of stress, maybe? Or just tiredness. It just… worries my husband. He's a bit of a worrier, bless him.
DOCTOR: Well, we shouldn’t dismiss anything entirely. Let's do a quick neurological exam. Just to rule out anything obvious. Can you follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, I can do that. Is this going to be long? I have a meeting later, with the foreman, about the new building plans. He’s not very patient. But, yes, I’m following your finger. It's a bit… blurry, though. Not your fault, just… my eyesight isn't the best.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright? It feels… a bit funny. I haven’t been smiling much lately, with all the work. Everything's been a bit stressful. I hope I’m not doing it wrong. Is that better?
DOCTOR: Adequate facial symmetry. Now, stick your tongue out. As far as you can.
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… not very elegant, is it? My husband always says I have a terrible poker face. I guess that shows in my tongue too. Is that alright? It feels a bit silly, doing this.
DOCTOR: No obvious fasciculations. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright? I don’t want to hurt you. I work with my hands all day, so they're pretty strong. I'm a construction manager, you see. Mostly paperwork, but sometimes I have to check things on site, make sure everything's up to code. Are they strong enough?
DOCTOR: Adequate grip strength. Alright. Now, can you try and push your hands against mine, like you're trying to resist me pushing yours together?
PATIENT: Like this? Is this what you mean? It feels… a bit odd. I’m trying to push, but it’s not very strong. I haven't been doing much physical work lately, mostly just paperwork. Everything’s been… a bit stressful, you see. My husband keeps telling me I need to slow down. Am I doing it wrong?
DOCTOR: Hmm. And can you walk heel-to-toe for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh! Sorry! That's… not very good, is it? I haven’t been feeling very steady on my feet lately. Everything's been a bit… blurry, you see? And I'm a bit tired. And I haven't had breakfast yet. Am I alright? I don't want to make a mess.
DOCTOR: Alright, Adyn, please sit down. Now, I think we need to order some bloodwork, just to rule out a few things. And I'm going to refer you to a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation. The instability and the speech changes, coupled with the difficulty with coordination… it warrants further investigation. We need to be thorough. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Bloodwork? Is it… is it something serious, Doctor? I just thought it was stress. Or tiredness. My husband… he’ll be so worried. I don't understand. What are you looking for? Is it something I did? I've been working so hard, trying to keep everything together. This is… this is a bit much.
DOCTOR: Adyn, please. Let's not jump to conclusions. It's far too early to say what's going on. The bloodwork will help us rule out common causes, and the neurologist is a specialist who can assess your neurological function in more detail. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. There are many possible explanations. I’m referring you as a precaution. I'm going to order a full blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a vitamin B12 level. We’ll also need to rule out any signs of infection. I’ll have the receptionist schedule you with Dr. Chen, a very good neurologist at City Hospital. Do you have any questions?
