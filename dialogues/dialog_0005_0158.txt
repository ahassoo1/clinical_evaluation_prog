DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wrye, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Well, it’s about… a letter. For my dog. You know, to prove I have a dog. Honestly, the whole thing is just… silly. Some place needs proof? Really? I can’t even remember which place now, though. It's one of those things… paperwork, paperwork, always paperwork.
DOCTOR: A letter… for your dog?
PATIENT: Yes! A pet ownership letter. Honestly, it's ridiculous. I've had dogs my whole life. Good, well-behaved dogs, mind you. Not like those little yappy things some people keep. But they need proof? It's probably some apartment complex thing. Or… was it for boarding? Ugh, I really wish I could remember. It’s just… a letter saying I own a dog. Is that so hard to believe?
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, we can certainly document that you own a dog. It's... unusual, but not unheard of to need documentation like that. Let’s try to figure out why you need it, though. Do you recall anything else about this request?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. My niece, she handles a lot of my… things. She probably told me. She's very organized. I just… showed up with the request. And now I’m here. It feels like a waste of my time, frankly. And yours, probably. It’s not like I need a note saying I’m allowed to own a pet. I have a pet! A lovely dog, a very good girl. She’s a… well, she’s big. A big girl. Brown. Mostly brown, anyway.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Well, let’s get some basic information down, just in case. Have you ever been to this clinic before?
PATIENT: No, never. Found you online, I think. Or maybe my niece found you. Honestly, they all look the same to me. A lot of waiting rooms and… smells. Not a fan of the smells. Do you have air freshener in here? It’s… pungent.
DOCTOR: Yes, we do, though clearly it isn't to your liking. Let's focus on getting you what you need. And perhaps figure out what that is. Now, outside of needing this letter, are you experiencing any health issues?
PATIENT: Health issues? Me? No, not particularly. I mean, I'm getting older, of course. A little creaky in the mornings, that's all. But nothing a good cup of tea can’t fix. My dog, she's healthy as a horse, too. Very energetic, for her size. We go for walks, you know. Keeps us both going. I just don't understand why I'm filling out forms about her health when all I need is a piece of paper.
DOCTOR: Alright. While we're establishing that you and your dog are both feeling relatively well, it’s standard procedure to get a complete medical history. It’s just good practice. So, have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Significant… Now you're asking. That's a long time ago. I had… tonsils out when I was little, I think. And maybe… appendicitis? It was a while back. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I’ve been perfectly healthy for years, though. Mostly. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older. I really don't see how any of this is relevant to a letter about my dog. It’s terribly inefficient, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, possible appendectomy. Okay. And, Ms. Wrye, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. Let me think. Not to anything major, I don’t believe. I get a bit of a sniffle with dust, but that's hardly an allergy. And sometimes with… strong perfumes. They give me a headache. But I wouldn't say I’m allergic. My niece is the one with allergies. Poor thing. She can’t eat half the things on the menu. It’s a nightmare. I’m quite robust, myself. That’s probably why I haven’t had any issues.
DOCTOR: Alright. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my creaky knees sometimes. You know, when they really bother me. It’s… Ibuprofen, I think? The regular kind. Nothing fancy. And sometimes a little tea with… something in it for sleep. My niece gets it for me. It’s herbal, she says. I just take it when I can't get to sleep. Honestly, I barely remember what I took yesterday, let alone what I take regularly. It’s all very… ad hoc. Again, I don't see the connection to this letter! Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration. However, as a physician, I have a responsibility to gather a complete medical picture. Even seemingly unrelated information can be important. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, no. Never smoked. Disgusting habit. And I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. Very moderate. Recreational drugs? Absolutely not! I have standards, you know. I lead a very… respectable life. My niece would be appalled. Honestly, this is starting to feel like an interrogation! And still, we haven't addressed the letter. Is this some kind of test? Are you trying to see if I’m a responsible pet owner by asking me these… personal questions? It's terribly rude, frankly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, this is not a test. It's standard practice. Now, you mentioned your niece handles a lot of things for you. Is she your primary caregiver?
PATIENT: Well, she assists me, yes. She’s very organized, as I’ve said. She helps with the paperwork, the bills, things like that. And she drives me to appointments sometimes. She's a good girl, my niece. Very responsible. She's probably the reason I'm even here, to be honest. She must have insisted. She worries about me, you see. I’m quite independent, but I appreciate her help. Still… I wish we could get back to the letter. What place needs proof I own a dog? It's utterly baffling. And frankly, it's wasting both of our time.
DOCTOR: Alright. This form asks for the reason for the pet ownership letter. Could you attempt to recall anything about it?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Another form? Honestly! Let me see… ...It’s… blank. Completely blank. I have no idea. I truly don't recall what this is for. Maybe it's for… housing? Or… a vacation? I don't know! My niece filled out most of this, I suspect. She's the one with the attention to detail. It's driving me mad trying to remember! I just want a piece of paper saying I own a dog and be done with it! Is that too much to ask? Honestly, I'm starting to think I should have just stayed home. It’s all rather… upsetting.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like you are very frustrated, and I apologize for the delay. Given your difficulty recalling the specifics, let's approach this differently. Do you mind if I conduct a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? What on earth for? It's a letter! You're a doctor, yes, but you're not examining the dog! And I certainly haven't brought her with me. Honestly, this is… preposterous. I came here for a simple document, and now you want to… poke and prod me? No, absolutely not. I'm quite certain I don't need a physical exam. My niece would be furious. This is… quite enough. I think I'll just leave. I can find someone else who won't waste my time with unnecessary procedures. Honestly, it's ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wrye. I understand. I apologize that I couldn’t be of more assistance. Given that you are unable to provide information regarding the purpose of the letter, and are declining a medical exam, I am unable to fulfill your request at this time. If you are able to recall any details, please do not hesitate to contact my office.
