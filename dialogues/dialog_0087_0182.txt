DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I'm Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, let’s get this over with. I need a signature, that’s all. Some…young lady on the phone said I need to be cleared for…well, a little touch-up. A bit of vanity, if you must know. Not that it’s necessary, mind you, but my daughter insisted. She worries about everything.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. So, to clarify, you’re here for medical clearance for an elective cosmetic procedure?
PATIENT: Elective, yes. That’s a fancy word for wanting to look a little less…weathered. It's not like I'm getting a hip replacement! And frankly, I don’t see what a doctor needs to clear me for. I’ve lived eighty-one years without needing anyone’s permission to do anything. But, here I am. Just tell me what forms need signing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Orwin. While it is an elective procedure, it’s my responsibility to ensure you are medically stable enough to safely undergo it. It’s a standard precaution. I’m reviewing your chart now. Do you have any known allergies, or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I eat everything. Grew up on a farm, you know. Builds character. And medications… let me think. Just a little something for my blood pressure, now and then. The doctor – Dr. Hemmings, good man – prescribed it a few years back. Can't recall the name, though. Something…pink? No, white. Small white pill. I take it when I remember. Not every day, mind you. Only when it feels a bit…tight.
DOCTOR: I see. We'll need to get the exact name and dosage of that medication for the clearance form, Mr. Orwin. Do you happen to have a list of your medications, or perhaps remember the last time you refilled it?
PATIENT: Refilled it? Heavens, no. My daughter handles all that. She fusses over everything. She has a list, I suppose. But she’s at work. And I'm not about to bother her over a little pill. Look, can’t we just skip this part? I'm perfectly healthy, thank you very much. I still shovel snow in the winter, you know. Well, I did last winter. Maybe not as much as usual... but still. It’s a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. However, even occasional blood pressure medication can affect how you respond to certain procedures. It’s important for the surgeon to be aware of everything you're taking to avoid any complications. Perhaps we can proceed with a brief physical exam to assess your overall health?
PATIENT: A physical exam? At my age? What for? I’ve had doctors poke and prod me for eighty years! They all said the same thing: “Healthy as an ox.” Well, maybe not an ox now. But still! Honestly, this is ridiculous. Is this some new rule? I just want a signature. It’s a simple face lift, not open-heart surgery! Look, if you’re not going to sign the form, just say so. I have other things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I assure you this isn't about questioning your overall health. It's a standard precaution to ensure your safety during any procedure, however minor. A brief exam – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs – will take only a few minutes and allow me to complete the clearance form responsibly. If everything is within normal limits, I will be happy to sign it for you. Would you be willing to allow me to do that?
PATIENT: Oh, fine. Just get it over with. But don't go poking around too much, alright? I haven’t got all day, and I'd like to be home before supper. And don’t tell my daughter about all this fuss. She’ll have a field day. Honestly, the things I do for that girl…
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Orwin. We'll keep it brief. If you could please have a seat on the table, we'll start with your blood pressure. Then I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs. It will only take a few moments.
PATIENT: Honestly, all this fuss for a little lift… Do be gentle, young lady. My bones aren’t what they used to be. And don’t go thinking you’re going to find anything wrong with me. I’ve lived a good, long life. A good life. Now, get on with it. Before I change my mind. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Just relax and breathe normally. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 86. Do you usually have readings this high?
