DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It nice to meet you as well. Well, is just… I been feeling very thirsty lately. And hungry too, all the time. Is not a normal thing for me, you know? I does eat when I hungry, of course, but this is different. Is like I can’t get enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information to start with. Increased thirst and hunger can be caused by a lot of different things. Can you tell me a little more about when you started noticing this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see now. Is hard to say exactly. Maybe… about a month or so ago? It start slow, just feeling a little more thirsty than usual. Then the hunger come after, maybe two weeks after that. Is been getting worse each week, that I know for sure. I does try to drink more water, but it not helping much. And I does eat, but then I hungry again soon after. Is just… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month ago, starting with increased thirst and then increased hunger following a couple of weeks later. And it's been progressively worsening. That's helpful. Besides the thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… Well, I does feel a little tired, yes. More tired than usual. I always been a busy woman, you know, working and so on, but this is a different kind of tired. And… I does have to go to the bathroom more often, too. Especially at night. Is a bother, waking up so much. But other than that, I don't think so. Nothing else really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased thirst, increased hunger, fatigue, and increased urination, particularly at night. Those symptoms together are definitely worth investigating. Now, just to get a better picture, have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision? Not that I notice, no. I does wear glasses for reading, always have, but I haven't had to change the prescription or anything. Everything look the same as always, as far as I can tell. Is a little blurry when I don’t have them on, but that normal for me. Is not worse than usual, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know your vision hasn't changed. And you've been wearing glasses for reading for a while. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any of those things. Never been told I have anything wrong with me, really. I does get a little aches and pains, like any old woman, but nothing serious. My husband, he have high blood pressure, but I don't. I try to eat healthy, you know? And I always been a strong woman, never really sick. I don't go to the doctor much. Is just this thirst and hunger… is worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know you haven't been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions. And your husband has high blood pressure. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries, no hospital. Not ever. I had all my babies at home, with the midwife. Is how things was done back then. And I been lucky, never needed anything like that. Just the usual things, colds and flu, but nothing serious enough for the hospital. I does try to stay healthy, you know? I walk a lot, and I eat my fruits and vegetables. Is just… this feeling, is new. And is getting worse. I worry is something bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. That's helpful. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she have… what you call it? Sugar sickness. Diabetes, yes. She have that for many years. My father, he have heart problems, later in life. And my brother, he have high blood pressure, like my husband. But that's about it, I think. Nobody else in the family have anything serious, as far as I know. Is why I worried about this thirst and hunger, you know? Because of my mother.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had diabetes, your father had heart problems, and your brother has high blood pressure. That family history is important to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't take any pills, nothing at all. I does try to stay away from those things, if I can. I does drink a little bush tea sometimes, for a cough or a cold, but that's it. Is just natural herbs, nothing from the pharmacy. I prefer to let my body heal itself, if it can. Is why I been putting off coming to the doctor, you know? I don't like taking pills. But this thirst and hunger… is worrying me too much to ignore.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, no supplements, just some bush tea occasionally. That’s good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I never been allergic to anything. I eat all kinds of food, and I never had a reaction. I does get a few mosquito bites, like everybody else, but that not an allergy. I never had a serious allergy, not ever. I does try to stay away from things I don't know, but I never had a bad reaction to anything. Is just this thirst and hunger... is so strange. And it's getting worse each day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Is just… I want to know what’s wrong, you know? This thirst and hunger is making me worry. I want to get back to my normal self. I does have things to do, you know? So, yes, please, do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88, your pulse is 78, your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiratory rate is 16. That blood pressure is a little elevated, but not terribly concerning at the moment. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not a new murmur, as far as I can tell. Your lungs are clear. Next, I'll check your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and not tender. Finally, I'm going to check your feet for any signs of neuropathy. Okay, sensation is intact in both feet. Your pulses are also strong in your feet. Overall, the physical exam doesn’t reveal anything immediately alarming, but the elevated blood pressure and slight heart murmur warrant further investigation. Based on your symptoms and family history, I'm concerned about the possibility of diabetes. To confirm this, I'd like to order some blood tests, including a fasting blood glucose level and a hemoglobin A1c. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear. My mother… yes. If you think it’s best, Doctor, then yes, please do the tests. I don’t want to have that sickness, but I want to know for sure. I want to take care of myself, you know? I don’t want it to get worse. So, yes, please do the blood tests. Is okay. Just tell me what I need to do. Do I need to fast? For how long? And when will I get the results? I does have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca, don’t worry too much right now. We’re just gathering information. A lot of things can cause increased thirst and hunger, and we need to rule things out. Yes, for the fasting blood glucose test, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks – just water is okay. We'll schedule the blood draw for first thing in the morning, so you’ll fast overnight. The hemoglobin A1c doesn't require fasting. The lab usually gets the results back within 2-3 business days. I'll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of water, but try to avoid sugary drinks like juice and soda. We'll discuss a plan based on the blood test results. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I understand. Fast for eight hours, no food or sugary drinks, just water. And the nurse will call me in two or three days with the results. Is okay. Is just… it’s a lot to take in. My mother, she was sick for so long. But I trust you, Doctor. You seem to know what you’re doing. I will do what you tell me. Thank you for listening to me. And thank you for taking care of me. Is a relief to finally have someone look at this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bianca. I understand it's a lot to process, and I'm glad I could listen and offer some guidance. We'll take things one step at a time. I'm going to write you a lab order for the blood tests and also a note for your primary care physician. My nurse, Maria, will come in shortly to schedule the blood draw and answer any questions you might have about the process. She’ll also give you a copy of the lab order. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You explain everything very clearly. I will wait for the nurse, Maria, to come and schedule the tests. And I will call if anything change. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease, just knowing what’s going on. Is good to have someone to talk to. I appreciate your kindness. I will see you when the results come back.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bianca. I'm glad I could help. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
