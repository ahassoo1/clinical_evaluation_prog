DOCTOR: Right. Nadene Sadhu, 89 years old. Well, let's get this over with. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It's this cough, you see. It just won't stop. It’s been going on for…well, a good few weeks now, I’d say. And my heart…it feels a little funny with it. Not bad bad, just…tired, maybe? I get winded easily now, even walking to the kitchen.
DOCTOR: A cough for a few weeks, and…heart palpitations?
PATIENT: Not exactly palpitations, no. More like…a heaviness. Like someone’s sitting on my chest, sometimes. And it comes on when I cough a lot. It's hard to explain. I used to be able to walk all over town, but now… not so much. My son, Miguel, he worries about me. He's the one who made the appointment, actually. He said I needed to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Right. And how would you describe this cough?
PATIENT: Oh, it's a wet cough, mostly. Lots of…phlegm, you know? Sometimes it’s clear, sometimes it’s a little yellowish. Not green, thankfully, never green. And it’s worse at night. Keeps me up, it does. I have to sit up to breathe sometimes. I've been trying to drink lots of water, like my mother always told me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Water is…fine. Any fever, chills, or night sweats accompanying this cough?
PATIENT: No, no fever that I've noticed. I check myself with a thermometer every now and then, just to be sure, but it's always normal. No chills, either. And no…night sweats. I sleep pretty warm, always have, but it's not sweaty warm, if you know what I mean. Just…comfortable. My blankets are nice and soft.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any history of…smoking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, God rest his soul, he smoked a little when we were young, but I always made him go outside. Horrible habit, I always thought. I always said fresh air was better for you. I've always been a healthy eater too, mostly beans and rice and vegetables from my garden. Though, getting older…it's harder to keep up with the garden.
DOCTOR: No smoking. Good. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had a little trouble with penicillin when I was a girl, it gave me a rash. But other than that… I don’t think so. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years, for aches and pains, little colds… never had a bad reaction, not that I recall. My doctor back home – Dr. Ramirez, lovely man – he always checked carefully before giving me anything new.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's listen to your lungs and heart. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again.
PATIENT: Okay, dear. There. Is that alright? A bit wheezy, I suppose. Like a rusty gate. Old age, you know. It does things to you.
DOCTOR: Yes, some wheezing bilaterally, and diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes. Heart sounds… slightly muffled, but regular rhythm. Now, I'm going to check your oxygen saturation. Ninety-two percent. Not ideal.
PATIENT: Ninety-two? Oh dear. Is that bad? My son, Miguel, he's always going on about oxygen. What does that mean, "diminished?" Are my lungs…smaller? I feel a little scared now, doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal. It means your lungs aren't moving air as efficiently as they should. We'll need to get a chest X-ray to see what's going on. It could be a number of things, likely just age-related changes, but we need to rule out pneumonia or something more serious. I’ll order that now. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, Dr. Ramirez, my old doctor, he said my heart was…enlarged, years ago. Congestive heart failure, he called it. He put me on a water pill and told me to watch my salt. I’ve been taking the pill every day, religiously. And I try to watch the salt, but sometimes Miguel makes a nice soup… and it’s hard to say no. I don't have diabetes, no. My blood sugar's always been fine. That water pill… is that why my heart feels heavy sometimes?
DOCTOR: Congestive heart failure… alright. And you said you’re currently taking a water pill?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. Furosemide, I think it’s called. The little white one. I take it every morning, with my breakfast. Miguel helps me keep track, because sometimes my memory… it slips, you know? But I'm pretty good about it, most days. It helps with the swelling in my ankles, mostly. They get puffy if I don't take it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, given your history of congestive heart failure and your current symptoms… and the wheezing, I suspect we're dealing with a flare-up. We'll need to monitor your oxygen levels closely. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and that chest X-ray. I'll also prescribe a short course of antibiotics, just in case there's an underlying infection. Do you know who picks up your medications for you?
PATIENT: Oh, antibiotics are good. Always good to fight those little bugs. Miguel picks up my medications. He’s a good boy, always looking after me. He works at the market, down on Elm Street. He’ll know what to do. Is the X-ray…painful? I don't like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not painful. It’s just a picture. Right, I'll have the radiology department call you to schedule the X-ray. In the meantime, try to rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid strenuous activity. If your breathing gets significantly worse, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, well, that’s good to know it doesn’t hurt. I suppose I was just worried. Should I stop the water pill while we’re waiting for the X-ray? I don’t want to make things worse. And…will I be able to eat soup again? Miguel makes a very good soup.
DOCTOR: No, do not stop the water pill. It's crucial for your condition. And regarding the soup… reduce your salt intake for now. We'll reassess after we get the X-ray results. I think that’s all for today. The nurse will be in to discuss the lab orders and schedule your X-ray. I expect to see you back here next week to review the results. .
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Reduce the salt… I can do that. Thank you, doctor. .
