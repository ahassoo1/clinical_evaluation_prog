DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Bakan. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, um… it’s a little embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been… forgetting things. Little things, mostly, but it’s been happening more and more lately and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand. There’s no need to be embarrassed, Ms. Heidenthal. Memory concerns are quite common, and we’re here to investigate and understand what might be going on. Could you elaborate on these “little things” you’ve been forgetting?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… like, I’ll go into a room and forget why I went in there. Or I’ll be talking to someone and completely lose my train of thought mid-sentence. Yesterday, I couldn’t remember where I parked the car at the grocery store for a good ten minutes! It’s not… huge things, like appointments or anything, yet, but it’s enough to make me feel… off. And a little scared, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Ms. Heidenthal. It's good you're being proactive about this. Those examples – forgetting why you entered a room, losing your train of thought, difficulty recalling where you parked – are certainly things we should explore. To get a better understanding, could you tell me approximately when you first started noticing these memory lapses?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. I think… maybe six months ago? It was very gradual, at first. Just little things here and there, and I’d chalk it up to being busy or stressed. But it feels like it’s definitely gotten worse in the last three months, maybe two. It's hard to say for sure. I’m not very good at remembering dates, ironically!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Heidenthal. Estimating is fine. Three months is helpful. And it's common for these things to start gradually. Now, would you describe these lapses as happening constantly throughout the day, or are they more intermittent?
PATIENT: More intermittent, I think. It’s not like I’m forgetting things all the time. Some days are perfectly fine, and other days… like today, I felt a little foggy this morning. It seems to be worse when I’m tired, or stressed, definitely. And… maybe when I’m multitasking? I try to do a lot at once, sometimes. Probably a bad habit.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful information. Stress, fatigue, and multitasking can certainly play a role. Now, to get a broader picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Um… I don’t have a lot of major health problems, thankfully. I had chickenpox as a kid, and broke my arm once, but nothing serious. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that was pretty routine. No big illnesses, no surgeries besides that. I’m generally pretty healthy, I think. I do take a daily vitamin, just a multivitamin. And… oh, I have high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. I take Lisinopril, I think it’s called.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Heidenthal. Lisinopril for high blood pressure, and a daily multivitamin. That’s good to know. And you said the gallbladder removal was about ten years ago – did you experience any complications from that surgery?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no complications. It was pretty straightforward. I was in the hospital for a couple of days, and recovered pretty quickly. No lasting issues from that at all. Just… glad it's over with, you know? It was a bit scary at the time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to hear it went smoothly. Now, regarding your family history – are there any instances of memory loss, dementia, or neurological conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother… she always had a terrible memory, even when she was young. She just couldn’t remember names or dates, things like that. But it was just “her being her,” you know? We didn’t really think much of it. And my grandfather… he had some kind of… confusion, towards the end of his life, but we didn’t really know what it was. They didn’t really talk about those things much back then. So, I don't know if that counts, really. It wasn’t a formal diagnosis or anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Heidenthal. Even “possible” history is helpful. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. I used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I’ve cut back a lot in the last few months. Maybe a glass once a week, if that. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. I don’t really like taking anything like that. I prefer tea, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And how would you describe your typical diet?
PATIENT: Um… I try to eat healthy, but it’s not always easy. I work long hours, so sometimes I grab something quick and easy. I try to have a lot of fruits and vegetables, lean protein… but I definitely have my weaknesses. I have a sweet tooth, and I love pasta. I probably eat too much pasta, if I’m being honest. And I don’t drink enough water, I know that. It’s a work in progress.
DOCTOR: That sounds reasonable, Ms. Heidenthal. It's good to be aware of areas for improvement. Now, before we move on to a brief physical examination, are you currently experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I’ve been a little more tired lately, but I just figured that was from working too much. And… maybe a little bit more irritable than usual? But I think that’s also work-related. I haven't had any headaches, dizziness, vision changes… nothing like that. Just the memory stuff, really. And the fatigue, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and irritability alongside the memory concerns. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’d like to perform a brief neurological examination and check your vital signs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 72. That’s within a reasonable range, considering your medication. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Next, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I'd like to do a brief cognitive test. I'm going to ask you to repeat three words after me, and then I'll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny. Those aren't too hard, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let's move on to some other quick assessments. I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your orientation. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today's date… Hmm. It’s August… the second. August 2nd, 2025. Is that right?
DOCTOR: That is absolutely correct, Ms. Heidenthal. And can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh, that's easy. We're in… uh… I always forget the name of the suburb, but it’s near… Princeton. Yes, near Princeton.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. And finally, can you tell me your full name?
PATIENT: Ebony Heidenthal.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, I'm going to ask you to draw a clock face, showing all twelve numbers and setting the time to ten past eleven. Do you have any concerns with that?
PATIENT: Um… I haven’t drawn anything in years. But okay, I can try. Do you have a piece of paper and a pen?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Take your time. There’s no rush.
PATIENT: There. It’s not very good, but… that’s the best I can do. I haven’t drawn since school.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Heidenthal. That’s perfectly fine. It's not about artistic ability, it’s about assessing cognitive function. Now, do you recall the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… apple… and… table… and… oh dear. I’m blanking. Penny? No… I can’t remember the third word. I’m so sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s not a test of memory, it’s a part of the assessment. Based on the neurological examination and your history, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The memory lapses, combined with the difficulty recalling the words and the clock drawing, suggest some cognitive impairment. However, these symptoms can be caused by a variety of factors, including stress, fatigue, medication side effects, and underlying medical conditions. To rule out other potential causes, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other underlying conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I would also like to recommend an MRI of your brain, to get a clearer picture of your brain structure and rule out any underlying neurological issues. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI? That sounds… serious. What exactly would it show? And what if it does show something? I mean, what if there’s something wrong with my brain? I guess blood tests are okay, but I’m really hesitant about the MRI.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Heidenthal. It's natural to feel anxious about the possibility of something being wrong. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides detailed pictures of your brain. It doesn't involve any radiation, and it's generally very safe. It would help us rule out things like strokes, tumors, or other structural abnormalities that could be causing your symptoms. It’s important to remember that these symptoms could be due to something less serious, like stress or vitamin deficiencies. The tests are simply to help us get a clearer understanding of what’s going on, so we can develop the appropriate treatment plan. If the MRI does show something, we’ll discuss the results thoroughly and explore all of your treatment options. We’ll work together every step of the way, and I’ll answer any questions you have. We're not looking for bad news, we’re looking for answers. Would you like me to explain the MRI procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay. Explaining it would be good, yes. I’m just… worried, I guess. It’s a bit overwhelming. What does it feel like? Is it painful? And how long does it take? And what if I’m claustrophobic? I’ve heard those machines are very small.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ms. Heidenthal, and it's good you're asking them. The MRI machine is a large, tube-shaped scanner. You'll lie on a table that slides into the scanner. It’s important to remain very still during the scan, as any movement can blur the images. The scan itself typically takes about 30-60 minutes, depending on what we’re looking at. During the scan, you’ll hear loud knocking and buzzing noises. We’ll provide you with headphones so you can listen to music to help block out the sound. You mentioned claustrophobia. The scanner is relatively open, but it can feel enclosed for some people. If you're prone to claustrophobia, we can offer you a mild sedative to help you relax during the scan. We also have open MRI machines available, which are wider and less enclosed, although they don’t provide the same level of detail as the traditional machines. We’ll have a technician with you throughout the entire procedure, and you’ll be able to communicate with them at any time. They can stop the scan if you’re feeling uncomfortable. Do you feel that an open MRI might be a better option for you, given your concerns about claustrophobia?
PATIENT: Yes… an open MRI sounds much better. Less enclosed… that would definitely make me feel more comfortable. And the sedative… I think I might need that, just in case. It’s just… the thought of being stuck in a small tube… it makes me really uneasy. Okay. Let’s do the open MRI with the sedative. And the blood tests, of course. Just… please let me know everything as soon as you have the results. I’m really worried about this.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Heidenthal. We will schedule you for an open MRI as soon as possible, and we’ll discuss the sedative options with you. I’ll also order the blood tests right away. Once we have the results, I’ll contact you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, Dr. Bakan. You’ve been very helpful and… reassuring. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I just… hope it’s nothing serious. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Remember, it’s often something relatively minor, and even if it is something more serious, we have many effective treatment options available. My staff will be in touch shortly to schedule your appointments. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, Ms. Heidenthal.
