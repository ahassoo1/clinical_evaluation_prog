DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. It’s my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a little bit now. Honestly, I don’t have time for this, but it just wouldn’t go away.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in to have it checked. "A little bit now," could you be a bit more specific, Ms. Ottaviani?
PATIENT: Specific? Really? I… I don't keep a calendar of when my throat started aching! Maybe… a week? A week and a few days? It’s not important. It just hurts when I swallow. Is that enough detail for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. A week and a few days. And is it a constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant. Not like, stabbing pain, you understand? More like… a raw feeling. Like I’ve been yelling too much. Which I haven’t, mind you. It's just… unpleasant. Look, can we hurry this along? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Ottaviani, I'll do my best to be efficient. "Raw feeling"... alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the throat pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I don't know. I haven't been looking for symptoms. I just know my throat hurts. Maybe… I feel a little tired. But honestly, who isn’t tired these days? It’s probably just… life. I don’t understand why you need to know everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ottaviani. I simply ask to get a clearer picture of what might be going on, to ensure we address everything appropriately. Fatigue can be associated with several conditions. Have you had a fever, cough, or any nasal congestion?
PATIENT: No fever. No cough. A little… stuffy nose, maybe? It's August, Doctor. It's hot. Things are stuffy. Honestly, I don't pay attention to these things. It's just a throat. Can’t you just look at it and give me something for it? I really don't have time for a full investigation.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. I'll do a quick examination of your throat. It will only take a moment. Please open wide and say "ah." Okay… Your throat is a bit red, and your tonsils are slightly swollen. No visible pus or lesions at this time. Any pain when I gently touch the sides of your neck?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes! That hurts. Don’t poke so much. It feels… tender. Is that bad? I knew it was something serious. Honestly, I told you. Just give me something strong. I need to get back to work, you know. This is costing me money.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. The tenderness is noted. Given your symptoms – sore throat for about a week, some swelling and redness, and tenderness to the touch – it's most likely a viral pharyngitis, commonly known as a sore throat. However, to be certain, and to rule out other possibilities like strep throat, I would like to do a quick strep test. It's a simple swab, and the results will be available in a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Another test? Really? Must you? Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But if it turns out to be nothing, I expect a full refund of my time. And don’t poke too hard this time, Doctor. It’s incredibly unpleasant. I have important things to do, you know. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ottaviani. This test will help us ensure we provide the most appropriate care. It's a quick procedure. Please lean your head back and open wide. …Alright, the results are back. It's negative for strep throat. That confirms our initial suspicion of a viral pharyngitis. This means it's likely caused by a virus, and antibiotics won't be effective.
PATIENT: Negative? So, all this poking and prodding was for… nothing? I knew it was just a sore throat! Honestly, Doctor, you’ve wasted my entire morning. What do I do now? Just… tell me what I need to take to make it go away. And quickly, please. I have a business to run, you know. This is unacceptable.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ottaviani. While it was important to rule out a bacterial infection like strep throat, I assure you it wasn't a waste of time. For a viral pharyngitis, the treatment is mainly supportive care. Rest, plenty of fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help manage the symptoms. You can also use throat lozenges or gargle with warm salt water. Here's a care sheet with more detailed instructions. It also lists some warning signs to watch out for. If you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe difficulty swallowing, please seek immediate medical attention. I understand you're busy, and I apologize for the delay. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Salt water? Really? I run a business, Doctor, I don't have time for home remedies. Fine. Whatever. I suppose that’s all I can do. And honestly, I doubt it will help. No. No more questions. I think you’ve wasted enough of my time already. I need to get back to work. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Ottaviani. I wish you a speedy recovery. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if your symptoms worsen. Have a good day.
