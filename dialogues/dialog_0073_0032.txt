DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Hmm… what does bring me in? My wife, bless her heart, insisted. Something about… a bit of a problem, down there. Honestly, I haven’t paid it much mind. Old age, you know. Things…leak. Is that what she meant? She gets quite worked up about these things.
DOCTOR: "Leakage," you say?
PATIENT: Not precisely leakage, Doctor. More… a discharge. A bit unpleasant, if I’m being frank. Though I must say, I'm not entirely sure when it started. Days, perhaps? Weeks? Time does rather slip away, you know. It's not causing me any real trouble, mind you. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Right. And is there any pain associated with this discharge, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain to speak of. A little… sensitivity, perhaps. But nothing a man of my age isn't accustomed to. It’s more… bothersome than painful. It’s undignified, really. A gentleman shouldn’t have to worry about such things. Is this going to require… tests? I do dislike tests.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Krok, we can’t simply ignore a discharge. It could be nothing, but it's my professional responsibility to investigate. Yes, a brief examination and potentially a sample will be necessary to determine the cause. It’s standard procedure, and frankly, rather important. We need to rule out infection. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I'll need you to… disrobe from the waist down. There's a changing room just down the hall. I’ll be right back with the necessary supplies.
PATIENT: Infection, you say? Goodness. My wife always frets about germs. I suppose if you insist, Doctor. Though I must say, I find the whole process rather… intrusive. And I haven’t the stamina for a prolonged examination, if you catch my meaning. Is there no other way? A potion, perhaps? My mother always had a remedy for everything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, with all due respect, we are not practicing folk medicine here. A proper diagnosis requires a physical assessment. A "potion" will not suffice. It’s a relatively quick procedure, and I assure you, I’m very efficient. I'll be as gentle as possible. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we begin?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. I believe I had a slight reaction to some peaches last summer. A bit of a rash, nothing serious. And dust, of course. Who isn’t allergic to dust these days? But beyond that, no. Are you certain this is absolutely necessary, Doctor? My wife will be quite cross if I'm uncomfortable. She insists I rest in the afternoons, you know.
DOCTOR: A mild rash from peaches is good to know, thank you. And while I understand your concerns about discomfort, Mr. Krok, ruling out infection is paramount. We need to know what we're dealing with before we can decide on a course of action. It’s a simple examination, a quick swab, and then we’ll have some answers. It’s for your own wellbeing. Now, if you'll just head to the changing room, we can get this over with. I’ll be right behind you. Do you need assistance getting there?
PATIENT: Assistance? Heavens, no. I may be getting on in years, but I’m not incapable. Though I must say, this whole affair is rather… undignified. I do hope it doesn't take too long. My wife has prepared a lovely lemon pudding for dessert. It would be a shame to miss it. Lead the way, Doctor. The sooner this is over, the better.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Krok. Right this way. And please, try to relax. It will be much easier for both of us. .
