DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um… I have been coughing up some blood. It… it scared me a little, so I thought it was best to come get it checked. It's not… a lot of blood, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Coughing up blood, you say. Alright. And how long has this been happening, Ms. Weichers?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… a week ago? At first, it was just a little streak, and I thought maybe I scratched my throat. But it's happened a few times since then, and it's… more noticeable now. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. A week, increasing amounts… and it’s not associated with any injury, correct?
PATIENT: No, that is right. No injury. I haven’t hit myself or anything. Just… when I cough. Sometimes it happens with a lot of coughing, sometimes just a little. It's very strange. I've been trying to pay attention to when it happens, but it doesn't seem to be anything specific.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the coughing?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I have been a little tired, more than usual. But I thought that was just… life. And maybe a little short of breath when I climb the stairs, but I haven't been doing much exercise lately, so… I didn’t think much of it. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Fatigue and shortness of breath…yes, those could be relevant. Have you had a fever, chills, night sweats, or any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. I haven’t noticed any night sweats. And… I think I might have lost a little weight, but I haven't been weighing myself regularly. It’s possible. I’ve just… not been very hungry lately. Everything feels… a little off, I suppose. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Right. "Feeling off." We’ll try to get to the bottom of it. Now, let's go through some of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… my husband… he passed away last year. And I've been generally healthy. I don’t have any big problems, like diabetes or heart trouble. I used to have some back pain, so I saw a physical therapist for a while, but that’s all. I am a physical therapist myself, you know. Perhaps that is why I notice things easily.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Weichers. And being a physical therapist yourself gives you a good awareness of your body, certainly. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven't had any surgeries. Never needed them. Just the usual childhood things, like vaccinations, but nothing… serious. I try to stay healthy, you know? I believe in taking care of myself. I tell my patients that all the time!
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, and my father… he had some kind of lung problem when he was older, but I don’t remember exactly what. He smoked for a long time, I think. And… I don’t really know much beyond that, to be honest. We weren’t very close.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Weichers?
PATIENT: No, I don't take any regular medications. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache, like ibuprofen. But that’s it. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can. I believe in letting my body heal itself, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, I don't have any food allergies, and I haven't been stung by anything. I think I am pretty lucky, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Weichers. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate, and take your temperature. And I’d also like to get a chest X-ray just to rule out anything serious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. An X-ray is a good idea. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I want to know what is happening. It’s just… worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just sit up straight, I'll start by listening to your lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly.
PATIENT: Okay. Is everything alright? It feels a little cold.
DOCTOR: Just assessing your breathing, Ms. Weichers. I'm hearing some… diminished breath sounds on the lower left side. And a few scattered crackles. It's not immediately alarming, but it does warrant further investigation. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart.
PATIENT: Diminished… crackles? What does that mean? Is it… bad? I hope it’s not my heart. My father always had heart problems…
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is normal, and I don’t hear any murmurs or irregularities. "Diminished breath sounds" simply means that the sound of air entering and leaving that part of your lung is quieter than it should be. "Crackles" are small popping sounds, which can indicate fluid in the lungs, but they can also be caused by other things. It’s important not to jump to conclusions, Ms. Weichers. That's why we're getting the X-ray. I’m going to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter now.
PATIENT: Okay. That… that makes me feel a little better. Fluid… That sounds scary. Thank you for explaining. What number are you looking for? Is mine okay?
DOCTOR: Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low. Ideally, we want it above 95%. This, along with the diminished breath sounds and crackles, makes me want to be a bit more thorough. I'm also going to check your temperature and blood pressure. Temperature is normal, blood pressure is slightly elevated, 130/85. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your chest and back to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright… 92%… that doesn't sound very good. My blood pressure is high too? I haven't been very stressed lately… well, except for this coughing, of course. Palpate… yes, that’s fine. Please, be gentle. It feels a little sore when I cough.
DOCTOR: Alright. There is some tenderness on the lower left side of your chest when I press, which corresponds with the diminished breath sounds I heard. I don’t feel any masses. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart again, a bit more carefully. No new murmurs or irregularities. Ms. Weichers, based on what I'm hearing, and given your history of coughing up blood, I think it’s important to rule out a few possibilities, including pneumonia, bronchitis, or even something more serious like a pulmonary embolism. We need that chest X-ray as soon as possible. I’m also going to order a complete blood count and a D-dimer test to check for signs of infection and blood clots. Would you be able to go to the radiology department right away?
PATIENT: Pneumonia… bronchitis… pulmonary embolism? Those all sound… frightening. A blood clot? I… I don’t understand. A complete blood count and… a D-dimer test? What will those tests show? Is it… is it serious, Doctor? Yes, I can go to radiology right away. I just… I just want to know what is happening. I feel very scared.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Ms. Weichers. It's good that we're being thorough. The complete blood count will check for signs of infection, like an elevated white blood cell count. The D-dimer test will help us rule out a pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot in the lungs. It's important to rule that out quickly because it can be very serious. I'm not going to jump to any conclusions yet, but we need to gather more information. I’ll write you a referral for the X-ray and the blood tests. The radiology department will be able to take the X-ray right away. Once the results are back, we’ll discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild cough suppressant to help alleviate your symptoms. It won’t address the underlying cause, but it may make you more comfortable. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies… I told you, I don’t take anything regularly. A cough suppressant… okay. How long will the tests take? And… when will I know the results? I have a friend… she could come with me to the radiology department, if that is alright. I just… I don’t feel very well, and I’m a little scared to go alone.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Weichers. The radiology department should be able to perform the X-ray and draw blood relatively quickly. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes for the initial results to come back, but it can take longer for the full blood count results. I'll call the radiology department to let them know to expect you and to expedite the results as much as possible. And absolutely, you should bring your friend with you. Having support is a very good idea, especially when you’re feeling anxious. I will also have my nurse give you a list of instructions and contact information for the radiology department. Once you have the X-ray results, please call my office immediately, regardless of the time. We will review them together and discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Thirty to forty-five minutes… okay. And call immediately… I will. Yes… one question. Is there anything… anything I should be worried about specifically? If it is serious… what are the treatments? I just… I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you want to be prepared, Ms. Weichers. Let’s focus on getting the results first. If it’s pneumonia, treatment usually involves antibiotics and rest. If it's bronchitis, it's often managed with supportive care, such as rest, fluids, and potentially a bronchodilator to open up your airways. If, and this is a very small possibility, it is a pulmonary embolism, treatment would involve blood thinners, and potentially other interventions to stabilize your condition. However, I want to emphasize again that we don’t know anything for sure yet. It’s important not to jump to conclusions. We are doing everything we can to get you a diagnosis and the appropriate treatment. For now, focus on getting the tests done, and bring your friend with you for support. We will discuss the results as soon as they are available. Do you feel ready to head to radiology?
PATIENT: Okay… antibiotics, supportive care, blood thinners… I understand. Not to jump to conclusions… Yes, I think I’m ready. I’ll call my friend and head to radiology. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I will call you as soon as I have the results. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Weichers. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember to bring your friend. I'll be thinking of you, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. Take care.
