DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it’s about this… discoloration. My skin. It’s darkening, you see. And frankly, I’m tired. Very tired. I haven’t the time for ailments, Doctor. Let’s be quick about this, shall we?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. I understand you’d like to be efficient, and I’ll do my best to respect your time. When you say “darkening,” could you tell me where on your skin you’ve noticed this discoloration?
PATIENT: Everywhere, really. Arms, face… perhaps not everywhere, but… the usual places, I suppose. It’s difficult to say precisely. I don't spend much time examining myself, Doctor. I have work to do. Reinforcing iron doesn't allow for vanity. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: I understand. “Everywhere” is a good starting point. And thank you for clarifying about your work; that gives me some context. When did you first notice this darkening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. Weeks, perhaps? Months? Time… it all blurs together. It wasn't sudden, I can assure you. Just… a gradual shift. I really don't keep track of these things. Is it necessary to pinpoint a date?
DOCTOR: It's helpful if we can, but not essential at this stage. “Gradual” is useful information. Has anything changed recently that you can think of – new soaps, lotions, exposure to the sun, or perhaps even a change in your diet?
PATIENT: New soaps? Doctor, I use the same soap my father used. And his father before him. A perfectly sensible, utilitarian bar of soap. As for lotions… preposterous. I work with iron, not silk. And sun? I work in buildings, mostly. Though… yes, there was that job last month, the new high-rise downtown. Plenty of sun then. But surely that wouldn't be… consequential? I eat, of course. What does that matter?
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information. The new job with sun exposure is potentially relevant, and we'll certainly consider that. It's good you mentioned that. Now, aside from the skin discoloration and the tiredness you mentioned, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. Just… fatigue. A general feeling of… being worn down. I’m eighty-five years old, Doctor. A little tiredness is to be expected. I don’t have time for a catalogue of ailments. Is this truly necessary? Are you going to prescribe some… tonic? I assure you, I am quite capable of completing my work despite feeling… less than optimal.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota, and I appreciate you sharing that. It's important to rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue, even at 85. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe the tiredness?
PATIENT: Describe it? It’s… tiring! I require more sleep. I accomplish less each day. Simple tasks require… effort. It’s a… depletion of energy, Doctor. Do you require a detailed physiological breakdown? I assure you, my body functions as adequately as can be expected for a man of my age and profession. It’s called getting older, Doctor. It’s not a novel condition.
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out, Mr. Drahota. It is important to consider normal age-related changes. However, we still need to rule out any treatable causes. Now, has this fatigue been interfering with your ability to perform your work, or has it been a gradual decline that you've simply adjusted to?
PATIENT: Interfering… Well, yes, a bit. I’m not as… quick as I once was. It takes longer to complete a task. The others have had to… assist on occasion. I don’t like admitting that. It's… humiliating. But I’ve compensated. I’ve adjusted my schedule, delegated some responsibilities. I'm a foreman, Doctor, I'm used to managing things. But it’s… concerning. I don't want to become a burden. Now, are we getting somewhere, or shall I simply request a referral to a specialist? Perhaps a… strengthening tonic?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Drahota, and I appreciate your honesty. It's good you've been able to adjust, but it's still important to investigate the cause of the fatigue. Before we consider a referral, I'd like to ask a few more questions and perform a brief physical exam, if you're agreeable. This will help me determine the best course of action. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Honestly, Doctor. At my age? Very well. But please be swift. I have a schedule to maintain, you see. And I trust you’ve washed your hands? I have no patience for… germs. Proceed. But quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. I always wash my hands before and after examining patients. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. I’ll also feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. If you could please lie back on the examination table, that would be helpful. Your heart sounds regular, but a little distant. Lungs are clear, though breathing is somewhat shallow. Blood pressure is 105/65. A little on the lower side. I notice the discoloration you mentioned. It appears to be a generalized hyperpigmentation, more pronounced on areas exposed to the sun. Skin feels somewhat dry. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpable. Reflexes are diminished, but symmetrical. Alright, Mr. Drahota. Thank you for allowing me to conduct that examination. Based on what you’ve told me and my findings, I’d like to order some blood work. This will help rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue and skin discoloration. Are you agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Blood work? More tests? Doctor, I assure you, I am not made of time, nor do I possess an endless supply of patience. What exactly are you looking for? And will this… interfere with my schedule? I have commitments, you see. Very important commitments. Frankly, I’m beginning to regret this entire endeavor. Perhaps I should simply accept the tiredness and… persevere. It's what my father would have done. But… if it's quick, and doesn't involve a lengthy recovery period… then, yes, proceed with your… blood work. But I expect results promptly. Very promptly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Drahota. I assure you, the blood work is relatively quick and shouldn’t significantly interfere with your schedule. It will take only a few minutes to draw the samples. We'll be looking for things like your complete blood count to check for anemia, your kidney and liver function, thyroid levels, and vitamin deficiencies – specifically vitamin B12 and D. These are all things that can cause fatigue and skin changes. The lab is just down the hall, and the results should be back within 2-3 business days. We can discuss them during a follow-up appointment. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Two to three business days… Very well. As long as it doesn’t exceed that timeframe. And I expect a clear, concise explanation of the results. No medical jargon, Doctor. I am a foreman, not a physician. Lead me to this… lab. But I trust they are efficient? I haven’t time for delays. Honestly, this is… quite disruptive. But proceed. Let’s get this over with. And please, ensure they use a clean needle. I have a… sensitivity.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. I will personally ensure they use a clean needle. And I will do my best to explain the results in a clear and concise manner, avoiding any unnecessary medical jargon. The lab is just this way. "Good morning, Susan. We have Mr. Drahota here for some routine blood work. He's a bit pressed for time, so if you could be as efficient as possible, I would appreciate it." Susan is a very skilled technician. She’ll guide you through the process. It will only take a few minutes. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll be right outside.
PATIENT: Honestly… the indignity of it all. Fine. Let's get this over with. But be quick about it. I haven’t all day. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota, all done. Thank you for your patience. Susan said everything went smoothly. Just apply a little pressure to the site for a few minutes to prevent any bruising. We will contact you within 2-3 business days to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms – such as excessive bleeding, fever, or severe pain at the blood draw site – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
