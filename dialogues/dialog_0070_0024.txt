DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. A confirmation that I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but I’m travelling internationally next month and the airline needs it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sayar. A fit-to-fly letter. I can certainly help with that. To properly assess your eligibility and create the letter, I’ll need to gather some information from you. I see here your age is 33 and your race is Mongolian, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Thirty-three, and Mongolian. Is that all you need from the record, or…? I'm trying to be quick if that's alright. I have a flight to catch eventually, even just to book it.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand wanting to be efficient. The record gives me a good starting point, but I need to understand your current health status. Just to confirm, you are currently feeling well with no recent illnesses or injuries?
PATIENT: Yes, perfectly well. No illnesses, no injuries. Honestly, I've been… very careful since… well, never mind. Just… healthy. No problems at all. I feel good. Really good. Can we just get to the letter, if possible? I have all my travel details here if you need them.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you clarifying that, Ms. Sayar. While you state you are feeling well, to provide a responsible and accurate fit-to-fly letter, I do need to ask a few more questions to rule out any underlying conditions that might be affected by air travel. It’s standard procedure, and it helps ensure your safety. It won't take long, I assure you. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like heart problems, lung disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Okay, I understand. Standard procedure. Fine. Let me see… No heart problems. No lung disease. No diabetes. And no, thankfully, no high blood pressure. I… I lost my husband a few years ago, and he had a lot of health issues, so I'm very aware of those sorts of things. I keep on top of everything. Really. Just… I’d rather not dwell on it. Is that alright? I’m just… a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Sayar. I understand completely, and I apologize if my questions are bringing up difficult memories. We can move as quickly or slowly as you’re comfortable with. Alright. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never been hospitalized. Not even for the flu, honestly. I’m… I’m a very healthy person. I keep myself fit, I eat well… I try to. Look, is there a form I can fill out? Maybe that would be faster? I have all the information, I just… I don't enjoy talking about health, if that makes sense. It’s just… a personal thing. It brings up… things.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly reasonable, Ms. Sayar. I apologize for pushing when you've expressed discomfort. Yes, we do have a medical questionnaire that covers much of the same information. It might be a more comfortable way for you to proceed. Please take your time, and feel free to skip any questions you’d rather not answer. We can discuss anything that comes up afterward, or I can simply review the form when you’re finished. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be wonderful. Thank you. Seriously, thank you. This is… much better. I’ll just fill this out now.
DOCTOR: Please take all the time you need, Ms. Sayar. I’m here when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Okay, I think that’s everything. It asked a lot of questions. I've answered everything truthfully, as far as I know. Please let me know if you need anything else.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sayar. This is very helpful. I see you've indicated no significant medical history, no allergies, and you are not currently taking any medications. You've also stated you do not smoke and drink alcohol only socially. Just to clarify, you mentioned the loss of your husband. Was his health condition hereditary, or is there any family history of heart disease, lung problems, or blood clots that you are aware of?
PATIENT: No, it wasn’t hereditary. He… he had a very sudden illness. A virus, I think. It just… took him very quickly. And no, there's no family history of anything like that. My family is… very healthy. Always has been. Both sides. It’s why… it was such a shock. Look, can we please just get to the letter? I’m really starting to worry about missing the booking window for my flight. I just need to confirm I’m able to fly. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand your urgency, Ms. Sayar, and I sincerely apologize for causing you any further stress. You are right to prioritize your travel plans, and I want to assure you I will do everything I can to help. Given your reported medical history—or rather, the lack of significant medical history—and the fact that you are currently feeling well with no acute symptoms, I am comfortable providing you with a fit-to-fly letter. However, as a standard precaution, I would like to quickly perform a brief physical exam – just to listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do it. Quickly, though. Please. Just… quickly. I really need to get this sorted. It's just… I hate hospitals, and doctors, and… everything. But if you say it's necessary… just make it quick.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Sayar. This will be very quick, I promise. Just a few simple checks. Please have a seat and relax. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Everything sounds good, Ms. Sayar. Your heart and lungs are healthy, and your blood pressure is normal. Based on this quick examination and the information you’ve provided, I am happy to confirm that you are fit to fly.
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you. Is there anything else I need to do? Any forms to sign? Any… fees? I just want to get this letter and get out of here.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Ms. Sayar. Please review it to ensure all the information is correct. You’ll need to sign at the bottom to acknowledge its accuracy. Regarding fees, the cost of this visit, including the letter, is \$75. It can be paid at the reception desk on your way out. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfect. Thank you. No, that's all. Thank you so much, Doctor Abady. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate your time. And your patience.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I was happy to help. I understand it can be stressful dealing with travel requirements. I wish you safe travels, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. And Ms. Sayar, if you ever feel overwhelmed with grief or anxiety, there are resources available to help. I can provide you with some information if you'd like. But for now, have a wonderful trip.
PATIENT: .
