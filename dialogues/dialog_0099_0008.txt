DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Guerrerolopez, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Though… everyone usually just calls me Leo. Look, are we going to get right to it? I have a… a thing later. It’s my ears, right? They feel blocked.
DOCTOR: “Blocked,” you say. Alright, Leo. I prefer to maintain a level of professionalism, if you don’t mind. Twenty years in family medicine teaches you that “blocked” can mean a multitude of things, most of which aren’t simply… blockage. Let’s start with the basics. How long have your ears been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I… I don't really remember. A while. A couple of weeks, maybe? Longer? It comes and goes, you see. It’s just… annoying. It feels like there’s cotton in them, or something. Is that… helpful? I really don't keep track of these things. My wife… she used to handle all that.
DOCTOR: "Annoying" is rarely a medical diagnosis, Leo. It's good you're finally addressing it, though. “Comes and goes,” you say. Does anything trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed. I work outside a lot, you see. Agricultural inspections. Lots of… fields. Maybe the wind? Or pollen? I don’t know. Honestly, I haven’t really paid attention. It’s just… a feeling. Like pressure, sometimes. Is that… what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Pollen is a likely culprit, given your profession. Alright. Any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. It’s more… uncomfortable. Like needing to pop your ears, but they won’t. And it makes it hard to hear sometimes. Especially… quieter sounds. Like people mumbling. Or the television. It's not sharp pain, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any discharge?
PATIENT: Discharge? You mean… like, something coming out of my ears? No! No, definitely not. I would have noticed that, wouldn’t I? No discharge. Absolutely not.
DOCTOR: Right. Of course. Let’s move on. Do you have any history of ear infections?
PATIENT: Ear infections… hmm. When I was a little boy, maybe? I think so. My mother always said I was prone to them. But… honestly, it was a long time ago. I don’t really remember the details. I don’t think I’ve had one as an adult. Not that I recall, anyway. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It’s relevant, Leo. Alright. Any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Sometimes. A faint… buzzing, maybe? It’s not constant, you see. It comes and goes, like everything else. And it’s not very loud. I mostly notice it when it's very quiet. Like… at night. Or in a soundproof room, if such a thing exists. Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: Leo, with all due respect, your lack of detail is… less than helpful. Ringing in the ears, or tinnitus, can be indicative of a number of issues. Alright, let's get a quick look. Open wide.
PATIENT: Look in my ears? Oh. Right. I… I don’t like things going in my ears. Is it really necessary? I just thought… maybe some ear drops or something? I have a… a meeting soon, you see. And I really don’t have a lot of time. .
DOCTOR: Leo, I assure you, a quick examination is significantly faster than attempting to diagnose you based on vague descriptions. It’s a standard procedure. And frankly, dismissing the possibility of a more serious underlying issue because of a “meeting” is… unwise. Open your mouth.
