DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I’m Dr. Piet. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this pain. Down low, in my belly. It’s been coming and going, but lately it’s been rather… severe. I do apologize, I sometimes have trouble recalling exactly when things started. It feels like it’s been a few weeks, perhaps? I believe I mentioned it was related to… something I have. A condition.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of abdominal pain. Can you tell me a bit more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Certainly. Hmm… It’s not a constant ache, you understand. It comes in waves, almost. Like…cramps, but deeper. And sharper, at times. It feels… internal. It doesn't radiate, as far as I can tell. It just is, there, in my lower abdomen. And it makes me feel quite… unwell. A bit nauseous, though I haven’t actually been sick. It’s difficult to describe precisely.
DOCTOR: Alright, waves of sharper, internal pain in your lower abdomen, with some nausea but no vomiting. And you said it's related to a condition you have?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s… SLE, I believe. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. That's what the other doctor told me, years ago. Though… honestly, it’s been a while since I’ve focused on it much. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was. Is that… relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, SLE is very relevant. Thank you for telling me. It's not uncommon for lupus to cause abdominal symptoms. Let me pull up your records… Okay, I see your diagnosis of SLE from Dr. Ramirez, dating back eight years. Have you been seeing anyone regularly for your lupus since then?
PATIENT: Eight years… yes, that sounds about right. Dr. Ramirez was… very thorough. After him… not so much. Honestly, I’ve mostly managed on my own. Tried to, anyway. Just… watching for things to get too bad. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly for it, no. Just when something felt… alarming. Like this pain.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from this pain, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… My energy levels have been lower, certainly. More tired than usual. And I've noticed some… swelling, I suppose. In my ankles, mostly. It comes and goes. Oh, and I’ve been a bit more… forgetful, if that’s not too surprising. But then, I’ve always been a little prone to that. Is that helpful, Doctor? I do apologize for being so… rambling.
DOCTOR: No, it’s helpful, Ms. Glymph. Don't apologize. Lower energy, ankle swelling, and increased forgetfulness. Have you noticed any fever, rash, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I’ve been aware of. I haven't taken my temperature. Rash… no, not recently. Though I do get… a bit of a flush sometimes, when I’m warm. Is that the same thing? Bowel habits… well, they’ve been a bit… unsettled, perhaps. Not diarrhea, exactly, but… not regular. More… frequent trips to the restroom. And a little discomfort, alongside the pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional flushing, unsettled bowel habits with increased frequency and discomfort alongside the pain. Ms. Glymph, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. It will be fairly brief.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, do whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment. I apologize again for not being more… precise with my descriptions. It’s difficult to articulate these things, and my memory… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m listening to your abdomen now… and feeling around. There is some tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on your left side. Not severe, but definitely present. I also hear normal bowel sounds. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, there is a bit of discomfort when you press there. Not sharp, exactly, but… a dull ache. It’s… unpleasant. It radiates slightly towards my back, I think. Just a little. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache with some tenderness in your lower abdomen, radiating slightly to your back. Given your history of SLE and these findings, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of your pain without further investigation. Several possibilities come to mind, including a lupus flare, diverticulitis, or even something like a urinary tract infection. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work—a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an inflammatory marker called a CRP. And a urine analysis. I would also like a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to rule out anything more serious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to investigate. Blood work, urine analysis, and a CT scan… yes, please. Whatever you think is necessary to determine the cause of this discomfort. I trust your judgment implicitly. And… if it’s not too much trouble, could you perhaps explain what each of those tests looks for? My understanding of these things is… limited.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The complete blood count will check for signs of infection or anemia, which can sometimes occur with lupus. The metabolic panel assesses your kidney and liver function—important organs that can be affected by lupus. The CRP is a marker of inflammation in the body. The urine analysis will check for a urinary tract infection, as well as assess your kidney function. And the CT scan will give us a detailed look at your abdomen and pelvis to identify any abnormalities—like inflammation of the intestines, or problems with your organs. It sounds like a lot, but it’s the best way to figure out what’s going on. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that does make sense. Checking for infection, kidney and liver function, inflammation… and a detailed look with the CT scan. It all sounds very… sensible. I suppose it’s better to be thorough than to leave things to chance. I do apologize for being such a… complicated case. It’s just… the lupus, and the memory problems… it makes things rather difficult.
DOCTOR: You're not a complicated case, Ms. Glymph. You’re a patient with a chronic condition, and it's perfectly normal to have questions and concerns. We'll work through this together. Here are the requisitions for your blood work and the CT scan order. You can schedule the CT scan at the radiology department—the number is on the form. The lab is just down the hall. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and contact you to discuss them—usually within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, if you experience a high fever, severe abdominal pain, or any changes in your bowel habits, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. I will schedule the CT scan as soon as possible, and head to the lab. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours… I’ll keep an eye out for your call. High fever, severe pain, changes in bowel habits… yes, I will be vigilant. No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for your time and your thoroughness. And for your… patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. Get those tests done, and don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. .
