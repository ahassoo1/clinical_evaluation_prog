DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, my wife, she said I should come get some… papers. Something about needing them for… work? It’s a bit fuzzy, honestly. I’m Ronnald, by the way. Limtiaco. She handles most of that stuff, you see. Something about me needing time off… or something? I do… religious work, mostly. And teaching. It's all a bit of a blur these days, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Limtiaco. Well, we can certainly sort this out. It sounds like you may need some documentation for work related to your religious work and teaching. Just to clarify, are you experiencing any new symptoms or changes in how you’re feeling—anything at all—that prompted your wife to suggest this visit?
PATIENT: New symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Well, I’ve been… more tired than usual, I suppose. And… forgetting things. Like names, mostly. And where I put my glasses. Which is funny, considering I have them on. My wife says I ask the same questions a lot. But that’s just… old age, isn’t it? I don't feel sick, if that makes sense. Just… slow, sometimes. And a little… lost.
DOCTOR: Okay, “slow” and “lost” are helpful descriptions, Mr. Limtiaco. And it is good that you're not experiencing any other symptoms, such as fever, headache, or weakness. When did you first start noticing this increased fatigue and these memory problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It's been… gradual, you see? A little at a time. Maybe… six months ago? Or was it eight? It’s hard to say. It didn’t just happen one day. It's just… been getting worse, slowly. My wife noticed it first, I think. She’s very observant. I just… brushed it off. Thought it was the heat, maybe. Or stress. We’ve been busy with things at the church.
DOCTOR: Right. And you mentioned being busy with things at the church. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I’m Directors, Religious Activities and Education, you see. I help organize the services, and teach Sunday school, mostly. We have a lot of young people in the congregation, which is wonderful. And I do a lot of outreach work, visiting people in the community. It’s… fulfilling work, but it’s a lot. There's a lot of responsibility. We're planning a big event next month, a fundraiser… That's probably what's stressing me out. Trying to get everything organized. So many details...
DOCTOR: Alright. That does sound like a lot of responsibility. Now, aside from the stress of the fundraiser, have you experienced any significant life changes recently?
PATIENT: Significant life changes… Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Everything’s been pretty stable, thankfully. My wife and I have been married for a long time, and the kids are all grown up and doing well. We've had a few health scares with my wife over the years, but nothing major recently. We've been… lucky, I suppose. Oh! Wait. My brother… he moved to the mainland last year. That was a bit sad. We were close. But that wasn't… recent, was it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s talk about your health a bit. Do you have any past medical problems – anything that you’ve been treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had… the usual things, I suppose. High blood pressure, a few years back. The doctor put me on some pills for that. And I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was a scary time! But… other than that… not much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, thankfully. I try to eat well, mostly fish and fruit. And I walk when I can. My wife keeps me active, you see. She's a good woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me what medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a good question. I honestly can’t remember the name of it. It’s a small white pill, I think? Maybe two small white pills? I take them every morning with my breakfast. My wife refills the prescription, you see. She handles all of that. I just… take them. I'm sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. No worries at all. Let me just take a quick look at your records here… Ah, here we are. It says you're currently taking Lisinopril 20mg daily. Do you recognize that name?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… Lisinopril… Yes! That sounds right. That’s it! Lisinopril. Thank you, Doctor. My memory… it's just not what it used to be, you see. I appreciate you looking that up for me. She worries about me forgetting my medication.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Well, just to get a better understanding of things, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your blood pressure, heart and lungs, and a neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I haven’t had a full check-up in… well, I can’t remember how long, to be honest. It's probably a good idea. Do I need to… undress?
DOCTOR: No, no need to undress just yet, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope, and do a few simple tests to check your reflexes and balance. Alright, take a deep breath for me… and let it out slowly. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Lungs sound clear. Reflexes are slightly diminished. Balance is a bit unsteady. Okay, everything seems… within normal limits, though your blood pressure is a little high and your balance is a bit off. We'll need to investigate that further.
PATIENT: Okay. A bit off… that doesn’t sound good, does it? I have been feeling a little… wobbly sometimes, like I might fall. Especially when I stand up quickly. I just thought it was my age, you see. Old age and a bit of dizziness.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It's good you mentioned that. Dizziness and unsteadiness can be caused by a number of things, and we'll need to figure out what's going on. I'd like to order a few tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. I also recommend an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and a CT scan of your head to rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… of my head? Goodness. That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is something wrong? I just came in for some papers for work… Are you saying there might be something… wrong with my brain?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, let’s not jump to conclusions. A CT scan is just a precautionary measure. It helps us to rule out any potential problems, and it's a very safe procedure. The tests I'm ordering are standard for someone experiencing dizziness and memory issues, and it doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong with your brain. We need to investigate the cause of your symptoms, and these tests will help us to do that. It could be something as simple as a Vitamin deficiency or a side effect of medication. But it’s important to rule out anything more serious. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. A Vitamin deficiency… that sounds better than something wrong with my brain. But a CT scan… it still sounds frightening, Doctor. Will it… hurt? And will it take a long time? I have so much to do at the church… My wife is going to be so worried.
DOCTOR: The CT scan is completely painless, Mr. Limtiaco. You’ll simply lie on a table, and the machine will take a series of X-rays. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. We’ll get the results back quickly, and I’ll explain everything to you in detail. As for your wife, we can discuss the results together. It’s important to remember that we’re doing this to get to the bottom of your symptoms, and to ensure you’re healthy and able to continue your work at the church. Alright, let me write down the instructions for the CT scan. You’ll need to avoid eating or drinking anything for a few hours beforehand. And please bring a list of all your medications with you. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: No… not right now, I think. Just… all these tests… it's a bit overwhelming. And the possibility of something… wrong. Maybe if my wife was here… she always knows what to ask. She's very good at that. But… yes. Okay. I’ll try to remember everything you said. And I’ll bring my medication list. But… what about the papers I came in for? The ones for work?
DOCTOR: Right. The papers for work. I completely forgot. It sounds like you may need a note for medical leave. However, considering your symptoms, it would be premature to sign anything until we get the results of these tests. We need to determine the cause of your dizziness and memory issues before making any decisions about your work. I can write you a note stating that you are under my care and undergoing medical evaluation. But it will not specify the nature of your illness. Is that acceptable for now?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that would be acceptable. Just something to show them I’m… seeing a doctor. My wife will be so happy. She worries so much. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. Even though I can’t remember half the things you’ve said.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. We'll take things one step at a time. I’ll have my nurse schedule you for the tests, and we'll go from there. Remember to bring your medication list and avoid eating or drinking anything before the CT scan. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call. And please, encourage your wife to attend your next appointment with you. It will be helpful to have her there. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. You’ve put my mind at… well, not ease, exactly, but… slightly less worried. I appreciate your patience. I really do. And… please, don’t mention all this to my wife just yet. I want to tell her myself. She gets… anxious.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Limtiaco. I will respect your wishes. I'll make a note to keep my conversation confidential. Please, take care of yourself. And don't hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day, and we'll see you soon. .
PATIENT: .
