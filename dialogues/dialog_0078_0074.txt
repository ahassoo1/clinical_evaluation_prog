DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Just…the pressure. Been gettin’ high, the nurse told me. I don’t rightly understand all that fancy talk, but she said I needed to see you about it. Been feelin’ a little tired lately, too. Not much energy for bakin’ like I used to.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Pressure,” as the nurse mentioned, likely refers to your blood pressure. It’s good you’re getting it checked. And it’s very common for energy levels to change as we get older. We'll figure out what's going on. To start, could you tell me a little more about this pressure you’ve been feeling?
PATIENT: Well, it ain’t like a pain, exactly. More like…a heavy feelin’ in my head sometimes. And my hands get kinda shaky when I’m rollin’ out dough. Not always, just when I’m tired, I reckon. I don’t worry much, usually. But the nurse seemed concerned, so here I am. She said somethin’ about numbers…high numbers bein’ bad?
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right to recall that the nurse mentioned numbers. Blood pressure is measured as two numbers – a systolic and a diastolic – and higher numbers can indicate a problem. We want to get a good reading today to see where you're at. And it's good you’re noticing the shakiness in your hands. That can be connected. Before we take your blood pressure, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the heavy feeling and shakiness?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Not really. I get a little short of breath when I’m walkin’ up the hill to the store, but I figure that’s just my age. And sometimes my eyesight gets blurry, but that happens every now and then anyway. I ain’t been havin’ chest pain or nothin’ like that. Just…tired. And this head feelin’. I eat pretty good, mostly. Lots of fruits and veggies from my garden. Oh! And I do love my salt. Maybe too much salt? My husband always said so.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. Shortness of breath with walking and occasional blurry vision are good things to mention, thank you. And yes, you're right to think about your salt intake. That can certainly affect blood pressure. Let's take a look at your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you happen to know if you’ve been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not much, really. I had the flu real bad when I was a little girl, but that’s about it. And I broke my wrist once, fallin’ off a horse. But other than that, I’ve been pretty lucky. I don’t take no regular medicines, 'cept for a little somethin’ for my arthritis in my hands when it flares up. Dr. Matthews used to see me for that, but he retired a few years back. I always figured good livin’ and hard work kept me goin'.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear you've been generally healthy. Arthritis in your hands is good to know. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for it when it flares up?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that's a question. It was a little white pill…or maybe it was pink? I just told my daughter-in-law to fill the prescription for me every few months. She handles all that now. I'm terrible with names, always have been. I think it started with a 'N'…or maybe a 'P'? I really couldn't say for sure. It helps the pain, that’s all I know.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Steines, don’t worry about it. We can likely find out what you’re taking through your pharmacy records if needed. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than that broken wrist when you were younger?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that. I had all my babies at home, with the midwife. Back in my day, folks didn't go to the hospital for every little thing. I was always a strong woman. Never needed much help, really. Except maybe for gettin’ this pressure under control now, I reckon. It’s just…never bothered me before.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It sounds like you’ve lived a full and active life! Now, thinking about your family…are there any medical conditions that run in your family—things like heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else that your parents or siblings might have had?
PATIENT: My mama…she had trouble with her heart when she got older. She was real frail, always tired. And my brother, he had somethin’ with his sugar…diabetes, I think they called it. He had to watch what he ate real careful. My daddy was strong as an ox all his life, never sick a day. And my sisters…they were mostly healthy, too. Just…normal things, you know? Colds and the flu. It’s hard to remember now. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. History of heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your brother are important to note. Now, Ms. Steines, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else—like foods, pollen, or insects?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to nothin’. I spend a lot of time in my garden, and I'm around bees all the time, but they don’t bother me none. I've been stung a few times, but it's just a little pinch. I’m a tough old bird, Doctor. Don't worry about me gettin’ sick from allergies.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And it sounds like you really are a tough old bird! Now, one last question before we do a quick physical exam. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements—anything at all—besides the arthritis medication?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, my daughter-in-law gives me somethin’ for my memory. Little orange pills. Says it’s got somethin’ in it to help keep my mind sharp. And I take a vitamin D pill in the winter, 'cause I don't get out in the sun much then. Other than that…no, nothin’. I don’t hold much with all them fancy medicines. I just try to eat good and stay busy, that's what keeps me goin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful, Ms. Steines. Orange pills for memory and Vitamin D. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam—just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds fine to me, Doctor. Get it over with. I got a pie crust needs rollin’ later. Don't take too long now.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Steines. We won't take long. If you could just sit here for me. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. That's not necessarily concerning, especially with your history of heart trouble in your mother, but we'll keep it in mind. Your lungs sound clear. Okay, your blood pressure is 162 over 94. That is elevated. Your ears and throat look clear. I’ll palpate your thyroid gland now. Your thyroid feels normal. Alright, Ms. Steines, everything else seems good. Your pulse is a bit fast, which can be associated with high blood pressure, and your weight is 85 pounds, and your height is 190. It is a good thing you came in today. Your blood pressure is higher than we'd like. Let’s talk about what that means and what we can do about it.
PATIENT: Well, I figured as much. Always somethin’, ain’t it? What does it mean, exactly? Is it bad? And what can we do? I don’t want to take a bunch of pills if I can help it. I'm 90 years old, Doctor. I just want to enjoy my bakin’ while I still can.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those questions, Ms. Steines. And I understand your concern about taking pills. High blood pressure, or hypertension, means your heart is working harder to pump blood through your arteries. Over time, that can lead to serious problems like heart attack, stroke, or kidney problems. However, we don’t have to jump straight to medication. We can try some lifestyle changes first. Things like reducing salt intake, eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables – which you already do, which is wonderful – maintaining a healthy weight, and getting regular exercise, if you're able. We'll also want to monitor your blood pressure closely. Would you be willing to check it at home a few times a week?
PATIENT: Check it at home? I ain’t so good with all that newfangled stuff. My daughter-in-law has a machine, I reckon, but I wouldn’t know where to start. And I’m already watchin’ my salt…or tryin’ to, anyway. It’s hard when you’ve seasoned everything a certain way for 90 years! What if those things don’t work? Will I have to take pills then? And what kind of pills are we talkin’ about? I’ve heard stories about side effects…
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Ms. Steines. Checking it at home isn’t essential, we can certainly monitor it here regularly. Your daughter-in-law can help you with that, if you're willing. If not, we'll check it every visit. If lifestyle changes aren’t enough, we may need to consider medication. There are many different types of blood pressure medications, and we’d start with a very low dose. Common side effects can include dizziness, fatigue, or a cough, but not everyone experiences them, and we can always adjust the medication if needed. We’ll find something that works for you if medication becomes necessary. Before we discuss medication any further, let’s order some blood tests to rule out any other underlying causes for your high blood pressure and to check your kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… More pokin’ and proddin’. Alright, Doctor. If you think it’s best. Just get it over with, I reckon. I trust your judgment. But please, no fancy talk. Just tell me what it all means, plain and simple. And let’s try to avoid them pills if we can, alright? I just wanna keep bakin’ my pies.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Steines. No fancy talk, I promise. And we'll do everything we can to avoid those pills if possible. We’ll start with the blood tests, and then we’ll see what they tell us. I’ll also give you a handout with some simple tips for lowering your blood pressure through diet and lifestyle. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood samples now. After the results come back—usually within a few days—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds…fine. As good as anything, I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. You seem like a nice young man. Let's get this over with, then. I got a cherry pie waitin’ to be made.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Steines. It was a pleasure meeting you. I'll have the nurse come in now. And enjoy that cherry pie!
