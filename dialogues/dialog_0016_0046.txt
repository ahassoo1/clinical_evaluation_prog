DOCTOR: Hi Marialena, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. Thank you for having me. I’ve been experiencing some…well, bladder pressure, as my appointment indicates. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. That's a good reason to come in. “A little while” can mean different things to different people, so could you tell me roughly how long you’ve been noticing this pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me think… it began approximately six weeks ago, perhaps a little more. It started subtly, just a slight discomfort after drinking my usual amount of water, but it’s gradually become more noticeable, and now it happens even with smaller amounts. It doesn't necessarily feel painful, just…present.
DOCTOR: Okay, six weeks, starting subtly and now with smaller amounts of fluid. And you describe it as pressure, not pain. That's helpful. Is it constant pressure, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Doctor. It's not a constant feeling, thankfully. It’s most prominent after I drink something – water, tea, it doesn’t seem to matter the liquid – and then it gradually subsides. It’s less noticeable when I haven’t had anything to drink for a while, but even then, I sometimes feel a faint sensation of…fullness, even when I know I haven’t had much to drink.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's triggered by fluids but also present sometimes even when you're not drinking. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it… I’ve been going to the bathroom a bit more frequently, I suppose. Not drastically, but I’d say I’m visiting the restroom perhaps every two to three hours, whereas before it was more like every four or five. And, occasionally, I experience a slight…urgency, a feeling like I need to go right now, even if my bladder doesn't feel particularly full. It doesn’t happen every time, but it’s been occurring more often recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency and some urgency. Do you have any difficulty starting the stream of urine when you go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I haven’t had any trouble starting to go. The stream itself seems normal, as well—it's not weak or hesitant, and I don't have any burning or discomfort during urination. It really is just this pressure and the increased frequency, with the occasional urgency. I suppose I should mention that I do sometimes feel like I don’t fully empty my bladder, though that feeling tends to go away shortly after.
DOCTOR: Okay, no difficulty starting, normal stream, no burning… and sometimes a sensation of incomplete emptying. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, odor, or any blood?
PATIENT: No blood, Doctor, thankfully. The color hasn’t changed—it’s the usual pale yellow. And the odor seems normal as well, I haven’t noticed anything unusual. I do make a point of drinking a lot of water, so it's typically quite clear, actually. I really haven’t noticed anything alarming in the urine itself, just the pressure and the other symptoms we’ve discussed. It’s more of a sensation than anything visibly different.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No changes in the urine itself. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like urinary tract infections, kidney problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. To my knowledge, I’ve never been diagnosed with any medical conditions. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, of course – chickenpox, measles – but nothing serious. I’ve never had a urinary tract infection, or any kidney problems. I do have mild seasonal allergies, but that’s about it. And my yearly check-ups have always been perfectly normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries or been hospitalized, Doctor. I've been fortunate enough to avoid both, thankfully. I broke my arm when I was a child, but it was treated with a cast and healed perfectly well at home. Otherwise, I've always been able to manage things without needing more invasive medical intervention.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Do you have a family history of any medical conditions, particularly kidney problems, bladder issues, or anything related to urinary function?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… my mother had high blood pressure, and my paternal grandfather had diabetes, but neither of them had any kidney problems or bladder issues, to my knowledge. My father is still quite healthy, and he doesn’t have any medical conditions. As far as I’m aware, there isn't a family history of anything specifically related to urinary function. I can ask my parents for more details if you’d like, but I don’t believe so.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of kidney or bladder problems. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke. Never have. My husband smokes occasionally – perhaps a cigarette or two on weekends – but I’ve never been a smoker myself. I find the smell quite unpleasant, actually. I also don’t drink alcohol very often – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but nothing regular. I generally prefer water or tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements. I try to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle, and haven’t felt the need for anything extra. I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, perhaps once or twice a month, but that's the extent of it. It’s just the usual over-the-counter pain reliever.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional ibuprofen. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, food, or anything else, as far as I’m aware. I can tolerate most things without any issue. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Alright, Marialena, that gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I’ll also do a quick neurological exam, and potentially a pelvic exam to rule out anything obvious. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please proceed. I understand the need for a thorough examination, and I trust your judgment completely. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can to get to the bottom of this. I appreciate you taking the time to be so thorough.
DOCTOR: Great. Let’s start by listening to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. I’m going to use my stethoscope to listen for any unusual sounds. Just breathe normally. Okay, your abdomen sounds normal. I didn’t hear anything concerning. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Reflexes are normal as well. Now, for the pelvic exam, I'll need you to position yourself on the examination table as you would for a routine gynecological checkup. I'll use a speculum to visualize the vaginal and cervical areas. I’m just looking for any signs of infection or abnormalities. It might feel a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Let me know if you experience any discomfort. Okay, everything looks normal externally and internally. I didn't see any signs of infection or any obvious abnormalities. Your uterus feels normal in size and position, and your cervix looks healthy. However, to be absolutely certain, I'd like to order a urinalysis to check for a urinary tract infection and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. I’m happy to provide a sample and have those tests done. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly and taking the time to be so thorough. It's reassuring to know you've checked everything so carefully. I understand that tests are necessary to be completely certain, and I'm happy to proceed with the urinalysis and the basic metabolic panel. When can I expect to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. The nurse will provide you with a sterile cup for the urine sample. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect the sample mid-way through. As for the results, the lab typically takes about 24-48 hours to process everything. I'll review them as soon as they’re available and call you with the findings. If I don’t hear back from you within three business days, please feel free to call the office to check on the status of your results. In the meantime, I’m going to tentatively suggest a trial of increased fluid intake, and monitoring your symptoms. If the urgency or frequency worsen, or if you develop any fever, back pain, or blood in your urine, please contact the office immediately. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Increased fluid intake seems sensible, and I will certainly monitor my symptoms closely. I understand the importance of contacting the office if anything worsens, and I will do so without hesitation. Thank you again for your thorough examination and your clear explanation of everything. I feel much more reassured now, and I appreciate you taking the time to address my concerns. I’ll wait for your call with the test results. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime, or any specific things I should be noting?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. For now, just continue to drink plenty of water – aim for at least eight glasses a day. Also, it would be helpful if you could keep a simple bladder diary for the next few days, noting how much fluid you’re drinking and how often you’re urinating. That can give us a better picture of what’s going on. Just a quick note each time you go to the bathroom, and the amount of fluid you've consumed since your last bathroom visit. Other than that, just continue your normal activities and try not to worry too much. We’ll have a better idea of what’s going on once we get the test results back. Here’s a printed sheet with some information about bladder diaries, and my contact information in case you have any questions. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: That’s very thoughtful of you, Doctor. A bladder diary is a good idea, and I’ll certainly start one today. I appreciate you providing the information sheet. No, I think that covers everything for now. I feel much more confident now, knowing what steps to take and what to look out for. Thank you again for your excellent care and your kindness. I look forward to hearing from you with the results. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. I'm glad I could help. You have a good day as well, and please don't hesitate to call if anything changes.
PATIENT: .
