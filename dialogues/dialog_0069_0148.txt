DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is nice to meet you. Oh, um… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. It’s… pain. Down there. In… that area. My… testicles, I think? It’s been bothering me for a little while now. I don't really… remember exactly when it started, though. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani, no need to be embarrassed at all. That’s what I’m here for. Pain in that area can definitely be concerning, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. It's very common for the timing to be a little unclear, so don't worry about that. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not… sharp, exactly. More of a… dull ache, I suppose. Sometimes it feels heavy, you know? Like something is… weighing down. And sometimes it feels… tight. It’s difficult to explain. It doesn't really radiate anywhere, it just stays… there. I mostly notice it when I’m walking, or after I’ve been… doing things around the house, with the wood. I work with wood, you see. A lot of bending and… lifting. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dull ache, heaviness, and tightness… and it's worse with activity, especially bending and lifting. That gives me a bit more to work with. Now, when you say “a little while now,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's the tricky part, isn't it? Let me think… It must be… several weeks, at least? Maybe a month? It's hard to say, really. I've been quite busy with… a commission, a large piece for a client. It’s taken up a lot of my time and attention, and I haven't been paying as much attention to… myself, I suppose. I just sort of… ignored it, hoping it would go away. Which, clearly, it hasn't. I apologize for not being more specific.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Noelani. It’s very common to put things off when you’re busy. Several weeks, okay. And has anything specific seemed to make it worse, besides the bending and lifting?
PATIENT: Hmm… Now that you mention it… I think it’s a little worse after I’ve been standing for a long time. I sometimes work outside, shaping the wood, and I’m on my feet for hours. But that could just be… my legs, you know? I’m not as young as I used to be. And… I don't recall anything sudden happening. No injury, no… particular event. Just… gradually, this discomfort. Is that helpful? I feel as though I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Noelani. This is all very helpful information. Standing for long periods makes it worse, no specific injury… okay. Now, let’s talk about some other things. Have you noticed any swelling or any changes in the size or shape of your testicles?
PATIENT: Oh… Well, I haven’t… really looked, to be honest. I know that sounds silly. I mean, I haven't been specifically… examining myself. I don't think I've noticed anything different… not that I’m aware of. But I haven't made a point of checking. Should I have been? I apologize. I truly haven't paid much attention. It’s… not something I’m used to doing. Is it something I should be doing regularly?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Noelani. Many people don’t routinely check, and it's never silly to ask. It’s good you’re asking now. Self-exams can be helpful in noticing changes, but we're going to do a proper examination today. Okay. Have you had any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting associated with this pain?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No fever, no chills, no nausea… nothing like that. Just the… ache. And the heaviness. It doesn’t keep me up at night or anything, it’s just… a constant discomfort when I’m active. I do find myself… shifting around a bit more, trying to find a comfortable position. Does that make sense? It's a subtle thing, really. I'm not normally one to complain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A constant discomfort, shifting around to find a comfortable position… Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That's another thing I struggle with remembering. I… I had a bout of the flu a few years back, but that was quite mild. And I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, but that was a very long time ago. Aside from that… I’m not sure. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly in… well, a very long time. I try to stay healthy, eat well, get enough sleep, but I don't have any diagnosed conditions that I'm aware of. I'm on Medicare, if that’s helpful. I apologize for not having a more detailed answer.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Noelani. That’s helpful to know. Flu a few years back, appendix removed as a teenager, otherwise healthy… and on Medicare. Alright. Have you had any surgeries other than your appendix removal?
PATIENT: No, that was the only one. As far as I recall, anyway. I had a… difficult childbirth, many years ago, but I don’t think that involved surgery. Just… a very long labor. And I've had… dental work, of course. Fillings and such. But nothing major. I truly don’t believe I’ve had any other surgical procedures. I would remember something like that, wouldn’t I? It's just… my memory isn't what it used to be. I apologize for being so vague. I wish I was more helpful.
DOCTOR: You are perfectly helpful, Noelani. It’s good you’re letting me know about the difficult childbirth. It's important information, even if it didn't involve surgery. Alright. And how about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh… My family history. That’s… complicated. My mother passed away when I was young, and I didn’t know my father. I have… a few cousins, but I haven’t seen them in many years. And I don’t really know much about their medical histories. I… I believe my mother had high blood pressure, but that’s about all I know. I truly don’t have much information about my family’s medical background. I apologize for not being more knowledgeable. It’s… a sensitive topic, and I haven’t really made an effort to find out. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Noelani. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t have a lot of information about your family history. It’s not something everyone has access to, and it’s a sensitive topic for many. Alright. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, let's talk about medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I don’t take any medications regularly. I occasionally take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s very rare. And I haven’t taken any supplements in… well, a very long time. I try to get all the nutrients I need from my diet. I'm very careful about what I eat. And… I don't have any known allergies. No food allergies, no drug allergies, nothing like that. I can usually tolerate anything. I apologize for being so… healthy, I suppose. It feels strange to not have anything to report.
DOCTOR: You don't need to apologize for being healthy! That's wonderful. No medications, no supplements, no allergies. Alright. Now, I would like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. This will involve me listening to your heart and lungs, and then gently examining your abdomen and… that area. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. I understand. Please, go ahead. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest, but I trust your judgment. I… I’m just hoping it’s nothing too serious. Please, don’t hesitate to tell me if anything feels uncomfortable. I apologize for being such a worrywart.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright to be nervous, Noelani. We'll take it one step at a time. And I absolutely will let you know before I do anything that might cause discomfort. Alright, let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I… I hope I’m not making this difficult. It's been a long time since I've been in this situation. Please, take your time. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Your lungs are clear, I hear normal breath sounds bilaterally. Good. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation… Now, I'm going to gently examine the area where you’re experiencing the discomfort. Please let me know if anything feels painful. I'm just going to feel for any swelling or abnormalities. Okay. I do feel some mild tenderness on the left testicle, when I gently palpate. It doesn’t seem to be significantly swollen, and I don’t feel any obvious masses. However, there is a slight… firmness to the left testicle compared to the right. It’s subtle, but noticeable. And there’s some slight discomfort when I lift your leg slightly. Alright. That’s all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience.
PATIENT: Oh… a slight firmness? And tenderness? That doesn’t sound good, does it? Is it… serious? Should we be worried? I apologize for being so anxious. I truly don’t want anything to be wrong. Perhaps it's just… a muscle strain? I've been doing a lot of heavy lifting lately, as I mentioned. Is that possible? What do you think, Doctor? I’m truly worried.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be worried, Noelani. I want to be upfront with you. The mild tenderness and firmness I felt warrant further investigation. It could be a muscle strain, as you suggested, but we need to rule out other possibilities. There are a few things that could cause these findings, including a condition called epididymitis, which is inflammation of the tube at the back of the testicle, or a hydrocele, which is a fluid collection. Less commonly, it could be a sign of something more serious, such as a testicular torsion or, very rarely, testicular cancer. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a scrotal ultrasound. This is a painless imaging test that will allow us to visualize your testicles and surrounding structures in detail. It's the best way to determine the cause of your discomfort. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… Yes, of course. If that’s what you recommend, then yes, please. I want to know what’s going on. I'd rather know the truth, even if it’s not what I want to hear. A hydrocele? Testicular torsion? Those sound… frightening. But I understand it's best to rule things out. And… is it painful? The ultrasound, I mean. I apologize for asking so many questions. I'm just… nervous, as you can see. And… how long will it take to get the results? And… what if it is something serious? I truly appreciate your patience with me, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Noelani. It's good you're asking—it means you're involved in your care, and that’s wonderful. The ultrasound itself is completely painless. A technician will apply a gel to your scrotum, and then use a handheld device to create images on a screen. It takes about 20-30 minutes. You’ll lie on a table, and the technician will move the device around to get different views. We should have the results within 24-48 hours. I'll review them carefully and discuss them with you in detail. If it is something serious, we’ll discuss all your treatment options. For a testicular torsion, immediate surgery is usually required. For other conditions, such as epididymitis, antibiotics or other medications may be sufficient. And for a hydrocele, we may recommend observation or surgical drainage. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll wait for the ultrasound results first. I’ll order it right away and schedule you for an appointment as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity, including heavy lifting, and wearing supportive underwear. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Supportive underwear… Yes, that makes sense. I suppose I should have been wearing that all along. No, I think that’s everything for now. Just… avoiding strenuous activity, wearing supportive underwear… and waiting for the ultrasound. It's a bit overwhelming, to be honest, but I appreciate your thorough explanation, Doctor. And… thank you. For being so patient and kind. It’s… reassuring to know that I’m in good hands. I'll try not to worry too much, but it's difficult. I truly appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. So, just to be clear… you’ll call me when the results are available? And I don’t need to do anything else at this time? I apologize for asking so many questions again. I just want to make sure I understand everything correctly. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Noelani. I'm glad I could help. You're right to ask all your questions – it’s important you feel informed and comfortable. Yes, my office will call you as soon as the ultrasound results are available. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. For now, just focus on resting, avoiding strenuous activity, and wearing supportive underwear. And don’t hesitate to call my office if you experience any worsening pain, swelling, redness, or fever. I'll order the ultrasound right away. Take care, Noelani. And please try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
