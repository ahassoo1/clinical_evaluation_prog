DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, my left leg is quite swollen. It’s been getting bigger for a few days now, and it’s a bit uncomfortable. I do have… a heart thing, the doctors told me. Something about it fluttering. I think they called it… atrial… fib… something. It's not new, but the leg is.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, yes. I see that noted in your record. And this leg swelling… is it just the left leg, or is the right leg affected as well?
PATIENT: Just the left one, Doctor. The right one is perfectly fine, thank you. It’s mostly around my calf, I think. It feels… tight, if that makes sense. And a little bit achy. Not terribly painful, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Tight and achy… alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… not that I can think of, really. I’ve been keeping to my usual routine, mostly. Work, a bit of reading, the occasional walk. I haven't started any new medicines or anything like that. I did perhaps… eat a bit more salt than usual last week? My sister brought over some crisps, and I had quite a few. But that’s about it. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It can matter. Salt retention can contribute to fluid build-up. But we need to rule out other possibilities. Let’s get some more information. Do you have any shortness of breath, or chest pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No chest pain at all, and I haven’t been feeling short of breath. I’ve been a bit tired lately, but I always am, to be honest. I just put that down to work. It's a demanding job, teaching the young ones about computers. It's a lot of sitting, if that makes any difference.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said this started a few days ago?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I first noticed it on… Tuesday, I think. It wasn’t terribly big then, just a little puffiness. But it’s definitely grown since. I thought it might just go away on its own, but it hasn’t. And it feels a bit worse this morning. Should I be worried, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Worrying won’t help, Nixon. But we do need to investigate. Given your history of atrial fibrillation, and the unilateral leg swelling, we need to rule out a few things. I'm going to need to examine your leg, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll likely order a D-dimer test to check for a blood clot, and possibly an ultrasound of your leg. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That sounds… complicated. No, I don’t have any allergies, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m a bit nervous about the tests, if you don’t mind me saying. What exactly does a D-dimer test involve? And an ultrasound… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: A D-dimer is just a blood test, a simple prick of the finger. As for the ultrasound, no, it doesn’t hurt. It uses sound waves to look at the blood flow in your leg. It’s non-invasive. Now, if you'll please, let's have a look at your leg. Could you sit on the examination table, and I’ll begin?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you say it doesn’t hurt, I’ll trust you. Just… please be gentle? It’s a bit sensitive, as I said. I’m not very good with needles, either, if that helps. Is the blood test first, then?
DOCTOR: Alright. There is definite edema here… pitting edema, actually. And the skin is warm to the touch. No visible signs of redness or infection. Now, let's get that blood sample. The phlebotomist will be in shortly. We'll start with that, and then we can discuss the ultrasound.
PATIENT: Oh. Pitting edema… is that bad, Doctor? A phlebotomist? Is that the person who does the blood test? I do hope they're gentle. And… what if they can’t find a vein? I’ve always been a bit difficult for them. It’s terribly embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Pitting edema simply means fluid is accumulating in the tissues. It's a sign of something, not a disease in itself. And yes, a phlebotomist draws the blood. They are quite skilled at finding veins. If they have trouble, they'll let me know. Now, please try to relax. The more tense you are, the harder it will be for them. Mrs. Davies?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I’m trying. It’s just… I’ve never been very good with medical things. Everything always seems so… clinical. And I do tend to get flustered easily. Perhaps I should have brought my sister with me. She’s much braver than I am. Is it much blood they need, do you think?
DOCTOR: It’s a small sample, barely a few milliliters. And frankly, focusing on your anxiety isn't going to help us determine the cause of your leg swelling. Mrs. Davies, could you please draw a D-dimer for Nixon?
PATIENT: Alright. A few milliliters… that doesn’t sound too bad. But… what if it is something serious, Doctor? What if it’s a blood clot, like you said? Will I have to go to the hospital? I haven't packed a bag. And I have work tomorrow…
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions, Nixon. We haven’t even had the results of the D-dimer yet. Worrying about the hospital at this point is entirely premature. The phlebotomist is ready when you are. Focus on taking deep breaths, and let’s get this done. Please proceed, Mrs. Davies.
PATIENT: Alright. Please… be gentle. And… could you tell me what you’re doing, as you go? It always makes me feel better to know what's happening. I don’t like surprises, you see. I’m afraid of needles, terribly afraid. I think I’m going to close my eyes.
