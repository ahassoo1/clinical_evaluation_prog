DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Stoffregen. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my waterworks. Been a bit… tricky lately. Not as strong as they used to be, you know? Takes me a while to… get going. It's been a few weeks now, I think. Maybe longer? Time… slips away.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Tricky" is a good way to put it. So, it sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty starting your urine stream, and it’s been going on for a few weeks, potentially longer. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s not… painful, exactly. Just… weak. Like a little stream, not a good strong push. And sometimes… sometimes I feel like it doesn't all come out, if you know what I mean. I have to… wait a bit, and try again. My husband, he doesn't mind helping me keep track, bless his heart. He says I shouldn't worry so much. But it bothers me.
DOCTOR: It's good that you're addressing this, Ms. Stoffregen, and it's very thoughtful of your husband to assist you. It's perfectly reasonable to want to investigate changes in your body. When you say it doesn’t feel like it all comes out, does that happen every time, or just occasionally?
PATIENT: Oh, not every time, no. Maybe… half the time? It's hard to say for sure. Some days are better than others. And I drink plenty of water, I do. Always have. My mother always said water was the best medicine, and I believe her. Though, I do like a bit of juice with my breakfast now and then. Orange juice, mostly. Is that… bad? I don't want to be doing anything wrong.
DOCTOR: No, drinking water is excellent, and a little orange juice with breakfast is perfectly fine. We just want to get a complete picture. So, about half the time you feel like you don’t fully empty your bladder. Are you experiencing any burning or discomfort when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no burning. Not a bit. Just… weak. And the waiting. It's annoying, that's all. I used to be able to go straight away, you see? Years and years of no trouble. Now… well, now it's different. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so I can't remember exactly when it started. Maybe after I turned eighty? Or was it seventy-five? I get so mixed up these days.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to have difficulty pinpointing a specific timeframe. We can work around that. No burning is good to know. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh dear… color and smell… Let me think. It looks normal, I think. The usual pale yellow. I haven't noticed anything different. And smell… well, urine smells like urine, doesn't it? I don't go sniffing at it, if you know what I mean! I just haven’t noticed anything… off. My husband might notice more, he’s got a good nose. But he hasn't said anything.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. You certainly shouldn't be sniffing your urine! It's good that you haven’t noticed any changes in color or smell, and that your husband hasn’t mentioned anything either. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you been experiencing any constipation or difficulty with bowel movements lately?
PATIENT: Constipation… hmm. Not really. I go… regular enough. Maybe a little hard sometimes, now that I think about it. But nothing terrible. I eat my fiber, you know. Prunes, mostly. My mother swore by prunes. She said they were good for everything! But no, no trouble going, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. It sounds like you're taking good care of yourself. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen with a stethoscope and a brief external examination. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I’ve been poked and prodded by doctors my whole life, so it doesn't bother me none. Just be gentle, alright? My skin’s a bit thin these days. Go ahead, then.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Please lie back on the examination table. Alright, everything sounds relatively normal listening to your abdomen. I didn't feel anything concerning during the external examination either. Now, I'd like to do a quick neurological check, just to assess your reflexes and sensation. This is routine. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, go right ahead. Neurological… that sounds fancy. But if you say it’s routine, I trust you. My legs aren’t what they used to be, mind you. A bit shaky sometimes. But I still get around. Just be careful I don't fall! Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen, your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, and there's some decreased sensation in your feet, but nothing overly concerning. Your gait is a little unsteady, as you mentioned, but I didn't see anything that immediately raises a red flag. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of an overactive bladder and some urinary retention. This can happen as we age, and sometimes it's related to changes in the bladder muscle itself or a weakening of the pelvic floor muscles. It's important to rule out other possibilities, though, so I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for infection and a post-void residual volume test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh my. That’s a lot of fancy words. Overactive bladder… urinary retention… sounds dreadful. But if it's just getting old, I suppose that's alright. Is it… serious? Will I need… surgery? I don't want no surgery! A test to see how much is left… that sounds… practical. Yes, alright. Do the test. Whatever you think is best. But no surgery, dear. Please.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Stoffregen, let's not jump to conclusions. Most cases of overactive bladder and urinary retention can be managed with lifestyle changes and medication. Surgery is rarely necessary. The tests will simply help us get a clearer picture of what's going on so we can develop the best plan for you. The urinalysis is just a simple urine sample. We’ll have you provide that here in the clinic. The post-void residual volume test will involve a quick ultrasound after you urinate to see how much urine is left in your bladder. I’ll write the orders for those tests now. In the meantime, I recommend trying to do pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises, to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. There are plenty of resources online and I can provide you with a handout as well. Also, make sure you're staying well-hydrated, but avoid drinking large amounts of fluids right before bedtime. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Kegel exercises… oh dear. I think my daughter mentioned those once. Strengthen the pelvic floor… Sounds like hard work! I'll try my best, dear. I always try my best. No big drinks before bed, alright. That I can do. I like a bit of chamomile tea before bed, but it's not a big cup. And I'll try to remember those exercises. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. Thank you, dear. You've been very kind. And no surgery, right? Just the tests and exercises?
DOCTOR: That’s right, Ms. Stoffregen. Just the tests and exercises for now. We’ll review the results together and see if any further steps are needed. We’ll start with the least invasive options first. I'll have the nurse come in to collect a urine sample and give you a handout on Kegel exercises. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here's a work note excusing you from strenuous activity for a few days, just in case. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s lovely, dear. A work note… even though I’m retired, my daughter always says I should have something to do. She worries so much. No, I think that’s all, dear. You’ve been very thorough. And kind. I appreciate you taking the time with an old woman like me. Thank you again. I’ll try those exercises and not drink too much before bed. And I’ll call if I get confused. It's easy to get confused these days.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, taking care of yourself is the most important thing. Have a wonderful day, and we’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
