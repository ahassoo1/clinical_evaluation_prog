DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I'm Dr. GonzalezPerez. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Courtnye is fine. Um, well, it’s my bruising. It’s been… worse lately. I’m on something for my blood, makes it thinner, and I just keep getting these big, purple marks. It’s kinda worrying me.
DOCTOR: Very well, Courtnye. You mentioned being on medication to thin your blood. I see here you are prescribed Warfarin. And these bruises… are they appearing with minimal trauma, or are you noticing them after bumps or injuries?
PATIENT: Minimal trauma, definitely. Like, I barely brush against the table and, boom, a mark. Or sometimes I don't even remember brushing against anything! It's not like I'm falling down or anything. It’s just… appearing. It's kinda freaky, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Spontaneous bruising can certainly be unsettling. Now, have you noticed this bruising occurring in specific areas of your body more frequently than others?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think so. My arms, mostly. And my legs, a bit. It’s hard to say for sure, ‘cause I’m always noticing new ones popping up. But yeah, arms and legs, I’d say. And… sometimes on my tummy? Though that could just be from, you know, moving around.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been a gradual increase in bruising over time, or was there a sudden onset?
PATIENT: Gradual, definitely gradual. It started, like, a few months ago, just little marks here and there. I didn't think much of it at first, figured it was just part of being on the Warfarin. But it's just gotten worse and worse, you know? Bigger marks, more of them. That’s why I came in, really. It feels different now.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the bruising?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. No, not really. I've been a little tired, maybe? But I'm always a bit tired. Nothing else that I've noticed, no. No pain, no bleeding gums, no weird headaches… just the bruising. And the worrying, of course!
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, take a look at your skin, and perhaps palpate your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on. It's kinda scaring me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I do observe multiple ecchymoses on your extremities, consistent with your description. Their sizes vary, and there’s some distribution on your abdomen as well, though it's difficult to ascertain if this is new versus established bruising. No obvious tenderness to palpation. Now, Courtnye, to rule out any underlying causes and to assess your current Warfarin levels, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a PT/INR test. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, that sounds good. Whatever tests you think are necessary, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted. A PT/INR test... that checks the blood thinner, right? Is it hard? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Yes, the PT/INR test checks how quickly your blood is clotting, which is directly related to the effectiveness of Warfarin. It’s a simple blood draw, Courtnye. A small prick with a needle, and it's usually quite quick. The phlebotomist is very skilled. We will get that done today, and I'll have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, it's important to avoid any activities that could lead to injury, and if you do experience any unusual bleeding – nosebleeds, bleeding gums, heavy menstrual bleeding, or blood in your stool – please seek immediate medical attention.
PATIENT: Okay, alright. Avoid injury... I can do that. And I will watch for the bleeding. Heavy menstrual bleeding… not an issue for me, thankfully. So, we're just waiting on the blood test results, then? How long will it take to get those back, exactly? And will you call me with them? I don’t really get out much.
DOCTOR: The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to return. I will personally review them as soon as they are available. And yes, I will absolutely call you with the results, Courtnye. I understand you don’t get out much, so I'll be sure to contact you directly, even if the results are normal. We'll discuss them over the phone and determine the best course of action from there. Now, while we await the results, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. No, not really. Just the Warfarin, like we said. Oh, wait! I take a multivitamin sometimes. But not every day, just when I remember. And… sometimes I take Tylenol for headaches, but that’s it. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Courtnye. The occasional use of Tylenol shouldn't be a concern, but it's good to know. It's important to be aware that even over-the-counter medications can interact with Warfarin, though the risk is generally low with infrequent use. Now, do you have any known allergies to any medications or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. I don’t really have much in the way of allergies, food or anything. Just… a bit sensitive to the sun, but that’s about it. I always wear sunscreen.
DOCTOR: Very good. Alright, Courtnye, I believe that covers everything for now. To reiterate, we've ordered a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and PT/INR test to assess your overall health and Warfarin levels. I will call you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, please avoid activities that could lead to injury, and be vigilant for any unusual bleeding. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude today’s consultation?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything really clearly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. Just… hopefully it’s nothing serious. It’s just been worrying me a lot. I’ll try not to stress too much until I hear back. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Courtnye. I understand your concern, and we'll get to the bottom of this. Try to rest and take care of yourself. I will be in touch as soon as possible. .
