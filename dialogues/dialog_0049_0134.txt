DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this…feeling sick to my stomach, mostly. It's been going on for a bit now, and I don’t seem to be able to eat much before I feel full. It’s just…not right. I can’t really say when it started, exactly. Seems like a long time, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Feeling sick to your stomach” and early fullness… alright. And you say it’s been going on for “a bit now”. Could you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh dear, specific… that's hard. Let me see… I reckon it started… maybe after the holidays? Last Christmas, perhaps? Or was it the one before? Honestly, time gets away from me these days. It's not a sharp pain, just…uncomfortable. And it happens pretty much after just a few bites of food. I used to have a good appetite, you know. I love to cook for my grandkids when they visit. But now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Right. So, potentially several months. And it's not a pain, precisely, just…discomfort. And it affects your ability to eat normally. Do you experience any nausea or vomiting with this discomfort, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the nausea… that's a good way to put it. It's not constant, but it comes in waves. And no, I haven’t actually thrown up, thankfully. Just feel… queasy. Like I might, but it hasn't happened. It's worse after I try to eat, usually. Sometimes even the smell of cooking makes it worse. Though, like I said, I don’t cook as much anymore. It just doesn't feel worth it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Nausea without vomiting, triggered by eating or even the smell of food. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I’ve been a bit…tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. But I am getting older, so maybe that’s just old age catching up with me. I’ve also lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t actually weighed myself recently. I mostly just try to ignore it, to be honest. It's just been a lot of little things, all adding up. My daughter keeps telling me to get checked out, and that's why I'm here. I don't want to worry her more than she already is.
DOCTOR: “A little weight loss” and fatigue… alright. It’s good your daughter encouraged you to come in. Let's do a quick physical exam, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better, if that's possible. It’s hard to enjoy things when you feel like this all the time. And I do want to enjoy my grandkids while I can. They grow up so fast.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll see what we can find. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll palpate it – that means I’ll gently press on your stomach. Please let me know if anything feels painful. And then I'll check your reflexes and listen to your heart and lungs. If you could lie down for me, please.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, yes. Palpate… that sounds a bit scary, but if you say it's necessary. Just let me know if it gets uncomfortable, alright? I'm a bit sensitive, you know. And my bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. Just breathe normally. Sounds are…normal, but a little quiet. Now, I'm going to gently press on your stomach. Tell me if you feel any tenderness or pain. How about here?
PATIENT: That's...not too bad. A little uncomfortable, but not painful. Oh, there… that's a little tender. Not sharp, just…a dull ache. It’s hard to explain. It’s like a pressure, more than a pain. And it feels…deeper inside, if that makes any sense. My tummy feels a bit swollen too, now that you mention it. I hadn’t really noticed before.
DOCTOR: Alright, tenderness in the right upper quadrant, with a dull ache and a feeling of pressure. And you note some swelling. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Okay, Ms. Kelder. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it could be a number of things. It’s difficult to say definitively without some further testing.
PATIENT: Oh dear. “A number of things”… that doesn’t sound good. What kind of testing are we talking about? I'm not afraid, exactly, but I do worry about needles. And I don't like being poked and prodded. Is it something serious, Doctor? I'm just… a bit anxious, I suppose. My daughter said something about cancer, but I didn’t pay much attention. I always try to stay positive, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be anxious, Ms. Kelder. And it's good you're staying positive. Your daughter mentioned cancer, and while it’s always important to consider all possibilities, it's far too early to jump to any conclusions. We need to rule things out systematically. The testing I'm recommending would include a complete blood count – that’s a basic blood test to check your overall health. And an abdominal ultrasound. That uses sound waves to create images of your liver, gallbladder, and other organs. It doesn’t involve any needles, thankfully. It’s non-invasive. We may also want to check your liver enzymes, another blood test. It'll give us a better idea of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, an ultrasound… that doesn’t sound too bad. No needles, that’s good. And blood tests are… well, I’ve had those before. As long as it doesn’t take too long, I suppose. I have a bridge game on Wednesday afternoons, and I wouldn’t want to miss that. My partner, Beatrice, would be furious. Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Let’s get it over with, I suppose. Just… tell me what you’re looking for, if you don’t mind. I like to know what’s happening, even if I don’t understand all the medical terms. And… is it expensive? Medicare covers most things, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll get this done as quickly as possible, Ms. Kelder. I understand about bridge – it's important to keep busy and socialize. With the blood tests, we’re looking at your overall blood count, and specifically, we’ll check your liver enzymes. Elevated enzymes can indicate inflammation or damage to the liver. The ultrasound will help us visualize your organs and look for any abnormalities – gallstones, cysts, or any changes in the liver’s structure. As for cost, Medicare should cover the majority of these tests, but there may be a small co-pay, depending on your specific plan. Our billing department can confirm that for you. I’ll write up the orders now, and then the nurse will come in and draw the blood. The ultrasound can be scheduled for later this week, probably on Thursday. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Thursday sounds fine, yes. I can rearrange my schedule. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It makes me feel a bit better, knowing what to expect. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. My daughter always says I don't explain things properly to doctors, so I'm glad you're patient with me. Now, about this nurse… will they be gentle with the needle? I bruise easily, you know. And I faint sometimes, if I get too nervous. Just… a warning.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Kelder. We'll make sure the nurse is aware of your concerns. They are very experienced and gentle, and they'll take extra care. And yes, we’ll definitely have you lie down during the blood draw, just in case. It’s always better to be safe. We'll monitor you closely throughout the process. Here are the orders for the blood work. The nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to get you started. She’ll explain everything to you again and answer any questions you may have. Don’t hesitate to let her know if you feel faint or uncomfortable at any time. And please, don’t worry. We’ll take good care of you. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with before Sarah arrives?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Nestingen. You’ve been very kind and patient with an old lady like me. I feel a little bit better now, knowing we’re getting things sorted out. I’m still a bit anxious, but… it’s a manageable anxiety, I suppose. Just… tell Sarah to be gentle, will you? That's all I ask. I suppose I’ll just sit here and wait for her then.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kelder. I’ll let Sarah know. And I’ll be right outside if you need anything at all. Just call my name. Try to relax, and remember, we're here to help.
