DOCTOR: Alright, Lacreasha Thut, 40 years old. Good. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um... my nails. They look... funny. Not good funny. Just... funny. I don't remember exactly what's wrong, but they're different. They always look okay before, and now... not okay. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: "Different." Right. Well, that's... descriptive. Different how, exactly?
PATIENT: Ugh. Look, I'm not a doctor, okay? I just know they're... kinda discolored. And one of 'em feels... loose. Like it could fall off. I don't know! That's why I'm here. You're supposed to know this stuff. They weren't like this last week, I think. Maybe two weeks. It's hard to remember. I don't pay attention to nails. Who does that?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get frustrated. Discolored and feeling loose... that's something we can work with. Let’s try to be a little more precise, if you can. What color are they discolored to?
PATIENT: Hmm... like... yellowish? Maybe brownish? It's not bright, not like a polish or anything. Just... not skin colored. And kinda thick, I guess. I haven't been doing dishes lately, so it's not from that. I swear. It just... happened. I don’t know why they changed! I just noticed it when I was putting on lotion this morning. It's really bothering me, though.
DOCTOR: Yellowish, brownish, thicker... and it happened over the last two weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. Maybe a little longer. Time all blurs together, you know? It definitely wasn't like this when I went to my sister’s last month. She would have said something. She notices everything. Always has. So, not that long ago. A few weeks, at most. And it’s just…weird. They never do this. It's like they’re…sick. Can nails get sick?
DOCTOR: Nails can be affected by various things, yes. It's usually a sign of something else going on, though. Before we jump to conclusions, let's go through a bit more. Have you noticed any changes anywhere else?
PATIENT: Changes? Like…what kind of changes? My hair's the same. I haven't gotten a perm in years. And my weight…well, it’s always the same. I try to eat healthy. Mostly. I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? Oh! My skin’s been kinda dry, I guess. But that's the weather. It's really dry out here. I don’t know what you want me to say. Everything’s mostly normal. It’s just the nails! Why are you asking about all this other stuff? It's not helping.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Lacreasha. Changes in nails can sometimes be an indicator of systemic issues – things going on inside the body. Dry skin could be related, for instance. Do you have any joint pain?
PATIENT: Joint pain? No! I mean… sometimes my knees creak a little when I get up, but that’s just…old age! I’m not that old, but 40 isn't exactly spring chicken, is it? Everyone gets creaky joints. It's normal! I don't have pain pain, just…creaking. And it's not all the time. Honestly, I think you're making a big deal out of nothing. It's probably just a fungus. Can you just give me something for a fungus? My friend Brenda had a toenail fungus once, and she just used some cream and it went away. Is that what I need?
DOCTOR: While a fungal infection is possible, it's premature to self-diagnose, Lacreasha. We need to rule out other potential causes. Have you noticed any changes to your breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? What kind of changes? I breathe! Everyone breathes! I haven’t been coughing or anything. I mean… sometimes I get a little winded when I climb the stairs, but I’m not exactly a marathon runner, you know? It’s probably just…out of shape. I used to walk more, but the weather's been bad. And my sister’s always telling me to lose weight. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. I came here about my nails. Can we just look at the nails? I don't think my lungs are involved. It’s a waste of time asking all these questions! It’s just a nail problem!
DOCTOR: Alright. Fine. Let's have a look. If you’ll sit, I’ll examine your nails. But understand that I'm still gathering information, and I'll need to ask more questions if anything unusual presents itself.
PATIENT: Finally! Yes, okay, good. Just look at them. They're awful. See? See how funny they look? And one of them feels all…loose. It's this one. Don't you think it looks weird? Just fix it, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your nails do show some discoloration, as you’ve noted – yellowish-brownish hue, particularly on this one. There's thickening present, and I can see some slight separation of the nail plate from the nail bed – what you described as “loose.” The texture is also somewhat brittle. I don't see any inflammation around the nail folds currently, but there is some subtle ridging. I also notice some minor pitting. It does appear more significant on this nail, but there are changes present on several others. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or topical creams?
PATIENT: Allergies? Um… not that I know of. I used to get hives when I was little, but that was a long time ago. And I'm pretty sure it was strawberries. I don't eat a lot of strawberries. Maybe I had a reaction to a perfume once, but I can't remember. Honestly, I don't really pay attention to that stuff. I just try not to get rashes. Does it matter? It's just my nails! What do allergies have to do with nails? Is something wrong? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It’s always important to rule things out, Lacreasha. A reaction to something topical could be contributing. Based on what I'm seeing, the changes in your nails could be a number of things. It could be a fungal infection – onychomycosis – but the pitting and ridging suggest other possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I recommend sending a nail sample to the lab for a fungal culture. We'll also do a blood test to check for some common conditions that can affect nail health – things like thyroid issues and vitamin deficiencies. It’s better to be thorough. Do you have any objection to those tests?
PATIENT: Tests? Blood tests? Oh, great. More tests. This is getting ridiculous. I just wanted something for my nails. Why do I need a blood test? What does my blood have to do with my nails? Honestly, I don’t like needles. And I hate waiting for test results. It's going to be ages, isn't it? And then you'll probably tell me I need to eat healthier and lose weight. I already know that! Is there anything you can do right now? Like, just give me a cream or something? It can’t hurt, can it?
DOCTOR: Lacreasha, I understand your frustration, but I'm trying to provide you with the best possible care. Simply prescribing a cream without knowing the underlying cause could mask a more serious condition. For example, certain types of nail changes can be associated with psoriasis, thyroid problems, even anemia. While I can appreciate you don't want needles or tests, without more information, it’s impossible to give you a safe and effective treatment plan. The blood test is to rule out systemic causes and help guide appropriate management. The fungal culture will confirm or rule out a fungal infection. I understand your aversion to needles, and we can discuss strategies to make it as comfortable as possible. The lab results typically take 5-7 business days. Until then, I can recommend keeping your nails short and dry to minimize the risk of further infection, and avoid harsh chemicals or polishes. Are you willing to proceed with the blood test and fungal culture?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But I'm telling you, it’s going to be nothing. Just a fungus. Probably. And I'm not paying for all this if it is just a fungus. I have Medicare. I swear, if this is a waste of time and money… Just get it over with. Where do I go for the blood work? And how long is this going to take? I have an appointment with my sister on Friday… This is such a hassle…
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the requisition for the blood work and nail sample. You can go to the lab located at 123 Main Street – it's a five-minute drive from here. They're open until 5 PM today. The blood draw shouldn't take more than 15 minutes, and the nail sample collection is quick and painless. Medicare will cover the necessary testing. They’ll bill you for any copay that is required. The lab will send the results directly to my office. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the results and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, try to relax and avoid any activities that could further irritate your nails. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Two weeks?! That's ages! Okay, fine. Just two weeks. And I hope they're gentle with the needle. I hate needles. Is there anything else I need to do? Like, should I fast before the blood work? Or wear special clothes? I'm terrible at remembering things like that… Just tell me everything I need to know, please. I don’t want to have to come back again. It's already a hassle enough…
DOCTOR: You do not need to fast for the blood work. Wear comfortable clothes that allow easy access to your arms. It’s best to drink plenty of water before your appointment. The only other thing is to avoid applying any nail polish or creams to the affected nails for the next 24 hours, as it could interfere with the fungal culture. And please, try not to stress. We’re just gathering information. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Just… no polish or cream. And drink water. Okay. I’m going to go do this now. Hopefully it’s nothing. This has been… a lot. I just wanted something for my nails…
