DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… Octavis, was it? Yes. Well, it’s about a letter. A letter for my… friend’s dog. A pet ownership letter, that’s what they called it. Honestly, all this paperwork these days is just… much. I just need something signed so he can… well, so he can go places with her. Do you do those?
DOCTOR: Yes, Octavis is correct. A pet ownership letter, certainly. We do those, though I do need to examine the dog to verify its health status and ensure it’s up-to-date on vaccinations. It's standard practice, and it helps ensure the safety of everyone involved. Do you have your friend’s dog with you today, Ms. Wrye?
PATIENT: Oh, examine the dog? Really? Honestly, I didn’t think it would be that involved. It’s just a little chihuahua. Very well-behaved, mostly. No, I don’t have him with me. He's… at home. With my friend. I figured I could just, you know, tell you about him. His name is… what was his name again? Little… something. Oh dear. He's a tiny thing, though. Very tiny. Are you sure you need to see him? It’s a bit of a drive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the drive, Ms. Wrye. However, verifying the dog’s health is important for a few reasons. It ensures he’s healthy enough to travel and interact in public spaces, and it also allows me to document his vaccination status, which may be required by certain establishments or for travel purposes. Perhaps you could tell me a little bit more about him, and then we can discuss whether a full examination is absolutely necessary. Do you recall his name?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It's just… things happen, you know? People, life… It's all a bit blurry. His name… it starts with a ‘P’, I think. Percy? No, that doesn’t sound right. Phillip? Oh, honestly, I wish I could remember! He’s very small, very fluffy, and… well, he likes treats. Does that help? He's been vaccinated… I think so. My friend handles most of that. She's very responsible, that one. Much more organized than me, definitely. Is there a form I can fill out with what I do remember? This is all a bit… stressful.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to not remember every detail, Ms. Wrye. Memory can be tricky. We can work with what you do recall. Let’s focus on what you're certain of. You mentioned he’s small and fluffy, and your friend is responsible for his vaccinations. That’s good to know. To start, do you know approximately when he last received a rabies vaccination?
PATIENT: Rabies… Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Honestly, I have no idea. My friend probably has a record of it somewhere. She’s very meticulous with these things, always keeping everything in order. I just… bring the dog sometimes. To visit. Or maybe not. It's all a bit… hazy. Look, is this something she needs to come in for? Because I really don't think I can give you the information you need. She’s the pet owner, really. I’m just… a friend. A helpful friend. But not a knowledgeable one, apparently.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like your friend is the primary caretaker and has the most accurate information regarding the dog’s medical history. In that case, it would be best for her to come in for an examination. That way, we can ensure the dog is healthy and up-to-date on all necessary vaccinations. Would you like me to schedule an appointment for her?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful. Honestly, it’s probably for the best. She'll have all the details. What days do you have available? And… could you remind me where exactly this clinic is? I think I drove past a gas station to get here… but I get so turned around. Rural, you said? Everything looks the same when you’re driving, honestly. A lot of trees. A lot of fields. It’s all very… green.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let me see… we have availability on Thursday afternoon at 2:00 PM or Friday morning at 9:30 AM. As for the location, we are located at 123 Main Street, just off Highway 10. You mentioned a gas station – there's a Quick Stop about half a mile before the clinic on Highway 10. It's a rural area, as you noted, so cell service can be spotty. Here's a map with the directions, and the address and phone number are also listed. Would either of those times work for your friend?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, thank you. A map is perfect! Thursday afternoon sounds good, I think. Yes, 2:00 PM. She'll be able to make it then. She's a very punctual person. Unlike me, naturally. Let me see… do I need to pay anything now? Or is it just for the appointment? Oh, and tell me, Doctor… is it okay if I just… bring the dog next time? She’s a bit nervous around strangers, my friend, and I'm sure he gets anxious too. He's very small, you know. Wouldn’t want to scare him.
DOCTOR: Perfect, Thursday at 2:00 PM it is. There is a standard examination fee of $85, which you can pay at the front desk when you check in. As for bringing the dog, absolutely. It's always best to have the patient present for a thorough examination. Just let the front desk know when you arrive that your friend is bringing her chihuahua for a pet ownership letter and a general health check. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your patience, Doctor. Honestly, you’ve been very understanding. It's just… things slip my mind, you know? I best be going. She'll be expecting me. And thank you again for the map. I’m terrible with directions.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wrye. It was my pleasure. Don’t worry about the directions, and please, if you have any questions before your friend’s appointment, don’t hesitate to call. Have a good day, and we’ll see you on Thursday.
