DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Carlotta, let’s get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh… hello Doctor. My wife… she want… baby. We old, you know? I make small things with metal. She say maybe… need help for baby? I not sure. Long time… since last baby.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you and your wife are… attempting to conceive?
PATIENT: Yes. Attempt… is good word. We try… not much happen. She worry. I worry too, but… I not understand all this. Is… complicated. She say something about… planning? Before?
DOCTOR: Planning, yes. Well, at your age… it’s… less about planning and more about… the possibility of it happening. How old is your wife, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… she… older than me, I think. Maybe… sixty-five? Sixty-eight? Something like that. I not good with numbers. We been married a long time. A very long time. She always remember things… I forget.
DOCTOR: Sixty-eight… right. And you're seventy. Okay. Have you had any children previously, either of you with other partners?
PATIENT: Yes. I have… two. Long ago. From before my wife. She… had one. But all grown up now. Very grown up. Not little babies anymore. It was… a long time ago, for both of us.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is your wife currently menstruating?
PATIENT: Menstru… what? Sorry, Doctor. I don’t… understand big words. Is she… bleeding? Every month? She does, yes. But… less now. Much less. She say it’s… normal for old ladies.
DOCTOR: Right, bleeding. Yes. And how often is “less”?
PATIENT: Uh… not every month. Maybe… every two months? Three? I not sure. She keep track… I just know it's not… regular like before. She get tired easy now too. She worry about… if baby is strong.
DOCTOR: Okay. Has she had any medical problems recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… she get pain in her legs sometimes. And she… forget things too, like me. But… she say it's just old age. She see doctor for legs, but… I don’t remember what he say. Something about… water? She take pills for it.
DOCTOR: Pills for… water?
PATIENT: Yes. For the… swelling. In her legs. The doctor say it’s… important to take pills. She drink them every day. And she… sometimes get dizzy. But not often. Mostly when she stand up too fast. She try to be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any medical problems, Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: Me? Not much. I get a little tired when I work with the metal. My hands… they get stiff sometimes. And my back… aches. But… that's just from bending over all day. I take some pills for it too. Like my wife, I take pills.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you both taking any other medications?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. She has… a little blue pill for her heart. The doctor gave it to her last year. And I… I take something for my… pressure? High pressure, the doctor say. It makes me… sleepy. I forget what color it is.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given your ages… and the fact that your wife hasn’t menstruated regularly in some time… conceiving naturally is… unlikely. There are… options. But they are complicated, expensive, and… frankly, at your age, carry significant risks. I recommend you both discuss this further. Perhaps… a geriatric specialist would be a better resource. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Risks? What kind of risks? For baby? For my wife? I… I don’t understand. We just want… a little baby. Is there… anything simple? Anything… not too much trouble? I not want to cause trouble.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Carlotta, at your ages, pregnancy carries a very high risk of complications for both your wife and the baby. Things like gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, chromosomal abnormalities… the list goes on. Frankly, it’s a lot to consider. And “simple” options… don’t exist. I’m not comfortable pursuing this without a thorough evaluation by a specialist. I'm going to write you a referral. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: Chromos… what? I just… want a baby. My wife really wants a baby. We not have much time left, you know? Is there… no way to just… try? Maybe with some pills? Like we take now? We can pay… some money. Not much, but some.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, I understand you're hopeful. But attempting to conceive at your ages, even with medication, is irresponsible. It's putting your wife's health, and potentially the baby's health, at significant risk. I'm not going to participate in something that could be harmful. I’ve written the referral to Dr. Amina Mensah, a geriatric specialist. She can discuss your options in more detail. I’m finished here. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No… I think… that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. But… she will be sad. She really, really wanted a baby. Maybe… maybe we just talk to the specialist. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Right. Have a good day, Mr. Carlotta. .
PATIENT: .
