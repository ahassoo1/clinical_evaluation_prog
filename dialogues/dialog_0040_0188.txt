DOCTOR: Right, well… good morning. Criston, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Criston Secondi. Good morning to you too. I have… a problem with my water. It's orange.
DOCTOR: Orange?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… the color of an orange fruit. Not all the time, but… most of the last few days. It worries my wife.
DOCTOR: Thirty-six… alright. And it’s most of the last few days?
PATIENT: Yes, maybe… four days? Sometimes it looks normal, then sometimes very orange. I drink… water, you know? And tea. Not much else. I don’t… do anything special.
DOCTOR: “Do anything special?
PATIENT: I mean… no strange foods. No medicines. Just… normal things. Work, home, tea. My wife thinks it’s something bad, but I feel okay. No pain, no… nothing. Just the color. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Look, I’ve seen… things. Usually, it's dehydration. Are you sweating a lot?
PATIENT: Sweating? Yes, a little. I work outside, sometimes. Building things. It’s been hot, you know? But I drink water all day. I try to, anyway. Is that… enough? Maybe I need to drink more water?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick look. Hop up on the exam table, please. I need to check your hydration levels and listen to your… everything. Don't make this difficult.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. No problem. I am not good at… medical things.
DOCTOR: Chest sounds clear. Abdomen… soft. Blood pressure is 130 over 85, pulse 78. Not terrible. You’re a big man, you’re probably just a little dehydrated. But we need to rule things out. I’m going to order a urinalysis. Just standard procedure. It’ll check for infection, blood… the usual.
PATIENT: Okay, yes. That sounds… good. Infection? I don’t feel sick. But, okay, a check is good. So… I give a water sample? How much? And… where do I do that?
DOCTOR: There’s a bathroom right there. The nurse will give you a cup. Standard procedure, really. And yes, enough to fill the cup. Don’t make a mess. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they’re ready. Don’t bother calling unless you develop a fever or… actual pain. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, clear. Fever or pain. Okay. How long… usually, for the results? Just… so my wife knows. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Hours. Maybe a day. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea. It depends on the lab. Just… don’t stress about it. It’s probably nothing. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients.
PATIENT: Okay. Hours. Thank you, Doctor. I… I will go do the water sample now. .
