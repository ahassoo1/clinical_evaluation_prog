DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my bruising. It's been getting worse, even though I’m already on blood thinners. It's a bit worrying, to be honest. I don’t want to end up in the hospital, you know?
DOCTOR: Blood thinners, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Warfarin. I’ve been on it for… oh, let me think… about six years now. My regular doctor prescribed it after a blood clot in my leg. He’s good, but he’s been out of town for a week, and this bruising just kept getting worse, so I thought I’d come see someone while I could. It’s just… a lot more than usual.
DOCTOR: Six years is a considerable time on Warfarin. And you're saying the bruising is newly increased, despite consistent dosage?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. I haven’t changed anything about my pills, I swear. Same time, same dose, everything. But I bumped my arm yesterday – just a little bump against the doorframe – and it turned purple almost immediately. Normally it would just be a little sore, maybe a tiny bit of color, but this… it’s like I’m a peach. Honestly, it’s a bit scary.
DOCTOR: “Peach,” you say. Right. Well, easy bruising can be a side effect of Warfarin, of course. We'll need to rule out other causes, though. Let's start with a thorough medication review. Besides the Warfarin, are you taking anything else?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I take a multivitamin, sometimes. And I’ve been taking some ibuprofen for my back pain. It’s just over-the-counter stuff, you know? Nothing fancy. Oh! And occasionally, a sleep aid when I can’t get to sleep. It's just melatonin, though, a small dose. Is that… is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen and melatonin… both can potentially interact with Warfarin and affect its efficacy. Over-the-counter doesn’t mean harmless, Ms. Hainley. Now, tell me about your back pain. When did it start?
PATIENT: It started a few weeks ago, just a little ache. I think I slept wrong, maybe? It comes and goes, nothing major. I usually take two ibuprofen when it’s bad, maybe three if I’ve been on my feet a lot. I didn’t realize that could mess with the blood thinner! I just thought it was good for the pain. I don’t take it every day, only when I really need to. Honestly, I just wanted to get through gardening season, you know?
DOCTOR: Gardening, of course. Well, let's move on. Any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that’s it. And I'm allergic to penicillin, if that matters. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, usually. I try to eat well, and I walk every day when the weather is nice. Is this going to be a long appointment? I have a lunch date with my cousin later.
DOCTOR: We’ll be as efficient as possible, Ms. Hainley. Penicillin allergy noted. Now, family history. Any bleeding disorders in your family?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. My mom had high blood pressure, and my dad had diabetes, but no bleeding problems. My grandparents… I don’t really know much about their health, to be honest. They passed away a long time ago. My cousin’s side… I haven’t really asked. Is that important? I really don’t know much about their medical stuff.
DOCTOR: It's good to be aware. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I need to assess the bruising and check for any other signs of bleeding. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m not very flexible these days.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, quite extensive bruising, even with minimal trauma, as you described. Palpation reveals some tenderness, but no signs of compartment syndrome. Capillary refill is normal. Let me check your lower extremities as well. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: No, that’s okay. Just a little cold. That’s… that’s all. Honestly, Doctor, is it the ibuprofen? Should I just stop taking that altogether? I really don't want to end up in the hospital. It's just, I've got a lot going on, you know?
DOCTOR: The ibuprofen is a likely contributor, yes. And I understand you have commitments. However, we need to be thorough. I’m going to order a PT/INR test to check your Warfarin levels. Also, a complete blood count to rule out other causes of bleeding. Do you have any dietary restrictions or allergies to latex that I should be aware of before we draw blood?
PATIENT: No dietary restrictions, and no latex allergy. I eat pretty much everything. Okay, good. Blood test sounds… fine. When will I get the results? And can you just tell me, straight up, if it’s serious? I don’t want to be kept in the dark. I have a lunch date with my cousin later, you know? I don't want to cancel it if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: The lab results should be available within a few hours. I will review them as soon as they are ready and contact you directly. As for “serious,” we won’t know until we have the results. But, to reiterate, the ibuprofen is a definite concern, and I strongly advise you to discontinue its use immediately. In the meantime, if you experience any excessive bleeding, severe pain, dizziness, or weakness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No ibuprofen, and watch for bleeding. And call if anything gets worse. Okay. That’s… helpful. So, can I go now? I really need to get going if I’m going to make my lunch date. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Yes, you may go. The nurse will provide you with the lab order. I will be in touch as soon as the results are available. And Ms. Hainley, please, try to be more forthcoming with your medication list in the future. It simplifies things considerably. .
