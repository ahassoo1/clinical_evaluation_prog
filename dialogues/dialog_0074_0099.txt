DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, to be frank, I received some results back from a test… an examination of my insides, I believe they called it, and the findings weren’t quite what I was hoping for. They said it was… abnormal. I’m a bit worried, naturally, and wanted to understand what that means.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Minatra. “Abnormal” can certainly be a worrying word. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me which test you’re referring to, and if you happen to recall what specifically was flagged as abnormal?
PATIENT: Certainly. It was a GI Endo Test, performed just last week, on July 26th, I believe. The paperwork… let me see… Ah, here we are. It states here… “Evidence of unusual cells detected in the lower digestive tract.” That’s the part that concerns me, Doctor. I don’t understand what “unusual cells” means, and the doctor who ordered the test simply said I needed a follow-up with an internal medicine specialist – that is you, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Thank you for bringing those in. “Unusual cells” is a rather broad term, and it’s good you’re seeking clarification. It often means cells were identified that don’t quite look like the normal cells in your digestive tract. This doesn’t automatically mean anything serious, but it does warrant further investigation to determine the cause. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. I’ve always been quite healthy, truth be told. I’ve had the usual aches and pains of getting older, of course – a bit of arthritis in my knees, nothing too debilitating. But no diagnosed conditions of that sort. My late husband, bless his soul, he had some heart trouble later in life, but I myself have always been rather robust. I eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables, and I try to stay active. I walk in the park most mornings, weather permitting, of course. Is that helpful information, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Minatra, thank you. Knowing you’ve generally been healthy is important. And staying active and eating well are wonderful habits. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than routine care?
PATIENT: No, not really. When I was quite young, perhaps eight years old, I had my tonsils removed. But that was… well, a very long time ago. And besides that, no. No hospital stays, no surgeries. Just the yearly check-ups and the occasional visit to the doctor for a cold or the flu. I pride myself on avoiding illness when I can. I always thought a strong constitution was the best medicine.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. A strong constitution certainly goes a long way. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My mother… she lived a long life, into her nineties, but she struggled with high blood pressure in her later years. My father, he passed away relatively young, in his sixties, from a heart attack, I believe. And as for siblings… I had two brothers, but sadly, both have passed away. One succumbed to diabetes, and the other, a tragic accident, quite a few years ago. As for cancer, thankfully, no one in my immediate family has had a diagnosis, to my knowledge. It’s a frightening illness.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Minatra. It’s helpful to have that information. Knowing about your family history of heart disease and diabetes is important. And it's good to know there hasn't been a history of cancer in your immediate family. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not to foods, not to medications, not to anything, thankfully. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. I can enjoy a wide variety of foods, and I’ve never had a reaction to any prescription I've been given. It’s one less thing to worry about, certainly. I suppose I’ve been blessed with a relatively uncomplicated constitution.
DOCTOR: That is wonderful, Ms. Minatra. No known allergies certainly simplifies things. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I truly avoid medications when I can. I might take an aspirin now and again for a headache, but that’s the extent of it. I believe in letting my body heal itself whenever possible. I occasionally take a Vitamin D supplement in the winter months, as I don't get out in the sun as much, but otherwise, nothing. I prefer herbal teas and a good night's sleep, if you don’t mind. Is that unusual, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Minatra. It's perfectly reasonable to prioritize natural remedies and minimize medication use when appropriate. Now, let's discuss your current symptoms. Besides the concerning findings on the GI Endo Test, are you experiencing any abdominal pain, changes in your bowel habits, rectal bleeding, fatigue, or unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Well… that’s a good question, Doctor. I haven’t experienced any rectal bleeding, thankfully. And my weight has remained stable. As for fatigue, I do tire more easily than I used to, but I attribute that to my age, you understand. But… …I have been experiencing some discomfort in my abdomen, yes. Not a sharp pain, more of a… a dull ache, really. And my bowel habits have changed somewhat. I've been… more irregular, you see. Sometimes constipated, sometimes… the opposite. It’s not been constant, though. It comes and goes. I hadn't thought much of it, to be honest, just chalked it up to… well, getting older. Is that significant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That is significant, Ms. Minatra, and I'm glad you brought that up. Abdominal discomfort and changes in bowel habits, even if intermittent, are certainly reasons to investigate further, especially in the context of the abnormal findings on the GI Endo Test. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the abdominal discomfort in more detail?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s mostly located in the lower abdomen, sort of… in the general area of my intestines, I suppose. It’s not a cramping pain, more of a… a constant pressure, really. It’s not excruciating, I can still go about my daily activities, but it’s… unsettling. It’s worse after I eat, usually. And it seems to fluctuate throughout the day. Some hours it’s barely noticeable, other times it’s… more prominent. It’s difficult to describe, Doctor. It’s not a pain that comes and goes suddenly. It’s more… a persistent feeling of discomfort, a sort of… fullness, even when I haven’t eaten much. And sometimes, it feels… bloated. Like I’m carrying extra weight in my abdomen, even though I haven’t gained any. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Minatra. It sounds like you’ve described a fairly classic presentation. Now, let's proceed with a physical examination. I’d like to listen to your abdomen, and gently palpate it to check for any tenderness or masses. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment completely. Please, proceed. I’m ready when you are. It's just… the unknown is always the most unsettling part, isn't it? But I’m glad we’re getting to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Please lie back on the examination table if you'd be more comfortable. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds, though they are slightly sluggish. I am noting some mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant, but no palpable masses. No significant guarding or rebound tenderness. Overall, the examination is within normal limits, although the mild tenderness warrants further investigation. Given your symptoms and the results of the GI Endo Test, I would like to order a colonoscopy. It will allow us to visualize the entire colon and take biopsies of any abnormal areas. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… yes, I’ve heard of those. It sounds… thorough. If you believe it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, absolutely. I want to get to the bottom of this, as you say. It’s unsettling living with this uncertainty. What does it entail, exactly? And… is it painful? I’ve heard stories… And what if they do find something? I suppose I should be prepared for any eventuality.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Ms. Minatra, and it's good you're asking. A colonoscopy involves inserting a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your rectum to visualize the entire colon. It's typically performed with sedation, so you shouldn't feel any pain during the procedure. You will likely feel some pressure or cramping, similar to a bowel movement, but it shouldn't be severe. As for what if we do find something, that's something we'll discuss in detail if and when we have results. It's important to remember that finding something isn't necessarily a worst-case scenario. Often, it's a polyp that can be removed during the procedure. Polyps are common and often benign, but they can sometimes develop into cancer over time, which is why removing them is important. We will send the removed tissue to a lab for analysis, and we'll discuss the results with you in detail. I will also refer you to a gastroenterologist to perform the colonoscopy, as they are specialists in this area. Do you have any other questions about the colonoscopy or the process?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly, Doctor. The sedation is a relief to hear, truthfully. And knowing it’s often just a polyp… that eases my mind considerably. The referral to a gastroenterologist… that sounds sensible. Are there any particular ones you recommend? And what about the preparation? I've heard… unpleasant stories about the cleansing process. I apologize for asking so many questions, Doctor, but I prefer to be prepared for everything. It’s just… this is all a bit overwhelming, naturally.
DOCTOR: You're not at all asking too many questions, Ms. Minatra. It's perfectly normal to be anxious and want to be prepared, especially when facing a medical procedure. I recommend Dr. Eleanor Vance. She's an excellent gastroenterologist and has a very compassionate bedside manner. I will send the referral electronically to her office. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. As for the preparation… yes, the bowel preparation isn't the most pleasant part of the procedure, I won't lie. It involves drinking a large volume of a special liquid to cleanse your colon completely. However, it's crucial for ensuring a clear view during the colonoscopy. Dr. Vance’s office will provide you with detailed instructions and can discuss options to make it more tolerable. They may suggest splitting the dose or using different types of preparation depending on your medical history. I will also provide you with a written summary of our discussion today, including the referral information and the colonoscopy preparation guidelines. For now, let’s focus on scheduling the appointment with Dr. Vance. Do you have any preference for days or times?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you, Doctor. Dr. Vance sounds excellent, and I appreciate you providing the referral and the written summary. The split dose option is… encouraging, naturally. …I’m fairly flexible, truthfully. Weekdays are preferable, if possible. I have a book club meeting on Tuesday evenings, and I volunteer at the local library on Thursday afternoons. Otherwise, I’m fairly open. Perhaps sometime next week, if that’s feasible? I understand Dr. Vance is likely very busy. I’m happy to work around her schedule.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I see Dr. Vance has an opening next Wednesday afternoon at 2:30 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Wednesday afternoon at 2:30 PM… yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you for arranging that so efficiently. I believe that covers everything, then. I’m truly grateful for your time and your patience, Doctor Reisig. You’ve alleviated a great deal of my anxiety. I feel much more prepared now, and I’m confident Dr. Vance will provide excellent care. Is there anything else I should do before my appointment with Dr. Vance? Any paperwork I should bring? Or medications I should stop taking?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Minatra. I'm glad I could help ease your anxiety. Dr. Vance's office will contact you with any specific instructions regarding paperwork or medications. However, it's generally a good idea to bring a list of all your current medications, including over-the-counter medications and supplements, and any relevant medical history. If you take any blood thinners, you may need to temporarily stop taking them before the colonoscopy, but Dr. Vance's office will advise you on this. Otherwise, just focus on staying hydrated and following their preparation instructions. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Minatra. I wish you all the best with your appointment, and please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any further questions.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor Reisig. Thank you again for your kindness and your thoroughness. I will certainly contact your office if I have any concerns. Have a wonderful day. .
