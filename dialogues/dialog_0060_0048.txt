DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… these little spells, I guess you’d call them. My wife, she’s been saying I’ve been… not myself lately. Forgetful, she says. Though I don't forget things, usually. It’s just… moments. Like I’m looking at something and… well, I don’t quite know where I am for a bit. It’s unsettling, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes, I can imagine. “Moments,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Not all the time, mind you. It’s not like I’m wandering off or anything. It’s more… a blankness. Like the TV is static for a few seconds. Then it clears up. Happens mostly at home, I think. Though I was at the market last week and… well, I couldn’t remember why I was even in the produce section for a minute. My wife had to remind me we needed tomatoes. She thinks it's getting worse, honestly. And she worries.
DOCTOR: Tomatoes, right. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… a few months, I suppose. Maybe six? It started small, just little things. Misplacing my glasses, forgetting what I went into the shed for. Things an old man forgets, you know? But it's... more frequent now. And longer. These spells. Last time, I think I was staring at the wall for a good five minutes before I realized where I was. It's… degrading, frankly. A man should be able to keep his wits about him.
DOCTOR: Degrading, yes, I understand. And are these spells accompanied by anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else? Like… what do you mean? No, not really. No dizziness, no headaches. Just… the blankness. Sometimes I feel a little… confused afterward, like I've woken up from a nap. But no pain, no shaking, nothing like that. My wife keeps asking if I'm getting enough sleep, but I sleep just fine. Always have. She worries too much, that woman. Though… she did say I was muttering something the other day when I was in one of these… episodes. Didn't know what I was saying, apparently.
DOCTOR: Muttering, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. She couldn't make out the words, just… sounds. Nonsense, I suppose. I certainly don’t mean to be muttering. It’s just… when I come out of it, I don't recall a thing. Like a piece of the day is missing. It’s unsettling, Doctor. Really unsettling. And it's happening more and more. She's been talking about assisted living, can you believe it? I still work three days a week setting tile! Perfectly capable, I am.
DOCTOR: Setting tile, you said?
PATIENT: Yes! Three days a week. Hard work, mind you, but keeps me active. Keeps the mind sharp. It's not like I’m sitting around doing nothing. I’m a craftsman, Doctor. Been setting tile for… well, for longer than you’ve probably been alive! It's… it's a point of pride. And I can still do it, perfectly well. I just… these spells make my wife nervous, and when she’s nervous, everything gets blown out of proportion. She thinks I’m losing it, but I’m not!
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Lason, it’s good you're still active. But these episodes, even if they're brief, are concerning. And your wife is right to be cautious. Let’s do a quick neurological exam, just to get a baseline. It won’t be anything drastic, just checking your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Then we’ll look at your medical history, see if anything stands out. Have you had any recent illnesses or injuries?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Nothing much. A little cold last winter, but that’s it. No injuries, no falls, nothing like that. I'm a careful man. Always have been. Medical history… well, I had my gallbladder taken out twenty years ago, but that was a clean operation. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but I take a little pill for it every day. That’s it, really. Nothing major. Honestly, I eat well, I stay active, and I sleep fine. I don’t understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gallbladder twenty years ago, high blood pressure managed with medication… good. Let's start with some basic balance and coordination tests. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Fine. Balance, is it? I suppose that’s fair enough. Though I’m telling you, Doctor, I’m perfectly steady on my feet. Just a little slow getting up these days, that's all. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, age has its effects on us all. Now, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and extend your arms out to the sides. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Close my eyes? Seems a bit… unnecessary, but alright. There. What now? I can feel my balance is perfectly fine. This isn't going to tell you anything useful. I can tell you right now, it's just a little… absentmindedness.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to gently push your arms down. Try to resist my force. Just hold them steady. Don't strain yourself.
PATIENT: There! See? Weakness, you say? That's just… old man strength, Doctor. I don't lift heavy things anymore, you expect me to be as strong as a twenty-year-old? This is ridiculous. I'm a tile setter, not a weightlifter.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I understand your frustration. However, these tests aren’t about your strength as a tile setter. They’re about assessing your neurological function. The weakness, combined with the instability and the reports of muttering and these “episodes”, is concerning. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and I think an MRI of the brain would be prudent. It’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. A little sniffle when the pollen is bad, but that’s all. MRI, you say? That sounds… expensive. And unnecessary, if you ask me. I'm telling you, Doctor, it's just a little absentmindedness! My wife worries too much, and now you're getting involved. What exactly are you looking for with this MRI? It sounds like you think I'm losing my mind.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your concerns. I am not suggesting you are "losing your mind," as you put it. However, these symptoms warrant investigation to rule out serious causes. An MRI allows us to visualize the brain and identify any structural abnormalities, such as small strokes, tumors, or other issues that could be contributing to these episodes. As for the cost, we can discuss payment options with the billing department. But I strongly advise against dismissing this without proper evaluation. Now, let’s talk about your medications. What exactly are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Fine. An MRI, then. But don't expect to find anything. As for my medication… it's a little white pill. The doctor gave it to me a few years back. I take one every morning with my breakfast. Don't remember the name, honestly. I just take it. My wife handles the refills. She’s the organized one, as I’ve already said. I’m a craftsman, Doctor, not a pharmacist!
DOCTOR: Right. A little white pill for blood pressure… That’s not particularly helpful, Mr. Lason. Do you have any idea of the dosage?
PATIENT: Dosage? Honestly, no. It's a small pill. Round, I think. I just take it every morning. Really, Doctor, I don’t pay attention to these details. My wife brings me the pills. I swallow them. That’s the extent of my involvement. I’m more concerned with setting tile straight, not memorizing medication dosages. I'm starting to think you're making a big deal out of nothing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I appreciate your honesty, but without knowing the specific medication and dosage, it's difficult for me to assess your overall health accurately. Let me check your electronic health record. Perhaps we can find the information there. Ah, here we are. You're taking Lisinopril 20mg daily. Now, do you experience any side effects from this medication, like dizziness, fatigue, or cough?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… 20mg. Right. Dizziness? Sometimes, maybe. A little lightheaded when I stand up quickly, but I just chalk it up to getting old. Cough? No, not really. Though my wife says I snore a lot. Does that count? Honestly, Doctor, I don't pay much attention to these little things. I just want to know if these tests are going to take long. I have a job to get back to, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. The MRI will take approximately 30-45 minutes. We’ll need to schedule it with the radiology department. And I'm going to give you a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Given your symptoms—the episodes of blankness, the muttering, the slight instability, and the occasional dizziness—it's best to get a specialist's opinion. I’m also going to recommend that your wife accompany you to the neurologist appointment. It's helpful to have someone there to provide additional information and support. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A neurologist? More doctors? This is getting ridiculous. I just want to know what’s causing these little spells, not spend all day running from one specialist to another. And my wife… well, she’ll worry even more if I take her with me. She’s already convinced I’m on my last legs. Honestly, Doctor, I think I’m fine. Just a little forgetful, that’s all. Can't we just forget about the tests and the neurologist? I have a reputation to uphold, you know. People rely on me to do good work.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, with all due respect, dismissing these symptoms without proper investigation is not in your best interest. These episodes could be benign, but they could also indicate a more serious underlying issue. The neurological exam and the MRI are necessary to rule out potentially dangerous conditions like stroke, brain tumor, or early dementia. I understand your concerns about your reputation and your workload, but your health is paramount. I am recommending these tests not to alarm you, but to ensure you receive the appropriate care. I’m also suggesting your wife accompany you to the neurologist appointment because her observations can be invaluable. She has witnessed these episodes firsthand and can provide important details that you may not recall. I strongly advise you to reconsider your decision. I’m concerned about your well-being, and I believe a thorough evaluation is essential. We can discuss the scheduling options now. Would you like me to have my assistant contact you with available dates for the MRI and neurologist appointment?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, alright. Do what you have to do. But don't expect to find anything. It’s just… old age, that’s all. And yes, have your assistant contact us. My wife handles the schedule anyway. But I’m telling you, Doctor… this is a waste of time and money. And I have a job to get back to. I'm a tile setter, not a patient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I understand your reluctance, but I assure you, we’re taking these precautions to ensure your health and well-being. My assistant will contact you shortly to schedule the MRI and the neurology appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe headache, weakness on one side of your body, difficulty speaking, or changes in your vision – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No. No, I don’t think so. Just… get it over with. I have work to do, Doctor. And I need to get back to it. Hopefully, this won’t take too long. Thank you. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well. .
