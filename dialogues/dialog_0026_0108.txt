DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Latisia Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, don't bother with the pleasantries. I'm bleedin' internally, alright? Not here for a chat. It started a couple days ago, just thought it was somethin' I ate, but it ain’t stoppin'. And frankly, I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I understand you're concerned, and we’ll get right to it. “Bleeding internally” is certainly serious. Can you tell me a bit more about where you’re experiencing the bleeding, and what it looks like?
PATIENT: What do you mean, what does it look like? It's blood, Doc, red blood. What'd you expect, glitter? It's comin' out… well, you know. From down there. And it ain’t just a little bit. It's enough to worry a man, which is why I'm here, even though I really hate comin’ to doctors. It’s mostly when I… use the bathroom. And it smells… different. Worse than usual, if that makes any sense. It’s just… not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, red blood with your bowel movements, and a change in odor. That’s helpful, thank you. And this started a couple of days ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, two, maybe three days. Look, I keep pretty regular hours, if you catch my drift. I know my body, and this ain't normal. It's… persistent. And it's makin' me weak. I haven’t been eatin' much, either. Didn’t wanna risk makin’ it worse, you know? Frankly, I'm startin' to feel kinda dizzy. This better be somethin' you can fix, Doc. I got things to do. Things a man needs to do. No offense.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Mr. Gentz. We’ll do everything we can to figure this out. The dizziness is concerning, so I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just a listen to your abdomen, check your vitals… and a brief rectal exam, to get a better idea of what’s going on. It will give us more information, and help guide us to the appropriate next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Seriously? Look, I’m not thrilled about any of this, but you want to poke around there? I gotta ask, Doc, is that absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn’t you just… run some tests or somethin'? I'm a busy man, and that sounds highly unpleasant. And frankly, a little undignified. I'm not one for bein’ poked and prodded. Just sayin’. Can’t we skip that part?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Gentz, and I wouldn’t suggest anything unnecessarily. However, given your symptoms – the bleeding, the change in odor, and now the dizziness – a rectal exam is a crucial step in determining the source of the bleeding. It allows me to physically assess the area and look for any abnormalities. While blood tests and imaging can be helpful, they don’t always provide the complete picture. Skipping this step could delay an accurate diagnosis. It will only take a few moments, and I will explain everything as I go, to minimize any discomfort. We can discuss alternative approaches after the exam if you are still uncomfortable, but I strongly recommend it as a first step. Would you be willing to let me proceed?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, you're makin’ a real case for it, I'll give you that. But I still don't like it. Fine. Just… be quick about it, alright? And explain everything, like you said. I don’t want any surprises. And try to be gentle. Seriously. This is… not my idea of a good time. Just get it over with. But if I start feelin’ faint or somethin’, you stop immediately. Understand? This ain’t no game.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Gentz. I understand completely. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible, and I will explain everything as I go. I will also stop immediately if you feel uncomfortable or faint. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then, I will perform a brief rectal exam. I’ll be using a lubricated gloved finger to gently check for any tenderness, masses, or blood. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort at any point during the exam. Okay, your abdomen is slightly tender to the touch, primarily in the lower quadrants. Your bowel sounds are present, though a little sluggish. Now, if you could please lie on your left side with your knees drawn up towards your chest…
PATIENT: Alright, alright, get it over with. Just… don't dawdle. And try not to make it awkward, Doc. This is already bad enough. And don't go lookin' for anything you shouldn't be. I got no time for… whatever it is you're checkin' for. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz. I’m gently inserting a lubricated gloved finger now… I’m checking for any masses or tenderness… I do feel some stool present… and… there is some blood on my gloved finger. It appears to be dark, which suggests it’s coming from higher up in the colon. I don’t feel any obvious masses, but there is some tenderness when I press on the lower rectum. I'm also noting the tone of your anal sphincter. It seems to be normal. Okay, that’s all done. It was quick, I hope. What I’m feeling, coupled with your symptoms, suggests that there may be some inflammation or irritation in your colon or rectum. The dark blood indicates it's likely originating from higher up. It could be a number of things, such as diverticulitis, colitis, or even a polyp. To get a clearer picture, I recommend we order some blood tests, including a complete blood count and inflammatory markers. I also think a colonoscopy is necessary to visualize the colon directly and identify the source of the bleeding.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Seriously? You're tellin' me I gotta go through another procedure? Look, Doc, I ain't got time for this. I got a business to run, things to do. This is gettin' ridiculous. And what's with all these "maybes" and "could be's"? Can’t you just tell me what's wrong? And what does all this mean, anyway? Is this somethin' serious? Am I dyin'? Just give it to me straight, Doc, no fancy medical jargon. I need a straight answer, and I need it now. And frankly, I expect you to be able to give me one. What’s the worst-case scenario here?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, I understand your frustration. You’re right, you deserve a straight answer. Let’s break it down. The colonoscopy is important because it allows us to see what’s going on inside your colon, and that’s the only way to get a definitive diagnosis. Based on your symptoms and the initial exam, there are several possibilities. The dark blood suggests bleeding higher up in the colon. The tenderness could indicate inflammation, which could be due to diverticulitis – small pouches forming in the colon wall – or colitis, an inflammation of the colon itself. It could also be caused by polyps, which are growths in the colon. The worst-case scenario, although it’s not the most likely, would be colon cancer. That’s why it's so important to get this checked out quickly. The colonoscopy allows us to rule that out, or if it is present, to identify it early when it’s most treatable. I want to assure you, we’re taking this seriously, and we’re going to get to the bottom of it. The blood tests will give us a better understanding of your overall health and any inflammation present. Then, the colonoscopy will provide a clear picture of your colon. It’s important to remember that many of these conditions are treatable, especially when caught early. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Cancer? You're tellin' me… cancer? Just like that? Look, Doc, I ain’t ready to hear about cancer. I got things to do, people who need me. I can’t… I can’t be dealin' with that. What are the chances? Be honest with me. Is this somethin' I should be panickin' about? And this colonoscopy… what exactly does that involve? Is it gonna be painful? I need to know. I need a clear explanation, no sugarcoating. And what if… what if it is cancer? What happens then? Just lay it all out for me, Doc. The whole, ugly truth. Don't hold anything back. I deserve to know. And frankly, I need to know what I'm gettin' myself into. This is… this is a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed right now. Hearing the word “cancer” is frightening, and I apologize if I caused you undue alarm. I want to be clear: I am not saying you have cancer. I am saying that it’s one possibility we need to rule out, and the colonoscopy is the best way to do that. The chances of it being cancer depend on a variety of factors, including your age, family history, and the specific findings during the colonoscopy. I can't give you a percentage right now without more information. Let's talk about the colonoscopy itself. It involves inserting a long, flexible tube with a camera attached into your rectum to visualize the entire colon. Before the procedure, you’ll need to cleanse your colon completely, usually with a special liquid diet and laxatives. This is the least pleasant part, but it’s essential for a clear view. During the procedure, you’ll be sedated, so you won’t feel any pain. You might feel some pressure or cramping, but it shouldn’t be severe. The entire procedure usually takes about 30-60 minutes. If we find any polyps, we can remove them during the colonoscopy and send them to a lab for analysis. If the analysis reveals cancer, we will discuss treatment options with you, which could include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. We would also refer you to an oncologist – a cancer specialist – for further evaluation and care. It's important to remember that early detection is key with colon cancer. If we find it early, it's often very treatable. I understand this is a lot to take in. Do you want me to repeat any of that?
PATIENT: Surgery… chemotherapy… radiation… Just hearing those words makes me sick. Look, Doc, I ain’t a coward, but I ain’t lookin’ for a fight I can’t win. This is… this is too much. Is there… is there anything else we can do? Are there any other tests we can take? Anything to avoid… all of that? I just… I just don’t wanna go through all that. I got a life to live, things I wanna do. I can't just spend it in a hospital, gettin’ poked and prodded and… and poisoned. This is… this is a nightmare. What are the chances it’s somethin’ minor? Just… indigestion? Something I ate? Could it just… go away on its own? Just tell me there's a chance, Doc. Please. Just tell me there's a chance it’s not as bad as it seems. I need to hear somethin’ positive. Anything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling this way. Facing the possibility of serious illness is terrifying, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed and scared. I want to assure you that we will explore every possible option before making any decisions. While the colonoscopy is the most accurate way to determine the cause of your bleeding, we can start with some additional blood tests, including a fecal immunochemical test, or FIT, which checks for blood in your stool. This won't give us a definitive answer, but it can help us assess the urgency of the situation. As for the chance it's something minor, it is possible. Indigestion or a temporary inflammation can sometimes cause bleeding, but the fact that it’s been persistent and you're experiencing dizziness suggests we need to investigate further. The truth is, Mr. Gentz, I can't tell you for certain that it's not serious. But I can promise you that we will work together to get to the bottom of this, and we will develop a treatment plan that's right for you. If it is cancer, we will explore all available options, and we will provide you with the best possible care. I understand you’re not looking for a fight, and we won’t rush into anything. Let's start with the additional blood tests. I’ll also write you a referral to a gastroenterologist – a specialist in digestive health – for a second opinion. Then, we can discuss the next steps based on the results. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fine. Blood tests and a specialist. Whatever it takes. Just… get it over with. I don’t wanna drag this out any longer than I have to. And Doc… if it is bad… I need to know… what’s the survival rate? Just… give it to me straight. No sugarcoating. I need to know what I’m facin’. I know it’s probably not good, but I need to be prepared. And frankly… I need to know how long I have. Just… tell me. I deserve to know the truth, no matter how ugly it is. This is… this is a lot to take in, Doc. A lot. Just… please, don't sugarcoat it. I need to be realistic. I need to be prepared for the worst.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your need to know, and I respect that. However, providing you with a survival rate right now would be irresponsible and potentially misleading. Survival rates are based on averages and depend on many factors, including the stage of cancer, your overall health, the specific type of cancer, and the treatment you receive. Without knowing the specifics of your condition, any number I give you would be meaningless. It could cause unnecessary anxiety and fear. What I can tell you is that colon cancer is highly treatable, especially when detected early. With surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and advancements in targeted therapies, many people live long and full lives after a diagnosis. Right now, it's important to focus on getting a diagnosis. Once we have that, we can discuss your specific prognosis and treatment options. We will also connect you with resources and support groups to help you cope with the emotional and practical challenges of cancer. I understand this is difficult, and it's okay to feel scared and overwhelmed. But please remember, you are not alone. We will be with you every step of the way. I will order the blood tests now and write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly respected gastroenterologist in the area. She’ll be able to schedule a colonoscopy and provide you with a comprehensive evaluation. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. Just do what you gotta do. I… I need to be alone now. Just… let me go. I need some time to… process things. I don’t wanna talk anymore. Just… let me go, Doc. Please. This is… too much. I… I don’t know what to say. Just… leave me alone.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gentz. I understand. I will have the nurse escort you out, and we will contact you with the results of the blood tests as soon as they are available. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself. .
