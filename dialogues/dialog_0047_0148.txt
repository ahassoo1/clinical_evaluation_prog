DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepro. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Press. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having some pain… down there. It's… in the… the area with the… you know. I’m not quite sure how to explain it properly. It’s been going on for a little while now, but it’s gotten more noticeable recently.
DOCTOR: "Down there," is rather vague, Ms. Stepro. I understand it's uncomfortable to discuss, but to help you, I need specifics. Is it pain inside the vagina, pain on the outside?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You are right to ask for clarity. It’s… not inside, exactly. More… the sack. The… the skin around it. It’s… a dull ache, mostly, but sometimes it feels sharper. I hope that makes more sense. It’s just… I don’t usually talk about these things. I apologize for being so unclear.
DOCTOR: Right. The vulva, then. A dull ache, with occasional sharper pains. And how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s… hard to say exactly. A few weeks, perhaps? Maybe longer. Time… it slips my mind these days. It wasn’t… pressing. Not a concern right away. It just… gradually became more noticeable. Perhaps a month, give or take? I truly wish I could be more precise. I apologize again.
DOCTOR: A month, approximately. And has anything changed in the last month that might correlate with the onset or worsening of this pain?
PATIENT: Changed…? Hmm. That’s a good question. Let me see… I’ve been doing more work with the wood, certainly. Building some shelves for Mrs. Henderson, you know. It's rather physical, lifting and carrying… but I’ve always done physical work. Nothing different about it, I don’t think. Oh! And… I started using a new soap. Lavender scented. Perhaps that has something to do with it? It’s a long shot, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Lavender scented soap. Yes, that could be a factor. Many of those scented products contain irritants. Do you experience any itching, burning, or discharge alongside the pain?
PATIENT: No, no itching, thankfully. And no… discharge either. Just the pain, mostly. It’s… not constant, thankfully. Comes and goes. But it’s… unsettling. I worry sometimes. It’s silly, I know, but… I haven’t had any… problems like this before. And I’m not… married, you see, so there’s no one… to discuss these things with.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bladder or bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes…? Oh dear… Now you’re asking things I don’t usually pay attention to. I suppose… I have been going to the bathroom a bit more frequently lately. But I assumed that was just… with getting older, you know? And drinking more water. Nothing… dramatic. Just… a few more trips. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: Increased frequency could be relevant. Now, Ms. Stepro, I’m going to need to perform a quick physical examination. It’s necessary to assess the area and determine the cause of your discomfort. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. An examination…? Yes, of course. If it’s necessary. I… I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… please be gentle? I… it’s a bit embarrassing, as you can imagine. And… please explain everything as you go along? I prefer to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will explain everything as I proceed. It will be a visual examination, primarily. I’ll need you to lie on the examination table, with your knees bent and feet flat. We'll start with a simple visual inspection of the vulva, and then I’ll gently palpate the area to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know immediately if you experience any pain during the examination. If you’re comfortable, we can begin.
PATIENT: Very well. I… I suppose the sooner it’s done, the better. Please do let me know if you see anything… concerning. And… I truly appreciate your patience. Whenever you are ready, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepro. I’m just going to take a look now. I note some mild erythema – redness – of the labia majora. No obvious lesions or ulcerations. There’s some tenderness to palpation on the left labium majora. Not severe, but present. No palpable masses. The clitoris is normal to palpation. Now, I'm going to gently examine the perineum.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a little tender, yes. Just there. It's not sharp, exactly… just… uncomfortable. The rest feels… normal, I suppose. Please… don't rush. And thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the examination, it appears you have some localized inflammation and tenderness of the left labium majora. This could be due to several factors - irritant contact dermatitis from the new soap, a mild skin infection, or even a small hematoma if you’ve experienced any minor trauma. Given your history and the findings, I suspect irritant contact dermatitis is the most likely culprit. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a simple urine analysis to check for a urinary tract infection, and a vaginal swab to assess for any bacterial or fungal growth. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Oh… dermatitis? From the soap? That… that would make sense. Yes, of course. If that’s what’s necessary. Urine analysis and… a swab? Will the swab be… uncomfortable? And how long will it take to get the results? I… I just want to know what’s going on. And hopefully… it's not serious. Yes, I consent to the tests.
DOCTOR: The swab is a quick procedure. It may cause slight discomfort, similar to a brief pinch. It shouldn't be painful, but please let me know if you experience any significant discomfort. As for the results, the urine analysis usually takes about 24-48 hours, and the swab culture will take approximately 3-5 business days. I'll order those tests now, and the nurse will collect the samples before you leave. In the meantime, I recommend discontinuing use of the lavender scented soap immediately. Also, wear loose-fitting cotton underwear and avoid any harsh chemicals or irritants in the area. If the symptoms worsen, or if you develop a fever, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No lavender soap, cotton underwear… I can do that. Three to five days… that seems like a long time. But… I understand. If it is just the soap, will it clear up quickly once I stop using it? And… what if it’s not the soap? What else could it be? I apologize for all the questions. I just… I worry.
DOCTOR: Discontinuing the soap should provide some relief within a few days, if that is the cause. However, if the symptoms persist, other possibilities include a bacterial or fungal infection, eczema, or, rarely, a more serious skin condition. That's why the tests are necessary – to determine the precise cause and ensure appropriate treatment. I understand your concern, Ms. Stepro, but we need to await the results before jumping to conclusions. It's likely a simple case of irritant contact dermatitis, but we must rule out other possibilities to provide you with the best possible care. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. I’ll wait for the results, and stop using the soap. Thank you for your patience. And… for explaining everything so clearly. I suppose I’ll just… go and wait for the nurse.
