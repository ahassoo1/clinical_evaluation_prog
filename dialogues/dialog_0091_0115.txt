DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you please tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure why I’m here. Something about… my skin? It’s a bit yellow, I believe. My niece scheduled this appointment, bless her heart, she worries so. I don’t recall the full details. It has to do with my liver, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s quite common for family members to notice things we might miss ourselves, and it’s good of your niece to be proactive about your health. You mentioned some yellowing of the skin – that's called jaundice, and it can be related to liver issues, among other things. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh, jaundice, is it? That sounds… serious. When did I notice it… hmm. That’s difficult. It feels… recent, but not terribly recent. Perhaps a few weeks? It's hard to say, truthfully. I don’t pay much attention to such things. I suppose it wasn’t sudden, it just… appeared. Does that make sense? I apologize for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Durig. It’s perfectly alright to be vague; we’ll work through it together. “A few weeks” is helpful. Has this yellowing been getting progressively worse, or has it stayed about the same since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Oh, I think it’s… a little worse, yes. Not dramatically, but I do believe it’s become more noticeable. My niece pointed it out again just the other day, which is why I’m here. She said my eyes looked particularly… yellow. Goodness, I’m sorry. I’m not very good at explaining. It’s just… a gradual change, I suppose. And I haven't been feeling terribly well, though I can't quite put my finger on how unwell. A bit tired, perhaps.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know, Ms. Durig. And it's good you've noticed some fatigue as well. Now, let's try to get a more complete picture. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the yellowing and tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Symptoms… Let me think. I’ve had a bit of an upset stomach lately. Not terribly severe, just… a little queasy. And my appetite hasn't been very good. I haven't been eating as much as I usually do. Also, I’ve noticed my urine is… darker than usual, I think. Everything is a bit of a blur, honestly. I apologize for being so unhelpful. Is this… serious, Doctor? I do worry about my liver. My sister had some trouble with hers years ago.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Ms. Durig. These details are all very important. Nausea, decreased appetite, and darker urine are certainly things we need to investigate. Given your sister’s history with liver problems, it’s good you brought that up; it helps us understand your potential risk factors. To clarify, when you say “darker urine,” can you describe the color?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it's not bright yellow, that much I know. It’s… more of a tea color, I suppose. A dark tea color. Not like the color of, oh, lemonade. More… like a strong, brewed tea. Is that a useful description? It's been happening for a little while now, along with everything else. It’s all rather unsettling. I do hope it’s nothing too serious. I’m not a young woman anymore, and I haven't the energy for a long illness.
DOCTOR: That’s a very helpful description, Ms. Durig – “dark tea color” is quite specific. That, along with the jaundice and your decreased appetite, does raise some concerns that need to be looked into. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I’ve had the usual aches and pains of getting older, of course. Arthritis, mostly. And high blood pressure, for a time, but it's been managed with medication for years, I believe. I don’t recall anything else specifically. I was always quite healthy, until recently. My sister had some liver issues, as I mentioned, but I’ve never had any problems myself, at least not that I’m aware of. I did have a gallbladder removed years ago, but that was… a long time ago. I haven't been to a doctor regularly in… well, I can’t recall exactly when. Perhaps five years? Or longer? It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Durig. That’s helpful to know. And the past gallbladder removal is important. Are you currently taking any medications for your arthritis or blood pressure, or any other reason?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I am. Let me see… I take a small white pill for my blood pressure, every morning. I believe it’s… Lisinopril? Yes, that’s it. And I take something for my arthritis, a pink pill, I think. I can’t recall the name, I’m afraid. My niece helps me manage my medications, she keeps everything organized. I just take what she gives me, honestly. I’m not very good at remembering names. And I do take a multivitamin every day, just to be safe. Does that help? I do apologize for being so vague, Doctor. It’s just… a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: You’re not vague at all, Ms. Durig. It’s perfectly understandable to have difficulty remembering medication names. Knowing you’re taking Lisinopril and a multivitamin is helpful. We’ll try to get the name of the pink pill later. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… let me think. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything, as far as I know. I’ve always been able to eat anything, thankfully. And I don’t recall having any skin allergies or anything of that nature. I used to garden a lot, and I never had any problems with plants or anything. So, no, I don’t believe I have any allergies. But I suppose it’s always possible I’ve forgotten something. My memory isn’t what it used to be, as you know. Is that satisfactory, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly satisfactory, Ms. Durig. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me assess your overall health and narrow down the possible causes of your symptoms. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently examine your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, a very long time. I suppose an examination is a good idea. My abdomen, you say? Is that where the problem might be? I do feel a little… tender there sometimes, a sort of dull ache. But it’s nothing terribly serious, I don’t think. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Though… please be gentle. I am a bit frail, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Durig. I will be as gentle as possible. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I'm starting here… …and here. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… that’s a little tender, yes. Not terribly painful, but… uncomfortable. A dull ache, like I said. It’s been there for a little while now, on and off. It’s more noticeable when I… when I eat something heavy, I think. Like fried food. Or… anything rich. Is that significant, Doctor? I do apologize for being so vague. It’s just… hard to describe. It’s not a sharp pain, it’s just… an ache. A dull, persistent ache. And it seems to radiate… a little, perhaps? Towards my back. Does that make any sense? I do hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Durig. Tenderness in the right upper quadrant with radiating pain to the back, and worse with heavy meals, is consistent with some of our concerns. I’m going to palpate the rest of your abdomen now. ...There is mild tenderness in the epigastric region as well. No palpable masses detected. Liver span is difficult to assess given the tenderness, but appears slightly enlarged. Spleen is not palpable. Now, I’m just going to check your ankles for any swelling.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My ankles… I haven’t really paid attention to them. They feel… a little puffy, perhaps? I’ve been sitting for a long time, waiting, so it’s probably just from that. I do have a tendency to swell when I’m on my feet too long. It’s nothing unusual, I don’t think. But you’re right, they are a little… larger than usual. I do apologize for being so vague, Doctor. It’s just… difficult to describe. Is that concerning? Is it related to my… liver? I do worry about my liver. My niece says I shouldn’t worry, but… it's hard not to.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Durig. It's good you've noticed the swelling. It could be related to the prolonged sitting, but edema can also be a sign of underlying medical issues. Based on the physical examination and your reported symptoms – jaundice, dark urine, fatigue, decreased appetite, right upper quadrant tenderness radiating to the back, and mild edema – I’m concerned about a possible liver issue. While we can't make a definitive diagnosis without further testing, your symptoms warrant investigation. I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a bilirubin level. These tests will help us assess your liver function and identify any abnormalities. I also recommend an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your liver, gallbladder, and other abdominal organs. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood tests and an ultrasound… that sounds… serious. But I suppose it’s better to know, isn’t it? If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes, I agree. Please do whatever you think is necessary to find out what’s going on. I do hope it’s nothing too serious, but… I’m prepared for the worst, I suppose. When will I have these tests? And… will they be painful? I do have a slight… aversion to needles, you see. My niece can come with me, if that helps. I do apologize for being so… anxious. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to feel anxious, Ms. Durig. We'll take things one step at a time. The blood tests are relatively quick and generally not very painful. You might feel a brief pinch, but it's usually over quickly. And the abdominal ultrasound is non-invasive; it uses sound waves to create images of your organs, so there are no needles involved. I can order the blood tests right away, and you can have them done at the lab just down the hall. They usually take about 30 minutes. As for the ultrasound, we can schedule that for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Oh, tomorrow morning sounds… manageable, yes. 9:00 AM is fine. And the blood tests today… yes, I can do that. Just down the hall, you say? That’s good. I do feel a little… relieved that the ultrasound doesn’t involve needles. And my niece can come with me tomorrow, yes. That will be… helpful. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… kind. I do hope it’s nothing too serious, but… I trust your judgment. Please let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare for the tests. And… what should I do in the meantime? Should I rest? Or… is there anything I should avoid eating? I do apologize for asking so many questions. I just… want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Durig. It’s my job to answer your questions and ensure you feel comfortable. For the blood tests, no specific preparation is needed, but please ensure you’re adequately hydrated. Drink plenty of water today. For the ultrasound tomorrow, there are no special requirements either. You can eat and drink normally. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest and avoiding alcohol and fatty foods, as these can put extra stress on your liver. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, or yellowing of your eyes – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here’s a lab requisition for the blood tests, and a scheduling confirmation for the ultrasound. My nurse will be in shortly to review the instructions with you. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very… thoughtful of you, Doctor. Instructions reviewed, you say? That’s good. I do feel a little… reassured, knowing that everything is being taken care of. No, I don't think I have any other questions at this time. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results of the tests. I do worry, you see. But… I trust your judgment. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very… kind. I believe my niece is waiting for me in the lobby. I should go… join her. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Durig. We will contact you as soon as the results are available. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. I wish you and your niece all the best. Please come in and see me when you have the results. Have a good day.
