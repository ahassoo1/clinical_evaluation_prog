DOCTOR: Good morning, Lacreasha. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, my nails. They just...look funny. Not good funny. I don't even know why I'm here, really. Just thought I should get them checked. They been like this a while, I guess. Not a big deal, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay. Not a big deal is good to hear, but it's always best to check things out. When you say "funny," can you describe what you're seeing with your nails?
PATIENT: Well...they're kinda...discolored. Not bright colors, just...off. And they feel...thick? Not like they've grown a lot, just...bulky. I don't know. It’s hard to explain. I don't really look at my hands, you know? I use them for stuff, but I don't sit and admire them. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's hard to notice subtle changes when you're just using your hands for everyday things. "Off" color and thickness...okay. And how long have you noticed this discoloration and thickness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. Maybe...six months? A year? I really don't keep track of things like that. It started slowly, I think. I just noticed them looking...worse than usual. Does it matter exactly how long? I got other things to worry about, honestly.
DOCTOR: It's helpful to have a general idea, yes, but don't worry if you can't be precise. Six months to a year is good enough for now. Has anything changed in your life around that time—new soaps, lotions, detergents, any new hobbies or work that might expose your hands to different chemicals?
PATIENT: Chemicals? Hmm... Not that I know of. I use the same laundry soap I always have. And the same dish soap. I, uh, do a little gardening, but nothing fancy. Mostly just pulling weeds. Oh! Wait... I did start using a new hand cream. My niece gave it to me. Said it was really good for dry skin. It smells nice... kinda floral.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information. A new hand cream is a definite thing to note. Do you remember the name of the hand cream, or perhaps what ingredients were listed on the packaging?
PATIENT: Uh... no. I threw the packaging away. I don't keep stuff like that. It was...pink, I think. And had flowers on it. Fancy flowers. It didn't burn or anything. Just... smelled nice. I don't know why I even bother with that stuff, honestly. It probably didn't do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, sometimes even things that don't cause irritation can contribute to changes. Let's take a look at your nails. I’ll need to do a quick exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. They're just nails. I got things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some thickening and discoloration, as you mentioned. The color is a bit yellowish-brown, and there are some ridges on several nails. It doesn't look actively infected, but there is some debris under a few of them. Do you have any pain or discomfort in your fingers or around your nails?
PATIENT: No pain. Not really. Maybe a little...gritty feeling sometimes? But I just thought that was from the gardening. It’s nothing, honestly. You're making a big deal out of nothing. Are you going to tell me I have some horrible disease now?
DOCTOR: No, I'm not going to tell you that at all. But this could be a fungal infection of the nails, which is quite common. It's also possible it’s another condition, so we shouldn't assume anything without further testing. To be sure, I'd like to take a small sample from under your nail to send to the lab for analysis. It’s a quick and relatively painless procedure. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: A sample? You want to cut my nails? No. Absolutely not. I don't like that. That sounds awful. Just... leave them alone. I told you it was nothing. It’s just funny-looking nails. I’m not letting you cut them.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. It's a very small scraping, not a full cut. It doesn't usually cause any discomfort, and it will give us a definitive answer. However, if you are truly uncomfortable with that, we can explore other options. We could try a topical antifungal medication as a trial, but it may take several months to see if it helps, and it won't give us a clear diagnosis. Or, if it continues to bother you, I can refer you to a dermatologist who can assess it further. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A dermatologist? Ugh. More doctors. No thank you. A cream sounds... okay, I guess. If it won't hurt. Just something I rub on. But if it doesn't work, I'm not coming back. And don’t tell me it’s something serious. I don't need that stress.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can certainly try a topical antifungal cream. I'll write you a prescription for one. It's important to be consistent with application – twice a day, as directed, for several months. It may take a while to see improvement, and it doesn't always work, but it's a good first step. While we're at it, to rule out other possible causes, and just for good documentation, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, goodness. That's a long story. I get confused easily. I have... the usual old lady stuff, I guess. A little arthritis. My blood pressure is sometimes high. And my knees ache. I don’t really remember all the details. I take a pill for my blood pressure, I think. What else...? I don't even know where to start. It's all a blur.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. We can take it slowly. Do you know the name of the pill you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Umm... no. It's a little white one. That's all I know. My daughter handles all that stuff, usually. She brings me the pills every month. I just take 'em. Honestly, I don't like thinking about all that medical stuff. It just makes me anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's alright. We can try to get the information from your daughter if needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any other allergies at all?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I haven't had any problems with anything. Maybe I was allergic to something as a kid, but I don't remember. Honestly, I think people worry too much about allergies these days. It's all a big fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! My mother would turn over in her grave. And I don't drink. Makes me feel sick. Never really liked it. Drugs? Absolutely not. I'm a respectable woman. Honestly, these are silly questions. I eat my vegetables and go to church. That's my lifestyle.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Alright, so I’ve written you a prescription for the antifungal cream. Apply it twice daily to the affected nails after washing and drying them thoroughly. It's important to be consistent with the application for at least six months to see if it helps. I’m also going to give you a handout with information about fungal nail infections and proper nail care. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Handout? Oh, goodness. I don't need more papers to lose. But... no, I guess not. Just... don’t expect miracles, okay? And if it gets worse, I’m not coming back. You hear me?
DOCTOR: I understand. I won't expect miracles, and I certainly respect your wishes. If the condition worsens or you experience any side effects from the cream, please contact the office immediately. Here’s the handout, and the prescription will be sent to your pharmacy. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. That's all. I just want to get out of here. Thank you. I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. You have a good day, Lacreasha. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Bye.
