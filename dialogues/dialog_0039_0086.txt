DOCTOR: Hello Kahrin, welcome. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hi Doctor. Just here for the results, like we talked about. I really don’t have a lot of time, if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. We can definitely focus on the results. Let me just get those pulled up here… Ah, yes. So, as you know, we ran some tests last week. Just to clarify, those were blood work and a urine sample, correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. Blood and pee. Sounds about right. Can we just… skip the explaining everything about them and just tell me what it means? I remember what I did for the tests, I just need the bottom line.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I can do that. Okay, so the good news is, most of your results came back within the normal range. However, there were a couple of things that were a little bit outside of those ranges… Your white blood cell count was slightly elevated, and there was a small amount of protein in your urine. Do you have any idea what might have caused those?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, not really. I haven’t been sick or anything. And I drink a lot of water… maybe that’s the protein? I don’t know. What does elevated white blood cells even mean? I'm not a doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question! Elevated white blood cells can indicate a few different things - most commonly it suggests your body is fighting something off, like an infection, inflammation, or even stress. Sometimes it's nothing serious, like a minor cold you haven't even noticed yet, but we want to rule out anything more significant. The protein in your urine could be related to hydration levels, as you mentioned, but it’s also something we should investigate a little further, just to be safe. Do you have any symptoms at all – like a fever, pain when you urinate, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No fever, no pain when I pee. Ankles are… normal, I think? I haven’t really paid attention. Look, is it something I need to worry about right now? Because honestly, I’m on a pretty tight schedule. If it’s just ‘drink more water and see what happens’ I’m good with that.
DOCTOR: I understand wanting a quick answer. It's good you haven't noticed any pain or swelling. It's unlikely to be a medical emergency, but the slightly elevated white blood cells and the protein in the urine together do warrant a little more investigation. It could be something simple, like a mild urinary tract infection, or it could be something else. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to run a repeat urine test, and possibly a more detailed blood panel. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? Really? Okay, fine. But can we do it quickly? And can you tell me exactly what you’re looking for this time? Like, what’s the worst-case scenario, so I’m not sitting here worrying about everything?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Kahrin. We'll make it as quick as possible. This time, the repeat urine test will check for bacteria, and the detailed blood panel will help us assess your kidney function and look for any signs of infection. The worst-case scenario, though it's unlikely, would be a kidney infection or a more serious urinary tract infection that requires antibiotics. We want to rule those out. More commonly, it could be something minor like a viral infection or dehydration. We're being thorough just to be safe. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Yeah, that sounds… less bad, I guess. So, what do I need to do? Another pee sample? And blood? How long will it take to get the results this time? And will someone actually call me with them, or do I have to keep coming back?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly – another urine sample, and a small blood draw. We'll send the blood sample to the lab, and they usually get results back within 24-48 hours. And yes, someone will definitely call you with the results. I'll make a note on your chart to have the lab technician contact you directly as soon as they're available. We won't have you come back unless we need to discuss something more complex. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Okay, good. That’s… acceptable. So, where do I go for the blood draw? And do I need to fast beforehand? Seriously, please tell me if I need to fast. I hate fasting.
DOCTOR: Here’s a requisition form with the address of the lab. It’s just down the street, at 14 Oak Street. And yes, you do need to fast for this blood draw. It needs to be a 12-hour fast – no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. I’m sorry about that, I know it’s not ideal. It helps ensure accurate results. Is there anything else I can clarify for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Fasting sucks, but okay. I really appreciate you not making me come back if it's not necessary. I've got a lot going on. Thanks, Doctor. I guess I'll go do the blood thing. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kahrin. I understand, and we'll certainly do our best to get these results back to you quickly and avoid another visit if possible. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions at all. Have a good day, and I hope everything goes smoothly. .
