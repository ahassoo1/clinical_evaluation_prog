DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. I’m Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Sorry, my English not so good. I… cough a lot. Long time already. And tired also. Very tired. And… my nose, always block, then runny. Happens a lot. I think… sinus, the doctor before say sinus. But I forget what he do.
DOCTOR: Right. A cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion. “Sinus,” you say. Vaguely recall a previous physician mentioning that. How long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Long time… maybe… one year? Or more? I really don’t remember. Work every day, very busy. Sometimes better, sometimes worse. Now it’s… worse, I think. Hard to breathe when lie down. My wife, she complain also, say I cough too much at night. Sorry, I no good with dates.
DOCTOR: A year or more… Yes, well. Chronic symptoms, then. And the difficulty breathing when lying down is new?
PATIENT: Um… yes. Not always. But… last few weeks, more bad. I try sleep, then start coughing, wake up. Then hard to breathe. Maybe… two, three times a week now? Sometimes more, if very tired from work. I lift tire all day, very heavy. Sorry, I don't know what cause it.
DOCTOR: Heavy lifting… alright. Do you have any fever, chills, or night sweats accompanying this?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes feel warm, but not very high. Not like sick fever. Just… warm skin. No chills, I think. And no… night sweat. Just tired. Very, very tired. And cough until body ache. I drink a lot of water, that's all. Sorry, I don’t take medicine much. Make me sleepy.
DOCTOR: Right. No significant fever, no chills, no night sweats. You mentioned body aches… are these generalized, or localized to certain areas?
PATIENT: All over, Doctor. Like… after hard work, whole body pain. Especially back and chest. When cough too much, chest really hurt. Makes it hard to breathe even when not lying down. My wife give me some massage oil, but only help a little bit. I no know what to do anymore. Sorry… I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to do a quick examination. Please, if you’ll step over to the examination table. I'll listen to your lungs and check your sinuses. Afterwards, we can discuss potential causes and next steps. Let's start with your chest. Breathe deeply for me.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. My chest… okay. I try breathe deep. This good? Tell me if I need to do anything different. Sorry… I nervous.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. I'm hearing some mild wheezing in your lower lobes. Nothing alarming, but it indicates some airway inflammation. Now, let’s check your sinuses. I’m going to palpate around your forehead and cheeks. Just let me know if you feel any tenderness.
PATIENT: Ow… here. A little bit pain. And… here also. This one also sensitive. Not so bad, but… uncomfortable. Like… pressure. Happens a lot. Especially when weather change. Sorry… is it bad?
DOCTOR: Tenderness over the maxillary and frontal sinuses. As you mentioned, this correlates with your previous physician’s assessment of sinusitis. Given the duration of your symptoms, the chronic nature of the cough and fatigue, and the recent worsening, we need to consider a few possibilities. However, given your description, it's likely a chronic exacerbation of sinusitis, possibly complicated by some mild bronchitis. Now, do you have any allergies – to pollen, dust, mold, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… um… I don't know. Never really think about it. Work in tire shop all day, lots of dust. Maybe that? My nose always itchy when change tire. And sometimes, when raining, feel stuffy also. But… not sure if allergy. Never go to doctor for allergy before. Sorry, I no good with these things. Just cough and tired.
DOCTOR: Right. Exposure to dust, potential seasonal symptoms… We’ll proceed with a presumptive diagnosis of chronic sinusitis with possible bronchitis. Given you're uninsured, and your symptoms have persisted for quite some time, I recommend a trial of conservative management first. I’ll prescribe a saline nasal rinse and an over-the-counter decongestant. If these do not improve your symptoms within two weeks, you will need to follow up, and we can discuss further options—possibly a referral to a specialist. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Saline… rinse? Like… wash my nose? And… decongestant? Medicine? Okay… two weeks. If no better, come back? Yes… that sounds okay. Is it expensive, the medicine? Sorry, money a little tight now. But I really want to feel better. Just want to work and sleep.
DOCTOR: The saline rinse is inexpensive, a simple over-the-counter solution. The decongestant will be similarly priced. I will write the prescriptions. However, I must stress – if you develop a high fever, shortness of breath, or severe chest pain, you need to seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. High fever… shortness of breath… chest pain. Go to hospital. Okay, I remember. Saline rinse, decongestant, two weeks. And… be careful. Thank you, Doctor. Very much. This help, I think. I go buy the medicine now?
DOCTOR: Yes, go ahead. And try to avoid prolonged exposure to dust, if possible. Follow the instructions on the packaging carefully. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you very much. I will try. And… thank you again.
