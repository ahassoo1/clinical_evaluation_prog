DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, Doctor Havird, it’s about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on and on about it. Says it’s good for everything. Frankly, I think it's a load of nonsense, but she insists I look into it. She says I need a… certification, is that right? To be perfectly honest, I’m not entirely sure why I’d need one, but she's quite insistent, and frankly, it's easier to just humor her. So here I am.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it is becoming more common. Look, I understand wanting to appease your daughter, but frankly, most people come in looking for actual medical problems, not… suggestions. But, we can certainly discuss it. To be clear, it's not a simple "certification" process. It involves determining if you have a qualifying condition. What specifically is your daughter suggesting it would help with?
PATIENT: Qualifying condition? Honestly, she just keeps saying it'll “make me feel better.” She says it helps with… aches and pains, mostly. And… sleeping. I do have a bit of trouble getting a good night's rest, though I always have. It's just getting old, I suppose. Not that I think some weed is going to fix that. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I’ve dealt with a few aches and pains. It's not as if I’m laid up in bed, you understand. It’s just… she's making a fuss.
DOCTOR: "Make you feel better" isn't a diagnosis, Ellan. And aches and pains… that's incredibly vague. Do you have any specific areas where you're experiencing discomfort?
PATIENT: Well, now. Don't get snippy with me, young lady. It's my back, mostly. Lower back. It flares up when I've been on my feet too long, which is… often, seeing as my profession. And my knees, a bit. They ache in the cold weather. Bailiffs work, you see. Lots of walking, lots of standing. It's not constant pain, mind you. It's just… bothersome. Honestly, I just take some ibuprofen and carry on. I don’t go making a mountain out of a molehill, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. So, lower back and knees, intermittent pain. Ibuprofen helps. And how long have you been experiencing this discomfort, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Years, certainly. Decades, probably. It comes and goes, you see? It's part of getting older. I've been a bailiff for… well, a very long time. Over forty years, I should think. It just… gradually worsened over time. It's never been severe enough to see a doctor, until my daughter started this nonsense. I've always just… managed. You understand. A woman doesn't complain. Especially not about aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Right. Forty years of physical work. And no previous medical evaluations for this?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I’ve always been perfectly capable. I’ve never needed to see a doctor for something like this. It's just… wear and tear, you see? A bailiff’s work isn't exactly sitting behind a desk. It's a respectable profession, mind you, but it’s physically demanding. I’ve always just… toughed it out. Honestly, all this fuss over a few aches and pains… I'm starting to feel quite foolish, just being here. I only came because of my daughter. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your daughter is… persuasive. Alright, Ellan. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It won't take long. I need to check your range of motion, reflexes, and a few other things. It's just to rule out anything serious, alright?
PATIENT: Honestly. Fine. But don't go poking and prodding too much. I haven’t got all day, you know. And I'm not a fan of being treated like some… fragile old woman. Just get it over with, please. And be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll start with your lower back. Just relax as much as possible. Does this area feel particularly tender?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that one. A bit tender, yes. But honestly, Doctor, it’s always been a bit tender. It’s my lower back, you know? It supports my entire weight. It's not surprising it's a bit sore. Don't go pushing too hard, please. I don't need you to make it worse. Honestly, I'm starting to regret agreeing to this whole examination. It's just… unnecessary, really. But my daughter...
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now, see? This is ridiculous. I haven't bent over like this in years. There! I can't reach my toes, you know. Not anymore. It's… uncomfortable. Honestly, I think I pulled something. This is precisely why I don't go bothering doctors. They just make things worse. Are you finished now? I'd like to sit down.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just sit here for a moment. Let's assess your knees now. Can you bend them fully?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now there's a lovely creaking noise. It's just… old age, you see? It's been a long life. They're a bit stiff, you know. Not as flexible as they used to be. They haven't been properly used in a while. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite foolish. I should have just said no to this whole thing. It's just… a waste of my time. Are we nearly finished now, Doctor? My back is quite sore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a few more quick checks. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now there's a creaking noise from everything. Honestly, I feel like a rusty gate. Please don’t ask me to do anything strenuous. I’m not a spring chicken, you know. I haven't been on my feet this long in ages. This is precisely why I prefer to sit down. Are you finished now? This is all quite exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just walk a few steps for me. Okay. Stop there. And can you tell me, do you experience any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? I'm walking. I walk perfectly fine, considering my age. It's just… a bit slow. My feet hurt, you know. I’ve been on them all day. Numbness? No. Not exactly numbness. Just… a bit of ache. It's a general ache. It's hard to describe. It's just… old age. Honestly, I think I pulled something. This whole exercise is just… unnecessary. Are we finished now, Doctor? My back is quite sore, and I’m starting to feel quite dizzy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan. I've got a basic assessment here. You have some age-related wear and tear in your back and knees, as you suspected. Limited range of motion, some discomfort with movement. No signs of acute injury. The ibuprofen is likely helping manage the pain. Now, about this medical marijuana... I’m going to be frank. Based on what you've described, I don't see a compelling medical reason for it. It sounds like you're managing, albeit with some discomfort. I’m not opposed to exploring options, but I think there are other things we can try first. Physical therapy, for example, could help improve your strength and flexibility. We could also discuss different pain management strategies. Would you be open to those options?
PATIENT: Physical therapy? At my age? Honestly, Doctor, I appreciate your concern, but I’ve lived a long life. I’m not going to start doing exercises now. As for different pain management strategies… I take ibuprofen. It works perfectly fine. Honestly, I think this whole thing is a waste of time. My daughter just keeps going on and on about it. She reads things on the internet, you see. So, are you saying you won't give me this certification? Honestly, I just want to appease my daughter. It’s easier that way. But if you won’t, then… well, I suppose I can tell her I tried. But she’ll be very disappointed. And frankly, I don't need the fuss.
DOCTOR: Ellan, I understand you want to appease your daughter. But ethically, I can’t recommend or certify you for medical marijuana without a legitimate medical need. The potential benefits don’t outweigh the risks in your case, based on the information you’ve provided. I can write a note stating you were evaluated and, in my professional opinion, are not a suitable candidate for medical marijuana at this time. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A note? That’s… not ideal. My daughter will be furious. She'll say I didn't even try. Honestly, it's all just so… frustrating. Very well. A note it is. But make it sound… official. Say something about a thorough evaluation. And that you considered all options. I don’t want her thinking I didn’t take her seriously. Honestly, Doctor, you're making me do all the work. Very well, a note. But it had better be convincing. Can we be finished now? I'm starting to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll write a detailed note outlining your evaluation, my findings, and my professional recommendation against medical marijuana at this time. I’ll state that we discussed alternative treatment options, which you declined. I will make it as thorough and professional as possible. It will take a few minutes to finalize. In the meantime, I would strongly suggest staying hydrated and resting. Do you have anyone who can help you get home safely?
PATIENT: I can manage perfectly fine. I’ve been driving for longer than you’ve been alive. Honestly, Doctor, I appreciate your concern, but I'm not an invalid. I just want this note. The sooner I have it, the sooner I can get home and put an end to this whole ordeal. Honestly, it's been quite exhausting. How much longer will this take?
DOCTOR: Here you go. This outlines everything we discussed. It's quite detailed, as you requested. I’ve also included a few resources for managing chronic pain, should you be interested. And please, if your pain worsens, or you experience any new symptoms, don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Adequate, I suppose. It will have to do. No, nothing else. I just want to go home. Honestly, Doctor, it’s been a… trying afternoon. Thank you for your time. Though I doubt my daughter will be pleased. Good day. .
