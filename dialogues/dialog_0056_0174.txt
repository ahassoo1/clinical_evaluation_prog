DOCTOR: Hi Nani, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It’s…difficult to explain, but I just feel quite low, you understand? I suppose that's why I'm here. I’d like to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Feeling low” can mean a lot of things. To help me get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about when you started feeling this way?
PATIENT: Hmm…when did it start? That’s a good question. Honestly, it’s been creeping up on me for… oh, I’d say at least six months now, maybe longer. It wasn’t sudden, you see. Just…a gradual fading of enjoyment, if that makes sense. Everything feels a bit…gray. It's hard to pinpoint a specific date, I’m afraid. I don't keep much track of time these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so several months. And you described it as a "fading of enjoyment." Can you give me some examples of things you used to enjoy that you’re not enjoying now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I used to be very active. Ski patrol, you know. Loved the mountains. Now…the thought of it just exhausts me. I used to love gardening, but I haven't touched my roses all season. Even spending time with my grandchildren feels…like a chore, which is terrible to admit. It’s just…nothing feels good anymore. Not like it used to.
DOCTOR: Okay. So a loss of interest in activities you previously enjoyed, fatigue... Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my sleep. It’s dreadful. I wake up several times a night, usually with my mind racing. Sometimes I just lie awake for hours, staring at the ceiling. And even when I do sleep, I don’t feel rested. It’s… quite frustrating, really. I’m always tired, even after a full night – or what should be a full night – in bed. It's a vicious cycle, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite... it’s all over the place. Some days I have no interest in food at all. Other days I eat… well, perhaps too much. Comfort eating, I suppose. It's mostly sweets, to be honest. Chocolate, biscuits… things I shouldn’t really be having, but they provide a little…something. It's not a healthy habit, I know. It’s just… difficult to resist when I’m feeling so low.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any weight changes recently?
PATIENT: Well, yes, actually. I’ve gained a bit of weight. Not a huge amount, but enough to notice in my clothes. Perhaps five or six kilograms. It’s… discouraging. Everything feels out of control, you see? My sleep, my appetite, my weight… It's all just a mess. I used to be very careful about my health, but now… I just don't seem to have the energy or the motivation. I really would appreciate it if we could get this sorted quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any difficulty with concentration or memory lately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. That’s been happening more and more. I forget things constantly. Where I put my keys, what I was saying mid-sentence, appointments… It’s quite embarrassing, really. My daughter has to remind me of things all the time. It’s not like me at all. I used to have a very sharp mind. I’m worried it’s something serious. It’s making everything even harder, you understand? I used to be so independent. Now, I feel like I’m relying on others for everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness or thoughts of self-harm?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That’s…a difficult question. Hopelessness, yes. Definitely. I often feel like things will never get better. But self-harm? No, no, I would never do anything like that. I have my faith, and my family. I wouldn’t leave them like that. It’s just…the constant sadness is exhausting. I don't enjoy anything anymore. That's what's so awful. But I would never… hurt myself. No. Definitely not. I just want to feel like myself again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. Okay, Nani, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with depression. We’ll need to rule out any other underlying medical conditions first. I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, vitamin D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. And I’d also like to do a brief physical exam, just to check your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood work and a physical exam. Fine, yes. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get to the bottom of this. The sooner the better, if you don’t mind. I have a bridge club meeting on Thursday, and I really don’t want to be…like this then. Though, I suppose I’ll likely have to cancel it, if this takes long. Do you think it will be long?
DOCTOR: Okay. The blood work should be processed fairly quickly – usually within a day or two. The physical exam won’t take long. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Certainly. . Here you are, Doctor. I do hope it’s nothing too serious. And thank you for seeing me so promptly. It’s a relief to finally be talking about this. Though, I must say, I’m still rather worried about my bridge club… They’ll be furious if I cancel again.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140/90. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. No obvious tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. Everything sounds normal so far, but the blood work will give us a more complete picture. Now, let's just check your temperature…
PATIENT: Very well. . It’s…rather warm today, isn’t it? I haven’t been sleeping well, as I said. Perhaps that’s affecting my temperature. I do hope it’s not anything to worry about. Honestly, Doctor, all this… poking and prodding… it’s a bit unsettling. Is it normal to feel this anxious? I’ve always been a very independent woman, and this… needing help… it’s not easy.
DOCTOR: Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. It is normal to feel anxious during a medical exam, especially when you’re discussing personal concerns. You’re absolutely right – it takes courage to seek help, and it’s perfectly okay to feel vulnerable. I appreciate you sharing this with me. We’re just gathering information at this stage, and I’ll explain everything thoroughly once we have the blood work results. Now, I’m just going to quickly listen to your heart again, and then we can discuss next steps.
PATIENT: Very well. . Do you think it could be stress, Doctor? My daughter has been unwell lately, and I've been rather preoccupied with her care. Perhaps that's all it is. Though, I've always been a strong woman. I’ve handled plenty of stress in my life. This feels… different. I just want to feel like myself again. Is that too much to ask? Perhaps a nice cup of tea would help. I always find a cup of tea settles my nerves. Though, I suppose that’s a foolish thought, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It could certainly be stress, Nani, and your daughter’s illness is a significant stressor. However, it’s important to rule out any other underlying causes for your symptoms. A cup of tea would be lovely later, but for now, let’s focus on getting the necessary tests done. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan that’s tailored to your needs. I’m going to order the blood work now, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. It’s a simple procedure, and it shouldn’t take long. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. . Just… when will I hear back? I have that bridge club meeting on Thursday, as you know, and I really need to know if I’ll be fit to attend. And… will the results take long? Honestly, I’m just anxious to get this sorted. I haven't been feeling like myself for months, and I just want to feel normal again. It’s… rather exhausting, all this worrying. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time. And please, do let me know as soon as the results are in. Thursday is looming, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m noting your concern about the bridge club meeting. I’ll put a rush on the blood work request, and I’ll personally call you as soon as the results are available – likely within 48 hours. If we haven't spoken by Wednesday afternoon, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic and ask for me directly. And just to reiterate, these tests are simply to rule out any other potential causes. We’ll discuss a plan of action based on the results. Do you have any other concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. . Thank you, Doctor Amussen. You've been very helpful, even if you are rather…efficient. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And please, do call as soon as you have the results. Thursday is very important, you see. . Good day to you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nani. You’re very welcome. I’ll make sure to prioritize your results. You have a good day as well. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then.
