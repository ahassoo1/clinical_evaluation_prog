DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Tremor, you said? Yes… that’s right. My hands. They… well, they shake. Been happening a while now, I suppose. Not sure how long, exactly. Time gets away from you, you know? I just want to get it sorted, if that’s possible. Don't have the patience for a long fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay. A tremor in your hands. And you said it’s been happening for a while… difficult to say exactly how long. We'll try to narrow that down. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. Mostly when I… when I try to do something precise. Like, I used to build model boats, but… can't do that anymore. Too shaky. Just… happens sometimes. Not all the time. When I'm just sitting, usually fine. Though… now that I think about it, maybe a little even then? Hard to say, really. It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's more noticeable with fine motor skills, like building the boats, and potentially present even at rest, though harder to detect. Do you notice anything that makes it worse – certain times of day, stress, caffeine, anything like that?
PATIENT: Caffeine… hmm. I used to drink coffee, years ago. Not so much now. Stress… well, who doesn’t have stress? I don’t think it gets much worse with stress, no. Time of day… maybe a little worse in the afternoon? But honestly, Doctor, it's all a bit of a blur. I don't really keep track of those things. I just know it's there, and it’s bothersome. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. No significant worsening with stress or caffeine, potentially a little more noticeable in the afternoon. I understand you’re concerned about time, Mr. Jezik. We’ll try to be efficient. Before we move on, can you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms alongside the tremor?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No… not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn't? I haven't fallen or anything. No… no numbness, no pain. Just the shaking. I used to have a good memory, but… well, it's not what it used to be. So if I have forgotten something, don't be surprised. This is… frustrating, honestly. I just want to know what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No other associated symptoms like falls, numbness, or pain, just the tremor and some memory changes. Now, let’s go over a bit of your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… … Not that I know of. Had some trouble with my heart, years back, but they fixed it. Or… I think they did. I had a… a procedure. A long time ago. Other than that… nothing comes to mind. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a very long time. Frankly, I avoid them if I can. They never tell you anything useful. Do I have to go through all this?
DOCTOR: Okay. Some past heart trouble with a procedure performed a long time ago. We'll need to get more specifics on that, if possible. I understand your frustration, Mr. Jezik, but getting a good history is important to figure out what's going on. Do you remember what kind of procedure it was?
PATIENT: … Honestly, Doctor, no. Something with… wires? They poked around in there with something. It was… uncomfortable. I was in the hospital for a few days. That’s all I really remember. They said it fixed things, but… I don't recall the details. It was… a long time ago. Before my divorce, definitely. And that was… well, a while back. Is this going to help, or are we just going in circles? I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Alright, a procedure involving wires, sometime before your divorce. We’ll try to get those records if we can. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or have you been taking any recently?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Not regularly. I used to take something for… for my blood pressure, I think. But the doctor took me off of it. Said I didn't need it anymore. That was… years ago, too. No, I don't take anything now. Just… a little aspirin sometimes, for aches and pains. But that's it. Honestly, I try to avoid pills if I can. They never seem to do much good. Is that helpful? I'm starting to feel a bit… flustered, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. No regular medications, just aspirin occasionally. And you were previously on something for blood pressure, but it was discontinued. Alright. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, Mr. Jezik. Just going to check your reflexes, coordination, and look at your hands a bit more closely. Is that alright?
PATIENT: … Fine. Just… try to be quick about it, please. I have… commitments. And try not to poke too much. My hands are sensitive enough as it is. Just… get it over with. I don't like being examined. It always makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Just going to check your reflexes first. Please relax your arm. And now the other side. Okay. Now, could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: … There. Like this? It’s worse when I try to hold still. See? That’s the problem. Always shaking. Don’t need a fancy exam to see that, Doctor. It’s right there. Is this going to lead to anything useful, or are we just confirming what I already know? Honestly, it’s a bit… insulting.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the tremor, and it's more pronounced with movement. I’m also noting some rigidity, a slight stiffness, in your arms. Now, could you please try to tap your thumb to each of your fingers, one at a time?
PATIENT: … Like this? It's… difficult. See? Slow, shaky… It takes effort. I used to be able to do this without even thinking. … Honestly, it’s embarrassing. This is just… getting worse the longer this goes on. Is there anything you can do about it? Some kind of pill, perhaps? I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. The movement is slow and there is a noticeable tremor. Okay. Based on what you've told me, and what I'm seeing in the exam, it's possible this could be a sign of Parkinson's disease, but we need to do some further testing to confirm. I want to order some blood work to rule out other causes, and I'd like to refer you to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Parkinson’s… … I’ve heard of that. Isn't that… bad? Look, Doctor, I'm an old man. I don't want a lot of tests and specialists and… and things. Is there a pill? Just something to calm the shaking? I don't want to spend the rest of my life in doctor’s offices. Honestly, this is… upsetting. I just wanted a quick fix. Is there anything quick? Or am I stuck with this… Parkinson’s? .
