DOCTOR: Good morning, Cleo. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Mornin’ Doc. Renzi, right? Yeah, nice to meet ya too. Uh… somethin’ about insurance? My daughter, she set this up. Long-term… care insurance, I think she said. Honestly, I get a little mixed up with all the paperwork. It’s been a while since I had to deal with stuff like this.
DOCTOR: Yes, Cleo, Dr. Renzi. And don’t you worry a bit about the paperwork. It is confusing. So, just to clarify, your daughter scheduled this appointment because you’re looking into long-term care insurance options?
PATIENT: That sounds right. She said somethin’ about makin’ sure I was… covered. For if I needed help later on. I don’t really… remember all the details. Things kinda blur these days, ya know? She was real worried about it, though. Good girl, my Sarah. Always lookin’ out for me.
DOCTOR: Sarah sounds wonderful. It’s very thoughtful of her to get this sorted out. And it’s perfectly alright if details are fuzzy – that happens. We can certainly go over the options and figure out what makes the most sense for you. Before we dive into insurance specifically, just to get a good overall picture… could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General health… hmm. Well, I work down at the docks, unloadin’ stuff. Been doin’ that for… a long time. Gets hard on ya, ya know? Knees ain’t what they used to be. And my back… acts up sometimes. Mostly just aches, though. I get tired easier now than I used to. I see Doc Hanson when things get bad, but… he mostly gives me pills. Don't really remember much else. I eat okay, I guess. Fish mostly. And bread.
DOCTOR: Okay, so physically active work at the docks, some knee and back pain, fatigue… and you see Dr. Hanson for those issues. Fish and bread for your diet. That's helpful, thank you. Just to clarify about the pain… when you say it "acts up," how often would you say that happens?
PATIENT: Well… not every day. Maybe a few times a week. Some weeks are worse than others. Depends on what I’m unloadin’, I think. Heavy stuff makes it real bad. And if it’s cold and damp… that doesn’t help. It’s just a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, nothin’ like a broken bone or somethin'. It just makes it hard to bend over, ya know? Hard to get up sometimes too.
DOCTOR: Right, a dull ache a few times a week, worse with heavy lifting and damp weather. Difficulty bending and getting up. And you said you see Dr. Hanson for this… Do you recall what he’s diagnosed the pain as, or what treatments he’s tried besides the pills?
PATIENT: Uh… honestly, Doc Hanson talks pretty fast. And I get a little… distracted sometimes. I think he said somethin’ about my joints. Arthritis, maybe? Or somethin’ close to that. He gave me some stretches to do, but… I didn’t really stick with ‘em. Hard to remember when ya got work to do. The pills help take the edge off, mostly. He’s a good doctor, I think, just… busy. Real busy.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and busy doctors don’t always have a lot of time to explain things. So, possible arthritis, pain relief with medication… Let’s switch gears for a moment, if you don’t mind. Besides the pain, are you experiencing any other health problems?
PATIENT: Uh… well, my memory ain't what it used to be. Like we talked about. Sarah gets worried about that. She says I repeat myself sometimes. And… I get kinda… confused sometimes. Not all the time, just… occasionally. Especially if I’m tired. And… I get a little short of breath when I walk uphill. But I figure that’s just my age. I ain't as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Memory issues, occasional confusion, and shortness of breath with exertion… Those are all things we want to explore a bit further. And you're right, those things can be related to age, but it's important to rule out other potential causes. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… I feel kinda shaky. Not a big shake, just… a little tremble in my hands. Mostly when I'm tryin’ to do somethin’ delicate, like buttonin’ my shirt. And… I sleep okay, but I wake up a lot during the night. Gotta get up and… use the bathroom, mostly. And I've been feelin' kinda down lately, ya know? Just… not myself. Sarah says I don't smile as much as I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hand tremors, frequent nighttime urination, and feeling down… It’s good you're sharing all of this with me, Cleo. It helps me get a complete picture of your health. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything besides what you've discussed with Dr. Hanson?
PATIENT: Let me think… Doc Hanson said my blood pressure was a little high a few years back. He put me on some pills for that too. I take ‘em every day. And… oh! When I was a kid, I had the measles. Real bad. But that was a long time ago. And… I don’t think that counts. I don’t remember anything else, honestly. My wife, bless her soul, she handled all the doctor stuff when we were married. I just… went along.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and measles as a child. That's helpful. It sounds like your wife was wonderful to take care of things. Now, just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… Oh! When I was young, I broke my arm fallin’ out of a tree. They had to set it. And… I think I had my tonsils taken out when I was a kid. That’s all I can remember, honestly. It was a long time ago. And I was pretty young. Don't really remember much about it. It was just a blur. Everything is just kinda… fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child and tonsillectomy. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… uh… my momma, she lived to be a real old lady. Ninety-something, I think. She had arthritis real bad in her hands. Couldn’t hardly move ‘em. My daddy, he died young. Heart trouble, I think. And… my sister, she had diabetes. But that’s all I can really remember. We didn’t really talk about health stuff much. Just kinda… dealt with it as it came. I don't really know much about anyone else. My wife's family, I don't know a whole lot about them either. It's all kinda… blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of arthritis, heart trouble, and diabetes. And you said you don’t know much about the health history on your wife’s side. That's alright, we can work with what we have. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never smoked a day in my life. Tried it once when I was a young man, didn't like it. Made me sick. My wife didn't like it either. She always said it was a nasty habit. I drink… a little beer sometimes. Mostly on weekends. A couple of cans. Nothing fancy. And… I don't really have any other habits, ya know? Just work. And tryin’ to stay outta trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional beer on weekends. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the ones you mentioned for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Doc Hanson gave me somethin' for the pain sometimes. When it gets real bad. A little white pill. And… oh! There’s a pill I take for my water. Helps me sleep through the night. I think. Sarah handles most of that. She puts ‘em in little containers for me. I just take ‘em when she tells me to. I don't really know what they are. Honestly, I get a little confused with all the pills. They all look the same.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for pain, medication for nighttime urination, and blood pressure medication. It sounds like you have quite a few medications, and it’s easy to get confused with them all. We can definitely review them and make sure everything is organized. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… uh… not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat fish all the time. Never had a problem. I'm a little sensitive to the cold, but that's not an allergy. Just… gets me achin'. And… I think I get a little itchy sometimes when I wear wool. But that's about it. Honestly, I'm pretty lucky. I don't have a lot of problems. Just… gettin' old, ya know? Things start to fall apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a better sense of things. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a few other basic tests. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. Whatever ya need. I ain't got nothin' to hide. Just… be gentle, alright? My knees ain't what they used to be. And… I get a little nervous around doctors. Never been a fan of bein' poked and prodded. But… I trust ya. Sarah said you're a good doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And Sarah is right, I always try to make my patients comfortable. Let's start with your blood pressure. Can you please sit here for a moment?
PATIENT: Alright. Here I am. Just let me know if I need to do anything. My knees are makin’ a bit of noise, sorry about that. Old age, ya know?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all. That's perfectly normal. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. It's not drastically high, but it’s something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Your heart sounds regular, but I can hear a slight murmur. It’s not concerning at this moment, but we’ll make a note of it. Your lungs sound clear, but your breathing is a little shallow. Your abdomen is soft, and there doesn’t seem to be any tenderness. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which can be normal with age. Your knees have some crepitus, which is a grating sensation. That’s likely due to arthritis. Your hands have some mild swelling in the joints.
PATIENT: Yeah, they ache somethin’ awful when it's cold. And the hands… they get stiff in the mornin'. Makes it hard to get dressed. That murmur… is that bad? My wife, bless her soul, she had somethin’ wrong with her heart too. It worries me a little, ya know? I don't want to end up like her.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Cleo. It's natural to be worried when you have a family history of heart problems. The murmur I heard is a relatively common finding, and it doesn't necessarily mean there's anything serious wrong. It could be a benign flow murmur, which is just a normal variation in blood flow. However, to be sure, I’d like to order an EKG, which is a simple test that measures your heart’s electrical activity. And potentially an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart. That will give us a more detailed look at its structure and function. Do you have any questions about those tests?
PATIENT: Tests… EKG… echo… what do those even do? I get a little lost with all the medical stuff. Does it hurt? Will it take long? I got things to do, ya know? Unloadin' stuff down at the docks… can't be gone all day. I just… wanna know if it's gonna be painful. And if it's gonna take a long time. My daughter, Sarah, she can help me schedule it, if it's alright. She’s good with all this stuff.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, let me explain. The EKG is completely painless. We simply attach a few small stickers to your chest, arms, and legs, and it records your heart’s electrical activity. It takes about five minutes. The echocardiogram is also non-invasive. We use a small handheld device, called a transducer, to send sound waves into your chest. It creates a picture of your heart on a screen. It takes about 30 to 60 minutes. Sarah is more than welcome to help you schedule the appointments. We’ll work around your schedule as much as possible. We can likely get you in next week, if that works for you. And I can write a note for your employer explaining the appointments, if needed. Would you like me to order those tests for you now?
PATIENT: Alright… sound waves… stickers… thirty minutes… an hour… I guess it's alright. Better to know what's goin' on, ya know? Sarah can schedule it. She's pretty good with all this stuff. She can call next week. Just… let her know what days work best. I gotta get back to work, unloadin' stuff. Can't be gone all day. And… if it's not too much trouble, that note for my employer would be good. Thanks. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’m ordering the EKG and echocardiogram now. I'll also print a note for your employer explaining the appointments. The receptionist will help Sarah schedule them when she calls. Now, based on what we've discussed today, I'm suspecting osteoarthritis in your knees and hands, which is a common condition as we age. The hand tremors could be related to that, or potentially something else, which is why we're running the tests. The fatigue and feeling down could be related to the overall discomfort and stress, but we'll want to rule out any other underlying causes. We’ll also monitor your blood pressure closely. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up today?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that's all. You explained everything pretty well. Sarah will take care of the tests. And… I appreciate you listenin'. It's good to talk about it, ya know? Sometimes it just helps to get it off your chest. Thank you, Doc. You’re a good doctor. I guess I should get goin'. Gotta get back to work. Unloadin' stuff ain’t gonna do itself. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Cleo. I’m glad I could help. Remember, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take it easy back at work. I’ll see you next week, after the tests. Have a good day.
PATIENT: You too, Doc. You have a good one. Sarah will be callin'… about the tests. .
