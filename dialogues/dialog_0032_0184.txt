DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Pleasure is a strong word. Look, I don’t have all day, young lady. It’s my… appearance. I don’t like what I see in the mirror no more. It’s…sagging. Everything is just sagging. I want it fixed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I see. You're concerned about some changes in your physical appearance. Specifically, you've noticed some…laxity in your tissues. Could you elaborate a bit on where exactly you're noticing this “sagging”?
PATIENT: Laxity? What kinda fancy words is that? Look, it’s all over! My belly, my arms…even my face! It used to be firm, you understand? Like steel. Now it’s…jelly. Everywhere I look, it’s just…down. And not in a good way. You got pictures of before and afters, right? Let’s see them. Don't waste my time talking in circles.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. And I apologize if my terminology was unclear. "Laxity" simply refers to a loss of firmness in the skin and underlying tissues. Now, while I appreciate your directness, I need to gather some more information before we discuss potential options. Showing you pictures without understanding the cause of these changes wouldn’t be helpful, and could even be misleading. First, has this been a recent development, or has it been a gradual process?
PATIENT: Gradual? Look, I ain't got time for history lessons! It’s happened over…years, I suppose. But it’s worse now. A lot worse. I used to be a strong man, you see? Pile driving all day, sun to sun. That’s hard work! But now… Now I just look old. And tired. It's the arms mostly, and the stomach. Can you fix the stomach? That’s what I want to know. Can you make it flat again? Like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I assure you, I'm not trying to waste your time. However, simply wanting to "fix" something isn't sufficient for a proper medical approach. We need to determine why these changes have occurred. Your history of physical labor is certainly relevant, but there are many other factors involved. Have you noticed any weight fluctuations recently?
PATIENT: Weight? A little. I used to weigh more, when I was working. Pile driving builds a man up, you know? Now I eat less. Don't need the fuel no more. But it ain't the weight, it’s the shape. It’s like everything just… melted. And it’s embarrassing, I tell you. My grandkids… they don't say anything, but I can see it in their eyes. Can you fix it or not? That’s all I need to know. Don't need a lecture about… whatever.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your concern, and I want to be clear: I can discuss potential cosmetic procedures. However, a responsible medical evaluation requires more than simply stating a desire for change. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to these changes, and to determine if you are a suitable candidate for any procedure. Before we discuss options, I’d like to ask a few questions about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmph. Diabetes? Heart disease? No! I was a strong man, remember? I built things! Never been sick a day in my life, 'til recently. Just…old. And tired. Look, I don't understand all this questioning. Is this some kinda trick? You gonna tell me I can't get it fixed? Just look at my stomach! It’s hanging! Surely you can see that. Can you tighten the skin or not? Stop with the questions!
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I assure you this is not a trick. My questions are necessary to ensure your safety and to determine the best course of action. Dismissing medical history is not helpful. We need to consider all possibilities. Now, I understand you’re frustrated, but I need you to answer my questions. Have you experienced any recent changes in your appetite or energy levels?
PATIENT: Look, I eat when I'm hungry, and I sleep when I'm tired. What kinda question is that?! I used to eat a whole roast chicken by myself, you know? Now… not so much. I just don't have the drive for it, alright? Less appetite, less energy… less of everything. But that ain't what I came here for! I came here to fix the sagging! Are you going to help me or not? I haven't got all day! And frankly, I'm starting to lose patience. You a doctor or a…questioner?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I am a doctor, and part of my job is to ensure that any procedure I consider is safe and appropriate for you. Reduced appetite and energy levels can be indicative of several underlying issues that could affect the success of any cosmetic intervention, or even make it dangerous. Now, to proceed, I need to perform a physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs, examining your skin, and palpating your abdomen. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Palpate? What kinda mumbo jumbo is that?! Look, I don't want you poking and prodding me. I know what's wrong! It’s old age and gravity! Just fix it! I don't need an examination. I need results! You got those pictures you showed me? Let's see 'em. And tell me what it'll cost. That’s all I want to know. Cost and results. No poking and prodding! I'm a grown man, and I know what my body looks like. Don’t waste my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, with all due respect, your insistence on skipping a proper medical evaluation is concerning. I cannot, and will not, discuss potential procedures without first determining if you are a suitable candidate. I understand your desire for quick results, but safety is paramount. Given your reluctance to cooperate with a physical examination, and your insistence on proceeding without a proper assessment, I am unable to offer any advice or treatment at this time. I recommend you seek a second opinion from another physician who may be more willing to accommodate your preferences. However, please understand that proceeding without a medical evaluation could be detrimental to your health. I will document my concerns in your chart. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Hmph. So you won't even look at it? Just because I know what's wrong? Fine! Waste of my time. A doctor who won't even look at a patient... unbelievable. You young doctors, all fancy talk and no action. No, there's nothing else. Just… a waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Trendler. Have a good day. .
