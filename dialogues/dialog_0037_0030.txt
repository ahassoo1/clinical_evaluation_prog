DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, but I've noticed a change in my body odor. It's...different than usual, and I wanted to get it checked out, just in case. It started maybe a week or so ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kerriann, no need to be embarrassed at all. Changes in body odor can have a lot of different causes, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. A week ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a week ago. Maybe a little longer, honestly. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. I usually don’t have much of an odor at all, even when I’m working hard. That’s why I noticed it. It's...sweeter, I guess? Not a bad sweet, but definitely not me.
DOCTOR: I understand. A change is what prompted you to come in, and that's smart. A sweeter odor... okay. And where are you noticing this change most prominently?
PATIENT: Hmm… mostly under my arms, I think. But I feel like it's…all over? It’s subtle, but I can smell it on my clothes, even after I wash them. I do a lot of physical labor at work, so I sweat, of course, but usually my clothes smell like…well, like sweat, not like something else. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Subtle and all over, even after washing... okay. And you mentioned physical labor at work. What kind of work do you do, Kerriann?
PATIENT: I’m a floor layer. Except carpet, wood, and hard tiles. Mostly vinyl and linoleum, things like that. It's pretty strenuous work, lots of bending and kneeling, and I'm on my feet all day. I’m usually pretty good at keeping clean, showering right after work and changing my clothes.
DOCTOR: Okay, floor laying – that is strenuous. And you're diligent about hygiene, which is good to know. Now, besides the change in body odor, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. No, not really. I've been a little more tired than usual, but I just figured that was from the heat. And maybe a bit more thirsty, but again, it’s August, it's hot! Nothing major. No weight loss, no fever, no new rashes... just the smell, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other significant symptoms. That's good information. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions, like diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I had a bit of high blood pressure a few years ago, but it was managed with medication for a while, and the doctor took me off of it when it went down. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy. I have Medicare, if that helps. And I was divorced about ten years ago, if that's relevant. I don't really have a regular doctor, honestly. I just go when something's wrong.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Kerriann. That's helpful. The blood pressure history is good to know. And no, the divorce isn't directly relevant to your current concern, but I appreciate you letting me know. Since you don't have a regular doctor, and you mentioned you’re on Medicare, I'll make sure we document everything thoroughly. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. And no serious illnesses. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps, chickenpox, but nothing since. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. I try to eat healthy, and I drink a lot of water. I really haven’t been sick much in my life.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Kerriann. A good health history is a great starting point. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think... My mother had diabetes, type 2 I think. And my father had heart problems. He had a stroke a few years before he passed away. My brother is healthy as far as I know, but we don't see each other much anymore. I don't really know much about my grandparents' medical history. They passed away when I was pretty young.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes and heart problems in the family. Noted. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. Not anything at all. I used to take a multivitamin for a while, but I stopped a few years ago. Just water, mostly! I really try to avoid taking pills if I can. I figure a good diet is better than anything they can prescribe.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No current medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, tried everything, and never had a reaction. I'm pretty sure I'm good there. Does that cover everything? I feel like I've told you my whole life story!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Kerriann. It’s important to get a complete picture. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s okay. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. It’s a fairly standard exam, and it will help me narrow down the possible causes of the change in your body odor. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if I need to do anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, if you could just sit back and relax. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is within normal limits. Skin appears normal, no rashes or lesions noted. I don't see anything immediately concerning. Do you notice any areas where you sweat more than others?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, mostly under my arms, but it doesn’t feel different. It just…smells different from under my arms. I always thought I didn’t sweat much, even when I'm working hard. It’s just never bothered me before, and I’ve always been able to go about my day without worrying about it. It’s just the change that’s concerning me. I don’t usually break a sweat at all unless I’m doing something really strenuous.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s helpful. A subtle change is often more concerning than a dramatic one. Now, I’m going to order some lab work just to rule out some of the more common causes of changes in body odor. I'll order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. These tests will give us a better idea of how your body is functioning overall. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. A complete blood count, a comprehensive… what did you call it? A panel? And something with the thyroid? Okay. That sounds good. Will I need to fast for any of these tests? I’m not a big breakfast person, but I like to have something before I start working.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for 10-12 hours before the comprehensive metabolic panel. That means no food or drinks – except water – from tonight until the morning of your blood draw. The CBC and TSH don't require fasting. I’ll also order a urinalysis. You’ll just need to provide a urine sample when you come in for the blood draw. I’ll have the lab requisition ready for you. They should be able to do the blood draw and collect the urine sample at the same time. Would you like me to go over anything else before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Fast for 10-12 hours, a urine sample, and the blood work. That’s all good. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. I really appreciate it. It makes me feel a lot better knowing we’re looking into it. Where do I go for the lab work? Is it here at the clinic?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. The lab is located just across the hall, in Suite 203. You can go anytime tomorrow. Just let the receptionist know you're here for Dr. AX's lab order. Once the results are back – typically within 3-5 business days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, chills, weight loss, or excessive thirst, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You've answered everything I've been wondering. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel much better knowing what to expect. I’ll go to the lab tomorrow and schedule the follow-up. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. It was a pleasure meeting you. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day as well, and don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes.
PATIENT: .
