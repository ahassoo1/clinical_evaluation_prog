DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kelder, welcome. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, it’s…it’s been a bit of a bother, this feeling. I just don't seem to be able to keep much food down lately. And I get full so quickly. It's not like me at all, you see. I used to have a good appetite. Though, goodness, that was…a while back now. My husband, bless his soul, always said I could eat a horse.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. So, a change in appetite and feeling full quickly, even with small amounts of food. And this has been happening for…how long now, would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Time…it slips away, doesn’t it? Let me think… it started, I reckon, maybe a month or so ago? It’s hard to say exactly. It wasn’t sudden, more like it crept up on me. At first, I just thought I wasn’t as hungry, but now… now it’s truly bothering me. I lose my energy easily, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or so, gradual onset. And you’ve noticed a loss of energy along with it. Any nausea or vomiting accompanying this, Mrs. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the nausea. That’s the worst of it, I think. It’s not… violent, if you know what I mean. More like a constant queasiness. It comes and goes, but it’s always there in the background. And… I haven’t actually thrown up, not exactly. Just… that feeling like I might, all the time. It's awful unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. Constant nausea, no vomiting… Have you noticed any abdominal pain, bloating, or changes in your bowel habits—either constipation or diarrhea—along with this?
PATIENT: Now, let me see... pain... not really pain, no. Just a sort of… discomfort, sometimes, after I try to eat. Bloating… maybe a little, but I'm not sure if that's just getting old! As for the other thing…well, things haven't been regular, I'll put it that way. A bit…stopped up, if you understand. It’s been like that for a little while now too. I don’t pay it much mind usually, but with everything else…
DOCTOR: Okay. So discomfort after eating, some bloating, and constipation. Have you noticed any heartburn or indigestion?
PATIENT: Heartburn…yes, I think so. It’s a burning feeling, isn’t it? Especially after supper. I thought it was just something I ate, sometimes. I try to take those little antacid tablets, but they don’t always help. Indigestion… yes, that too. Everything just feels… heavy. Oh, and sometimes…a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.
DOCTOR: Alright, heartburn, indigestion, sour taste in your mouth... And you're taking antacids, but with limited relief. Now, Mrs. Kelder, let's talk about other things. Any unintended weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Weight loss... yes, I suppose there has been. I haven't been weighing myself much lately, to be honest. I don't really like to. But my clothes are a little looser, and…well, my daughter, bless her heart, she said I look thinner when she visited last month. I just figured it was getting older, and not eating as much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Unintended weight loss noted. And you've noticed this over the past month or so, alongside the other symptoms. Have you had any changes in your appetite for specific foods?
PATIENT: Specific foods… well, it’s funny you ask. Everything just tastes… bland, now. I used to love a good roast chicken, but it doesn’t appeal to me anymore. And sweets... I don't even crave them. I mostly just pick at things, whatever seems easiest. I tried a nice piece of pie the other day, and I just couldn’t finish it. Which is very unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Loss of appetite for specific foods, things tasting bland. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. Go ahead. I'll try my best to answer. My memory isn't what it used to be, though.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, take your time. Do you have any history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Let me see… I think my husband had high blood pressure, but not me. The doctor checked me regularly, always said I was healthy as a horse. Cholesterol… I don’t rightly recall. I used to get regular check-ups, but it was years ago now. They did say something about my blood sugar once, but I can’t remember what they said exactly. It wasn’t anything to worry about, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll have to check your records to confirm. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmmm. Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, that was a long time ago. And… oh, yes! I had a hysterectomy when I was in my thirties. That was…well, it was a long time ago. Nothing else, not that I can recall.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tonsillectomy as a child, hysterectomy in your thirties. Now, what about any significant medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now that’s a hard one. My mother… she had some sort of trouble with her stomach, I think. They said it was cancer, but it was a long time ago, and I was just a girl. My father… he was a strong man, healthy as could be. My brother, bless his soul, he had heart trouble, but that was later in life. And my sister, she had arthritis, bad as could be. It seems like everyone has something, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It often does. Alright, history of stomach issues in your mother, heart trouble in your brother, and arthritis in your sister. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the antacids, dear. Like I said, they don’t seem to do much good. Oh, and I take a vitamin D supplement sometimes, in the winter. My daughter says I don't get enough sunshine. That’s about it, really. Nothing else. I try to stay natural, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Alright, antacids and occasional vitamin D. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, dear. Not that I'm aware of. I've always been pretty lucky, never had any trouble with allergies. I can eat anything, thankfully. Though I don’t much want to these days!
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Thank you, Mrs. Kelder, that's very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your reflexes. It shouldn't take too long.
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. My husband always said I was an open book, easy to read. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I'm not as spry as I used to be!
