DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… about getting surgery. For my weight, you know? My wife, she set up the appointment. I… honestly, I don’t remember all the details right now. Something about checking if I can have it? It’s a… bariatric surgery, right? She mentioned that name.
DOCTOR: Bariatric surgery, yes. Alright. Well, we need to determine if you are a suitable candidate, and that requires a bit of information. Your wife set up the appointment, that's helpful. It’s… common to be a little overwhelmed with all the details. Let's start with your current weight and height. You’re listed as 155 centimeters and 139 pounds, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. About… five foot one, and, uh, around 140 pounds. Something like that. I haven’t really… checked lately, to be honest. It’s just… been a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And for how long have you been… concerned about your weight?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. A long time. Since… well, after my kids were born, I guess. That was… almost 15 years ago now. It’s kind of always been there, but it's gotten worse in the last few years, I think. My wife says so, anyway. I… lose track of time sometimes. It’s hard to remember exactly when things started feeling… bad.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you tried any weight loss methods in the past?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few. Diets, mostly. You know, the kind my wife finds in magazines, or what people at work talk about. I tried that one with the grapefruit… and another one where you couldn't eat carbs. I stick to them for a little bit, but… it's hard. I always end up going back to eating what I like. It never really stays off. I did try exercising for a while, too, but… my knees started bothering me. I don’t know… it's just tough.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, previous attempts at diet and exercise with limited sustained success, and some knee pain. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. My wife handles most of that. I think the doctor said something about my cholesterol being a little high last time I had a checkup. And… I get heartburn sometimes, pretty bad. But other than that… I don’t really know. I haven’t been to the doctor much in the last few years. Honestly, I forget what they told me. Could you ask my wife, maybe? She’s got all the papers.
DOCTOR: It would be helpful to have that information. Alright. We can certainly review her records when she's available. For now, let's try to recall any major illnesses or surgeries you've had in the past. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Hmm… I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing soccer. That’s… about it, I think. And… I had my tonsils out when I was little, too. But nothing major since then. No big surgeries, no serious illnesses. Just the usual colds and flus, I guess. I really don’t remember much about any of it. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Childhood broken arm and tonsillectomy. No significant medical history otherwise, as you recall. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… something for the heartburn. It’s… a little pink pill. I think it’s called… Nexium? Or something like that. I take it when it gets really bad. And… sometimes I take a pain reliever for my knees, when they act up. Just ibuprofen, you know, the regular kind. Nothing else, I don’t think. My wife keeps track of all that stuff, so I could be forgetting something.
DOCTOR: Alright. Nexium as needed for heartburn, and ibuprofen for knee pain. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. My wife always asks before she gives me anything, so… I haven't had any bad reactions to anything. I get itchy sometimes, but that’s just from the heat, I think. We live in a hot place, you know? I don't think I'm allergic to anything. But, like I said, my wife would know better. She's always so careful.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it seems we’ve covered the basics, though relying heavily on your wife’s recollection. I’ll need to perform a physical exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. It’s… I just want to feel better, you know? My wife says this surgery could help, and I want to see if I'm a good candidate. I'm just… not very good at remembering things. So, if I forget something, please just ask.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with your vital signs. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. Blood pressure is… 148 over 92. Pulse is 88. Temperature is 98.6. A little elevated blood pressure, but not terribly concerning. Now, let me listen to your heart… Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen... Any pain or tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. A little… uncomfortable, maybe. But I don’t think it’s pain. It’s just… I have a bit of a belly, you know? It's always a little sensitive when someone pokes it. It’s probably just that. Nothing serious, I don’t think. I’m not a doctor, but… I’ve had this belly for a long time.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any difficulty breathing, chest pain, or swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. I get a little winded when I climb the stairs, but… that’s probably just from being out of shape. And no swelling in my legs, not that I’ve noticed. I wear sneakers all the time, so… I wouldn't really see it, I guess. Everything feels pretty normal, except for the belly, and the heartburn sometimes. You know, the usual things. It's not like I'm really sick, Doctor. Just… heavy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Knees have some crepitus with movement, consistent with osteoarthritis. We’ll need to consider that in the overall picture. Okay, I’m going to need to order some blood work to assess your overall health, including your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and kidney function. And we'll also need an EKG to rule out any underlying heart problems. Would you be able to come back to the clinic for a follow-up appointment next week to discuss the results?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Next week is fine. Whatever time works for you, Doctor. My wife can help me schedule it. She’s really good at all that stuff. I just… I want to get this done, you know? If this surgery can help me feel better, I want to do it. I’m just… a little nervous, I guess. It’s a big thing, right? Surgery?
DOCTOR: It is a significant procedure, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious. We'll discuss all the risks and benefits thoroughly before making any decisions. Let me get the lab orders printed for you. And I'll have the receptionist schedule your follow-up appointment. We'll review the results together and then determine if you are a suitable candidate for bariatric surgery. You’ll need to fast for 12 hours before your blood draw. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I know I’m not very good at remembering things. My wife will probably have a lot of questions, though. She’s… very thorough. I’ll let her know what you said. And I’ll try to remember to fast. I really appreciate you seeing me.
