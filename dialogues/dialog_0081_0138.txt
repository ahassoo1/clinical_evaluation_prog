DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor Paulino. It's nice to meet you. Land sakes, where do I begin? Well, my daughter, bless her heart, she's been worried about me. I’ve been… having these spells, I guess you could call them. My side feels weak sometimes, just… not as strong. And there’s been headaches, not terrible, but enough to bother me. It’s just… a little concerning, you know? My mother, she used to get awful migraines, and my brother… well, he had some trouble moving his arm a few years back. It's probably nothing, but we thought it best to check it out.
DOCTOR: Weakness on one side and headaches… and a family history of migraines and some neurological symptoms. Alright. Ms. Tofani, can you describe these “spells” in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Oh dear, detail… that’s always the hardest part for me. It comes and goes, you see? It’s not constant. Sometimes I just feel… a heaviness, like a weight on my right side. My arm feels clumsy, and it’s harder to… button my coat, things like that. And the headache usually comes with it, a dull ache, mostly behind my eye. It doesn’t last long, maybe an hour or so, and then it’s gone. It’s hard to pinpoint when it happens, though. I don't really notice it until it is happening, if that makes any sense. I was making dinner the other day, and I almost dropped a plate… that’s when my daughter really got worried.
DOCTOR: Intermittent weakness on the right side, clumsiness, headaches accompanying the weakness. Plate dropping incident noted. Hmm. And how often would you say these episodes occur, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a tricky one. Not every day, definitely. Maybe… once a week? Sometimes two weeks go by without one. It’s been worse lately, I think. Or maybe I’m just paying more attention. It's hard to say, really. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. My daughter keeps a calendar, she's wonderful, but even she hasn't written down every single time. I think it happens more when I'm tired, or stressed. But everything stresses me these days, to be honest!
DOCTOR: Stress and fatigue as potential triggers. Alright. Now, Ms. Tofani, aside from the weakness and headaches, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well, sometimes my vision gets a little blurry, just for a moment. Like looking through a fog, but it goes away quickly. And… oh! I’ve been feeling a bit dizzy sometimes, especially when I stand up fast. Not enough to fall, mind you, but enough to make me steady myself. I don't know if that's related, though. Old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: Transient blurry vision and dizziness upon standing. Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, let’s see… Well, the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, so he put me on a little pill. I take it every morning, keeps it under control, he said. Otherwise… not much, really. I had the flu once, a bad one, but that was years ago. My knees bother me sometimes, arthritis, the doctor says, but what old woman doesn’t have bad knees? Nothing else that I can think of, really.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, managed with medication. Arthritis. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Let me see... Oh! Yes, I take a little something for my cholesterol, the doctor said it was a bit high too. Just a small white pill, every night before bed. And… and sometimes I take something for my heartburn. It doesn’t bother me every day, but when it does, I take a little pink one. My daughter keeps track of all of it, she’s very organized. I'm probably forgetting something, though.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, occasional heartburn medication. Alright. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, dear. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. Maybe a little sniffly when the pollen is bad in the spring, but nothing serious. I've never had a bad reaction to any of the pills the doctor has given me. I remember when I was a little girl, I was allergic to bee stings, but that was a long time ago, and I haven’t been stung since!
DOCTOR: No known drug allergies documented… Alright. Now, Ms. Tofani, let's talk about your family history. You mentioned your mother had migraines and your brother had trouble with his arm. Are there any other significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… that’s a long one. My father, he had heart trouble, passed away when I was quite young. And my sister, she had diabetes, later in life. A few of my cousins, they’ve had strokes, I think. It’s hard to keep track of everything, you see? We were a big family, and everyone lived so far apart. My daughter has been trying to piece it together, she’s very good at that sort of thing. She says there’s been some talk of dementia on my grandmother’s side, but that was a long time ago, and it wasn’t ever really talked about much.
DOCTOR: History of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and possible dementia in the family. Alright. Now, Ms. Tofani, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I'm retired, so I don't have a lot of a "lifestyle" these days. I live at home with my husband, bless his heart, he's a good man but a little… forgetful himself these days. I used to be very active, I loved to garden, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. I mostly spend my time reading, watching television, and visiting with my children and grandchildren. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much alcohol, just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: Retired, lives with husband, enjoys reading and visiting family. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. Alright. Ms. Tofani, I'm going to do a quick physical exam now. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I always trust the doctor. Just try not to poke too much, my bones are a little fragile these days!
DOCTOR: Very good. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear, no wheezes or crackles. No bruits detected. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Is this good? My eyesight isn't what it used to be, so if I miss it, please just tell me. It’s harder to see things clearly now, especially little things. Just let me know if I’m not following it correctly.
DOCTOR: Eye movements are full and smooth, no nystagmus. Now, could you please squeeze my hands tightly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Is that alright? I try to keep my hands strong, you know? Helps with the gardening, even if I can't do as much anymore. I’m squeezing as hard as I can.
DOCTOR: Grip strength is slightly diminished on the right side, but within normal limits. Now, could you please push against my hands like you’re trying to lift something heavy?
PATIENT: Like this? It feels a little… harder on this side, I think. Not painful, just… a bit weaker. My daughter always says I favor my left side.
DOCTOR: Right arm strength is noticeably reduced compared to the left. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal bilaterally. And finally, I’ll check your gait. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Just be careful, I'm a little wobbly sometimes. My knees aren't what they used to be, you know? And… sometimes I stumble a little. Just a little.
DOCTOR: Gait is slightly shuffling and unsteady, with reduced arm swing on the right side. Alright, Ms. Tofani, thank you. That’s all for the physical exam. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, I’m concerned about possible neurological issues. The weakness on your right side, along with the headaches and dizziness, are concerning. It’s too early to say for sure what’s going on, but we need to do some further testing.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Testing? That doesn’t sound very good, does it? What kind of testing? Is it something serious? I was hoping it was just old age catching up with me, but that doesn't sound very reassuring. I trust your judgment, doctor, but I'm a little scared.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Tofani. It’s perfectly natural to be worried. We’re going to start with an MRI of your brain to get a better look at what's going on. This will help us rule out anything serious, like a stroke or a tumor. We'll also do some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any other potential causes. It doesn’t necessarily mean there is something serious, but we need to be thorough. The MRI is painless, you just lie very still for about 30-40 minutes. The blood work is just a routine check. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Well, if you think it's best, doctor. I suppose I don't have much of a choice, do I? Thirty to forty minutes… I can manage that. I just don't like being confined, and I get a little anxious in those machines. And blood work… oh, I never did like needles. But if it will help find out what's going on, then yes, I’m comfortable with it. Please just tell me what to expect, and if it will be painful. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Tofani. I’ll explain everything in detail. The MRI machine is a large, tunnel-like structure. You'll lie on a table that slides into the tunnel. It’s important to lie very still during the scan, and it can be a little noisy. You'll have headphones to wear so you can hear me talk to you and listen to music if you like. It’s not painful at all, but some people feel a little claustrophobic. If you feel anxious at any time, you can press a button to stop the scan. As for the blood work, it's just a small prick in your arm. You might feel a little pinch, but it’s over very quickly. The nurse will take care of you. I'll have my nurse schedule both the MRI and the blood work for you. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You explained it very well, doctor. Just… thirty to forty minutes, you said? That seems like a long time to lie still. And is there anything I need to do to prepare for the MRI? Should I avoid anything? I always forget these things, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a little while, but you can close your eyes and relax. You don't need to do much to prepare, Ms. Tofani. Please remove any jewelry or metal objects, like hairpins or watches. And it’s very important to let me know if you have any metal implants in your body, like a pacemaker or artificial joint. We’ll go over a full safety questionnaire before the scan. The radiologist will also ask you about this. Nothing to eat or drink prior to the MRI. The main thing is to just relax and try to stay still. Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very patient with all my questions, doctor. It’s just… worrying, you know? My mother always said worrying wouldn't solve anything, but it's hard not to. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. When should I expect to hear back about the results?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be worried, Ms. Tofani. And you're very welcome. I'm happy to answer any questions you have. The results of the MRI will take a couple of days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. It typically takes 2-3 business days for the radiologist to generate the report and me to review it. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as weakness, headache, dizziness, or difficulty speaking, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. A couple of days… I can manage that. I'll try not to worry too much in the meantime, but it's hard, you know? And I’ll definitely contact the office if anything changes. Thank you again, doctor. You’ve put my mind a little more at ease. I suppose I'll let my daughter handle scheduling everything. She's much better at these things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Tofani. I'm glad I could help. And that’s a very good idea, let your daughter handle the scheduling. She sounds very capable. I'll have the nurse come in and give you the instructions for the MRI and blood work, and the contact information for the office. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Tofani. And please, try to relax.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, doctor. You too. And I will try. Bye-bye.
