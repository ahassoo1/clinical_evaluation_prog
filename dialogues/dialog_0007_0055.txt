DOCTOR: Hi Ellan, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s… Ellan Rannells. Yes. Well, to be frank, I’ve heard things are… changing. And my daughter, bless her heart, she thinks I ought to look into this… medical marijuana. She says it’s for… ailments. I haven't a clue what all the fuss is about, but she insisted. I suppose I'm here to see if I even qualify for such a thing. It all seems rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ellan, I understand. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to understand your options and what’s involved, and it's good your daughter is looking out for you. Medical marijuana is becoming a more common topic, and it can be helpful for certain conditions. Let's talk through things to see if it might be something worth exploring for you. To start, could you tell me a little bit more about what’s been going on with you?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, what hasn’t been going on? At my age, things are bound to ache. Mostly it's my joints, you see. Knees, hips, the usual. And this… stiffness in my hands. Makes it difficult to do my work, truthfully. Though, I don't expect any sympathy for that. A bailiff’s life isn’t exactly known for being gentle on the body. But it’s… persistent. And the pain keeps me from my garden, which is… unacceptable. I've been using creams, those over-the-counter things, and they do… something. But it’s hardly a solution, is it? I certainly don't want to start popping pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Right, so joint pain – knees, hips, hands – and stiffness. It’s impacting your ability to work and, importantly, enjoy your garden. And you’re understandably hesitant about taking pain pills. That's very reasonable. Just to get a clearer picture, how long have you been experiencing this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s not a recent development, Doctor. It’s been… building, I suppose, for a good five years now. At first, it was just a little ache after a long day. Then it became more frequent, more… noticeable. The last two years it’s been… well, a constant companion, really. I simply thought it was part of getting older. One tolerates these things, you see. You don’t go running to a doctor for every little creak and groan. But my daughter… she insisted I get it checked. And now here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, five years of progressive joint pain, getting worse over the last two. And you’re right to mention it's been gradual – that's important information. Now, aside from the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Well, I sleep… less than I used to. Not terribly, mind you, but I don’t get the deep, restful sleep I once did. I wake up feeling… stiff. And sometimes my hands… they tingle. Not constantly, but often enough to be… irritating. It’s more noticeable in the mornings, or after I’ve been… using my hands a lot. Doing paperwork, mostly. A bailiff’s work isn’t all boots and doors, you know. There’s a great deal of administration involved. But other than that… no. No fevers, no swelling, no… dramatic symptoms. Just aches and pains and a little… inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Okay, so disturbed sleep, stiffness upon waking, and tingling in your hands, especially with use. That’s helpful. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, just to get a full picture. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I had a bout of… bronchitis, many years ago. Nothing serious. And I was told, some time back, that my cholesterol was a little high. They put me on a… a statin, I believe it was called. I stopped taking it, though. Didn't seem to make much difference, and my daughter, bless her heart, said they have too many… side effects. And… let me think. Oh, yes. I had a rather nasty fall, ten years ago, broke my wrist. But it healed, properly. Other than that… no. Nothing major. Certainly no arthritis. I’ve always been very… active. I believe in keeping busy. Still do, as much as I can. Though these aches and pains… they do make things difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of bronchitis, high cholesterol , and a healed wrist fracture. No diagnosis of arthritis. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the one, Doctor. A hysterectomy, many, many years ago. Before your daughter was even a thought, you see. It was… necessary, at the time. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall, but that was… a long time ago. Everything healed properly, no complications. I haven’t been under the knife since. And I intend to keep it that way, if I can avoid it. All these modern procedures… they seem rather… invasive.
DOCTOR: Alright, hysterectomy many years ago, no other surgeries. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family with arthritis, or any other joint problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother, bless her soul, she had… trouble with her hands, in her later years. Not arthritis, exactly, but she complained of a great deal of stiffness and aching. She attributed it to… housework, mostly. She was a very… industrious woman. And my grandfather, on my husband’s side, he had… gout, I believe it was. Dreadful affliction. Swollen feet, terrible pain. But other than that… no. No widespread family history of joint problems, as far as I know. Although, families rarely speak of such things, do they? It's all rather… private.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. A history of hand problems in your mother and gout in your husband’s grandfather. Alright. And lastly, regarding your lifestyle – do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. And alcohol? Only a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. Perhaps once a month. My husband enjoys a… nip of brandy after dinner, but I find it… unnecessary. I believe in a sensible lifestyle, Doctor. A good diet, plenty of activity… as much as I can manage, these days. And a good night’s sleep. Though that’s becoming increasingly difficult, as you know. I simply can't abide excess. It never leads to anything good.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very occasional alcohol. That’s excellent. And you prioritize a healthy lifestyle. Now, before we proceed, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, Doctor. I’ve never been one for taking pills, as you’ve probably gathered. A little cream for the aches and pains, occasionally, but nothing serious. I had a reaction to penicillin, many years ago, when I was a child, but that was… a long time ago. Other than that, no. I’ve always been quite… robust, in that regard. My daughter does worry, of course. She insists on knowing everything, but I assure you, I’m not allergic to anything… significant. She’s just… cautious.
DOCTOR: Okay, a childhood reaction to penicillin, but no other known allergies. Alright, Ellan, thank you for that detailed history. It sounds like you've been dealing with these aches and pains for quite some time, and it's understandable you'd like to explore all your options. Now, would you mind if I performed a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on with your joints?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I suppose not. Though I must confess, I'm not terribly fond of being… poked and prodded. But if it's necessary, I suppose I can endure it. Just be gentle, if you would be so kind. And please, don't keep me longer than necessary. I have a garden that needs attending to, you see. And my daughter… she's expecting me home for dinner. Though she'll likely quiz me for hours about this whole… ordeal.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ellan. I'll be as gentle and efficient as possible. I promise not to keep you any longer than needed. First, I'm just going to take a look at your hands. Can you open and close your fists for me, and then spread your fingers apart?
PATIENT: There. As you can see, Doctor, it's not as nimble as it once was. A little stiff, you see. And this… tingling. It's more pronounced today, I think. All this… discussing it. It seems to aggravate it. A bailiff’s hands need to be… precise, you know. For paperwork, and… other things. It's rather inconvenient. I do hope you can find something to help.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ellan. I do see some slight stiffness, and there’s a little tenderness when I press here on the base of your fingers, and along the knuckles. No visible swelling or redness, thankfully. Can you rotate your wrists for me, both clockwise and counterclockwise?
PATIENT: There. As you can see, Doctor, it’s not a fluid motion. It… cracks a little. And it’s… uncomfortable. I haven’t done any heavy lifting, lately. Simply paperwork and… the usual. I believe it’s just… age, Doctor. Simply the body wearing down. Though my daughter insists it’s something… more serious. She has a great deal of… anxiety, you see. Everything is a potential… catastrophe, in her eyes. But I assure you, I’m not falling apart. Not yet, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant swelling or warmth in the wrists. Now, let’s move to your knees. Could you please bend your knees as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: There. As you can see, Doctor, it’s not as… accommodating as it once was. And it’s rather… noisy. All this bending and creaking. It’s most unpleasant, I assure you. And the pain… it’s not excruciating, but it’s certainly… noticeable. It's the same with getting up and down, you see. It’s a rather slow process these days. I haven’t been able to tend to my roses properly, lately. And my daughter… well, you can imagine. She’s quite passionate about my garden. She says it's… therapeutic. But it's becoming increasingly difficult to maintain.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ellan. There's a bit of crepitus – that’s the crackling sound – and some limited range of motion, as you mentioned. There's no significant swelling or warmth, which is good. Now, just one more quick thing. Can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. As you can see, Doctor, it's not a particularly graceful performance. A little… uneven, perhaps. And it’s rather slow. I used to be quite nimble, you know. But age… it takes its toll. I try to maintain a steady pace, but it's becoming increasingly difficult. I used to walk for miles, you see. But now… it’s simply a few steps at a time. And my daughter… she insists on accompanying me, just in case I… topple over. She’s a very… protective woman. But it’s rather… embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ellan. Thank you. That gives me a good idea. Based on what you've told me and what I've observed during the exam, it appears you’re experiencing some joint pain and stiffness, likely related to age-related wear and tear. We call this osteoarthritis, and it’s very common. There’s no sign of any major inflammation or anything more serious. It's causing you discomfort and limiting your ability to enjoy your garden and walk comfortably, and that's understandably frustrating. Now, before we discuss potential treatment options, I'd like to order some simple blood tests to rule out other possibilities, such as rheumatoid arthritis. It's unlikely, but it's always best to be thorough. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, goodness. I’m not terribly fond of needles, Doctor. But if it’s necessary… if it will rule out anything… serious… then I suppose I can endure it. My daughter would insist on it, anyway. She’s quite… meticulous, you see. Always wanting to be… certain. Just promise me it won't take too long, and that the… practitioner is gentle. I’ve never been one for medical procedures, as you’ve gathered. And I have a garden that needs tending to, you see. The roses are… demanding.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ellan. I understand your reluctance. It won’t take long, just a simple blood draw. And I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle and experienced. We’ll get it done as quickly and efficiently as possible. The blood tests will simply help us to confirm a diagnosis and rule out any other underlying conditions. If everything comes back normal, we can then focus on managing your osteoarthritis symptoms. We can discuss treatment options like physical therapy, over-the-counter pain relief, and in some cases, if needed, prescription medications. And we can certainly explore whether medical marijuana might be a helpful addition to your plan. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed with the blood tests?
PATIENT: Medical marijuana… yes. That’s what my daughter was most insistent on, you see. Does it… really work? And what would it involve? I’ve heard… stories. About… side effects. And the… legality of it all. I wouldn’t want to get myself into trouble. I’m a law-abiding citizen, Doctor. I simply want to be able to tend to my garden, and walk comfortably. Is that too much to ask? And if it does help… how long would I have to… take it? It sounds rather… involved. And I'm not sure my husband would approve. He’s a very… traditional man, you see.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ellan. Let’s address them one by one. First, does it really work?
PATIENT: Yes, that's what I meant. Does it really work?
DOCTOR: Okay. Medical marijuana can be helpful for some people with osteoarthritis. It won't work for everyone, but for many, it can reduce pain, improve sleep, and help with stiffness. It works by interacting with the body's endocannabinoid system, which plays a role in pain regulation and inflammation. Now, as for side effects, like with any medication, there can be some. Common side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, and drowsiness. More serious side effects are rare, but can include anxiety or changes in cognitive function. We would start with a very low dose and gradually increase it as needed, to minimize any potential side effects. Regarding legality, the laws are complex and vary by state. Here, we are in a state where medical marijuana is legal with a doctor's recommendation. We would need to complete the necessary paperwork to ensure you are in compliance with all regulations. As for how long you would need to take it, that depends on your response. It's not a cure, but it can provide symptom relief as long as you continue to use it. We would regularly monitor your progress and adjust your dosage as needed. And finally, regarding your husband’s concerns, that’s something you would need to discuss with him. However, it’s becoming increasingly accepted, and many people are finding it to be a safe and effective treatment option. Would you like me to explain the process of obtaining a medical marijuana card and how it would work in our clinic?
PATIENT: A medical marijuana card? Oh, goodness. It sounds rather… complicated. And I'm not particularly tech-savvy, you see. I struggle with the television remote, as it is. And paperwork… I simply loathe paperwork. My daughter handles all the bills and… insurance, bless her heart. She's quite capable, but… I’m not sure I could manage it on my own. And what about the… smell? I wouldn’t want to offend my neighbors, or my husband. He’s very… particular about fragrances, you see. And I don't want to draw any… unwanted attention. It sounds rather… disruptive. I simply want to tend to my garden, Doctor. Is there no simpler solution? Perhaps just a stronger cream? Or a… pill? Something less… involved?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ellan. It does sound more complicated than you’d like, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want a simpler solution. Let’s forget about the medical marijuana card for now. It’s not the right option for everyone, and if it causes you anxiety, then it’s not worth pursuing. You’re right to ask about other options. We can certainly try a stronger topical cream. There are some excellent over-the-counter options available, and I can recommend a few that might be helpful. We can also discuss prescription pain relievers, but as you mentioned, you’re hesitant about taking pills, and that’s perfectly valid. Another option we can explore is physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen your muscles, improve your range of motion, and reduce your pain. It's a more hands-on approach and doesn’t involve any medications. Before we make any decisions, let’s get those blood tests done to rule out other conditions. Then, we can discuss these options in more detail and create a plan that’s right for you. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds much more reasonable, Doctor. No cards, no… smells. Simply a stronger cream, and perhaps some… exercises. I used to enjoy swimming, you know. Perhaps I could resume that. And the blood tests… yes. If it will rule out anything… serious. My daughter will be relieved, I suspect. She's always wanting to be… certain. Alright. Let's proceed with the blood tests, then. And perhaps you could recommend a good physical therapist? One who is… gentle? And patient? I'm not as nimble as I used to be, you see. And perhaps a list of those… stronger creams? Just in case. My garden is… demanding, you know. And I want to be able to tend to my roses. That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That sounds like a great plan, Ellan. I'll have my nurse draw your blood right away. It won’t take long. While you’re waiting, I’ll print out a list of recommended physical therapists in the area, and a list of those stronger creams for you. I’ll make sure to include therapists who have experience working with patients with arthritis, and who are known for being gentle and patient. I also have some brochures on arthritis and managing pain that you might find helpful. Once we have the blood test results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a more detailed plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly alright. Thank you. You've been most… reassuring. And helpful. I feel much… calmer now. My daughter will be pleased, I suspect. She's always worrying, you see. Alright. Let's proceed with the blood tests, then. And I appreciate the list of… gentle therapists. My roses are… waiting. And I want to be able to tend to them. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been most… considerate.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ellan. It’s my pleasure. The nurse will be right in to draw your blood. Don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns. And please, don’t worry about your roses. We'll work together to get you back to enjoying your garden. Have a good day, Ellan.
