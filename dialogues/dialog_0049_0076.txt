DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's these bumps on my legs. They're on my shins, and they really hurt, you know? Red and kinda hard. They've been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Bumps on your shins, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Not like bruises, though. More...like little knots. And they ache, especially after I've been on my feet all day. I work moving things, so that’s pretty often. Do you...need me to show you?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Let me have a look. Please, have a seat on the examination table and pull your pants up enough so I can see your shins. It helps to understand exactly what we're dealing with.
PATIENT: Here. See? This one’s the worst, I think. And there's a smaller one here... feels kinda tender to the touch. I don’t remember hurting my legs, though.
DOCTOR: Alright... yes, I see them. They do appear to be rather…firm. And slightly raised. No visible bruising or open sores. Skin temperature is normal to the touch. Moderate tenderness upon palpation of the larger nodule on the right shin. No edema observed. Have you noticed any changes in your skin elsewhere?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. Let me think. No, not really. I get a little dry skin sometimes, especially in the winter, but nothing like these bumps. Just the usual, I guess. Nothing new on my arms or chest or anything like that. I haven’t really looked closely, if that makes sense. I just noticed these on my legs because they hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long have these bumps been present?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Not too long, I don’t think. Maybe… a month or so? It started with just one, I remember that. I figured I just bumped it, you know? But then a couple more showed up. It’s been slowly getting worse since then, but not fast, if that makes sense. It’s just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Persistent…right. Any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not that I've noticed. I haven’t felt sick, just these bumps hurting. No chills, no sweats either. My wife would notice if I was running a fever, she's always checking on me! She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any history of diabetes, or any issues with circulation in your legs?
PATIENT: Diabetes…? No, not that I know of. Doctors always check when I go for my yearly checkup, and they haven’t said anything. And circulation… well, I work on my feet all day, like I said. Sometimes they feel a little tired at the end of the day, but not like numb or anything. I walk a lot, if that helps. I thought it was good for my circulation! Do you… need me to tell you my medical history? I have a list somewhere, if you want.
DOCTOR: No, that's alright for now. I can pull up your records. Let me see...your last physical was six months ago. No mention of diabetes, and vitals were within normal limits. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Traveled? No, not really. We go to church every Sunday, but that’s about it. And we visited my daughter in the next town over last month, but that wasn’t very far. No planes, no big trips… just local stuff. I don't do well on airplanes, honestly. Makes me nervous. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Sometimes it can be. Alright. And any recent injuries to your legs?
PATIENT: Injuries…? No, not that I can recall. Like I said, I haven’t really bumped them or anything. I work around boxes and stuff, but I'm pretty careful. Maybe a little scrape here or there, but nothing major. I'm getting old, Doctor, I get scrapes easily these days! My skin isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on what you've told me, and a quick examination, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing these bumps. They could be a number of things. One possibility is a form of localized vasculitis, but we'd need further testing to confirm that. Another possibility, given your work, could be a reaction to something you’re exposed to. I’m going to order some blood work to check your inflammatory markers, and we’ll do a skin biopsy to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and a biopsy…? Oh. That sounds… serious. What exactly is vasculitis? And a biopsy… is that going to hurt? I don't like needles, Doctor. And I'm not sure what inflammatory markers are… could you explain it to me a little bit? I don't want to get too worried if I don’t understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's break it down. Vasculitis is inflammation of the blood vessels. Think of them like tiny pipes in your body. When they get inflamed, it can cause bumps and pain, like what you're experiencing. The blood work will help us look for signs of inflammation in your body. As for the biopsy, it’s a small sample of your skin that we'll send to a lab for analysis. It will help us determine the exact cause of the bumps. It will involve a small injection to numb the area, and then a tiny punch to remove a small piece of skin. It shouldn’t be overly painful, but there will be some discomfort. It’s standard procedure, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable. Does that make more sense?
PATIENT: Okay… so it’s not like… a big surgery or anything? Just a little pinch and a sample of skin? And it'll help figure out why these bumps are hurting? That sounds… a little better. But what if it's something serious? My wife will be worried sick. What are the chances it's just… something simple? Like a bad reaction to my work boots or something?
DOCTOR: It is not a major surgery, no. It’s a relatively simple procedure, performed in the office. And while we need to investigate to rule out anything serious, it is possible it could be something minor. A reaction to your boots, a localized infection… we need the tests to tell us for sure. The chances are difficult to quantify without the results, frankly. We will start with the blood work and the biopsy, and then we will discuss the results and create a plan. I can order a referral to a dermatologist as well, if you would like a second opinion. They are experts in skin conditions. Would that be something you’d be interested in?
PATIENT: A dermatologist… that sounds… good, maybe. A second opinion couldn't hurt, I suppose. My wife always says it's better to be safe than sorry. Okay, yes, let’s do the blood work and the biopsy. And the referral to a dermatologist. When can we get the blood work done? And how long will it take to get the results? I have to go back to work on Monday, you know. I can't be out too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve ordered the blood work. You can go to the lab down the hall – they take walk-ins, but it might be a bit of a wait. The results typically take 3-5 business days. As for the biopsy, we can schedule that for tomorrow morning. It will only take about 15 minutes. As for the dermatologist, I’m sending a referral now. It may take a week or two to get an appointment. Here you go. I’ll have the nurse call you tomorrow to confirm the biopsy appointment. I understand you need to get back to work, and we'll try to expedite everything as much as possible. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Three to five days for the blood work… okay. And a week or two for the dermatologist. That’s… a little longer than I hoped, but it is what it is, I suppose. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… try to hurry things along if you can, Doctor. My wife is going to worry. And I need to get back to work. Thank you, Doctor Nestingen. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I’ll see you tomorrow, then. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Aluia. I will do my best. The nurse will be in touch. Have a good day.
