DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I'm pleased to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Reisig, you say? Fancy name. Well, I’m here because… honestly, I don’t much feel like letting anyone poke and prod at my feet. Never have. Seems unnecessary, if you ask me. I've lived a long life just fine without it. Though my daughter, bless her heart, insisted. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s good of your daughter to look out for you, and I certainly don't want to do anything you're uncomfortable with. It sounds like this visit is, at least in part, to address your daughter’s concerns. To help me understand things better, could you tell me a little more about why she’s worried about your feet?
PATIENT: Oh, she just goes on and on about circulation and… and swelling, I think. Says I shouldn't be walking barefoot, which is ridiculous! I’ve been walking barefoot in my garden for eighty years! And something about diabetes, always mentioning diabetes. I don’t have diabetes. I’d know if I did. Though, to be fair, my memory isn’t what it used to be. But I definitely haven’t been told I have that… sugar sickness. Is that what it’s called?
DOCTOR: It's good you're aware of your daughter's concerns, and it's very helpful to hear what she’s noticed. It sounds like she's concerned about potential issues with circulation and the possibility of diabetes. “Sugar sickness” is a common way to refer to diabetes, yes. Just to be thorough, Ms. Gunasekara, have you ever been formally tested for diabetes?
PATIENT: Tested? Hmm… Now that you mention it… I honestly can't recall. I've seen so many doctors over the years, it all blurs together. Back when my husband was still alive, we had that doctor, Dr. Miller… a good man. But that was… oh, goodness, decades ago. I doubt he tested me for anything like that. I was young and healthy then! Or, at least, I felt healthy. I mostly just went for check-ups. I really don’t remember specifics. Is it important? Because if it's not, I'd rather not bother with it. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you don't recall specific tests from the past. It's good you had regular check-ups with Dr. Miller, though. Testing for diabetes is important, Ms. Gunasekara, particularly as we age. It’s a common condition, and early detection allows us to manage it effectively and prevent complications. It's a simple blood test, and we can discuss options to make it as comfortable as possible for you. Before we decide about testing, let's talk a bit more about what's been going on with your feet. You mentioned your daughter is concerned about swelling. Have you noticed any swelling in your feet or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling… well, sometimes. When it’s really hot, perhaps. Or if I’ve been on my feet all day in the garden. But it goes away! I just put my feet up, that's all. I don’t consider it a problem. It's just… what happens when you're old, isn't it? Everything swells a little. Besides, my ankles are rather… substantial. Always have been. It's hard to tell if they're more swollen than usual. I suppose I haven’t really been looking at my feet, if I'm being honest. Too busy with other things.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s common for some swelling to occur with age and activity. Since your daughter is concerned and you've noticed some swelling, it would be helpful to take a closer look. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam of your feet and ankles?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A physical exam? Is that going to involve… poking and prodding? I really don’t like being poked and prodded. Honestly. I feel like they always try to find something wrong just to… I don’t know, justify their existence? Is there really any need for it? I'm perfectly capable of feeling my own feet, thank you very much. I've been walking on them for eighty-three years!
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Ms. Gunasekara. I assure you, my intention is not to find something wrong, but to get a better understanding of what's going on and to address your daughter’s concerns. The exam will be gentle, and I will explain everything I’m doing as I go. It involves checking your pulses, looking at the skin on your feet for any changes, and briefly assessing your range of motion. We can take it very slowly, and if at any point you're uncomfortable, we'll stop immediately. I'm also happy to discuss alternatives if you'd prefer. However, a quick exam is often the best way to rule out any underlying issues. Would you be willing to let me start by simply checking your pulses?
PATIENT: Pulses… that sounds… less intrusive, I suppose. But don't go poking around! Just a quick check, you said? And you'll tell me what you're doing beforehand? Alright, fine. But if it gets uncomfortable, I'm stopping you. Don't think I won't. And don’t expect me to cooperate if you start asking me to do silly things, like wiggle my toes. I haven’t got the patience for that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Gunasekara. Just a quick check of your pulses, and I'll explain each step beforehand. No silly things, I promise! First, let’s just take a look at your feet. Could you please remove your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. But don’t stare, young lady. I haven’t had a pedicure in… well, I can’t even remember. And be gentle! These old bones aren't as forgiving as they used to be. I hope you have a comfortable chair... my feet might need a rest after all this fuss.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Gunasekara. I completely understand. Please, take your time. And yes, I have a comfortable chair. Now, if you'll allow me, I'm going to gently feel for your pulses in your ankles and the tops of your feet. This helps us assess blood flow to your legs and feet. I'll let you know exactly what I'm doing as I go, and please, tell me if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, but no sudden movements! And be quick about it. I haven't got all day, you know. My garden needs tending, and the tomatoes won't pick themselves. And please, don't make any alarming noises. I don't like surprises. Just… get it over with. And tell me what you're feeling for, exactly. I want to know everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Gunasekara. I'm feeling for your pulses – these are the points where we can feel the blood flowing through the arteries in your feet. I'm checking to see if they feel strong and regular. Your dorsalis pedis pulse feels… a little diminished, meaning it’s slightly weaker than I’d expect. It's not absent, but it’s not as strong as it could be. Your posterior tibial pulse is present, but also feels somewhat weak. This doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it does warrant a little further investigation. I'd like to take a closer look at your skin, checking for any changes in color or temperature. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Weak, you say? Well, that doesn't sound good. I knew I shouldn't have let you poke and prod. Always something with doctors, isn't it? Always finding something wrong. I suppose… I suppose you can look at my skin. But don’t stare too long, and don’t make a face. I don’t want to know if you’re judging my bunions. And be gentle! I've already told you, these old bones… Honestly, I should have just stayed home and tended to my tomatoes. At least they don't judge me.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Gunasekara, I’m not judging anything. I’m simply gathering information to understand what’s going on. I'm looking for any changes that might indicate a circulation issue or other concern. I notice some mild discoloration on your ankles, a bit of a reddish hue. Your skin feels slightly cool to the touch, and there’s some mild dryness. I also see a small area of cracking on your heel. These findings, combined with the diminished pulses, suggest we might want to investigate further. To get a clearer picture, I would recommend a simple blood test to check your blood sugar levels and a vascular study to assess blood flow in your legs and feet. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… vascular studies? Oh, for goodness sake. It never ends with you doctors, does it? Always something more. Honestly, I feel like I’m falling apart just listening to you. And needles! I hate needles. But… my daughter would want me to. She worries so much. And I suppose… I suppose it’s better to know, even if it’s bad news. Fine. You can do your tests. But make it quick, and be gentle! And don’t expect me to be happy about it. And if it turns out to be nothing, I’m blaming you for all the fuss. And I want a full report afterwards, in plain English, none of that medical jargon. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Gunasekara. And yes, I promise to explain everything in plain English – no jargon at all. I will order the blood tests and refer you to a vascular specialist for the study. We'll schedule those appointments as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend keeping your feet warm and dry, avoiding tight shoes, and checking your feet daily for any cuts, blisters, or redness. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Well… how long will all of this take? I don’t want to be spending weeks going back and forth to doctors. And will it be painful? I've got a garden to tend, you know. Tomatoes don't wait for anyone. And… will it cost a lot of money? Medicare doesn’t cover everything, and I'm on a fixed income. Oh, and… will I have to change my diet? I like my food. A lot. Just tell me the truth, young lady. No sugarcoating. Or, well… no too much sugarcoating.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ms. Gunasekara. Let's go through them one by one. The blood tests should be relatively quick – just a simple draw, and the results usually come back within a few days. The vascular study will take a bit longer – typically about an hour or so – and we'll schedule it for a time that’s convenient for you. As for pain, the blood draw will be a brief pinch, but it shouldn’t be overly uncomfortable. The vascular study is non-invasive – it involves placing sensors on your legs and feet – and most people find it painless, though some may experience a slight tingling sensation. Regarding cost, Medicare should cover the majority of both tests. We’ll verify your coverage beforehand and let you know of any potential out-of-pocket expenses. And as for your diet… we won’t make any drastic changes right now. We'll review your blood sugar results first and then discuss if any dietary adjustments are necessary. If needed, we can start with small, manageable changes. Does that help to address your concerns?
PATIENT: Alright. That… that doesn’t sound too bad. But I’m still blaming you if it all turns out to be nothing. And you better call my daughter and tell her everything. She worries too much, but she’s a good girl. Fine. Let’s get it over with. Just… please be gentle. And don’t keep me waiting. I’ve got tomatoes to pick, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Gunasekara. I’ll make sure everything is scheduled as quickly as possible, and I'll keep you informed every step of the way. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll have my nurse give you the paperwork for the blood tests and the referral to the vascular specialist. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Gunasekara. I hope you have a wonderful afternoon and enjoy your tomatoes!
