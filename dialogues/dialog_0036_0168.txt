DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be perfectly frank, it’s about this… gentleman I’ve been seeing. I suppose you could say I'm dating someone, and I just want to be certain everything is as it should be, health-wise, before things go any further. A woman has to be careful, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi, that’s very wise of you. It's always good to be proactive about your health and well-being. So, to clarify, you're looking for a general health screening for your partner, essentially?
PATIENT: Not precisely. I wouldn’t dream of putting him through anything without a very good reason. I’m more concerned with my health, in relation to… well, intimacy. I want to ensure I’m protected, and that there aren’t any… surprises. It’s really quite simple, Doctor. Though I do find it somewhat embarrassing to discuss.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Pandolfi. This is a very common concern, and you shouldn’t feel embarrassed at all. We discuss these things all the time. It sounds like you're interested in STI screening and perhaps a general wellness check related to sexual health. Is that a fair assessment?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… precisely put, Doctor. STI screening is certainly part of it. And I suppose a general check wouldn't hurt. One can never be too cautious, you understand. I do have a rather… discerning palate, and I wouldn’t want anything to… disrupt my lifestyle. Is there a particular panel you recommend? And do you test for everything, or do I need to specify?
DOCTOR: Certainly. We offer a comprehensive panel that tests for the most common sexually transmitted infections. It includes screening for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, trichomoniasis, and HIV. We also offer testing for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and hepatitis B and C, if you’d like. It's a blood and urine test, typically. Do you have any concerns about any specific infections, or would you like to proceed with the full panel?
PATIENT: Hmm. Herpes… I’ve always heard such dreadful things about herpes. Yes, I believe I would like to include that. And hepatitis, certainly. One reads such alarming things in the papers these days. The others… well, if they’re common, I suppose it’s best to be thorough. Is this a costly procedure, Doctor? I do have Medicare, of course, but I’d like to have some idea of any out-of-pocket expenses I might incur.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me check with Medicare coverage for you. With your Medicare coverage, the comprehensive panel, including herpes testing and hepatitis B and C, should be covered at 80% with a standard Part B deductible and a potential 20% co-pay. Let me pull up your benefits information to get a more precise estimate. Just one moment… Okay, it looks like your Part B deductible has already been met for the year, so your estimated out-of-pocket expense will be approximately $45 for the lab work. Does that sound acceptable, Ms. Pandolfi?
PATIENT: Forty-five dollars… acceptable, yes, I suppose. Though it seems a rather paltry sum considering the peace of mind it will buy me. Very well, Doctor. Let us proceed. I trust your laboratory is reputable? I wouldn’t want any false positives or, even worse, false negatives. Accuracy is paramount, you understand. And I do prefer discretion; I’m not one for gossip.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. We use a nationally certified laboratory and prioritize accuracy and confidentiality. All results are kept strictly confidential and are only released to you. We adhere to all HIPAA regulations. You will receive a phone call with your results, and we can discuss them privately. Before we proceed with the tests, let’s go over a brief medical history to ensure there aren't any factors that might influence the results or require further investigation. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Yes, well, I had a rather unpleasant bout of shingles a few years ago. Quite debilitating, it was. And I've always been prone to migraines, though I manage them with medication. Otherwise, I'm generally quite healthy. I do try to maintain a… balanced lifestyle, you understand. And I'm not one for indulging in… unhealthy habits. Though I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner from time to time. Is shingles relevant, Doctor? Or the migraines?
DOCTOR: Good to know. Yes, shingles is relevant, as it indicates you've had chickenpox, and that affects your immunity. The migraines themselves aren't directly relevant to STI screening, but it’s good to have a complete picture. Do you take any medications for your migraines, and if so, what are they?
PATIENT: Yes, I take sumatriptan as needed. It usually does the trick, though occasionally I'll have a breakthrough migraine despite taking it. And I take a daily preventative – propranolol. It helps keep them at bay, for the most part. I’ve been on it for several years now. Is there anything else you need to know, Doctor? I'm quite thorough myself, you see, so I doubt I've omitted anything pertinent.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. Sumatriptan and propranolol are good to know. Have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections previously?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Never. I’ve always been… exceedingly careful, you understand. I’m not one to take risks with my health. I’ve had a… rather limited social life, if I'm being perfectly honest, and I’ve always insisted on… discretion and responsibility from any… companions. It’s simply not a topic I’ve ever had to concern myself with before. It’s rather distressing to be discussing it now, to be frank. But as I said, a woman has to be cautious.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Pandolfi. And you’re absolutely right to be proactive about your health, regardless of your history. It’s wonderful that you prioritize responsibility and discretion. Now, just to complete the history, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none whatsoever. I've always been rather fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, take anything, without so much as a sniffle. It's another one of my… blessings, I suppose. Though I do prefer organic produce whenever possible. One doesn't want to ingest unnecessary chemicals, you understand. Is that all, Doctor? I’m rather eager to get this over with, to be perfectly honest. The mere thought of… potential exposure is quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, no known allergies. And yes, that completes the relevant medical history. Now, before we proceed with the testing, I just want to confirm you understand the testing process. We’ll need a urine sample and a small blood draw. The results will take approximately 5-7 business days to come back. Do you have any questions before we move forward?
PATIENT: Five to seven business days… that seems an eternity. But I suppose it’s unavoidable. No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. A urine sample and a blood draw… straightforward enough. I trust your phlebotomist is skilled? I have a rather… difficult vein. It’s always been that way. But other than that, I’m ready to proceed. Let’s get this over with, shall we? The sooner I know, the sooner I can put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. Our phlebotomist, Maria, is very experienced and skilled. She's excellent at drawing blood, even from difficult veins. I'll let her know to be prepared. If you’ll follow me, we’ll go to the lab room. The nurse will explain the process and collect the samples. And please, don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any concerns at any point.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Lead the way. I do appreciate your reassurance. It’s always comforting to know one is in capable hands. Though I must confess, the thought of needles… it does make me rather anxious. But I suppose it’s a necessary evil.
DOCTOR: Here we are. This is Maria, our nurse. Maria, this is Ms. Pandolfi. She’s here for STI screening, and I’ve already reviewed her medical history. Maria will explain the process to you, and she’ll take excellent care of you. I’ll be nearby if you need anything at all. Please let me know if you have any questions once you're settled.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Good morning. I trust you are proficient in your… craft? I’ve always had rather sensitive veins, and I’d prefer to minimize any discomfort, if possible. And I do hope you’re using sterile equipment, naturally. One can never be too careful, you understand. I’m rather fastidious about hygiene.
