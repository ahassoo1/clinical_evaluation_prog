DOCTOR: Good morning, Venus. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Renzi. It is… pleasant to meet you as well. I am here because… well, my memory. It is not as good as it was. I find I… forget things. Small things, mostly. It worries me, because the blood pressure… it is high. I want to be sure everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venus. Memory issues and high blood pressure – good that you're getting it checked out. It’s common for those things to be connected, or to worry us at the same time. When you say small things, can you give me an example of what you've been forgetting?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Yesterday, I… I went to the market. I had a list, a very specific list. But when I arrived… I could not remember why I was there. I stood there, looking at the fruit, and… nothing. Then I remembered the list in my purse, and everything was okay. But it frightened me, Doctor. It is… unusual for me. I always remember my lists. And sometimes… names. Not important names, but… the cashier’s name, for example. Things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds a bit unsettling, definitely. Forgetting the purpose of a trip, or a cashier’s name… that’s the kind of thing we want to look into. And you mentioned your blood pressure being high – do you know what your readings have been recently, or are you taking any medication for that?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. My neighbor, she is a nurse, she checks it for me. Usually, it is around… 150 over 90, sometimes a little higher. I do not take any pills for it. My late husband, he… he did not want me taking medication unless absolutely necessary. I have been trying to manage it with diet. Less salt, more… vegetables. It has not been very effective, I admit. Is that… bad? Should I have been taking something already? I do not understand these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, 150 over 90… consistently high, yes. Your husband’s approach is understandable, but with readings that high, it's good we discuss medication. Untreated high blood pressure can cause problems down the road, so it's not something to ignore. Before we talk about that though, let’s get a better picture of everything going on. You mentioned the memory issues and the high blood pressure. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: No… not really. I sleep well, mostly. I eat… reasonably. I walk every day, about thirty minutes. I feel… tired sometimes, but that could be my age, yes? I do not have headaches, or dizziness, or anything like that. I am… perhaps a little more forgetful than I used to be, but I always chalked it up to… stress. Being alone, after my husband… it is difficult. But nothing… dramatic. I assure you, Doctor. I am not unwell, generally. Just… concerned about the memory.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Sleeping well, regular walking… those are good things. And it’s completely understandable that you’d be feeling stressed after the loss of your husband. Stress can definitely impact memory. Let’s do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a basic neurological assessment. Just routine things, nothing to worry about. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That is… perfectly acceptable. I want to be sure everything is as it should be. Please, do what you need to do. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Alright, if you could just sit back and relax. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a nice, deep breath for me... and let it out slowly. Your heart sounds regular, a little strong, but nothing alarming. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Can you place your hands on your lap, palms up?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. They are… perhaps a little slow? My neighbor says I am not as quick as I used to be. But I am an older woman, yes? Is that normal?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. Reflexes can naturally slow down with age. Yours are a little diminished, yes, but not drastically so. It's within the normal range for someone your age. Now, I’m going to do a very quick cognitive assessment, just a few simple questions to get a better sense of your memory and thinking skills. It's nothing to worry about, just helps me to get a fuller picture. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… let me see. It is… August. The second of August. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I remembered. That is good, yes? I worry sometimes, Doctor. It feels… fragile. The memory.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Venus. Very good. Remembering the date is a good sign. And it's perfectly normal to worry about memory changes – we all do it. Now, can you recall three unrelated words for me?
PATIENT: Three words… let me think. Oh dear. This is… difficult. I am not good with… tests. You said three words? Which words should I remember? Perhaps if you tell me the words, I can try to repeat them back to you? I am very sorry, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Venus. No need to apologize at all. We’re not trying to trick you, just getting a baseline. I’ll give you the words, and then I’ll ask you to recall them after a short delay. The words are: apple, table, penny. Try to remember those, and I’ll ask you to repeat them back to me in a few moments. Don’t worry about getting them right, just do your best. Take your time.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. I have them. I think I have them. But it… it requires concentration. It did not used to be like this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you repeat those three words back to me?
PATIENT: Let me see… Apple… table… and… oh dear. It is on the tip of my tongue. It was… something small, and metal. A coin, perhaps? No… a… penny! Yes, penny. Apple, table, and penny. I hope I have it correct, Doctor. It felt… difficult. I am very sorry if this is… unhelpful.
DOCTOR: You did perfectly, Venus! You remembered all three words correctly, and that’s wonderful. The fact that it required some effort is what we're noting, not that you didn’t remember them at all. It gives us a little more information. Now, let’s talk about those blood pressure readings. 150 over 90 consistently is definitely something we need to address. We can discuss lifestyle modifications – diet, exercise, stress management – but given those numbers, I think it would be prudent to start you on a low dose of medication. It can help prevent more serious problems down the line. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Medication… My late husband… he did not like medication. He said it was better to… to try to manage things naturally. But… if you think it is necessary, Doctor, I trust your judgment. I do not want… complications. I want to be healthy. Is it… a lot of pills? And will it have… side effects? I worry about that. I have read things… online. It is all very frightening.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to be hesitant about medication, and it's good you're asking these questions. Your husband's approach is one many people share. We wouldn't start with a lot of pills. Usually, we start with a single, low-dose medication. There’s always a possibility of side effects, but they are often mild and manageable. The most common ones with this type of medication are a little dizziness, especially when standing up quickly, or a slight cough. We would monitor you closely and adjust the dosage if needed. Before we decide on a medication, I'd like to order some blood tests. They'll give us a clearer picture of your overall health and help rule out any other potential causes for your high blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, that is… sensible. If you think it is necessary, Doctor, I will do it. I want to be sure. As long as it is not… too invasive. And will it take long? I have an appointment with my… with the gardener on Thursday. He is very good, but difficult to reschedule.
DOCTOR: It’s a very simple blood draw, Venus. Not invasive at all. A quick prick of a needle, and we’ll collect a few vials of blood. It usually takes about ten minutes. We can schedule it for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. That way, we'll have the results in a few days, and we can discuss them at your follow-up appointment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, that would be… acceptable. As long as it does not interfere with my… afternoon tea. I have a friend coming over, and I promised her scones. But yes, tomorrow morning is fine. Perhaps… 9 o’clock? If that is convenient. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Fasting, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Scones are important! And yes, 9 o'clock works perfectly. And you're right to ask about fasting. For this particular test, you'll need to fast for eight to twelve hours beforehand. That means no food or drink after midnight tonight, except for water. We’ll have you come in first thing in the morning, and the phlebotomist will take care of the blood draw. Then, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results and decide on a plan. Does that sound like a good arrangement, Venus?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… quite good. No food after midnight. I can manage that. Water is… acceptable. Eight to twelve hours. I will set an alarm. And next week for the results. Thank you, Doctor Renzi. I feel much better now, knowing what to expect. You have been very patient with me. And very kind. I appreciate that. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Perhaps… paperwork?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venus. I'm glad I could ease your mind. You’re a very thoughtful patient, and it's good you ask so many questions. No, there’s no paperwork needed at this point. I’ll just have the nurse give you a printed sheet with the fasting instructions and the time for your blood draw tomorrow. And I'll write you a note for the gardener, just in case you need to reschedule. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think… no, that is all. You have answered everything. The fasting instructions… and the note for the gardener. That is… perfect. Thank you again, Doctor Renzi. I will see you next week. I hope I do not keep you too long. You have many patients, I imagine. .
DOCTOR: Not at all, Venus. You take all the time you need. I’m happy to help. And don't worry about keeping me long – patient care is what I'm here for. Have a good afternoon, and I’ll see you next week. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before then. .
