DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s about the cancer. I was told to come see you. It’s a bit scary, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: "Cancer," you say. Right. And who told you this, exactly?
PATIENT: Um… the hospital. When they did the tests. I… I don’t remember the doctor’s name, sorry. It was a busy place. They just said I needed to follow up with someone, and they gave me your name.
DOCTOR: "Right." Well, hospitals can be…overwhelming. Okay. So, you had some tests done at the hospital. Do you remember what kind of tests?
PATIENT: I think… a scan? Like, I laid on a table and a big machine went over me. And they took some blood. That’s all I really remember clearly. It was all very fast. I was nervous.
DOCTOR: A scan and bloodwork. Alright. And did anyone explain what they were looking for with these tests?
PATIENT: No, not really. They just said they found something, and I needed to see a specialist. That's when they gave me your name and number. I… I don't know where exactly they found something. It all happened so quickly. I’m sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s… unfortunate they didn’t give you more information. I need to access those results to understand what we're dealing with. Let me pull up your file. Chellsea Luft… yes, here we are. Medicare… height 179cm, weight 112… quite thin. Hmm. Okay. It seems you had a CT scan of the chest and abdomen on July 15th. The report mentions a "suspicious nodule" in the left lung, approximately 1.5cm. There’s also a note about some enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum. Have you been experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Um… not really. I’ve been a little tired, maybe. But I work a lot, so I just thought it was from that. No cough, no pain… nothing I thought was unusual. Just… tired. Is a “nodule” bad?
DOCTOR: "Tired" can mean many things. A nodule… well, it’s something on the scan. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it requires investigation. Enlarged lymph nodes are also… noteworthy. Have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. My grandmother smoked, but I always stayed away from it. It smelled awful, and… well, it made her very sick. I’ve always been careful about my health, actually. That’s why I’m so confused about all this.
DOCTOR: "Careful," you say. Alright. And any family history of… lung issues, or cancer in general?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had breast cancer, a long time ago. She's… she's okay now, thankfully. She had surgery and… treatment. That was years ago, though. Other than that… not that I know of. My father’s side of the family, I didn’t know them very well. Is… is it because of her? Could I have gotten this from her?
DOCTOR: "Genetics" are complicated. While there can be a hereditary component to certain cancers, it doesn’t automatically mean you’ve inherited something. Your mother’s breast cancer and this… finding… are not necessarily linked. Now, we need to determine what this nodule actually is. The next step is a biopsy. We'll need to take a small sample of the tissue and have it analyzed. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A biopsy? What does that involve? Will it… will it hurt? And what if it is cancer? I’m… I’m starting to get really scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: "Of course" you're scared. Any unusual finding is unsettling. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of the tissue from the nodule, usually with a needle. There will be some discomfort, a brief, sharp pain, like a pinch. We'll use local anesthetic to minimize it. As for “what if”... we don't know yet. That's why we need the biopsy. It could be benign, it could be something else entirely. We will know more after the results come back. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: So… a needle? Into my lung? Will I… will I have to stay in the hospital? And how long will it take to get the results? I… I really need to get back to work. My patients…
DOCTOR: “Into your lung” is… a dramatic way of putting it. It’s a targeted procedure, guided by imaging to ensure accuracy. Most patients don't require a hospital stay, it’s usually an outpatient procedure. As for the results, it usually takes about 5 to 7 business days for the pathology report to come back. And I understand you have patients, but your health is the priority. We’ll schedule the biopsy as soon as possible. I have a colleague, Dr. Ramirez, who specializes in these procedures. I'll have her contact you to discuss the details and answer any further questions. Do you have any allergies to local anesthetics?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve had stitches before, and I didn’t have any problems. So… Dr. Ramirez will call me? And then… then we’ll know? Is… is there anything I should do to prepare? I just… I feel so lost and overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: "Overwhelmed" is understandable. Dr. Ramirez will contact you to schedule the biopsy and explain the preparation instructions, which are minimal. It mostly involves avoiding blood thinners for a few days beforehand. I'll also order a chest X-ray to compare to the initial scan and help monitor any changes. We need to rule out anything else that might be going on. For now, try not to worry too much. We are taking all the necessary steps to get a clear diagnosis. Do you have any questions about the X-ray?
PATIENT: An X-ray… okay. No, I don't think so. Will… will Medicare cover all of this? I… I don't have a lot of money. And I really can’t afford to be off work for too long. This is just… a lot.
DOCTOR: "Of course" Medicare will cover the necessary procedures, that’s what it’s for. We have a billing department that will handle all the paperwork. As for time off work… that depends on the biopsy results and what, if any, further treatment is needed. I'm ordering the X-ray and a referral to Dr. Ramirez now. Her office will contact you within 24-48 hours to schedule the appointment. For now, focus on getting this done. Worrying won’t change the outcome. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I guess I’ll just… wait for Dr. Ramirez to call. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day. .
