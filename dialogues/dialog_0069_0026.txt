DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Andraca, is it? Yes, well… it’s this tiredness. Just… awful tiredness. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it really comes. Makes it hard to do anything, you know? Even just getting out of bed. And the young man at the lab said something about… numbers? Something high. I don’t rightly remember. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. Tiredness is definitely something that can impact your quality of life. And it’s perfectly okay not to remember everything the lab technician said – that’s what I’m here for. So, you mentioned some lab results. Let’s see… it looks like you had some blood work done recently. Can you tell me a little more about when this tiredness started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start? That's a tricky one. It feels like… a while. Maybe last spring? Or was it the fall before? Honestly, Doctor, I used to have a much better memory. I was a commercial diver, you know. Had to remember all sorts of things underwater! Not like now. Everything’s a bit… fuzzy. It’s not like it came on suddenly, more like it just… crept up on me. A little more tired each day, until now it’s just… this. I do remember it being worse after I did some gardening. A lot of bending and lifting, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating to have something come on gradually like that, and it’s completely normal for memory to change over time. Being a commercial diver sounds very demanding – that definitely required a sharp mind! Okay, so it's been building up over some time and seems to be aggravated by physical activity. Besides the tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… let me think. Well, my muscles feel… achy sometimes. Not all the time, but especially after I’ve been… doing things. Like I said, the gardening. And I’ve been a bit clumsier than usual, I suppose. Dropped a teacup just last week. My husband, Pemba, gave me a right telling! He says I’m not paying attention. But it wasn’t my fault, Doctor! I just… lost my grip. Nothing else, really. No fever, no chills, no coughing… just tired and achy. And clumsy. Pemba says I nag more too, but he always says that.
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you're not experiencing fever, chills, or cough. And husbands will be husbands! Okay, so muscle aches and increased clumsiness along with the tiredness. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is… normal, I think. Pemba cooks lovely meals, and I always eat a good portion. I haven’t been refusing food or anything. As for weight… well, I’m a bit smaller than I used to be, but that’s just old age, isn’t it? I haven’t been trying to lose weight, if that’s what you mean. I haven’t stepped on the scale in a while, to be honest. Pemba worries about my weight sometimes, says I need to eat more, but I tell him I’m fine. He's a good man, but he does fuss.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're eating well, and it sounds like Pemba takes good care of you. It’s not unusual to experience some weight loss with age, but we’ll take a look at that. Okay, so no significant changes in appetite, some possible weight loss. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that you’re aware of, like diabetes, heart issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a lot to remember. I’ve had the usual old lady things, I suppose. A bit of arthritis in my hands, that’s why I can’t knit as much anymore. And my blood pressure gets a bit high sometimes, but the doctor gave me a little pill for that. I take it every morning. Pemba makes sure of it. Let me think… Oh! I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that wasn’t a problem. Nothing major, really. No diabetes, no heart trouble… just the arthritis and the blood pressure. And I've been a very healthy person, Doctor, all my life! Even being a commercial diver!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know you’ve generally been healthy. And it’s helpful that you’re managing your blood pressure with medication. Okay. And have you had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… No, I don't think so. Not that I recall, anyway. Maybe a few stitches here and there when I was a child, but nothing major. Certainly nothing since I became a commercial diver. That was a dangerous job, you know. I had to be very careful. No time for surgeries! Too much money to be made. Pemba always worried about me, though. He said it was too risky. But I liked the work. It kept me young.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant surgical history. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… No, I don’t think so. Just the little pink pill for my blood pressure. Pemba gets it filled every month at the pharmacy. Sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis when my hands are really bothering me, but that’s just over-the-counter, you know? Like ibuprofen. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it. They make me feel sluggish.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication and occasional over-the-counter ibuprofen for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I’m aware of. I eat everything Pemba puts in front of me, and he puts a lot of spices in his cooking! I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve been lucky that way. Never even had much trouble with hay fever, and we had lots of flowers in Bhutan. No, no allergies. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any health problems that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history... Now that's a tricky one. My parents are both gone now, and I didn’t keep up with all that sort of thing. They lived long lives, both of them, but I don’t recall any specific illnesses. My mother had a bit of trouble with her joints when she got older, like me, but nothing serious. And my father… he was a strong man, worked hard all his life. I don’t recall any heart trouble or anything like that. We didn't talk much about illness, you see. Just got on with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It's common not to have detailed family history information. Alright, Ardelle, thank you for answering all my questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your hands. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle with my hands, alright? The arthritis makes them a bit sensitive. And don't mind if I ask a few questions while you're poking around. Pemba always says I'm too inquisitive. But I like to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And please, ask as many questions as you like. That’s what I’m here for. Alright, let’s start with your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally for me. Your heart sounds regular, good strong beat. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackling. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I'm going to tap on your knees and elbows. Just relax your legs. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Now, let's take a look at your hands. I do see some slight swelling and redness in the joints of your fingers, which is consistent with arthritis. Do you experience pain in these joints when you move them?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s where it bothers me the most. Especially in the mornings, when I wake up. They feel stiff and achy, and it’s hard to make a fist. Sometimes I have to soak them in warm water just to get them moving. And the gardening doesn’t help, you know. All that bending and digging. It really aggravates them. Pemba says I should hire someone to do the gardening for me, but I like to keep busy. I don’t like sitting around doing nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like the gardening is definitely making your arthritis symptoms worse. And it’s good that you like to stay active, but we need to find a balance to protect your joints. Alright, Ardelle, that completes the exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you are experiencing fatigue, likely related to a combination of factors, including your arthritis and potentially some age-related changes. The slight weakness and diminished reflexes I noted could be contributing, as well. To rule out any other potential causes of your fatigue, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any signs of inflammation or anemia. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests, more blood tests. Goodness. But, yes, alright, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just hope they don’t take too much blood! I always feel a bit faint afterwards. And will they tell me what everything means? I don't want to be left wondering what's going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. We’ll only take the necessary amount of blood, and I’ll make sure you have something to drink and eat afterwards to help you feel better. And absolutely, I will explain everything to you in detail once the results are back. I’ll go over each number and what it means, and we’ll discuss a plan together. The lab technician will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once the results are back, which usually takes a few days, we’ll set up another appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend trying to avoid strenuous activities, especially gardening, if possible. And if your fatigue becomes significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds sensible enough. Avoid the gardening… Pemba will be pleased about that! And I’ll call if anything changes. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s nice to have someone explain things clearly. So many doctors just rush you through without really hearing what you have to say.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ardelle. It’s my pleasure. I believe it’s important to take the time to listen to my patients and explain things in a way they understand. Alright, then. We’ll get those blood tests scheduled, and I’ll see you again soon to discuss the results. In the meantime, please take care of yourself and try to rest. It was nice meeting you. .
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor. You have a lovely office. And thank you again for your kindness. .
