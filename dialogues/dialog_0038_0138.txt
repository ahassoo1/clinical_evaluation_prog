DOCTOR: Good morning, Alayne. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Land sakes, where do the years go? Well, um… it’s my health, mostly. Or, well, worrying about it. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s the one who made the appointment. She's been concerned about some… things. I’ve been having a bit of trouble, you see. Not all the time, but… episodes, she calls them. And my father, he had terrible headaches… and weakness on one side. It’s a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I don’t remember everything so clearly anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It's common for memories to be a little hazy, especially with time. We'll take things slowly. So, your daughter is concerned about these episodes you've been having. Can you tell me a bit more about what happens during these episodes?
PATIENT: Well, it's hard to explain. It feels… like a heaviness, mostly. On one side. My right side, I think. Sometimes my arm just feels… like it's not mine, you know? It’s not pain, exactly. Just… weak. And then sometimes, a terrible headache comes on with it. Not always, though. And it doesn’t last long, usually. Just a little while. Maybe an hour? It’s hard to say. I just rest, and it usually goes away. I’ve been trying not to worry too much about it, but my daughter… she’s very thorough. And she mentioned my father… and his headaches were awful. Were you saying something about my father?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re right, you mentioned your father having headaches as well. It’s good your daughter is thorough, and it's smart to look into this, especially with family history. So, to clarify, these episodes involve a heaviness and weakness, primarily on your right side, and sometimes accompanied by a headache. About how long have these episodes been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. Not terribly long, I don’t think. Maybe… a few months? It started gradually, you see. I just thought I was getting old! A little ache here, a little weakness there… I figured it was just part of getting older. It hasn’t been constant, not at all. Just… now and then. It's probably nothing, really. My daughter just gets worried easily. She’s a good girl, though. Always looking out for me. But trying to remember exactly when it started… that's a bit tricky. Maybe six months? Perhaps a little longer. I really couldn’t say for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months or so, coming on gradually. And these episodes are intermittent, not constant. Now, aside from the heaviness and weakness on your right side and the occasional headache, have you noticed any other symptoms with these episodes, or at any other time?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. Well, sometimes I feel a little… off balance, maybe? Not like I'm going to fall, just a little unsteady. And my vision… sometimes it gets a little blurry. But I wear glasses, you know, so I just figured it was my prescription. I haven't changed it in a while, so maybe that's it. And… oh! Sometimes my speech feels a little… slurred. But just for a moment. Not all the time. My daughter mentioned something about that too, I think. She has a very good memory, that one. I mostly just try to ignore it, you know? Don’t want to make a fuss. It all comes and goes so quickly. Is that… is that a bad sign? I do apologize, I’m probably just rambling now.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Alayne. It’s good you're sharing all of this with me. The unsteadiness, blurry vision, and occasional slurred speech – those are all important things to know. Considering all of that, and your family history, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. My daughter would be relieved to hear you want to take a look. I'm not fond of doctors, if I'm honest – always poking and prodding – but I understand it's necessary. Just be gentle, please? And don’t be surprised if I ask a lot of questions. My mind wanders sometimes. And, um… is this going to take long? I have a little tea party with my granddaughter planned for this afternoon. A very important tea party!
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll take things as slowly as you need to, and I'll explain everything as we go. And yes, it's perfectly alright to ask questions - that's what I'm here for. We'll try to be as quick as possible, so you don't miss your tea party. First, I'm just going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll do a quick neurological exam – checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… very thorough! But alright, Doctor. As long as you promise not to keep me too long. My granddaughter, little Lily, she makes the best scones. She's a very talented baker, that one. And she's been planning this tea party for weeks. So, yes, let's get it over with, shall we? Blood pressure first, you say? Just… try not to poke too hard, please? My veins aren't what they used to be. And… what exactly is a neurological exam? Is that something serious? Oh dear, I'm getting anxious now.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel a little anxious, Alayne. A neurological exam is just a way for me to assess how your nervous system is functioning – things like your reflexes, strength, balance, and coordination. It’s not necessarily serious – it’s just a routine part of figuring out what’s going on. We'll just be doing some simple tests. Your blood pressure is 142/88, which is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a nice, deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Oh, 142… is that bad? I haven't paid much attention to numbers. My husband, bless his soul, he always took care of those things. He said my nerves were just… easily rattled. He was right, of course. Deep breath, you say? Alright. I always did have a bit of a wheeze in the winter. It’s probably just the old house, it’s so drafty. And my lungs… are they alright? I used to smoke, you see. A very bad habit, I know. I quit years ago, thankfully. Do you think it could be related to that? Oh dear, now I’m rambling again. I do apologize.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Alayne. It's good you quit smoking – that was a very wise decision. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight wheeze in your lungs, as you noticed, which could be related to your previous smoking or just the drafts in the house. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Can you sit comfortably with your feet flat on the floor?
PATIENT: Yes, comfortably enough. My old bones creak a little, but I manage. Reflexes, you say? What does that involve? Will you be tapping my knees with a little hammer? I always hated that part when I was a child! It tickled. And strength… how will you test that? I haven’t been lifting any heavy furniture lately, if that’s what you mean. Mostly just teacups. And little Lily’s dolls. She’s very strong for her age, that one. She can carry a whole stack of them! Oh dear, I’m off on a tangent again. Just tell me if it will hurt, please? I don’t have a very high pain tolerance anymore.
DOCTOR: No need to worry, Alayne. It won’t hurt. It’s just a quick tap on your knees and ankles to see how your nerves are responding. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. And we’ll just be asking you to squeeze my hands and move your arms and legs. Nothing strenuous. Let’s start with your knees. Can you let your legs dangle down comfortably?
PATIENT: Alright, dangling they are. My husband always said I had “floppy legs.” He meant it affectionately, I think. He always had a way with words, that one. Go ahead, Doctor. Tap away! I’m ready. Although, I must warn you, my legs might not cooperate. They haven't been very reliable lately. And… what exactly are you looking for? Are you checking for… something bad? Oh dear, I’m getting anxious again. My daughter always worries so much. She says I need to be more proactive about my health. Perhaps she’s right. But it's all so… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s see… Your reflexes are a little diminished on both sides, but not dramatically so. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? It’s not as strong as it used to be, I must admit. My hands get tired so easily these days. I used to be a very good knitter, you know. I made sweaters for all my grandchildren. But I haven't been able to knit much lately. My hands just… ache. And sometimes they tremble. It’s probably just old age, though. Everything starts to go, doesn’t it? What are you looking for exactly, Doctor? Are my hands… bad? Oh dear, I’m probably just being a bother. You must have patients with real problems to worry about.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Alayne. And your strength is a bit reduced on your right side, compared to your left. Now, I'm going to check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That wasn't very graceful, was it? My hand… it feels a little shaky. And my coordination… it's never been very good, to be honest. I always tripped over my own feet. And sometimes I forget where I'm going. It’s probably just… my age, though. Everything slows down, doesn't it? My mind wanders, too. I forget things… important things. Are you finding something wrong, Doctor? Please be honest with me. I'd rather know. My daughter… she'll want to know everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Alayne. Based on what I've seen during the exam – the diminished reflexes, reduced strength on your right side, and slightly clumsy coordination – there are some things that need further investigation. It could be a number of things, and it’s too early to say definitively. However, given your symptoms – the episodes of heaviness and weakness, the occasional slurred speech, the unsteadiness, and your father’s history of headaches – I want to be cautious. I’m going to order a CT scan of your brain, and I'd like you to have an appointment with a neurologist as soon as possible. The CT scan will help us rule out any serious underlying cause, such as a stroke or a tumor. And the neurologist can perform more detailed tests to assess your nervous system function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and a neurologist? Oh dear. That sounds… serious, doesn't it? A stroke… or a tumor? My daughter was right to worry, wasn’t she? I always told her I was fine, just a bit old and clumsy. But it sounds like it’s more than that. What… what are the chances it is something serious, Doctor? I don’t want to worry my daughter unnecessarily. She’s already so stressed. And a neurologist… I’ve never seen a neurologist before. What will they do? Will it hurt? Oh dear, I'm getting so flustered. Alright. If you think it's necessary, then I suppose I should have the CT scan and see the neurologist. But please, Doctor, be gentle with me. And please, tell me honestly what you think. I’d rather know the truth, even if it’s not what I want to hear. And… can my daughter come with me to the appointments? I think I’ll need her there.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel anxious, Alayne. And yes, it’s good your daughter is involved – she can definitely come with you to the appointments. Now, regarding the chances of it being something serious… it’s too early to say definitively. The CT scan and the neurologist will help us get a clearer picture. Many things can cause these symptoms, and most of them are not life-threatening. We are being cautious to rule out anything serious, that's all. The CT scan is a painless imaging test. You’ll lie on a table, and a scanner will take pictures of your brain. It takes about 15-20 minutes. The neurologist will perform a detailed neurological exam – checking your reflexes, strength, coordination, and sensation. They may also order some other tests, such as an MRI or blood tests. I’ll write you a referral to a neurologist – Dr. Eleanor Vance – and a prescription for the CT scan. I’ll also call the radiology department to schedule the scan for you as soon as possible. I want you to get this checked out quickly, just to be on the safe side. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as sudden weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, or severe headache – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Dr. Vance, you say? I’ll write that down. And the radiology department… yes, I’ll need to call them. It all seems so… daunting. So many appointments, so many tests… Sudden weakness… or difficulty speaking… Yes, I’ll remember that. Emergency room, if those things happen. What… what if it is something serious, Doctor? What are the possible treatments? I’ve heard terrible stories about strokes… and tumors… And… will I be able to still have tea with my granddaughter? That tea party is very important. She’s been planning it for weeks. It’s… it’s a silly thing to worry about, I know. But it means a lot to both of us. Are you optimistic, Doctor? Do you think it could be something… simple? Something that can be fixed?
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to be worried about the possibilities, Alayne, and it’s okay to ask those questions. It's much better to address your fears head-on. Regarding treatment, that depends entirely on the cause of your symptoms. For a stroke, there are treatments to restore blood flow to the brain. For a tumor, treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. But I want to emphasize that we haven’t determined the cause yet, so we shouldn’t jump to conclusions. And yes, I am optimistic. While it's important to be thorough, many things can cause these symptoms that are not life-threatening and are easily treatable. Things like migraines, vitamin deficiencies, or even side effects from medications. We need to rule out the more serious possibilities first, and then we can focus on finding the underlying cause and developing a treatment plan. Let's focus on getting the CT scan scheduled and seeing Dr. Vance. Once we have the results, we'll have a better understanding of what's going on. And as for your tea party… absolutely. We will do everything we can to make sure you don’t miss it. We’ll work around your schedule and do whatever it takes to get you back to enjoying time with your granddaughter. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Migraines… vitamin deficiencies… yes, those sound much better than a stroke or a tumor. I do get terrible headaches sometimes, as I mentioned. And my diet… well, it's not the best, I must admit. Mostly tea and scones, to be honest. You said Dr. Vance will do more tests? What kind of tests? Will they be painful? I’m not very good with needles, you see. And I get a little claustrophobic in small spaces. And… will my daughter be allowed to be in the room during the tests? I think I’ll need her there to hold my hand. She’s very good at calming me down. She's a very practical girl, that one. Always thinking ahead. Yes, please, tell me everything you can about the tests. I’d rather be prepared. Knowing what to expect will help me stay calm. I don’t want to make a fuss. I just want to get this sorted out so I can go back to enjoying time with my granddaughter. And… having tea with her. That tea party is very important, you see. It really is.
DOCTOR: Of course, Alayne. I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to answer all your questions. Dr. Vance may order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies or other underlying conditions. These are standard blood draws, and we can let the phlebotomist know you’re a little anxious – they’re very good at making patients comfortable. She may also order an MRI of your brain, which provides more detailed images than a CT scan. An MRI does involve lying in a small tube, and it can be a bit noisy. If you're claustrophobic, we can discuss options for managing your anxiety – such as medication or an open MRI machine. As for your daughter being in the room during the tests, absolutely. She can definitely be there to hold your hand and provide support. Here’s a pamphlet about neurological exams that provides more information about the tests and what to expect. I’ll also write a note to Dr. Vance explaining your concerns about needles and claustrophobia. I want you to feel as comfortable as possible throughout this process. If you have any questions or concerns at any time, please don’t hesitate to ask. Do you think you’d like me to schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results of the CT scan and Dr. Vance’s recommendations?
PATIENT: An open MRI machine… yes, that sounds much better. I don't think I could bear being in a small tube. It sounds terribly claustrophobic. And medication… well, I don't like taking pills, if I'm honest. But if it's necessary, I suppose I could try it. A follow-up appointment… yes, that would be good. I'd like to discuss the results with you in person. It's easier to understand things when you explain them to me. And I'd like my daughter to be there too. She's very good at asking questions. Do you think… do you think everything will be alright? I'm trying to stay positive, but it's hard. I just want to go back to my normal life. And have tea with my granddaughter. That tea party is very important, you see. It really is. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. And very patient. I appreciate it. I really do. I think… I think that's all the questions I have for now. But I may think of more later. And I'll be sure to call if I do. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alayne. And you’re right to want to stay positive. We’ll take things one step at a time, and we’ll do everything we can to get you back to enjoying your life – and your tea party with your granddaughter. I've made a note to schedule a follow-up appointment for us once we have the results of the CT scan and Dr. Vance’s recommendations. I’ll have my assistant call you to schedule a time that works for both of you. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Take care, Alayne. And please, try not to worry too much.
