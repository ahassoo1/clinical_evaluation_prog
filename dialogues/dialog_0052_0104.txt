DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you please tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly? I don't have time for this. My throat… it hurts. Has been for a few days. It’s just… a pain. Is that enough? I work, you know. Very important work.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Ottaviani, that is enough to start. A sore throat can certainly be disruptive. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: More…? What more is there to say? It hurts when I swallow. And… it feels scratchy. Like sandpaper, maybe. I don't know. I haven't been sick in… well, a long time. Not properly sick. Just… this. A nuisance, really. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Ms. Ottaviani. We’ll get through this as efficiently as possible. The scratchiness and pain with swallowing are helpful details. Has the pain been getting worse, better, or staying the same since it started?
PATIENT: Staying the same, I think. Maybe a little worse yesterday. But that could be… dust. There’s a lot of dust at work. It’s a… a processing plant. Very large machines. Not a clean environment, if that’s what you’re asking. Honestly, I don't pay attention to… little things. It’s just a throat. People get throats all the time. Is there something wrong with me?
DOCTOR: It's good you’re here, Ms. Ottaviani, and no, a sore throat doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong with you. It’s common, as you said, but we want to understand the cause to ensure you receive the appropriate care. You mentioned a processing plant; does your work involve exposure to any chemicals or irritants besides dust?
PATIENT: Chemicals? Irritants? Doctor, I set the machines! I don’t… handle things. My husband—before he passed—he was the one who dealt with all of that. I make sure the separators are correct, the filters are aligned, the clarifying is precise… It’s very technical. I don’t know about chemicals. Are you suggesting my work is… unsafe? Because it is not. It’s vital.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, I apologize if my question came across that way. I wasn’t questioning the safety of your work, merely trying to gather information about potential exposures that could be contributing to your sore throat. Let’s move back to you. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the throat pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think. I’ve been a little tired, I suppose. But I always tired. Long hours, you know. And… my voice is a bit raspy, maybe. But that could be from shouting over the machines. It’s very loud. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to my body. It just… works. Is this really necessary? Can't you just give me something for the pain? I have a very important shift tomorrow.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about getting back to work, Ms. Ottaviani. Fatigue and a raspy voice are helpful details. To rule out anything more serious, and to ensure I can recommend the best course of action, could you tell me if you've had any fever, chills, cough, or body aches?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? No. Cough? A little, perhaps. But that's just… dust. Body aches? I’m always a little achy, Doctor. From the work! Lifting, adjusting, setting… It’s a physical job. I told you. Honestly, this feels like a waste of my time. Are you going to actually do something, or just ask questions? I have things to manage. Important things.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the delay, Ms. Ottaviani. I assure you, I am trying to gather the necessary information to provide you with the best possible care. Given your symptoms – sore throat, raspy voice, slight cough, and fatigue – and the fact that you have no fever, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, if you’re willing. I'd like to look at your throat and listen to your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look at my throat? Listen to my lungs? Very well. Get it over with. But I expect this to be quick. I have a schedule to keep, you know. I do not have time for… prolonged examinations. And please be gentle. I have important things to do. Stop wasting my time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ottaviani. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. Your throat is a little red, but there's no sign of anything more serious. Your lungs sound clear. I don't detect any signs of pneumonia or bronchitis.
PATIENT: So? What does that mean? Is it serious? Am I going to be able to work tomorrow? I need to know. Don't just tell me it's a little red. I need a diagnosis. A solution. Frankly, I'm starting to feel quite irritated by all of this. It's just a throat. People get them. It's probably just dust. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, based on the examination, it appears you likely have a mild case of pharyngitis – inflammation of the throat – most likely caused by a viral upper respiratory infection. The symptoms you describe are consistent with that. Given the absence of fever and clear lung sounds, it’s unlikely to be a bacterial infection requiring antibiotics. However, it's important to monitor your symptoms. If you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain that prevents you from swallowing, please seek immediate medical attention. For now, I recommend rest, plenty of fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen as needed. A throat lozenge or warm salt water gargle may also provide some relief. You should be able to return to work tomorrow, but avoid strenuous activity if you are feeling fatigued. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
