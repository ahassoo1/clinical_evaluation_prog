DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, to be honest, I'm not entirely sure what exactly brought me here. Something about a… test? My niece, bless her heart, she’s the one who set this up. It’s about… well, I guess checking if I’ve been… using anything I shouldn’t. Medicare wanted it, she said. I’m a bit fuzzy on the details, though. Sorry!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. It sounds like this is a preventative screening requested by Medicare, likely as part of a routine health assessment. Your niece was very thoughtful to assist you with scheduling. To clarify, this screening is to assess for potential substance use, and it’s completely confidential. Before we proceed, could you tell me if you currently use any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know it’s confidential. Makes me feel a bit better. Let me think… medications… hmm. I take something for my blood pressure, a little white pill, I think. And sometimes, when my arthritis is acting up, I use a cream… Voltaren, maybe? It’s orange. And… oh! I take a vitamin D supplement, my doctor a few years back said I was low on it. That’s about it, I think. Really, I don’t take much. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so I might be forgetting something.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hughston. That’s helpful. So, you're currently taking medication for hypertension—a blood pressure medication—Voltaren topical cream for arthritis, and a vitamin D supplement. Do you recall the dosage of your blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear… dosage. That's… tricky. I just take one every morning, with my breakfast. It’s a small pill, like I said. I really don’t pay attention to the numbers on the bottle. My husband always took care of that, and… well, it’s been a while since he passed. I just keep refilling the prescription when it gets low. Is it important what the number is? I can try to look it up on my phone if you need, but I’m not very good with technology.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Hughston. It's understandable that remembering details like dosage can be difficult, especially with everything you’ve been through. We can look it up, or we can proceed and I can review your medication list with your primary care physician. For now, let’s focus on the reason for today’s screening. Are you experiencing any symptoms that prompted your niece to schedule this appointment, or was it simply a routine request from Medicare?
PATIENT: Oh, no symptoms, not that I know of. Honestly, I felt perfectly fine when she told me about it. She just said Medicare was doing more of these tests now, and it was best to get it done. She’s a very sensible girl, my niece. Always looking out for me. I was a little surprised, I suppose, because I don't… well, I haven't really felt like I needed a test like this. I mostly just work, and try to keep up with my garden. Not much else going on, really. Do you need me to… think harder? I just don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: You’re not wasting my time at all, Ms. Hughston. It's very helpful to know that you're not experiencing any specific concerns that prompted this screening. And it sounds like you maintain an active lifestyle with your work and gardening, which is wonderful. To get a better understanding of your overall health, may I ask a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… alright. That’s… a long story. I’ve had a few things over the years, but nothing major, I don’t think. I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, and I broke my wrist a few years back… slipped on the ice. And… let me see. I’ve always had high blood pressure, like we were talking about. I suppose that's the biggest thing. My husband… he had heart problems, but that was… a long time ago. Is that the kind of thing you need to know? I try to remember, but… it all blurs together after a while. I'm sorry if I'm not very helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Hughston. It’s perfectly normal for details to become blurred over time, and you’re providing me with exactly the information I need. So, to summarize, you’ve had your gallbladder removed, a wrist fracture, and have a history of hypertension. I’m going to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Knowing about the health of your close relatives can sometimes provide valuable insights. Has there been any history of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's… complicated. My mother, she lived a long life, but she had… well, she had some kind of trouble with her heart, I think. My father, he died young, in a car accident. And my husband’s side… his mother had diabetes, I believe. And his brother… he had cancer, a long time ago. Lung cancer, I think. It’s all a bit hazy, honestly. We didn't talk about these things much when they were alive. Is it important to know what kind of cancer it was? I’m sorry, I just don’t have a very good memory for details like that. I’m trying my best.
DOCTOR: You are doing wonderfully, Ms. Hughston. It's alright that the details are hazy; it's common for families not to discuss medical history in detail. Knowing there was a history of heart trouble in your mother, diabetes in your husband’s mother, and lung cancer in your husband’s brother is helpful. Now, may I ask about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, social history… what does that mean, exactly? Do you mean… what do I do for fun? Well, like I said, I like my garden. And I used to enjoy traveling with my husband, but… that was a long time ago. I don't really go out much these days. Mostly just work and… keep the house tidy. I don't really have any hobbies besides that. And… I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I haven't been doing that lately. Is that what you mean? It's just a glass, nothing strong. I’m sorry if I’m being confusing.
DOCTOR: No, you are not being confusing at all, Ms. Hughston. That’s exactly the kind of information I need. So, you enjoy gardening, previously enjoyed traveling, and occasionally had a glass of wine with dinner. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never smoked a day in my life. My husband, he tried it once, a long time ago, but he didn't like it. Made him cough something awful. No, definitely not a smoker. Always thought it was a terrible habit. Is that important? I’m just trying to figure out why you’re asking all these questions, if you don’t mind me asking. Is it related to the test? I'm starting to get a little worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly valid question, Ms. Hughston. I understand your concern, and I want to assure you that I'm simply gathering a comprehensive picture of your overall health. The questions help me understand potential risk factors and ensure the best possible care. The screening we discussed—the substance use assessment—is a routine part of preventative care, often requested by Medicare. It's not necessarily indicative of any concern, but it's important to rule out any potential issues. The questions about your medical, family, and social history help me interpret the results accurately. Now, before we proceed with the physical portion of the examination, are there any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, that makes me feel better, knowing it’s just routine. I was starting to get a little anxious. No allergies, not that I know of. I can eat anything, take any medication… well, except for the blood pressure pill makes me a little dizzy sometimes, but that’s not an allergy, is it? I haven’t had any rashes or trouble breathing or anything like that. I really don't have any allergies. I’m lucky that way, I suppose. Are you going to… poke me now? I don’t like needles, if you have to ask.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the dizziness with your blood pressure medication—we can certainly note that. And no, no poking just yet, Ms. Hughston. I'm not going to draw any blood or administer any injections today. The physical examination will be fairly straightforward—I’ll simply listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and assess your overall well-being. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. Would you mind if I start by listening to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… much better. Listening is fine. I don't mind that at all. Just… don’t surprise me, alright? I jump easily these days. And… please be gentle. I’m not as young as I used to be. Alright, go ahead. I’ll just… sit here and try to relax. Though, with all these questions, it’s a bit hard to relax. But I’ll try.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hughston. I will explain everything as I go, and I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart with the stethoscope. I’m listening for any unusual sounds or patterns. Please take a few deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Your heart rate is regular, and I’m not detecting any murmurs or abnormal sounds. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Again, please take a few deep breaths. Your lung sounds are clear bilaterally, with good air entry. Now, I'm just going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88, which is slightly elevated. We will discuss this further and review your medication list.
PATIENT: Oh, slightly elevated… that doesn’t sound good, does it? Is that why I feel a little dizzy sometimes? I told you about that pill. Maybe I should just stop taking it, but I don't want to do anything without asking. My husband always said I shouldn't mess with my medicine. What do you think? Should I just stop it? I'm starting to get a little worried now, to be honest. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's understandable that you're concerned, Ms. Hughston. A blood pressure of 142/88 is indeed slightly elevated, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem. It’s common for blood pressure to fluctuate, and there are many factors that can influence it. The dizziness you experience could be related to the medication, but it's also important to rule out other potential causes. Absolutely do not stop taking your medication without first discussing it with me. Suddenly stopping your blood pressure medication can be dangerous. We need to carefully evaluate your situation before making any changes. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few routine blood tests. These tests will help us assess your overall health, kidney function, and electrolyte levels. They can also help us determine if the medication is contributing to the dizziness. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests… alright. I don’t like needles, but… if it will help, I suppose. It’s just… I bruise easily, you know? And I get a little faint sometimes. But if it’s important, I’ll do it. Just… be gentle, alright? And tell me when you’re going to poke me, so I don’t jump. And what kind of tests are they? Are they going to look for… bad things? I'm sorry, I'm being a bit of a worrywart, aren't I? It's just… I haven't been feeling myself lately, and I want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: You are not being a worrywart at all, Ms. Hughston. It’s perfectly natural to feel anxious about medical tests, and I appreciate you sharing your concerns. I will certainly be as gentle as possible, and I will explain each step before we proceed. The blood tests we’re ordering are routine and will give us valuable information about your overall health. We'll be checking your complete blood count, kidney function, electrolytes, and a basic metabolic panel. These tests will help us identify any potential underlying causes for your elevated blood pressure and dizziness. They are not specifically looking for “bad things,” but rather providing us with a comprehensive picture of your health status. To ensure your comfort, we’ll have you lie down during the blood draw. The phlebotomist will use a small needle to collect a few vials of blood, and it should only take a few minutes. I'll be right here throughout the process. Would you like me to provide you with a written list of the tests we’re ordering?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… much better, knowing you’ll be right there. And a written list would be good, yes. Just so I know what they’re looking for. I always feel better when I understand what’s going on. I suppose… let’s get it over with then. I don’t want to keep putting it off. But please, be gentle. And tell me if you see anything… concerning, alright? I'd rather know the truth, even if it’s not good. And… can I have a glass of water afterwards? I always get a little thirsty after things like this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hughston. I’ve ordered the blood tests and I’ll have the list printed for you right away. I will also let the phlebotomist know about your concerns, and they will be extra gentle. I will be right here throughout the process. Once the tests are completed, we’ll have you sit and rest for a few minutes, and I’ll have a glass of water brought to you immediately. We'll discuss the results as soon as they become available, and I’ll explain everything in detail. In the meantime, I'm going to write a referral for a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician so we can review the results together and discuss any necessary adjustments to your medication. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… perfect, Doctor. Yes, a follow-up with my doctor is a good idea. She's been taking care of me for years, and she knows my history. She’ll probably have a better idea of what's going on. Alright, let’s get this blood draw over with then. I’m just… a little nervous, I suppose. But I’ll try to be brave. Thank you for being so patient with me, Doctor. You've been very kind. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. Just… tell me when you’re going to poke me, alright? And… please be gentle.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Hughston. It's my pleasure to take care of you, and I understand your nervousness completely. I will be with you every step of the way. I will let you know exactly when the phlebotomist is ready, and I will ensure they are as gentle as possible. Nurse Ramirez, could you please come in and assist Ms. Hughston with her blood draw?
PATIENT: .
