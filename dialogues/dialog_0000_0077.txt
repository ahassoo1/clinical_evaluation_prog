DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Bigger, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's right. Delmon Bigger. And you are...? Not a Nigerian doctor, are you?
DOCTOR: Pinky Batara, Doctor of Internal Medicine. And no, I am not. Mongolian, actually. Now, let's not dwell on my origins, shall we?
PATIENT: Mongolian... hmm. Never met a Mongolian doctor before. But that’s not important. I was sent here for… evaluation. Something about the mine? They keep sending old men for check-ups. Waste of time, if you ask me. I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: “Evaluation,” yes. From the mine, you say?
PATIENT: That’s right. Underground. Been doing it a long time. They say there was… something in the air. Dust, maybe? I don't know. Never bothered me none. They just want to be safe, I suppose. Lots of rules these days.
DOCTOR: The report does mention prolonged exposure to airborne particulates. And your age… 86, is that correct?
PATIENT: Eighty-six come September. But I’m strong for my age! Still move faster than some of those young fellas. They worry too much, these people. It was just dust! Coal dust. I’ve breathed worse. What are you looking at on that machine anyway? Something bad?
DOCTOR: It's your medical history, Mr. Bigger. Just routine. We're looking at past exposures, any respiratory issues reported… and a rather… extensive work history in the mines. Now, can you tell me specifically what prompted this latest evaluation?
PATIENT: Prompted it? They sent a letter! Said it was a… a precaution. Something about new regulations after… after that accident last year. Young fella, crushed by a machine. Terrible thing. But that had nothing to do with dust! This is just… paperwork. A waste of my time, honestly. I feel good. Never felt better, actually.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, even feeling “good” doesn’t preclude the possibility of underlying issues developing over time with that sort of exposure. Just to be thorough, let’s go through a few questions. Have you noticed any changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Like what kind of changes? I eat my jollof rice, watch my football… same as always. My wife, God rest her soul, she used to complain about me snoring, but that's been going on for decades. What kind of changes are you asking about? I don’t understand.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger. Any changes in your breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? You mean… like getting out of breath? Sometimes, walking up the hill to the market, yes. But that's because I’m an old man! And that hill is steep. It’s not the mine, I tell you. It’s the hill. I've been climbing that hill for fifty years!
DOCTOR: And has that shortness of breath been getting worse recently?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm… maybe a little. But it could be the heat, you know? This August heat is terrible. Makes everything harder. I wouldn’t blame the mine for that. It's the weather. Always complaining about the weather these days. What good does it do?
DOCTOR: Do you experience any coughing, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Coughing? Sometimes. A little tickle in my throat. But who doesn't cough? Especially in this dust! I mean, even the air in this city is dusty! It's just… a cough. A normal cough. Nothing to worry about. You’re making a big deal out of nothing, Doctor. Really. I'm wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just listen to your lungs. It will only take a moment, and it's simply part of a standard evaluation. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Listen to my lungs? What for? They're fine! I've been breathing just fine for eighty-six years! But… alright. Fine. Do what you need to do. But don't be surprised if they sound perfectly normal. Hurry up, though. I have important things to do.
DOCTOR: Deep breath… and again. Alright. I am hearing some… diminished breath sounds, particularly in the lower lobes. And a slight wheezing.
PATIENT: Diminished? Wheezing? What does that mean? Sounds bad, doesn’t it? See? I knew I shouldn’t have come. My wife always said I worry too much, and now look. What are you going to do? Give me some pills? I don't like pills.
DOCTOR: It means we need to investigate further, Mr. Bigger. Your history, combined with what I'm hearing, suggests the possibility of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, potentially related to your long-term exposure in the mines. We need a chest X-ray, and I’d like to order a pulmonary function test to assess your lung capacity.
PATIENT: Chronic… what now? Obstructive… pulmonary… You're saying I have something wrong with my lungs? After all these years? The mine never said anything about this. Never! X-ray? Tests? This sounds expensive. And complicated. I don't like complicated. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “serious” right now, Mr. Bigger. But chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, if left unmanaged, can worsen over time. The X-ray and pulmonary function test will help us determine the extent of the damage and the best course of action. We need to rule things out, and assess the severity. It’s a common condition in individuals with prolonged exposure to dust and irritants. And it is manageable. We’ll discuss treatment options once we have the results of the tests. The clinic will handle the insurance paperwork.
PATIENT: Manageable… you keep saying that. But what does that mean? Will I have to… stop going to the market? Stop watching my football? Will I be… sick all the time? And what about the mine? They should have warned us about this. It's their fault, you know. All those years breathing in dust… This is just… not fair.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, let’s focus on getting the tests done first. We can discuss treatment options and potential lifestyle adjustments after we have a clearer picture of your condition. As for the mine, that is a separate matter. If you wish to pursue legal action, you are free to do so. This is a referral order for the radiology department. They’re located just down the street. Go there, and they’ll schedule your chest X-ray. Once that’s done, the pulmonary function test can be scheduled through the clinic. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Radiology… pulmonary… it's all just… words. I understand I have to go get poked and prodded by more people. And then wait. Always waiting. Will someone explain all this to me? In plain English? I don't understand these medical… things.
DOCTOR: Alright. This order is for an X-ray of your chest. It’s a quick scan, like a photograph, that will let us see your lungs. Then, we’ll schedule a “pulmonary function test.” That involves breathing into a tube – it measures how much air you can take in and out, and how quickly. It will take about 30 minutes. These tests will help us understand if your lungs are working properly, and if there’s any damage from the dust you’ve inhaled over the years. Once we have the results, we can discuss options like inhalers, or other treatments to help you breathe easier. Does that make more sense?
PATIENT: Inhalers… like for asthma? My neighbor’s son has asthma. So, I breathe into a tube… and get a picture of my lungs. And then you tell me what’s wrong? And what I have to do about it? Will it… will it make it easier to climb that hill to the market? That’s all I really want. To be able to keep going to the market. And watch my football. And remember my wife.
DOCTOR: That’s the goal, Mr. Bigger. To improve your breathing, and allow you to continue doing the things you enjoy. We’ll review the results together, discuss the best course of action, and address any concerns you may have. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. Never been allergic to anything. Ate everything my wife cooked, and she cooked everything. Pepper soup, jollof rice… everything. No problems. But she used a lot of spices. Maybe that built up my immunity. No, no allergies. Just… a little tired now. All this talk about lungs and tests…
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s a copy of your referral order and a summary of today’s discussion. Please schedule those tests as soon as possible. And if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… try to explain it slowly next time. And thank you… I suppose. I hope you’re right about the hill. Tell your wife… tell her I hope she’s doing well. .
