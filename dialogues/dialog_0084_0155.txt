DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Tremor, she said. That's what my daughter wrote down for me. It’s… my hands, mostly. Shaking. Been happening a while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long. Everything’s a bit… fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tremor in your hands. And you said it’s been going on for a while. “A while” is okay, we can work with that. Can you tell me a little more about the shaking?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not constant, you see. It comes and goes. Worse when I… when I try to do something precise. Like, holding a cup of coffee… or… buttoning my shirt. Things like that. Not so bad when I'm just… sitting. It’s just… annoying, mostly. Makes things difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. So it's intermittent, worse with tasks requiring fine motor skills. And it doesn't bother you when you're at rest. Does anything seem to make it better or worse, besides trying to do something with your hands?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I don’t really know. Honestly, I don't pay that much attention. Coffee might make it worse, now that I think about it. My daughter makes me a strong cup every morning. But I've been drinking coffee for… well, forever. So, who knows? It's hard to say, really. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll note the coffee intake. And it’s good you’re not sure – it helps us figure things out. Has the tremor been getting worse over time, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Worse, I think. Yes, definitely worse. It used to be just a little quiver, barely noticeable. Now… well, it’s harder to hide. Makes me feel clumsy, you know? Dropped a plate just last week. My daughter wasn’t happy. She worries, that one.
DOCTOR: Alright. A gradual worsening of the tremor. And it’s impacting your ability to do things. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm... Let me see... I've been a bit… stiff, maybe? In my shoulder, sometimes. And my handwriting’s gotten worse, even before the shaking. But I figured that was just… old age. Everything gets worse when you get old, doesn’t it? I don’t know if that’s connected. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so stiffness in your shoulder and worsening handwriting. We'll definitely take those into account. And it’s good you mentioned the memory issues. Now, have you had any falls recently?
PATIENT: Falls? Not… recently. No. I stumbled once, a few months ago, in the garden. But I caught myself. My daughter said I was being careless. She's always telling me to be careful. But no proper falls, no. Not that I remember, anyway. It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent falls, just a stumble. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my prostate acted on, years ago. That was… unpleasant. And my blood pressure, she said, was a little high at one point, but they gave me some pills for that. I think I still take them. Somewhere. I forget which ones now. Everything’s a jumble. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so history of prostate surgery and high blood pressure, currently on medication that you can’t recall the name of. We’ll try to get that straightened out. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I used to be stung by a bee when I was a boy, but that was… a long time ago. Didn't bother me much. Nothing I'm aware of now. I eat just about anything. My daughter worries about my cholesterol, but I don’t pay her much mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I'd like to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination, and listen to your heart and lungs. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Uh, alright. If you have to. I don’t much like being poked and prodded, but… if it helps. Just… be gentle, please. And don’t take too long. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. We'll take it slow. Please have a seat here, and we’ll start with some basic checks. Okay, Mr. Jezik, I observed a tremor in your hands, which appears to be more prominent when you’re resting, and some stiffness. Your gait is a little slower than usual, and your arm swing is reduced. I also noted some mild rigidity. Do you feel any pain when I move your arms like this?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. A little… uncomfortable, maybe? Like they’re… stuck. Not sharp pain, just… tight. It’s hard to explain. It's been like that for a while, I think. I just thought it was old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tightness, not sharp pain. Now, given your symptoms – the tremor, stiffness, slow gait, and handwriting changes – it's possible you have Parkinson’s disease. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm this. I’m going to order some blood work to rule out other possible causes, and I’d like to schedule a consultation with a neurologist for a more in-depth evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Parkinson's…? Is that… bad? My mother had something like that, I think. She ended up in a wheelchair… Oh, dear. A neurologist… more doctors… More poking and prodding… I suppose I have no choice, do I? If you think it’s necessary. Just… try to keep it quick, please. And tell me what's going on. Don't use complicated words. I don’t understand half of what doctors say, anyway.
