DOCTOR: Alright, Jailenne, good morning. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I’ve been getting chills lately, and it’s a bit worrying. Not like a fever chill, just…cold. It comes and goes, really.
DOCTOR: Chills, okay. And you say it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. It’s not constant. Sometimes I’ll be perfectly fine all day, and then suddenly I’ll just feel…shivering cold for like, twenty minutes? Then it’s gone. It's weird. I don't know if it's just the AC being too strong everywhere, honestly. But it's been happening for a couple of weeks now.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks, alright. And are you experiencing anything else along with these chills?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Not really. No cough, no sore throat, no aches…I’m not tired more than usual, maybe a little bit sluggish sometimes, but I usually am, to be honest. Nothing major, definitely not like a full-blown flu.
DOCTOR: Sluggish...and how would you describe your typical energy levels?
PATIENT: Well, I work full time, so… pretty normal tired, you know? Like, I need my coffee in the morning, and I like to relax after work. But this isn't more than that. It’s hard to explain. Just…a bit more drained than usual, maybe. And maybe a little bit more…forgetful? Though, that could just be stress. I got divorced last year, so…things have been a little hectic.
DOCTOR: Divorce is certainly stressful. So, the sluggishness and forgetfulness are relatively new, coinciding with the chills?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. It’s all kind of blended together, to be honest. The chills started maybe a week or so after things really…calmed down with the divorce. Like, the paperwork was final and I was trying to get back to normal, and then the chills started. The tiredness and forgetfulness came a bit after that. It's a mess, really. I’m not good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll try to sort through it. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox and all that, but nothing major. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that’s it. I've been pretty healthy, to be honest. I do have a little bit of…low iron sometimes? My doctor told me a few years back, but it's never been bad enough to need treatment or anything. Just something she mentioned in a check-up.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any. I'm a bit of a scaredy-cat when it comes to hospitals, to be honest. That's probably why I waited this long to come in about the chills!
DOCTOR: Alright. And your family?
PATIENT: Hmm...family history. My mom has high blood pressure, and my grandma had diabetes, but that's about it, really. No one else I can think of with anything major. Oh! My uncle on my dad's side had asthma when he was a kid, but he grew out of it. Is that important? I don't know what's relevant, sorry.
DOCTOR: It could be. Alright. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking anything – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, honestly. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if I get a headache, but that's it. Nothing regular, just as needed. Oh! And I drink a lot of herbal tea. Mostly chamomile, for relaxing. Does that count? It’s not really medicine, I guess.
DOCTOR: No, chamomile tea doesn’t count. Allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. Oh, wait… sometimes I get a little itchy if I'm around cats. But it’s not a full-blown allergic reaction, just a little bit of a rash. I just avoid cats, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your temperature and blood pressure. Then, I want to do a quick neurological check - just to see how your reflexes are. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 128/76. Temperature is 98.6. Noted. Now, just going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. No obvious neurological deficits. I'm also going to palpate your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Everything appears normal, physically. Now, I'd like to order some bloodwork. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. It’ll give us a better look at what’s going on. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Bloodwork, right. No, I don't think so. Just...what exactly are we looking for? Like, is there something specific you suspect? I don't want to worry about anything too serious.
DOCTOR: We're ruling things out. The chills, sluggishness and forgetfulness could be a number of things – a mild viral infection, vitamin deficiency, thyroid issue…the bloodwork will help us pinpoint the cause. It's unlikely to be anything overly concerning, but it’s best to be thorough. We'll get the results back in a few days, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds…reasonable. A few days, okay. So, just routine bloodwork? And we’ll talk about the results after? That’s fine. Where do I go to get it done? Is there a lab I should use? And… will my insurance cover it? I have private insurance.
DOCTOR: Yes, routine. The lab is right across the street – 123 Main Street. They take your insurance - I've already pre-authorized the order. It's best to fast for 8 hours before the test, meaning no food or drinks other than water. The results will be sent directly to my office. Now, I don't want you to go and self-diagnose using the internet. You come back to me with any concerns. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, 123 Main Street. Fast for 8 hours, and no Googling. I promise. I’m terrible at medical stuff anyway, so I wouldn't even know where to start. So, just come back in a few days and we'll talk about the results? That sounds good, Doctor. Thank you. I think that's everything?
DOCTOR: Yes. The receptionist will schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. Have a good day. And try to relax. .
