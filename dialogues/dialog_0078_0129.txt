DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Hatchard. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's nice to meet you. I see you're here today with us at the clinic. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have all day. It’s my… well, it’s my stool. It’s black. Like tar, almost. And I take those pain pills, you know, for my arthritis. The red ones. Been taking ‘em for years. Is that what you need to know? Honestly, I just want to get this sorted and be on my way.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Hatchard, I understand you're concerned about the color of your stool and you've noticed it's black, like tar. And you mentioned taking red pain pills for your arthritis for quite some time. That's helpful information. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the change in your stool?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t remember exactly when. A few days, maybe? A week? It all blurs together after a while, you know. I just noticed it when I… well, when I went to the bathroom. It wasn’t normal, that’s for sure. Look, I'm not one for dwelling on these things. Is it serious? Because if it's nothing, I’d really like to know so I can go home.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mrs. Hatchard. It's perfectly alright if you don't have a precise date. "A few days to a week" is helpful enough. We just want to rule things out. Black, tarry stools can sometimes indicate bleeding in the digestive tract, which is why we need to investigate. Now, besides the color, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Goodness. Well, no, no bright red blood, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… dark. And, well, it’s been a bit… stickier, I suppose. Harder to… you know. Usually it goes right down, but lately I’ve had to… push a bit more. Is that important? Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. It’s probably just the pills. They mess everything up, those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for telling me about the stickiness and the increased effort to have a bowel movement. That's useful information. And you’re right to wonder about the pills, we definitely need to consider them. Now, have you noticed any abdominal pain, cramping, or bloating along with these changes?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it... my stomach has been a bit gassy. More than usual. And sometimes, just a dull ache. It's not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like after a big meal, maybe. But I get a lot of aches and pains, you know, being my age. Everything hurts, eventually. I don't go making a fuss over every little twinge. Are we getting anywhere with this? I really should be getting back to my garden. The tomatoes are ripening fast.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mrs. Hatchard. It’s good that you’re able to distinguish what feels different. The gas and dull ache are important things to note. And I appreciate your patience with me. We are getting somewhere, and I want to make sure we cover all the bases so you can get back to your tomatoes. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, just to get a complete picture. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Ugh. Weight loss? No! If anything, I’ve gained a bit. My husband keeps bringing me pastries. Can’t refuse a good pastry, you know. And no, no throwing up, and thankfully not feeling sick either. Just… tired. Always tired. But that’s just getting old, isn’t it? Honestly, I think I’ve told you everything. Can’t we just get a prescription or something? I’d really like to be done with this.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Hatchard. No nausea, vomiting, or weight loss – that’s helpful to know. And you’re right, fatigue can certainly be a part of getting older. To complete the picture, do you have any known allergies to medications, or any other medical conditions besides your arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis, that’s it! And no, no allergies. Never had any trouble with any pills, ever. My husband does the shopping, you know. He’s very careful. And no other conditions. Just… aches and pains. Like I said. Look, are we going to talk about this all day? This is ridiculous. I’ve been perfectly healthy my whole life, aside from the arthritis. Honestly, I think it’s just the pills. Can’t you just give me something for the gas and tell me to take less of the red ones? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mrs. Hatchard. I want to assure you, I’m not trying to keep you here longer than necessary. It's just important to gather all the information to make the best decision. Given your history and these symptoms, and your concern about the pain pills, I do want to proceed with a few simple tests to rule out any other potential causes. I’m thinking a stool test to check for blood, and a quick blood test to check your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
