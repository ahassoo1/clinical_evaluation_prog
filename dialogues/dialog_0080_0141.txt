DOCTOR: Hi Brendan, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Rosanova, nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching. It’s just… everywhere, really. Been going on for a little while now, and it’s driving me a bit crazy. Not a sharp itch, more… all-over and annoying, you know? It’s hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Okay, “all-over and annoying” – I understand. Itching can be incredibly frustrating. And you said "a little while now"—could you give me a more specific timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably about three weeks ago, maybe a little longer. At first, it was just my arms, and I didn’t think much of it. Thought it was just dry skin, you know? But then it spread to my legs, my back… now it feels like everywhere. It’s pretty constant, doesn’t really go away completely.
DOCTOR: Alright, three weeks, starting on the arms and spreading. Constant itching – that’s helpful to know. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Good question. Hmm… nothing specific really jumps out. I haven’t been doing anything different, not that I know of. Hot showers seem to make it a little bit worse right after, but it settles down eventually. And… maybe when I’m stressed? I don’t know if that’s just me noticing it more when I’m stressed, if that makes sense. I lost my wife a couple years back, and… well, things haven’t been the same, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Grief can absolutely manifest physically, and stress is a common trigger for skin issues. So, hot showers and possibly stress. Have you tried anything to relieve the itching so far?
PATIENT: Yeah, I have. Mostly just lotions, you know? Regular moisturizers. Didn’t really do much, honestly. I tried some of that anti-itch cream from the drugstore, the one with the menthol, but that just felt… cooling for a minute, and then it was back. I haven’t really found anything that helps for any length of time. I'm on Medicare, so I don’t want to go buying a bunch of expensive stuff if it's not going to work, you know?
DOCTOR: That's very sensible, and good to keep costs in mind. Okay, lotions and an over-the-counter anti-itch cream with limited relief. Now, aside from the itching, have you noticed any changes to your skin itself?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No, not really. It doesn't look different. No rash, no bumps, no redness. It just feels… irritated. Maybe a little dry in places, but I put lotion on it all the time, so it’s hard to say. Nothing visible, anyway. It's just this constant itch that's driving me up the wall, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no visible skin changes, just the persistent itch. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, just to get a fuller picture. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. I've never had a reaction to anything. I used to get stung by bees as a kid, but that was a long time ago, and I didn’t have any trouble with it. I eat pretty much anything, and haven't noticed any issues there either. Never had any trouble with penicillin or anything like that either, if that helps. I try to eat healthy, but I'm not perfect, you know?
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies is helpful. And you mentioned your wife passed a couple of years ago – I’m sorry for your loss. Are you currently taking any medications for anything?
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Rosanova. It’s… still hard some days. And no, I'm not taking any regular medications. Just over-the-counter stuff for aches and pains sometimes, like ibuprofen. Nothing daily, nothing prescribed. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can, you know? I'd rather just tough things out.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Now, do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got it under control with diet and exercise. It’s been good for a few years now. And… I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that was a one-time thing. Other than that, I’ve been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I try to stay active, walk every day.
DOCTOR: Alright, controlled high blood pressure and gallbladder removal ten years ago. And you walk daily – that's excellent. Just to complete the picture, have you ever had any surgery other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see... No, I don't think so. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that just needed a cast. Nothing else I can think of. No other surgeries, no. I've been pretty lucky, haven't had to go under the knife much.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history... That's a tough one. My mother had some trouble with her skin when she was older, some eczema, I think. My father was healthy as a horse, lived to be 85. My sister has diabetes, but she's over in Russia and I don't see her much. Nothing else really jumps to mind. Not a lot of serious illnesses in the family, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Eczema in your mother, diabetes in your sister. Alright Brendan, thank you for all that information, it’s very helpful. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Rosanova. I'm happy to do whatever I can to figure this out. It’s just been so annoying, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s take a look. Please, if you could just loosen your shirt a bit and stand facing me. I'm not seeing any rash, no hives, no obvious signs of infection. Your skin does appear a little dry overall, but nothing particularly remarkable. I'm also not seeing any areas of excoriation – that's where the skin is broken from scratching – which is good. Skin feels normal temperature and texture, no swelling. Okay. Alright, everything looks normal, which makes this a little tricky. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out a few things, just to be safe. We'll check your liver function, kidney function, thyroid levels, and do a complete blood count. That will give us a better idea of what might be going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible to me. Blood work sounds good. I just want to get this figured out, you know? I'm happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. Is it something I can do here at the clinic? And… will the Medicare cover that? I always worry about those things.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can absolutely do the blood work right here at the clinic. And yes, Medicare should cover it, but it’s always best to double-check with them directly to be sure. Our billing department can help you with that if you'd like – they're very good at navigating insurance. Okay, I'm just ordering the lab tests now. It should take about 10-15 minutes for the phlebotomist to get you set up. While you're waiting, I’m going to write down a couple of things for you to try at home in the meantime, while we wait for the results. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, thank you. I appreciate you thinking of things I can do in the meantime. And thanks for the help with the Medicare, that's one less thing to worry about. I'm happy to wait, and I appreciate you taking the time to figure this out. I've been itching for weeks now, so a little waiting won't bother me.
DOCTOR: Alright Brendan, here’s a handout with some recommendations for at-home care. I’m suggesting you switch to a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic soap and lotion. Avoid hot showers and baths – lukewarm is best. Also, try to minimize stress as much as possible. I know that’s easier said than done, but even small things can help. Finally, I’m recommending an over-the-counter antihistamine at night. It can help with the itching, especially if it's related to an allergic reaction, even a mild one. While we wait for the blood work, these steps can provide some relief. The phlebotomist will be with you shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any questions about any of these recommendations?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds good. Fragrance-free soap, lukewarm water, less stress… I can definitely try all of that. I'll see if I can get the antihistamine tonight. I think I remember my wife used to take something like that sometimes. Thank you, Dr. Rosanova. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Hopefully, the blood work will give us some answers.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome Brendan. I’m glad I could help, and I’m hopeful we’ll have some answers soon. I'll let you get started with the blood work, and I’ll come back and discuss the results with you once they’re available. Please, let the nurse know if you feel faint or dizzy at any time. Do you have any other questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Dr. Rosanova. I appreciate your time and patience. I'll let the nurse know if I need anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brendan. You have a good day, and I’ll see you shortly.
