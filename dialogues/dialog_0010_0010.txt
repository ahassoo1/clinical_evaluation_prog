DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it's… something with some swelling, I think. Honestly, it’s a bit hard to recall exactly when it started, or how. It just… appeared. I apologize for being vague.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jahaad. It’s quite common for these things to be a little hazy at first. “Some swelling”… where exactly are you experiencing this swelling, and can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: I believe it’s mostly… around my face and neck. It’s not terribly painful, more… uncomfortable. Like a tightness, you know? And it feels… softer than it should, if that makes any sense. It’s definitely noticeable when I look in the mirror, but I’m not sure how long it’s been this way.
DOCTOR: Okay, face and neck swelling, more uncomfortable than painful, with a feeling of softness… and you're unsure of the onset. Has this swelling been constant since it started, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I think it's been fairly constant, but… there might have been a day or two where it seemed a little less prominent. It’s difficult to say for certain. I haven't been actively tracking it, I'm afraid. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Jahaad. We’ll figure it out together. And it's perfectly alright if you don’t remember every detail. Now, has anything specific happened around the time you noticed this swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can recall. I’ve been… fairly routine lately, I suppose. Work, some quiet evenings at home… nothing particularly strenuous or unusual. No injuries, no new medications… I honestly wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… frustrating not being able to pinpoint a cause.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jahaad. It is helpful just telling me what hasn’t been happening. Let’s try this: have you noticed any other symptoms along with this swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… I suppose I have been feeling a bit more tired than usual, but I attributed that to work. And maybe a little… warm. Not a fever, exactly, but warmer than I typically am. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is relevant. Fatigue and feeling warm… Okay. And have you experienced any changes in your appetite, or have you noticed any difficulty swallowing or breathing?
PATIENT: No, my appetite hasn't changed. I’m eating pretty normally, I think. And no difficulty swallowing or breathing. Thankfully. No, those haven't been issues at all. It really is mostly just the swelling and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… to the best of my knowledge, no. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. No food allergies, no medication allergies… I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. I don't recall ever having a serious allergic reaction, at least.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, I think. Nothing prescribed, nothing for any specific condition. Just… a general health thing. I’ve been taking it for… a while now, I suppose. Years, probably. It’s quite routine.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jahaad. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a closer look at your neck and face. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please proceed. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I’m feeling some slight swelling in your neck, and I do detect some mild tenderness to the touch. The swelling on your face appears to be… soft, as you mentioned, and doesn’t seem to be accompanied by any redness or warmth. I don't feel any particularly large or concerning masses, but there is some diffuse swelling. Your lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, but not dramatically so.
PATIENT: That… sounds about right, I suppose. The tenderness is noticeable sometimes, especially when I turn my head. I’m glad you were able to confirm that it’s not anything too alarming. What do you think could be causing this, Doctor? And what would you recommend?
DOCTOR: Alright, Jahaad. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause with certainty at this point. However, the most likely possibilities include a viral infection, a mild allergic reaction, or potentially, inflammation of the salivary glands. It could also be a reaction to something you've been exposed to, but without more information, it’s hard to say for sure. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for signs of infection, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. We can also check your thyroid levels just to rule out any thyroid-related issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A viral infection, an allergic reaction… that sounds… reasonable, I suppose. I’m happy to get the tests done, Doctor. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. Yes, please proceed with the tests. I trust your judgment. How long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: Great. The lab results typically take about 24 to 48 hours to come back. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. Once we have those results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding any potential allergens if you suspect that might be a factor. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage any discomfort you’re experiencing. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Jahaad?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Rest, hydration, avoid allergens… I can certainly do that. Thank you for taking the time to examine me and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your help. I believe that’s all for now, then?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jahaad. I’m glad I could help. If anything changes or if you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. My nurse will provide you with instructions on how to do so. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. .
