DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, Doc, can we just get on with it? I haven't got all day. It’s this…shaking. Hands mostly. Been happening a while now, frankly. It's just getting worse, and my grandkids are starting to stare.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I understand you'd like to get straight to the point, and we will. It sounds like you're experiencing tremors, specifically in your hands, and it’s been progressive. And it’s concerning your grandchildren. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when this shaking started?
PATIENT: When it started? Honestly, I don’t rightly remember. Years, probably. A long time. It was just…a little thing at first. Barely noticeable. I figured it was just getting old, you know? I’ve lived a long life, what do you expect? Not like it’s a surprise or anything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's easy to dismiss things when they come on gradually. So, it's been years, starting as a slight tremor and slowly getting worse. Can you describe the shaking to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It’s…shaky! What do you want me to say? It's like…my hand is vibrating. Especially when I try to do something. Like, if I try to write or hold a glass, it gets worse. Sometimes it happens even when I’m just sitting there. It’s annoying, that’s what it is. Just…annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a vibration or trembling, primarily in your hands, and it's worsened by activity like writing or holding things. It also happens at rest sometimes. That’s helpful to know. Does anything seem to make it better, or worse, besides activity?
PATIENT: Worse? Stress, I suppose. Thinking too much. Though at my age, everything stresses me out. Better? Not really. Coffee maybe? But I like my coffee. Can’t be giving that up.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stress seems to exacerbate it, and coffee doesn’t appear to be a trigger, despite potentially being a stimulant. Let’s talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… I get tired, I guess. But who doesn't at my age? My knees ache. Everything aches, frankly. I don’t know what you’re getting at. Is this shaking something serious? Because I haven’t got time for serious. I’ve got a boat to maintain.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about it being serious, and we’ll get to the bottom of it together. Fatigue and aching joints are common, so I appreciate you clarifying that those aren’t necessarily new. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any stiffness in your muscles, any changes in your speech, or any difficulty with your balance?
PATIENT: Balance? No, not really. I walk fine. Though I take things slower these days. Stiffness…sometimes, maybe. But I’ve always been a bit creaky. Speech? I don't think so. Everyone says I talk too much, if anything. Look, Doc, are you going to give me a pill or what? I haven’t got all day for a guessing game. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Mr. Baide. I want to assure you I’m not trying to waste your time. I'm simply gathering information to help me understand what's going on and ensure I’m recommending the best course of action. Let me ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, lord. Let me think. High blood pressure, I think. Years ago. And…arthritis, maybe. Something with the joints. Honestly, I’ve seen so many doctors in my life, I can’t keep track. They all said the same thing: “You’re getting old.” Just give me something for the shaking, alright? That's all I care about. My granddaughter wants me to teach her how to waterski. Can’t do that with a shaky hand, can I?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. High blood pressure and arthritis are good to know. It sounds like you've had a lot of experience with doctors and a lot of similar advice. Just to confirm, do you currently take any medications for either of those conditions?
PATIENT: Medications? Ugh, let me see… I take a little pill for the blood pressure, I think. Small white one. And…something for my knees, sometimes. When they’re really bothering me. I honestly don’t keep track. My daughter handles most of that stuff now. It’s all a blur, alright? Just… give me a pill!
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a medication for blood pressure and something as needed for your knees. We’ll try to get a more precise list later. Before we consider medication, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your reflexes, your coordination, and assess the tremor itself. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Don’t poke around too much, alright? I’m an old man, not a science project. And make it quick. I’ve got important things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common at your age. Now, could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It’s shaking, see? What’s the point of even looking? You already know it’s shaking. Just give me something to stop it. That’s all I want. Honestly, this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the tremor. It appears to be a resting tremor, meaning it's more prominent when your arms are relaxed. The finger-to-nose test shows some mild difficulty with coordination, but nothing alarming. Your joints don’t show any significant swelling or tenderness at the moment. Based on this brief exam and your history, the most likely explanation for your shaking is essential tremor. It’s a common neurological condition that becomes more prevalent with age. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few blood tests and possibly a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Essential tremor? Never heard of it. Is it serious? Will it stop me from waterskiing? Blood tests… fine, I guess. Neurologist… ugh. More waiting rooms and poking and prodding? Look, Doc, if it’s not going to stop me from enjoying my life, I don’t want to hear about it. Just tell me what I can take to stop the shaking. And make it quick. I really haven’t got all day. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Baide. Essential tremor is typically not life-threatening, but it can be bothersome and impact your quality of life. It's not something that goes away on its own, but it's manageable. I appreciate that you're worried about it interfering with your activities. We can explore medication options to help reduce the tremor. However, it’s important to rule out other conditions first, such as thyroid problems or certain medication side effects. That's why I recommend the blood tests. To start, I will order a complete blood count, thyroid stimulating hormone level, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. We'll also review your current medications to ensure none of them are contributing to the tremor. If the blood tests are normal, I will refer you to a neurologist for further evaluation. They may recommend additional testing, such as a dopamine transport scan, to confirm the diagnosis and discuss treatment options, including medication or, in some cases, deep brain stimulation. I will also give you a prescription for Propranolol, a beta-blocker that can sometimes help reduce tremor symptoms. However, it’s important to be aware of potential side effects, such as low blood pressure and fatigue. We will monitor your blood pressure closely while you’re taking it. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
