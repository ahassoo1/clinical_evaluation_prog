DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, right. It's about this tryout. For the team. I need a checkup to make sure I'm good to go, you know? Just the usual, I guess. I want to get this over with quickly if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Right. A team tryout. Well, “usual” can mean a lot of things. It's good you’re thinking ahead, but we need to be a bit more specific. How old are you, Mr. Kingan?
PATIENT: Sixty-two. Sixty-two years old. I know, I know, old for a tryout, but I keep myself in shape. I don't want any surprises, that's why I'm here. Just need to make sure nothing's gonna give out on me.
DOCTOR: Sixty-two… alright. And what kind of team are we talking about?
PATIENT: Mongolian wrestling. You know, Bökh. It's… it's pretty demanding. Lots of strength and stamina. Not like those team sports with a lot of running. More… grappling, and… well, pushing. That's why I said I wanted to be thorough. Gotta be strong to push someone out of the ring, you know?
DOCTOR: Mongolian wrestling. Right. And you’re currently training for this?
PATIENT: Yeah, been training for months. Every day, mostly. I’ve been wrestling my whole life, really. Just want to make sure my old bones can handle a few more matches. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do later.
DOCTOR: “Old bones,” as you put it, require a bit more investigation than a routine checkup, Mr. Kingan. To get a better understanding, let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, anything at all?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. Nothing diagnosed, anyway. I've had aches and pains, sure. Getting old, right? My knees sometimes bother me after training, but I just rub them with some liniment. Nothing a good rub can't fix. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. Honestly. I just try to stay active. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: “Not diagnosed” doesn’t mean it’s not there, Mr. Kingan. And ignoring aches and pains, especially at your age and with the type of activity you’re doing, is… not ideal. Alright. Let’s talk about family history. Do you have a family history of heart disease, stroke, or any other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: My father… he had some heart trouble later in life. But he smoked, you know? Lots of cigarettes. I never touched them. My mother… she was pretty healthy, I think. Lived a long life. Not much else, really. We didn’t really talk about health a lot. More about… the wrestling, mostly.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just liniment, like I said. And sometimes ibuprofen for the knee pain, if it's really bad. Not every day, though. Maybe once or twice a month. And… vitamins. Multivitamins, just to keep things going. Nothing fancy. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, ibuprofen can have side effects, especially with regular use. And we need to be aware of all supplements you are taking, as they can interact with other medications, should you need them. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Then we can discuss further testing if needed. Do you have any allergies I should know about?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing that I know of. Heart and lungs are fine, I think. I'm still breathing, right? Go ahead. Let’s just get this done. The sooner I know, the sooner I can get back to training.
DOCTOR: Right. If you could just sit back and relax. I’ll need you to take a few deep breaths. Heart sounds… slightly irregular. Murmur present. Lungs sound clear, but breathing is a little labored. Blood pressure is… elevated. 160 over 95. Alright. Now, let's take a look at those knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: They creak a bit. Always have. But they still work, mostly. There's some swelling, I guess. It gets worse after training. Is that really so bad? It's just old age, Doctor. Old age and a lot of wrestling.
DOCTOR: There is some swelling and tenderness. Range of motion is limited. Mr. Kingan, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, your blood pressure is significantly elevated, and your heart sounds are concerning. The knee issues are likely arthritis, which we can manage, but the cardiac findings need to be investigated further. I'm going to order an EKG and some blood work to check your cholesterol and kidney function. And I strongly recommend a consultation with a cardiologist.
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Look, I just need a checkup for the team. I don't need all this… fuss. Is it going to stop me from wrestling? Because if it is… I've wrestled my whole life, Doctor. I can't just stop.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand your passion, but your health is more important than a wrestling tryout. Ignoring these issues could lead to serious consequences, including a heart attack or stroke. The EKG and blood work will give us a better understanding of what's going on, and the cardiologist can provide expert advice. I'm not saying you have to stop wrestling, but you absolutely need to get this checked out before you put any further strain on your body. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fine. EKG and… the blood work. And the… cardiologist. But can we hurry this up? I have things to do. I'll make the appointments, I guess. Just tell me where to go. But I'm telling you, Doctor, I feel fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's a referral to Dr. Chen, a cardiologist at County General. And this is for the lab. They have locations both downtown and in the West End. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment with me once you have the results. And, Mr. Kingan, until you've been cleared by the cardiologist, I strongly advise against any strenuous activity. It's not about stopping you from doing what you love, it's about keeping you alive to do it. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… where's the lab? And… thanks, I guess. This is going to take forever, isn't it? Bökh season is starting soon… .
