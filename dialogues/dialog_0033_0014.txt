DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Limtiaco, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Ronnald Limtiaco. Though, everyone just calls me Ron. It's… been a while since I've been to a doctor, to be honest. I think it’s about some papers I need filled out… for work? My wife helped me with the appointment. She’s much better at remembering these things than I am.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. We all have our strengths. Let’s try to be efficient, shall we?
PATIENT: Efficient sounds good! I just… I’m not exactly sure what papers she said I needed. Something about… time off? Or maybe if I can’t work right now? She mentioned FMLA… does that ring a bell? I work with the church, doing… well, a little bit of everything, really. Directing activities and education programs. It's a bit fuzzy when I try to remember the details.
DOCTOR: FMLA. Right. So, you’re requesting medical leave from your… church work. And you want me to fill out paperwork stating… what exactly?
PATIENT: That’s right. And I apologize, I truly do. I wish I could be more helpful. My wife said something about needing documentation for… a health issue. I've been feeling… off. Not sick, exactly, but just… tired a lot. And a little confused, sometimes. It's hard to explain. She thinks it’s important to have the paperwork in case it gets worse, or… if I need to take some time off to rest. I don’t even know what kind of information you need from me! Is there a form I should be looking at?
DOCTOR: "Confused," you say?
PATIENT: Yes… well, it’s not like I’m forgetting everything, but… things slip my mind. Dates, mostly. And names. And what I was just talking about, sometimes. It's been getting a little more frequent lately, my wife pointed out. She’s very observant. It’s not… debilitating, not yet. But it’s enough to make me worry. And enough for her to insist I get checked out. She’s probably right, to be honest. I just… I don't like feeling like I'm losing it, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s see what we have here… You’ve had remarkably few visits to any physician, frankly. Do you have any other health concerns I should be aware of?
PATIENT: That’s… not surprising. I’ve always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I don't really go to doctors unless absolutely necessary. My wife keeps telling me I need to be more proactive, but… I just don’t like being fussed over. As for other concerns… my knees bother me sometimes, getting older, I guess. And I’ve been a little more forgetful, as we discussed. Nothing else comes to mind at the moment. Is that… a problem? Should I be thinking of something else? I worry about my blood pressure, maybe? My father had that.
DOCTOR: Your father’s blood pressure is… irrelevant. We’re here to address your concerns. Now, let's try to narrow this down. This forgetfulness… when did it start?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It’s… gradual, you see. It wasn't like a sudden thing. Maybe… six months ago? No, longer. A year, perhaps? It’s hard to pinpoint. I started noticing I was repeating myself more, asking the same questions. And… misplacing things. Keys, mostly. And my glasses. It’s silly, really. But then… it started to feel like… gaps in my memory. Like I was missing pieces of conversations. My wife says it’s concerning, and she’s probably right. She remembers everything! It's… frustrating, if I'm honest. Not because of the forgetfulness, exactly, but because I can't seem to explain it properly. I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Right. “Gaps.” And are these gaps affecting your daily life?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. It’s not… drastic, not yet. But I’ve had a few… close calls. Forgetting appointments, almost missing important meetings at the church. And sometimes… I struggle to find the right words when I’m leading a discussion. It's embarrassing. And I’ve had to ask my wife to remind me of things constantly. Names of people I’ve known for years! It's… unsettling. I worry about being able to continue doing my work effectively. I enjoy helping people, leading the programs… and I don’t want to lose that. It's just… I'm not as sharp as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a brief cognitive assessment. Just a few simple questions to gauge your current state. Do you agree?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. A “cognitive assessment,” you say? Sounds… thorough. I hope I don’t do too badly. I’m just worried I’ll get flustered and forget everything I was just telling you. But yes, let’s do it. I want to figure out what’s going on, and if there’s anything I can do about it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First question: What is today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. Let me think… It’s… August, definitely August. But the… day? Is it the 1st? No… My wife told me, I just can’t seem to recall. Is it the 2nd? Yes, I think it’s the 2nd. August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I hope I’m not already failing!
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, can you spell "world"?
PATIENT: Oh, that's easy! W-O-R-L-D. World. Yes, that's a simple one. I used to read to my grandchildren all the time. Spelling and everything. Though… sometimes I think my brain is a little rusty. It's good to be tested, I suppose. Helps to know where things stand. Is it… okay that I'm taking a little longer than I should? I don't want to hold you up.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words. Listen carefully. Apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes, I have them. Apple, table, penny. I think I have them. It's just… I already feel like I’m forgetting things. Are you writing them down? It’s reassuring to know you’re keeping track. I worry I’ll say them wrong, or… miss one. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you subtract seven from one hundred?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… One hundred… subtract seven… Ninety-three? Is that right? Yes, I believe it’s ninety-three. It's… simple math, but my mind feels a little foggy. I used to be very good with numbers. I apologize if I'm taking too long. It's just… harder to concentrate than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. And finally, who is the current President of the United States?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a tricky one. I should know that, shouldn't I? Is it… Biden? Yes, I believe it's Biden. Joe Biden. I think. I follow the news, but sometimes… the names just slip my mind. It's embarrassing to admit, but… it's true. I hope I got it right. Is this… is this bad?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Limtiaco, the results are… concerning. Your performance on this brief assessment indicates some degree of cognitive impairment. It’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis, of course. But we need to investigate further. I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They will likely order some imaging scans—an MRI, perhaps—and further cognitive testing. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid complex tasks—driving, managing finances—until we have a clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. "Cognitive impairment?" That… sounds very serious. An MRI? I… I don't know what to say. I just thought it was a little forgetfulness, you know? Getting old. I certainly didn't think it was anything this serious. Avoid complex tasks? That… that means my wife will have to do everything. I… yes, I have questions. What… what does this mean? Is it… is it Alzheimer's? And what about the FMLA paperwork? Will I be able to take time off work? I don’t understand… everything is happening so fast.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, please. Let’s not jump to conclusions. “Cognitive impairment” is a broad term. It doesn’t automatically mean Alzheimer’s disease. There are many possible causes—vitamin deficiencies, medication side effects, even stress. The neurologist will determine the underlying cause. As for the FMLA paperwork, yes, I can complete it stating that you have a medical condition that may require time off work. However, that is contingent on the neurologist’s findings. I cannot guarantee approval. I recommend you schedule an appointment with Dr. Anya Sharma, she’s a very good neurologist. I have her contact information here. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma… alright. Thank you. It’s just… everything feels so overwhelming. I feel like I'm losing control. Losing my memory, losing my… myself. And my wife… she’s going to be so worried. She’s always been so strong, but this… this is a lot for her to handle. I… I suppose I just need some time to process everything. Will the neurologist be able to tell me what's happening, for sure? And… is there anything I can do right now, to… to help my memory? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, I understand you’re anxious. But I’m a specialist in Internal Medicine, not neurology. I can’t provide you with a definitive diagnosis or treatment plan. As for what you can do right now… maintain a healthy diet, get regular exercise, and try to reduce stress. That’s basic medical advice. And yes, the neurologist will conduct a thorough evaluation and provide you with a clearer picture of what's happening. I have other patients waiting, so I’m afraid I must wrap things up. Here’s a referral form for Dr. Sharma, and a summary of our conversation. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And try not to worry unduly. Sometimes, these things resolve on their own. Good day, Mr. Limtiaco.
PATIENT: .
