DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. It’s Dr. Pirl. Welcome to the clinic. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. It's been going on for a while now, honestly. I can't really say how long. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: I see. “Tiredness,” you say… and it's been ongoing for some time. It’s understandable that it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly when things started. Fuzzy is… a good way to describe it. To help me understand a little better, could you describe what this tiredness feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. What does it feel like… It’s not like I haven’t slept, exactly. I do sleep. But then I wake up… and it's like I didn't. Like I've been running a marathon all night. Just… heavy. Everything feels heavy. And it’s not just my body, you know? My… my head feels heavy too. I just… lack energy, I guess. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. “Heavy,” both physically and mentally… and lacking energy even after sleep. That gives me a better picture. Now, has this tiredness been gradually worsening, or has it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… suddenly or gradually… I really can’t say. It’s just… always been there, I think? Maybe it's gotten a little worse lately? It’s hard to remember things these days. My husband… he passed away a few years back, and… well, things haven’t been quite the same since.
DOCTOR: I understand. A significant loss like that can certainly have a lasting impact. It’s perfectly understandable that you might not be feeling yourself. Let’s try to piece things together. Besides the tiredness and the feeling of heaviness, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. My appetite isn't what it used to be. I don't really feel hungry much, and when I do eat, I don't enjoy it like I used to. And… I get a little… shaky sometimes. Not all the time, but… enough to notice. It's mostly in my hands, I think.
DOCTOR: Reduced appetite and a loss of enjoyment in food, along with some shakiness in your hands… alright. Are these symptoms constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go, I think. The shakiness is worse when I’m… stressed, maybe? Or if I haven't eaten in a while. The appetite thing… that’s more all the time, but some days are better than others. Honestly, Doctor, it’s just… frustrating. I feel like I'm falling apart.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Licano. It sounds very disruptive to your daily life. We will try to find some answers. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just… Medicare helps with a few things. Let me see… I have something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. And… sometimes I take something for aches and pains. Just when they’re bad. I don't remember the names, I’m afraid. My daughter usually sorts all that out for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication and something for aches and pains… That's helpful to know, even without the specific names. Do you know the dosages of either of these medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I wouldn't have a clue. Like I said, my daughter handles all that. She keeps a list, I'm sure. I'll have to ask her. I’m really sorry I can't be more help with the details. It's just… a lot to keep track of.
DOCTOR: Don't worry about it at all, Ms. Licano. It's perfectly common for patients to not remember medication details, especially with multiple prescriptions. Your daughter keeping a list is very helpful. Now, before we move on, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had any trouble with anything, really. I eat everything, and I haven’t noticed anything that makes me… well, react badly. I used to garden a lot, and I didn’t have any trouble with pollen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, alright. That’s good to know. Now, could you briefly describe your medical history, if you don't mind?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. That's… a long time ago, mostly. I had the usual childhood things, I suppose. Measles, mumps, chickenpox… but nothing serious. When I was younger, I had some trouble with my gallbladder, they took it out years ago. And… well, my husband had diabetes. I always worried I'd get it too, but I've never been diagnosed. Other than that… I can't really think of anything important.
DOCTOR: Childhood illnesses, gallbladder removal… and a family history of diabetes. Alright. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything else besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I don't believe so. Just the gallbladder. That was… a long time ago. I used to be very healthy, Doctor. Very active. But things change, don't they? I haven't been in the hospital since.
DOCTOR: They certainly do. Now, Ms. Licano, I’m going to do a quick physical examination, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a general assessment. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… please be gentle. I'm not as strong as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. Please sit back and relax. Alright, Ms. Licano. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, but everything else seems within normal limits. I noticed some slight tremors in your hands, but they don't appear to be severe.
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated blood pressure… that's not good, is it? I get so stressed sometimes. It's probably that. And the tremors… well, I've been feeling shaky, as I said. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Ms. Licano, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Elevated blood pressure can be managed with lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication. The tremors could be related to stress, anxiety, or other factors. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us check your thyroid function, blood sugar levels, and other important markers. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Blood tests… yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better, you know? I'm tired of feeling like this all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Licano. We will get to the bottom of this. The blood tests are a good starting point. We’ll also need to discuss your diet and exercise habits to rule out any deficiencies. I'll also give you a referral to a therapist, as managing stress and anxiety can be very helpful. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Therapist… hmm. I don’t know… I’ve never really talked to anyone about my feelings before. But if you think it would help… alright. Yes, I suppose I can try. But the blood tests first, please. I just want to know what’s going on inside.
DOCTOR: Of course. Blood tests first, and we can discuss the therapist referral later, if you wish. I will have the lab draw the blood samples today. The results should be available in a few days. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a plan to get you feeling better. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as possible, and try to eat a healthy diet. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, or severe dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I just hope… I hope we can figure out what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Licano. I will do my best to help you. We'll take things one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood, and she will give you instructions on how to prepare for your next appointment. Here's a copy of the lab order and a summary of today's visit. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, Ms. Licano.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
