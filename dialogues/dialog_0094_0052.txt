DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this nausea, really. Been happening most mornings now for… oh, must be a couple o’ weeks, I’d say. It’s a bit bothersome, especially considerin’… well, you know about the heart, right? I’ve been feelin’ a bit poorly with that for a while now, and this just feels… different.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see notes about your heart condition. It’s good you mention that, as it's important to consider everything together. A couple of weeks of morning nausea… that is worth looking into. Could you describe the nausea a bit more?
PATIENT: Aye, right you are. Important to get it all tied together. Hmm… describe it… well, it’s not like a sudden sickness, if that makes sense. It’s more of a… a queasy feeling, buildin’ up slowly when I wake. Doesn't always end in… well, anything, thankfully. Just feel awful and need to sit with it for a bit 'til it passes. Usually happens before I’ve even had breakfast. And it's not like food poisoning or anything, I’ve eaten perfectly normal every night.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful – a gradual onset before breakfast, not associated with anything specific in your diet… and thankfully no vomiting. It sounds unpleasant, certainly. Has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Och, aye, it is unpleasant, I can tell you. Let me think… anything else… Hmm. Well, I’ve been sleepin’ a wee bit more, maybe? Not drastically, but findin' myself needin’ a bit o’ a lie-in. And I think… aye, I have been a bit more breathless than usual, just walkin’ about the house. But I put that down to the heat, to be honest. It's been a warm summer, hasn't it?
DOCTOR: It has been a warm summer, and that certainly can contribute to breathlessness. But the increased sleep and breathlessness, along with the nausea, do warrant a closer look. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Appetite… aye, that’s a good question. I’ve been a bit off my food, maybe. Not that I’m not hungry, exactly, just… not enjoyin’ it as much, I suppose. More pickin’ than proper eatin’. And weight… well, I haven't been weighin’ myself regular, to be honest. But I reckon I might have lost a wee bit. My trousers feel a bit looser than they did a few weeks ago, if that makes sense. Not a lot, mind you, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Mr. Benic. Reduced appetite, unintentional weight loss, increased sleep, breathlessness, and the morning nausea… Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. Then we can talk about what might be going on, and if any tests are needed. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Check away. I’m not fond o’ bein’ poked and prodded, but I understand it’s gotta be done. I'll just sit here and try not to fidget. My blood pressure’s usually a bit high when I’m at the doctor’s, if that’s anythin’. Gets me nerves, I expect.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Benic. We'll take that into consideration. It's very common for blood pressure to be elevated in a clinical setting, so we'll account for that. Alright, your blood pressure is 150/90, which is a bit elevated, as you suspected. Heart sounds… I do hear a slight murmur, which we know about from previous visits, but it doesn't seem to have changed significantly. Your lungs sound clear, though your breathing is a bit shallow. Your abdomen is soft, but I note some mild tenderness in the upper quadrants. I’m also noting some slight swelling in your ankles. Now, based on what you've told me, and what I'm finding during the exam, several things could be going on. The nausea, fatigue, and loss of appetite, combined with the weight loss and swelling… it could be related to your heart condition, or it could be something else. We need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. How does that sound, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… thorough, at least. Swellin’ in the ankles, you say? I hadn't really noticed, to be honest. I usually wear thick socks. But if you're seein’ it… well, you’re the doctor. Tests… I’m not overly fond of tests, but I understand it's best to know. What kind o’ tests are we talkin’ about? Blood tests, I expect? Anything more involved? I'm a bit o' a worrier, so I like to know what I'm lettin’ myself in for.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Benic, and it’s good you’re asking questions. Yes, we’ll start with blood tests. A complete blood count to check for anemia or infection, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid test, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause similar symptoms. We’ll also check your electrolytes and your BNP level, which is a marker for heart failure. I'd also like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and heart. And finally, an EKG to check your heart rhythm. These are fairly standard tests, and they'll give us a lot of information. The blood work and EKG can be done here in the clinic today. We'll schedule the chest X-ray for tomorrow morning. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Och, that's… a lot, isn’t it? But, aye, I suppose it's manageable. All done here today and just the X-ray tomorrow… I can handle that. Will I need to fast for the blood tests? I had a wee bit o’ toast earlier, if that matters. And what about the results? How long will it be 'til we know somethin’? I’m not one for waitin’ around, if you don't mind me sayin’.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is quite a few tests, but it’s best to be thorough in this case. And yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests, so no more food or drink other than water. The toast shouldn’t be a major issue, but try to avoid anything else for now. The lab usually gets the results back within 48-72 hours. I'll have the nurse call you as soon as they are available. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss them with you in person. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant swelling – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately, or call 911. Does that sound alright, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible. No more eatin’ ‘til then, got it. And I’ll keep an eye out for those symptoms, for sure. Shortness o’ breath… that’s always the worry with the heart, isn’t it? Alright, then. Let’s get on with these tests. I’ll just… sit here and try to relax. Though relaxin’ isn’t somethin’ I’m overly good at when I’m at the doctor’s.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Benic. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’s very good, and will make sure you’re comfortable. In the meantime, are there any questions you have for me before we get started?
PATIENT: Och, aye, one thing actually. I’ve been takin’ those water pills the doctor prescribed for the swellin’, but they don't seem to be makin’ much difference. Should I be takin' more? Or are they just… not workin'? I don't like to bother you with silly questions, but…
DOCTOR: That’s not a silly question at all, Mr. Benic, and I’m glad you asked. It’s important to know if your medication is working effectively. If the water pills aren't reducing the swelling, we shouldn't simply increase the dose without understanding why. Several things could be happening. It could be a sign your heart failure is worsening, or it could be due to another issue altogether. I'll make a note to review your medication list during our follow-up appointment, and we can discuss adjusting the dosage or potentially trying a different medication. For now, please continue taking them as prescribed, and let the nurse know you haven’t seen significant improvement with the swelling. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Och, no, I think that's all for now. Just glad to have it noted. Sometimes I worry I'm not explainin’ things properly. I'm not one for medical jargon, as you might have noticed. But I appreciate you listenin’. Alright, then. Let’s get this over with. The nurse can find me, I suppose.
DOCTOR: You explain things perfectly well, Mr. Benic. And it’s my job to make sure I understand, so please don’t hesitate to ask if anything is unclear. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. Please just relax, and she'll be in shortly. I'll be right here if you need anything.
