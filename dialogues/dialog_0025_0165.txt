DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it's this fever. Keeps comin' back. It ain't nothin' major, usually, just feels kinda warm, you know? But it's been happenin' a lot lately. My wife keeps tellin' me to get it checked, so here I am. August 2nd already, time flies.
DOCTOR: Okay, a recurring fever. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started... probably around May, maybe June? It'll go away for a week or two, then pop back up. Not every week, mind you, but often enough to be a pain. It's hard to keep track, honestly. I don't write these things down.
DOCTOR: Right. And when you say "pop back up," can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Well, it ain't a high fever, doc. Never gets above 100, I don't think. Just kinda... warm. And tired. Real tired. Like I got the flu, but without the cough or the aches, mostly just… drained. Like my batteries are low. My wife makes me soup when it happens, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a low-grade fever with fatigue. No cough, no body aches… just the feeling of being drained. Have you noticed anything else that happens when this fever comes on?
PATIENT: Let me see… sometimes my appetite goes down a bit. Not completely gone, just… not as hungry. And I get a little bit of a headache, kinda dull, behind my eyes. Nothing you’d call a migraine, just… annoying. Oh, and I sweat more at night, even with the fan on. That’s about it, I think. It’s all kinda… mild, but persistent, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Mild, but persistent. And has anything changed in your life recently?
PATIENT: Not really, doc. Same routine for years. I go to work, see patients, come home, watch a little TV with my wife, go to bed. We took a trip to Puerto Rico back in April to see family, but that was nice and relaxing. Nothing stressful or anything. I haven't been sick with anything else recently, either. No colds, no flu, nothin'. Just this fever.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what do you do for work, Mr. Brege?
PATIENT: I'm a chiropractor, doc. Been adjustin' spines for over thirty years now. It's good work, keeps me movin', but it can be hard on the hands sometimes. It ain’t heavy lifting, mostly just precise movements, you know? I’m retired now, mostly. Just take a few patients a week to keep busy. It’s a good life.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin'. Never really been one for pills. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's about it. And I try to eat healthy, mostly. My wife is a good cook, makes sure of it. No allergies, either. I'm pretty straightforward, honestly. A little fever, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see if anything stands out. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your lymph nodes, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine, doc. Whatever you need to do. I ain't afraid of a little listenin' or feelin'. Just get to the bottom of this fever, that’s all I want. It's startin' to worry my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds are regular, rate is a little elevated at 88, but that could be from talking. Lungs are clear. Your lymph nodes feel normal, no swelling that I can detect. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Temperature is 99.7 Fahrenheit. Blood pressure is 130/80. Everything feels within normal limits so far. Now, I want to order some blood work just to rule out anything serious. It will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a sedimentation rate to see if there’s any inflammation. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, doc. Blood work is fine. Whatever it takes. I just want to know what's goin' on. I got patients to see tomorrow, can't be lyin' in bed with a fever. Can you send the results to my wife? She worries more than me, and she’ll remind me to follow up. Her name is Elena Brege.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve ordered the blood work. It should be ready within a few business days. And yes, I can definitely send the results to Elena. I’ll make a note of that. While we wait for the results, I want you to monitor your temperature and write down any other symptoms you experience. If the fever spikes above 101, or if you develop a cough, shortness of breath, or severe fatigue, please call the office immediately. It's unlikely, but it's best to be cautious. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible, doc. I’ll keep an eye on it and write things down. My wife will probably be keepin' track for me anyway, she’s good at that sort of thing. Listen, I got another patient waitin', if you don’t mind. I appreciate you lookin' into this, doc. Hopefully it’s nothin' serious.
