DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. Why don't you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… It’s my tummy, I think. It feels… big. And I don't want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to. It just doesn't seem… tasty. Is that what you want to know? It’s all a bit fuzzy, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a great place to start, Soila. “Big” and not feeling hungry… I understand it’s a bit fuzzy, and that’s perfectly alright. Let’s try to unpack it a little. When you say your tummy feels big, can you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… how to describe it? It’s… full, but not a good full. Like when you eat too much, but I haven’t eaten much! And… hard, maybe? Not painful, exactly, just… there. It feels different than usual. I don't know… it just feels… wrong. I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explaining things. It's been a while since I talked about my body, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining perfectly well, Soila, don’t worry at all. “Full but not a good full” and “hard” – that gives me a good starting point. And it’s alright that it’s been a while since you’ve talked about this. Has this feeling been coming on suddenly, or has it been building up gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It didn’t just pop up one day. It’s been… getting bigger, slower and slower. Maybe a month or two? It’s hard to say for sure. Time… it goes so quickly now. I used to be very good with dates, when I was a sociologist. But now… everything blends together. Did that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Soila. A month or two of gradual change… that’s helpful. And don’t worry about the dates, we’ll figure things out. Now, besides the feeling of fullness and it feeling hard, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… other changes… Let me think… Oh! I’m… tired. More tired than usual, maybe? I used to walk to the market every day, but now… it’s a long walk. And… I go to the bathroom more. But that might just be old age, you know? Everything gets a bit… leaky when you get old. Is that what you mean? Other than that… not that I can remember. My mind isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Soila. Increased tiredness and going to the bathroom more often – those are both things we should note. And it’s perfectly normal for things to change with age. Now, when you say you go to the bathroom more often, is that with urine, or with… well, with stool?
PATIENT: Oh… um… with water. With the… pee-pee. Not the other thing. No, that’s been… normal. Just the water part more often. I have to get up at night sometimes, which is new. I used to sleep all through the night. It’s… bothersome, but not terrible. I just get a little wobbly getting to the bathroom in the dark. Is that what you wanted to know? I hope I'm not confusing you.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Soila. You’re not confusing me one bit. Increased urination, especially at night… that’s definitely something we need to look into. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, other than just not feeling hungry?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That's what I said before, I think. Not tasty. Everything just… tastes like nothing. Or cardboard. Even my favorite berries… they don’t have that zing anymore. I used to love to cook, but what’s the point if nothing tastes good? My daughter, she brings me soup sometimes, but I just pick at it. It's… sad, really. Food was always such a joy. Now it’s just… fuel, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand, Soila. Loss of appetite and things not tasting as good… that can certainly take the joy out of eating. That’s important information. Now, have you had any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… weight loss. I don’t know… I haven’t weighed myself in ages. My scale broke a long time ago, and I haven’t bothered to get a new one. My clothes feel… looser, maybe? But I don’t know if that’s the weight, or just… old age shrinking me. I’m a small woman anyway. My daughter says I look… thin, but she always worries. She's a good girl. I really couldn’t say for sure. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. We’ll make a note of the potential weight loss. It’s good your daughter is observant. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… medical history. That was a long time ago. I used to be very healthy, very strong. I walked everywhere! I think… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… high blood pressure, maybe? The doctor put me on pills for it, but I stopped taking them. They made me feel funny. And… arthritis in my hands. It hurts sometimes, but not terrible. I think that’s all. My mind is… a bit foggy. I used to keep very good records, but they’re lost now. Everything is lost.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. Gallbladder removal, high blood pressure that you previously took medication for, and arthritis in your hands. That's a good start. We can try to get more detailed records if you'd like, but that's alright for now. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Not really. Just… sometimes I take a little something for my hands, when they really hurt. It’s… a cream, I think. From the drugstore. I don’t remember the name. And… sometimes a little something for sleep, but it doesn’t really help. Mostly, I just… try to get by. I don't like taking pills. They make me feel strange. My daughter brings me vitamins sometimes, but I forget to take them. I really don't take much of anything regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. A cream for your hands occasionally, and sometimes something for sleep. No regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies. Hmm… Not that I know of. I used to be stung by a bee when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I don’t really like liver, but that’s not an allergy. I haven’t had any trouble with anything lately. I’m a pretty sturdy woman, you see. Everything is… okay. I think. My mind is… slipping. I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. No known allergies. That’s good. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if any of your close family members have had any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh… family history. That's a hard one. My parents… they both lived to be very old. My mother… she had something with her heart, I think. She was very tired all the time. And my father… he had trouble with his stomach. But that was a long time ago. And… my sister… she had something with her lungs, but she lived far away, in Russia. I didn’t see her very often. I don't really know much about their illnesses. It was a long time ago. Everyone is… gone now. My mind is… fading. I hope that helps. I don't remember much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. Heart issues with your mother, stomach issues with your father, and some illness with your sister. That’s helpful to know. Finally, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. Smoking is terrible. My mother, she smoked a little when she was young, but I never liked it. It smells awful. I always liked fresh air. I used to walk everywhere, but now… not so much. I prefer to stay inside, where it’s quiet. My daughter, she tries to get me to go outside more, but… it’s just easier to stay inside. I have my books, and my memories… that’s enough for me. I never smoked. Never.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. Never smoked. That’s excellent. Alright, Soila. Thank you for answering all my questions. That gives me a good understanding of what's going on. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t mind. I trust you, Doctor. It’s just… I don’t like being poked and prodded. But if it will help, then yes. Go ahead. I'm a little wobbly, though, so be gentle. And… my skin is very thin, you see. Don’t pull too hard. I'm getting old, you know. But yes, go ahead. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I’ll be very gentle. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and let it out slowly. Your heart sounds a little bit faint, and your breathing sounds a little bit… diminished, but nothing overly concerning at this point. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back if you're comfortable. Your abdomen is… soft, but there is some mild fullness in the lower abdomen. It’s not painful when I press, but it feels a little… distended. Your blood pressure is a little bit elevated, 150/85. And your pulse is a bit slow, around 68. Alright, Soila. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, there are a few things I'd like to investigate further. Your symptoms of abdominal fullness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and increased urination, along with the mild fullness I felt during the exam, could be due to a few different things. One possibility is something relatively minor, like constipation or a change in your diet. However, it’s also important to rule out more serious conditions, such as bladder issues, and rarely, something more serious like cancer. To do that, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… tests? Well… alright. If you think it's necessary. I don't like going to the hospital, it smells awful. But if it will help me feel better, then yes. What kind of tests? Will they hurt? I’m a little scared, you see. I don't like needles. And… I don’t have much money, Doctor. Will they be expensive? Just tell me what I need to do. I trust you, but… I’m an old woman, and I get nervous easily. What kind of tests will you be doing?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Soila, and I’ll explain everything as clearly as possible. We'll start with some simple blood work to check your overall health, including your kidney function and to look for any signs of infection. We’ll also do a urine test to check for any problems with your bladder and kidneys. These tests don't require a hospital visit, we can do them right here in the clinic. As for the needle, yes, there will be a small blood draw, but it's very quick, and I'll be as gentle as possible. We can also apply a numbing cream beforehand if that would make you more comfortable. And finally, I'd like to order a simple imaging test called an abdominal ultrasound. This uses sound waves to create a picture of your abdomen and can help us see if there's anything unusual going on with your organs. This will also be done here at the clinic, and it doesn’t involve any needles or radiation. As for the cost, I know you mentioned having limited funds. We’ll do our best to work with you and see if we can find options for financial assistance or lower the cost where possible. Let’s get the tests ordered first, and then we can discuss the cost in more detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… an ultrasound? No needles? That’s good. And blood work… I suppose I can handle a little blood work. No hospital… that’s a relief. And you'll help me with the cost? That’s very kind of you, Doctor. I don’t want to be a burden. Alright. Yes. Let’s do the tests. Get it over with. The sooner we know what’s wrong, the better. But… please be gentle. And… tell me everything. I don't want any surprises. I'm a little scared, you see. But I trust you. Just… be gentle. And tell me everything.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I promise to be as gentle as possible, and I will explain everything to you every step of the way. There will be no surprises. Could you please draw Soila’s blood for the blood work and collect a urine sample?
PATIENT: Alright. I suppose I should go to the bathroom now, to get the… sample. Where is the bathroom? And… how much… sample do they need? I don’t want to have to go twice. I'm a little old, you see. And… I have a weak bladder. Please, be patient with me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. It’s just down the hall, on the left. And you only need a small sample, about a cupful should be enough. Take your time, and don’t rush. If it takes a little longer, that’s perfectly alright. I'll be right here if you need anything at all. Just let me or the assistant know. Take all the time you need. We're not in any rush.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. I hope I can do this. It's been a long day.
DOCTOR: How did it go, Soila?
PATIENT: It was… difficult. My bladder isn’t what it used to be. But I managed. It took a few tries. I hope that’s enough. And… can we get this over with soon? I'm getting tired. I just want to go home and rest. What happens next?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Soila. You did wonderfully. And yes, that’s plenty. Please send the samples to the lab. Now, we just need to wait for the lab results. It usually takes a few hours, sometimes a day or two, depending on how busy the lab is. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable while you wait?
PATIENT: Oh… a few hours? Or a few days? That sounds like a long time. I suppose… I can wait. But I don’t like being in the dark. Will you tell me everything as soon as you know? And… will it be bad news? I'm a little scared, you see. I don't want to be sick. Just… tell me everything. And… can I have a glass of water? My mouth is dry. Waiting makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. Here you are. And I promise, I will tell you everything as soon as we have the results. We'll go over them together, and I’ll explain everything in plain language. It's too early to say whether it will be good or bad news. We have to wait for the results first. But I want you to know that we’ll take things one step at a time, and we’ll figure out the best plan for you, whatever the results may be. In the meantime, is there anything at all that I can do to help you relax?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. I… I don’t know. Maybe just… to sit here quietly for a little while? My mind is… wandering. I used to be very strong, very independent. But now… I just feel old and tired. I suppose… there’s nothing else I can do but wait. But please, call me as soon as you know. I don’t like being in the dark. And… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind to me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. You just rest here as long as you need to. And I promise, we will call you as soon as we have the results. I'll also make a note to explain everything thoroughly when we talk, and we can go over any questions you may have. In the meantime, is there a family member or friend we can contact if we need to reach you?
PATIENT: Oh… my daughter. Yes, call my daughter, Irina. Her number is… Let me think… it’s… 555-123-4567. Yes, that’s it. Irina. She worries about me a lot. But she’s a good girl. She can… she can explain things better than I can. And she can… drive me to appointments. I’m not very good at driving anymore. Yes, call Irina. 555-123-4567. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I think… I’ll just sit here quietly for a little while.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I have your daughter’s number, and we’ll be sure to contact her if needed. Just rest here as long as you need to. We’ll take things one step at a time. I'll check in on you in a little while to see how you're doing.
