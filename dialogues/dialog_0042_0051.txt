DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Vodzak. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor… Vodzak, is it? Yes, lovely to meet you too. Let me see… well, my… someone told me I should find out my blood type. It’s just… things are a bit fuzzy these days, you know? I don’t rightly remember if I ever had that done. It's for… well, just general knowledge, I suppose. My daughter thought it would be a good idea. A sensible girl, that one.
DOCTOR: Yes, Vodzak is correct. And that's a very sensible idea from your daughter, Ms. Nini. Knowing your blood type is useful information to have. It’s good to be prepared. Let me just pull up your record here… Alright, I see you’ve been a patient with us for a few years. I don’t see any record of a blood type test on file. No problem at all, we can certainly get that done today. Before we proceed with the blood draw, just to be thorough, are you having any other health concerns that brought you in today, or is this solely for knowing your blood type?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, a record! That’s… reassuring. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so I wouldn’t remember if I told anyone anything before. No, no other concerns, dear. Just the blood type. I work with ropes, you see... rigging, it's called. Always have. Still do, when I can. It's a bit silly at my age, I know, but I enjoy it. But no… nothing else bothering me. Just want to know my blood type, like my daughter said. Is it a big fuss, getting blood drawn? I don’t like needles much.
DOCTOR: Rigging, that sounds… fascinating! And certainly keeps you active. It’s wonderful that you enjoy it. We certainly don’t want to discourage anything you’re passionate about. And no, getting blood drawn isn’t a big fuss at all. It's a very quick procedure. There will be a small pinch, but it’s over very quickly. We use very small needles. A phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw a small sample. Before the phlebotomist arrives, just to be completely thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear. A quick pinch is… tolerable. I’ve had worse, working with the ropes, believe me. Let me think… medications. Hmm. Well, the doctor gave me something for my arthritis a few years back, but I stopped taking it. It didn’t seem to do much, and it upset my stomach. And… sometimes I take something for my knees, a cream, when they’re really acting up. But that’s all, I think. Just the cream, when I need it. I try to avoid pills if I can. My late husband always said they were more trouble than they were worth.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no regular oral medications currently, just the arthritis cream as needed. That's good to know. And I understand your hesitation with pills – many people feel the same way. Just one more quick question before we proceed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me see. I don't think so. Not that I've ever noticed, anyway. I eat… well, I eat most things. Shellfish maybe? I haven’t had shellfish in years, so I couldn't say for certain. It’s possible I had a bit of trouble with it once, a long time ago, but it wasn’t anything serious. A little itchy throat, perhaps. Nothing to write home about. I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything, thankfully. My husband was the one with all the sensitivities. Poor man couldn't eat half the things put in front of him!
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible sensitivity to shellfish, noted. We’ll make sure to ask about that during any future medication discussions, just to be safe. Excellent. That covers the initial questions. Now, we’ll just need to draw a small amount of blood to determine your blood type. I’ll have the phlebotomist come in right away. It should only take a few minutes. Are you comfortable sitting, or would you prefer to lie down?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very thorough of you, dear. Thank you. Shellfish... it was a long time ago, so it's probably nothing. Sitting is fine. I’ve sat through worse, believe me. Ropes and heights will do things to you! I think I’m alright sitting. Just… try to be quick, if you wouldn’t mind. Needles always make me a bit… flustered.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will let the phlebotomist know you prefer a quick draw. They are very skilled and efficient. I will stay with you for a moment while they get set up, if you'd like. “Could we have a phlebotomist to room three, please?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s kind of you, Doctor. Staying with me is… reassuring, yes. I always feel better with someone nearby when it comes to… well, you know. It’s silly, I suppose, an old woman worrying about a little pinch. But thank you. It’s a comfort. I remember when my husband needed… things done. It was always easier when I was there with him. He didn’t like hospitals much, either. Always said they smelled of… worry. A strange man, he was. But a good man.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Nini. It’s perfectly natural to feel a little anxious about medical procedures. And it’s wonderful that you were there for your husband. Having a supportive presence makes all the difference. “Good morning, Ms. Nini. Dr. Vodzak, nice to meet you. I’m Maria, and I’ll be drawing your blood today. Dr. Vodzak mentioned you'd like a quick draw?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Maria. Yes, a quick draw would be… greatly appreciated. You have a kind face, dear. That helps. My arm… is that alright, just anywhere? I don’t have any… special veins or anything, I don’t think. My daughter always said I had difficult veins, but she's a bit dramatic, that one. A lovely girl, though. Very sensible. And… is it going to hurt much? Don't mind my questions, I just… well, you know.
DOCTOR: “It’s no trouble at all, Ms. Nini. Questions are always welcome. We'll find a comfortable spot on your arm. Most people don’t feel much more than a small pinch, and it’s very quick. I'll use a tourniquet to make your veins more visible, and then we’ll gently insert the needle. I have a lot of experience finding veins, even the tricky ones! Let’s take a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Experience is always a good thing. A tricky vein, you say? My daughter warned me about that. She said I was built like… well, never mind what she said. Just… be gentle, dear. And… perhaps a distraction? Do you… talk? Or sing? Not that I’m expecting a concert, of course. Just… something to take my mind off it. It’s silly, I know. An old woman and a needle. What a fuss. But… thank you. For being patient with me. It’s… kind.
DOCTOR: “Not silly at all, Ms. Nini. Many people find a little conversation helps. I'm happy to talk about anything you like! Or, if you'd prefer, I can just quietly get it done. I’m a bit of a gardener myself, so if you have any gardening tips, I’m all ears! Or we can talk about… rigging! Dr. Vodzak mentioned you enjoy that. We can definitely chat while I get things set up. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, rigging, you say? Well, that's a surprise! A gardener who knows about ropes… that’s a rare thing. Alright, let’s talk about rigging, then. It’s… well, it’s in my blood, I suppose. My grandfather was a rigger, my father, and then me. It's… a good life, if you're careful. You have to be, you know? Heights aren’t for the faint of heart. And the ropes… they have a life of their own, almost. You have to respect them. They’ll tell you when something’s wrong, if you listen. What about you, dear? How did you get into gardening? Is it a peaceful hobby? It sounds… lovely. Quiet. Something I haven't had much of lately.
DOCTOR: “It is peaceful, most of the time! I started when I was a little girl, helping my grandmother in her rose garden. There's something very satisfying about nurturing something and watching it grow. It’s a nice contrast to the hospital, actually. A lot less… stress involved. “And you're absolutely right about the ropes having a life of their own. My grandfather was a sailor, and he always said you had to treat them with respect. He taught me a few knots when I was a kid, although I'm definitely no expert! What kind of rigging do you specialize in?
PATIENT: Oh, roses! My mother loved roses. A beautiful flower, but so delicate. Too delicate for my hands, I always thought. I specialize in… well, mostly theatre rigging these days. Setting up the lights, the curtains, the scenery. It's a bit different from what my grandfather did, with the ships, but it’s still… rigging. You have to know the angles, the weight, the tension. It's a lot of responsibility, actually. One wrong knot, and… well, it’s not pretty. That’s a bit… cold. But yes, knots are everything. And knowing which ones to use. A bowline is a good all-purpose knot, but a clove hitch is… well, you have to be careful with a clove hitch. It can slip if you’re not paying attention. Do you… know your knots, dear? Just out of curiosity.
DOCTOR: “Just a little pinch, almost done… There we go. “And yes, I do know a few basic knots! My grandfather insisted. He always said a good sailor—or anyone working with ropes—should know at least a bowline, a square knot, and a clove hitch. Though, I admit, I haven't practiced them much lately. Mostly I stick to pruning and planting. It’s good to hear you’re keeping the tradition alive though. Theatre rigging sounds fascinating! It must be very satisfying to see all your work come together on stage.” “We’ll have your results back in a few days. I’ll let the lab know to send them directly to Dr. Vodzak. Just relax, and we’ll be finished in just a moment.”
PATIENT: Oh, a bowline, a square knot, a clove hitch… good to hear! The basics are important, you’re right. My grandfather always said the same thing. He was a stern man, but a good teacher. And yes, it is satisfying, seeing the lights come up, the curtains rise. It’s… magic, almost. But it’s also a lot of responsibility. You have to be sure everything’s secure. Finished soon, you say? That's… good. I always get a bit… lightheaded, with needles. But thank you, dear. You’ve been very patient. And kind. It’s… reassuring, having someone understand the ropes, so to speak.
DOCTOR: “All finished! Just hold that pressure for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. And yes, it’s perfectly normal to feel a little lightheaded. It will pass in a moment. “I’m glad I could help, Ms. Nini. And I’m very impressed with your work. Theatre rigging sounds incredibly demanding. Just take it easy for a few minutes, and if you start feeling dizzy, let me know immediately. “Dr. Vodzak will be in shortly to discuss the results when they’re available. Is there anything else I can get for you before I leave?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. That’s… good. Just holding it… alright. A bit of pressure. Yes. No, I don’t think so. No, nothing else. Just… thank you again. You’ve been very kind. And patient. It's… nice to meet someone who understands. Most people just think I’m an old woman, fussing over nothing. But the ropes… they matter. I think I'll just sit here for a bit. And… wait for the doctor. Yes. Thank you. Again. It’s… kind of you.
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Ms. Nini. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. Please don’t hesitate to let me or Dr. Vodzak know if you need anything at all. Just relax, and take it easy.
PATIENT:
