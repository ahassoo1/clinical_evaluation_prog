DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. So, you're here today... what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s this headache I’ve been havin’. Right at the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for… oh, goodness, must be a week now, maybe a little longer. Not constant, comes and goes, you know? Feels like a dull ache, nothin’ sharp or anything.
DOCTOR: A week or so, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly. Hard to say exactly, time just slips away when you get to be my age, you know? But it's definitely been hangin’ around for a while now. It don't stop me from doin' things, mind you, I still got all my clients to pamper. But it's there, a constant little nag.
DOCTOR: Clients?
PATIENT: Oh yes, Doctor. I'm a manicurist and pedicurist. Been doin’ nails for… Lord, nearly sixty years now! Started right after I came to this country. Keeps me busy, keeps me social. But all that bendin’ over… sometimes I wonder if that ain't got somethin' to do with this headache. Though I always thought I had pretty good posture for my age.
DOCTOR: Sixty years… That's a long time to be leanin' over. Alright. And aside from the headache, are you experiencing anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no dizziness. Vision's still good, thank goodness. I ain’t been feelin’ sick to my stomach or nothin’ like that. Just… tired, maybe? But I’m always a little tired, to be honest. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, my neck has been a little stiff lately. Not awful, but just… tighter than usual. Could be from the work, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Neck stiffness… Okay. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your arms or hands?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. Hands are steady as a rock, still got a good grip for polishin' and filin', thank you very much! I’d certainly notice if that were happenin', wouldn't be much good to my clients if I couldn't do my job properly. Though sometimes they do complain about a heavy hand… but that’s just because I give 'em a good scrub!
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any… changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite's always been good, Doctor! I enjoy my food, always have. My wife makes the best jerk chicken you ever did taste. As for weight… well, I’ve always been a slender fella. Not much meat on my bones, never have been. Been pretty steady that way, even with all the good food. I think it’s just my build, you know? Always been lean, even as a young man.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any medical conditions that you’re currently being treated for?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, thankfully. Never had a reaction to anything. And no, I ain't being treated for anything, not right now. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, just to keep the bones strong, but that's it. My wife always says I’m too stubborn to go to the doctor unless somethin' really bothers me. She'd be pleased to hear I finally came in. Though she probably thinks it’s just a little tension headache, tells me to take some aspirin and get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. Let’s have a quick look at your vital signs. Then I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better idea of what’s goin’ on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Vital signs and an exam… perfectly alright. Just tell me what you need me to do. I'm not afraid of a little pokin' and proddin'. Been gettin' poked and prodded by customers for sixty years, this shouldn't be too different!
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… 142 over 88. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is normal. Now, if you wouldn’t mind, just lie down on the examination table, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your reflexes and range of motion.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. No problem at all. Range of motion… haven't had much trouble with that yet, but go ahead. I'll lie as still as a statue. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. There’s some tenderness in your neck and upper back muscles. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but not significantly. Range of motion is slightly limited in your neck, with some discomfort on extension and rotation. Grip strength appears normal, no swelling or deformities. No numbness or tingling reported with light touch.
PATIENT: Hmm… diminished reflexes, you say? That don’t sound good, does it? I haven't noticed anything different with my hands, but I'm always busy workin', wouldn't necessarily feel somethin’ small. You think it could be somethin’ serious, Doctor? I’ve got clients dependin’ on me, you know. Can’t be layin’ about with a bad back or weak reflexes.
DOCTOR: It's unlikely to be anything serious, Mr. Popova. But your symptoms—the headache, neck stiffness, and diminished reflexes—could indicate some mild nerve compression. It’s probably related to your work, the repetitive movements and prolonged posture. But to rule out anything more significant, I’d like to order some blood work and a cervical spine X-ray. Just to be safe.
PATIENT: Blood work and an X-ray, eh? Alright, Doctor. If that's what you think is best, I trust your judgment. Though I ain’t a fan of all that radiation, you know. But if it'll give me peace of mind… and let me get back to pamperin’ my clients… then I suppose it’s worth it. Will it take long to get the results? And will I be able to work while I’m waitin’?
DOCTOR: The blood work should take about 48-72 hours. The X-ray results usually come back within a few days. You can continue to work, Mr. Popova, as long as you don’t experience any worsening of your symptoms—increased pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness. If anything changes, stop working and contact the office immediately. I’m also going to recommend some over-the-counter pain relievers—ibuprofen or naproxen—and some gentle stretching exercises for your neck and upper back. And try to take frequent breaks at work, and maintain good posture. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are back. We'll discuss them then.
PATIENT: Alright, ibuprofen and stretches… and be careful at work. I can manage that, Doctor. I’ve been stretchin’ since I was a young man, always gotta keep loose for the work. And I’ll be mindful of my posture. Just… how much should I worry? Is this somethin’ that could get worse, even if I take it easy? I don’t want to be a burden on my wife, you know. She’s already doin’ so much.
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, you’re 87 years old. Some aches and pains are to be expected. You've been doin’ nails for sixty years; that takes a toll on the body. I've ordered the tests to rule out anything serious, but I highly doubt there's anything to be overly concerned about. Just follow the recommendations, take it easy, and monitor your symptoms. If they worsen, then contact the office. Don’t borrow trouble. We'll address any concerns when the results are back. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that’s all. Thank you for your time. .
