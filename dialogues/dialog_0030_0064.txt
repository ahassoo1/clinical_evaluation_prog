DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? It feels… tight, like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Chest pain is certainly something we want to investigate. Could you tell me a little more about this tightness?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it doesn’t feel like a sharp pain, more like a… heavy feeling. And it usually happens when I’m walking, especially uphill. It goes away when I stop and rest a bit. Maybe five, ten minutes? It’s hard to say exactly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. That sounds like it could be related to exertion. Now, when you say “heavy feeling”, can you point to where exactly you're feeling the pain?
PATIENT: Right here, Doctor. More or less in the middle, but sometimes it feels like it spreads a little to my left side. Not my arm, just… over here. It's not a bad bad pain, like if I fell down, you know? It’s just… uncomfortable and makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand. And how long has this been happening, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started maybe a month ago? At first it was just once in a while, and I thought maybe I just pushed myself too hard at the market. But it’s been happening more often lately, maybe three or four times a week now. It worries me because my husband, Ricardo… he had some heart trouble a few years back.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s good you’re bringing this to our attention, and I understand your concern given your husband’s history. Now, besides walking, are there any other activities that seem to bring on this chest tightness?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really walking specifically, sometimes if I’m carrying a lot of groceries. Or if I get really stressed, like when I’m trying to get the bus and it's late! It feels… similar, like that squeezing feeling. But it’s worse with the walking, for sure. And it doesn't last as long with the stress. Just a quick feeling, then it goes away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so exertion and stress seem to be triggers. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this chest tightness?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes I feel a little short of breath when the pain happens. Not really bad, just like I need to take a few deeper breaths. And… oh, yes! My jaw sometimes feels a little… tight too, on the left side. It’s not all the time, just a few times when the chest is hurting. I didn't think that was connected, honestly. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re mentioning all of these details, Ms. Chelberg – they are connected. Jaw pain can sometimes accompany chest discomfort. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Well, I have Medicare, so they check me up pretty regular. The doctor told me my blood pressure is a little high, but he gave me a pill for it. I take it every day. I think it’s called… lisinopril? Something like that. And no, I don’t have diabetes, and they said my cholesterol was okay last time, but I don’t really remember the numbers. I’m not good with remembering those things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright; we have access to your records here. Lisinopril is a common medication for blood pressure, so that's good you're taking it. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… I had my gallbladder out many years ago, maybe thirty years? And I was in the hospital for a bad flu when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. No other surgeries, and I haven’t been in the hospital since the flu. And… oh! I broke my wrist a few years back when I fell, but it wasn't a serious surgery, just a cast. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Chelberg. A cast doesn't really count as a surgery. And you’ve had your gallbladder removed. Now, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, my husband Ricardo had some heart trouble. He had a… what do they call it… angina? He had to get a stent put in. And my mother, she had high blood pressure too, like me. And my father… he had a stroke when he was an older man. I think that’s about it. We don't have a lot of family history of… other things. We mostly just get old!
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart trouble and stroke. And you mentioned you take lisinopril for your blood pressure. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the lisinopril, Doctor. And sometimes I take an aspirin if I have a headache, but that’s it. No vitamins, no supplements. I try to eat healthy, you know? Lots of fruits and vegetables. Ricardo is always telling me to eat more fish!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental things?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything! Except maybe cilantro, I don’t really like the taste of that. But that’s not an allergy, just a preference. I've been pretty lucky with that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Ms. Chelberg, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if anything feels strange.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but not drastically so. Now I’ll listen to your heart. I hear a normal heart rhythm, but there’s a slight murmur. It’s not alarming, but something to note. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. And finally, I’ll check your pulse. Your pulse is normal. Everything seems stable, but the elevated blood pressure and the murmur warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A murmur? Is that… bad? I’m a little nervous now, Doctor. What does that mean? And the high blood pressure… should I be taking more of my pill? Is it not working? I don’t want to end up like Ricardo, you know? He had to have so many tests done.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Chelberg. It’s good you’re voicing your worries. A murmur isn't necessarily bad. It simply means there’s an extra sound when your heart beats, and it can have many causes, some harmless. We’ll need to do an EKG and possibly an echocardiogram to determine the cause. As for your blood pressure, it's a bit higher than we’d like, but it doesn't necessarily mean your medication isn't working. It can fluctuate with stress, diet, and activity. We can discuss adjusting your dosage, but let's get the EKG done first to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. It's important to be thorough. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… an EKG. That sounds… okay. As long as it helps us figure out what’s going on. An echocardiogram too, you said? Are those… painful? I don’t like needles very much. And will I be able to go home afterwards? I have to make dinner for Ricardo, you know. He likes my empanadas.
DOCTOR: An EKG is completely painless, Ms. Chelberg. It involves placing small, adhesive stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart’s electrical activity. No needles are involved at all. The echocardiogram is also non-invasive. It’s like an ultrasound for your heart – a technician will move a probe over your chest to create images. It can feel a little cool, but it shouldn't be painful. Yes, you will be able to go home afterwards. Both tests are relatively quick and don't require any recovery time. We can schedule them for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, let’s focus on managing your blood pressure. Try to reduce your stress levels as much as possible, and avoid salty foods. Do you think you can do that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can try. No salty foods… that’s hard, Ricardo loves his ham! But I’ll try. And I’ll try to relax more. Maybe I’ll take a nice long bath tonight. Tomorrow morning is good. What time should I come in? And should I eat anything before the tests? I always get a little shaky when I skip breakfast.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. That’s a good start. Tomorrow morning, please come in at 8:00 AM. We'll get the EKG and echocardiogram done first thing. You can have a light breakfast before the tests, Ms. Chelberg. Skipping breakfast might make you feel shaky, so something small and easy to digest would be best - like a piece of toast or some fruit. Just nothing too heavy. I’ll have the nurse schedule you and give you some written instructions before you leave today. Is there anything else I can address for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very kind and patient with all my questions. I feel a little better knowing we’re getting things checked out. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Chelberg. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. It's always best to be proactive with your health. Let's get the nurse in to give you those instructions and schedule the tests. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you tomorrow.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
