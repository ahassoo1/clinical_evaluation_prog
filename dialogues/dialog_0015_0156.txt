DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nahrwold. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Trestrail. Um… it’s my stomach, I guess. It’s been… well, it's been going on for a bit now. Like, a lot of… you know. Diarrhea. I feel like I'm always running to the bathroom. It's really annoying, honestly. I don't really remember when it started exactly, but it's been weeks, at least.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, weeks. Maybe a month? It's hard to say for sure. Things kinda… blur together, you know? It's not new, new, but it feels worse lately. Like, more frequent. I just thought it would go away on its own, but it hasn't.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say “worse lately”, can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Um… okay. Well, before it was just… a few times a day, maybe? Now it feels like after everything I eat. And it’s… looser? Sorry, that’s probably too much information. But definitely more watery than it used to be. And I've been feeling tired too, but I don't know if that's related. I just feel… drained.
DOCTOR: Drained… okay. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Um… I don't think so. I mean, I haven’t really… looked, to be honest. I know, gross question. Sorry. It’s just… not something I usually check for. Everything just… goes. I haven’t seen anything obvious, if that makes sense. But I haven’t been specifically looking either. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal, Ms. Nahrwold. It's important to know. Alright. Are you experiencing any abdominal pain with this?
PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes. Not like, really bad pain, but… cramping. Mostly in my lower stomach. It comes and goes. It's worse when I have to… go, obviously. And sometimes it's just a general ache, like something's not quite right. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, but it’s definitely uncomfortable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Can you point to where you’re feeling the cramping, roughly?
PATIENT: Um, right about here, I think. Maybe a little bit on both sides, but mostly here. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, it sort of… moves around a bit. But generally, lower part of my stomach. Like, where your belly button is, but lower down. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting accompanying this?
PATIENT: No fever, I don't think. I haven’t taken my temperature, but I haven’t felt sick. No vomiting either. Sometimes I feel a little nauseous, like, a little queasy, especially before I have to run to the bathroom. But I haven't actually thrown up. Just… uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your diet?
PATIENT: Um… normal, I guess? I try to eat healthy, but I also like… junk food sometimes. I don't have any allergies that I know of. I drink a lot of water. I don't eat a lot of dairy, I've always had a bit of trouble with it. Nothing really stands out as… causing it, I don't think. I mean, it happens no matter what I eat, really. Is that… a sign of something?
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Nahrwold, have you travelled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Oh! Um… No, not really. Not for a long time. Just around town. My husband and I went to visit his sister last month, but it was just a drive, maybe three hours away? Nothing international or anything. I haven't been out of the country in… years. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It can. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Just a multivitamin, sometimes. And ibuprofen, if I have a headache. Nothing regularly. My doctor prescribed something for… I don’t even remember what, a while ago. Something for my… stomach, I think. But I stopped taking it, it didn’t seem to help. I can’t remember the name of it. I'm really bad with remembering things. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Nahrwold, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I will need to listen to your abdomen and feel it as well. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want this to stop, honestly. It’s been going on for so long. Is it… serious? I’m a little worried. Sorry, I’m probably being silly.
DOCTOR: It's not silly to be worried. Let's get this checked out. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Okay. Alright, I'm ready. Just let me know if it's going to be cold or anything. I always get cold easily.
DOCTOR: Breathe normally, please. Alright. There's some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, as you described. No guarding or rebound tenderness at this time. Your bowel sounds are… active, though a bit… rushed. Now, I'm going to check your vital signs. Blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Just relax.
PATIENT: Okay. Is everything okay so far? You don’t have to tell me if it’s bad, but… just a little reassurance would be nice. I'm just a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 128/82, pulse is 88, respiration is 16, and temperature is 98.6. Within normal limits. However, given the prolonged nature of your symptoms—weeks, potentially a month—and the recent worsening, I'd like to order some stool samples to rule out any infection or parasites. We will also check for inflammatory markers. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Stool samples… Um… not really. Just… what does that mean exactly? Like, what are you looking for? And… will it take long to get the results? I just want to know what's going on, you know? I feel like I've been to a lot of doctors before and no one can figure it out. It's… frustrating. Sorry. I'm rambling again.
DOCTOR: It means we're trying to identify the cause of the diarrhea. It could be a bacterial infection, a parasitic infection, or an inflammatory condition. The test will analyze a small sample of your stool for these things. It will take approximately 3-5 business days to receive the results. Given your history, and to rule out anything more serious, I’d also like to schedule a colonoscopy. We need to visually inspect your colon to identify any inflammation, polyps, or other abnormalities. It's a standard procedure. Do you have any history of colon cancer or polyps in your family?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy…? Oh. Wow. That… sounds scary. No, no history of colon cancer or polyps in my family, that I know of. My family… we don't really talk about those things much. Um… is it… painful? And… what if they find something? Sorry, I'm really getting worked up now. I hate going to the doctor. It always ends up with something bad.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Nahrwold. A colonoscopy is a routine procedure and we take every measure to ensure your comfort. You will be sedated during the procedure, so you won’t feel any pain. The preparation—clearing your bowels—is the most unpleasant part. If anything is found, it doesn't necessarily mean something terrible. Polyps, for example, are often benign and can be removed during the procedure. Early detection is key. For now, let’s focus on the stool samples. I'll give you the instructions and collection kit. In the meantime, I recommend a bland diet—bananas, rice, applesauce, toast—to help settle your stomach. Also, stay well-hydrated with clear liquids. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Okay… bland diet… I can do that, I guess. No, no allergies to medications that I know of. Okay. What if the stool samples don’t find anything? Then what? Will I just… keep going to the bathroom all the time? I just want this to stop. I have a life, you know? A husband, a job… I can't keep running to the bathroom every hour. Sorry. I'm probably being dramatic again.
DOCTOR: You’re not being dramatic, Ms. Nahrwold. It’s completely understandable to be frustrated and worried. If the stool samples are negative, we'll consider other possibilities. This could include Irritable Bowel Syndrome , Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth , or microscopic colitis. We may need to refer you to a gastroenterologist for further testing, such as an endoscopy and potentially a SIBO breath test. In the meantime, let's get the stool samples ordered and see what they reveal. I'll write you a referral for the gastroenterologist, just in case. Do you have any questions about the referral process?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand about the referral. So, I just… call them and make an appointment? Um… is there anything I can do right now to make it better? Like, is there a medicine I can take? Even if it just slows it down a little? I have a really important meeting next week, and I can't… well, I can't explain this to my boss again. I already missed a day last month. Sorry, I'm just… really stressed.
DOCTOR: Given your prolonged symptoms and the negative initial findings we'll likely obtain from the stool sample, I am reluctant to prescribe anything long-term without a clearer understanding of the cause. Over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medications like loperamide can provide temporary relief, but they can mask underlying conditions and are not a sustainable solution. I can offer a short course of cholestyramine, which can sometimes help with diarrhea. However, it's important to understand that it's not a cure-all and may not be effective. We also need to rule out more serious causes. For your meeting next week, I recommend avoiding foods that trigger your symptoms, staying well-hydrated, and bringing an extra change of clothes, just in case. Is that alright?
