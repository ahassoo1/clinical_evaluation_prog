DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Vanderwiele is fine, please. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It gets bad when I try to lie flat. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked. I’d like to get this over with quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. I understand you're experiencing breathing difficulties that worsen when lying flat, and you'd like to be as efficient as possible today – we'll certainly try to be. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe what you mean by “bad”?
PATIENT: Well… it feels like… like something is pressing on my chest. Not painful, exactly, but… heavy. And I have to… really work to take a breath. It's much easier when I'm sitting up, or even standing. It started gradually, I suppose. I didn’t pay much attention at first, but it's gotten worse these past few weeks. I remember noticing it particularly after I helped my granddaughter move furniture on July 15th.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Ms. Vanderwiele. That’s very helpful. So, a sensation of heaviness in the chest, difficulty breathing when lying down, improving with sitting or standing, and onset gradually over the past few weeks, with a possible association to physical exertion on July 15th. Just to clarify, when you say "difficulty breathing", are you experiencing any wheezing, coughing, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No wheezing, no. And not much coughing either, unless it’s just a little tickle in my throat. It's mostly… just the struggle to get enough air. It's not like I can’t breathe at all, but it feels like my lungs aren’t filling up properly when I'm lying down. It's… frustrating. I always have been a very active person, you see. I don't like feeling winded so easily.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Vanderwiele. It's certainly concerning when a change impacts your ability to maintain your usual activity level. Now, let’s move on to some more general questions. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed. I wear slippers most of the time, so it's hard to say, really. My feet sometimes feel a little tired at the end of the day, but I always just put that down to being on them so much. I do a lot of walking, you know. To the library, to the store… things like that. I don’t think it’s been swelling swelling, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Vanderwiele. We'll keep that in mind. Now, have you had any chest pain at any time, even with this heaviness?
PATIENT: No, not pain. Heaviness, yes. A feeling of… pressure, maybe. But never a sharp pain, or a squeezing feeling, or anything like that. I had a friend who described angina once… that doesn’t sound like what I’m feeling. It’s just… uncomfortable. And it makes me nervous, naturally. I don't like being short of breath.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Vanderwiele. The absence of chest pain is helpful. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that you're aware of, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, my doctor… Doctor Ramirez, before he retired… he told me my blood pressure was a little high once, years ago. He put me on a small pill for it, but I didn’t take it very often. Didn’t like taking pills. It didn’t bother me much, so I just… didn’t bother with it. As for diabetes, no. Never been told I have that. And no heart problems, as far as I know. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly in a long time, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being honest, Ms. Vanderwiele. It's important to have a clear picture of your history. We may need to revisit blood pressure monitoring later. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh! I had my gallbladder removed when I was… oh, goodness, must have been forty years ago. Everything went fine, as far as I remember. And I was in the hospital when my daughter was born, naturally. But other than that… no. No other surgeries or hospital stays. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Until now, maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal forty years ago, and delivery of your daughter. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. I can eat anything, take any medicine… well, I prefer not to take medicine, but I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything. I don’t even get mosquito bites very often. My granddaughter says I have tough skin. It’s probably just luck again. I'm ready for this to be over, Doctor. Are we getting somewhere?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Vanderwiele, we are getting there. Your history is very helpful, and I appreciate your patience. Just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I told you, I don’t like taking pills. Not even vitamins. My daughter keeps trying to get me to take calcium, but I just refuse. I eat yogurt, so I figure that’s enough. I haven't taken anything regularly in years. I don't even have much call for it. I try to eat a balanced diet and stay active, and that's about it. Can we please finish now? I have a library book due tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. I understand your desire to get this resolved quickly, and I apologize for the number of questions. Now, finally, let’s talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – who has had heart problems, lung disease, or blood clots?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And she was always a bit… breathless. But she just got old, you know? She didn’t go to the doctor much either. My father… he was healthy as a horse. Never a sick day in his life. And my sister… she's still alive, but we don't talk much. I don't know anything about her health. That's about it, really. Can we be done now? I'm starting to feel anxious.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Vanderwiele, we are nearly finished. Thank you for providing that information. Alright, Ms. Vanderwiele, based on what you've told me, and considering your age and activity level, your symptoms suggest a few possibilities. It could be related to mild heart failure, a lung condition like COPD, or even something as simple as deconditioning. The fact that it's worse when lying flat is concerning and needs further investigation. I would like to listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen saturation level. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do to figure it out. I just want to get back to normal. My granddaughter is coming over tomorrow to help me with the garden, and I don’t want to be out of breath the whole time. Just… please be quick. I have that book to return.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Okay, and now I’d like to check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen saturation is a little low at 93%. That, combined with the diminished breath sounds and faint murmur, suggests we need to investigate further. I also notice a slight swelling in your ankles. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to check your heart rhythm and look for any signs of heart enlargement. I’d also like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, kidney function tests, and a BNP level, which can help rule out heart failure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds like… a lot. A lot of tests. Is it serious, Doctor? I just want to be able to breathe normally again. I don't want to have any… fancy things wrong with me. Will these tests take long? And will they hurt? I really don't like hospitals. Just tell me what I need to do, and I'll do it. I just want this over with, and I want to be able to help my granddaughter with the tomatoes. She’s counting on me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Vanderwiele. It does sound like a lot, and I apologize for that. However, these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your breathing difficulties and ensure we provide you with the appropriate care. They are relatively simple and painless. The chest X-ray is just a quick picture of your lungs, and it doesn’t involve any radiation. The EKG involves placing a few small stickers on your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity. It takes just a few minutes. The blood tests will require a small sample of blood from your arm. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. While it’s too early to say definitively, your symptoms could be related to a few different things, none of which are necessarily serious, but require attention. It could be something as simple as fluid retention or mild heart weakness. We need the test results to know for sure. The lab is just down the hall, and I’ll have a nurse draw the blood for you. The radiology department is on the second floor, and they’ll take the X-ray. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they’re available, usually within a few hours. In the meantime, I’ll write you a prescription for a mild diuretic to help reduce any fluid retention. We can adjust the dosage once we have the test results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A diuretic? Is that a water pill? My sister used to take those. I don't like the idea of taking pills, but… if it will help, I suppose. And a nurse will draw blood? Will it hurt much? I bruise easily, you know. And the X-ray… will I have to hold my breath for a long time? I just get so anxious. I really don't like being poked and prodded. Okay, okay, I'll do it. Just… tell the nurse to be gentle, please. And tell the radiology people not to take too long with the X-ray. I have that book to return, you remember? And tomatoes to help pick. Please just get me back to normal. Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Vanderwiele, I understand your anxieties, and I will make sure the nurse and radiology staff are aware of your concerns. I’ll personally write a note on your chart requesting they be as gentle as possible. The nurse is very experienced, and she will use a small needle to minimize any discomfort. And the X-ray technician will guide you through the process – you’ll only need to hold your breath for a few seconds at a time. No, there’s nothing else you need to do at this time. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to draw the blood, and she’ll direct you to the radiology department afterward. Once you’ve had the tests done, you can go about your day as usual. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and will contact you to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling in your ankles – please contact the office immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: No, I think… no. Just… please tell the nurse to be gentle. And hurry, please. I really need to get this over with. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… patience.
