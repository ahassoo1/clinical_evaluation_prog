DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t really do small talk. I just… want to get this over with. I want to have a baby, okay? And I want it to be… easy. My husband, God rest his soul, and I always planned on kids, and now… well, I’m not getting any younger. I just want to make sure everything works before I even bother trying, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Carmaleta. It’s very practical to want to ensure everything is in good working order before trying to conceive. It's a good idea to get things checked out. Let's start with a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Honestly? I don’t really remember a lot of details. It was… a long time ago. I had the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox… I broke my arm once, badly. And… there was something with my appendix when I was younger, but it was years ago. Nothing major, I don’t think. I was pretty healthy, always. My husband always said so. Does that… help? I'm not good at remembering dates and things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Carmaleta. Vague recollections are common. It’s helpful to know about those things, even without specific dates. We can try to clarify some details later if needed. So, regarding your appendix…do you recall if it was removed surgically?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You want to know about my appendix? Honestly, I think so? Yes, I think they took it out. It was a really bad pain, I remember that. I was in the hospital for a few days. It was… awful. Look, is this really necessary? I just want to know if I can have a baby, not relive my childhood medical traumas. Is there a test I can take? A blood test, or something?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. It is important to get a complete picture, and past surgeries can sometimes impact fertility. I promise we'll get to the tests soon. Knowing about the appendix helps me understand your overall health. Okay, let's move on. Have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: No. Never. That's... that's why I'm here, Doctor. We always… planned to, but things never quite worked out the timing right. And then… well, then my husband got sick. It’s just… been a long time. Honestly, it’s embarrassing even talking about it. I just want to know if there’s something wrong with me. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Carmaleta, that is absolutely not too much to ask. It's perfectly reasonable to want to know if there are any potential issues, and I understand why you’re feeling this way. It’s a very valid concern, and we will investigate it thoroughly. Let's talk about your menstrual cycles. Are they regular?
PATIENT: Ugh, regular? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t even know anymore. I mean, they used to be. Before… everything. Now they’re just… unpredictable. Sometimes they’re early, sometimes they’re late, sometimes they’re just… there. It's a mess. And honestly, with everything going on, I haven’t really been keeping track. It’s just… been difficult. Can we please just get to the tests? I feel like I’m being interrogated about my… womanly issues.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m making you feel uncomfortable, Carmaleta. I’m just trying to gather information to understand the best course of action. It's important to get a full picture. Alright, let’s move towards some testing then. We’ll start with a blood test to check your hormone levels. That will give us some initial insights. I’d also like to do a pelvic exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It allows me to assess your reproductive organs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, a pelvic exam? Really? Look, I… I suppose. But just get it over with quickly, please. And no unnecessary chatting, alright? I really don't want to lie here while someone… pokes around. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can know if this is even worth the effort. I have things to do, you know. This is taking up my whole day.
DOCTOR: I understand, Carmaleta. We’ll proceed as efficiently as possible. I will explain each step before I do it, and I’ll keep the conversation minimal unless you have specific questions. If you’ll just change into a gown, I’ll be right back to explain the procedure and get started. The nurse will show you to the examination room. Just let me know if you have any concerns at all.
PATIENT: .
