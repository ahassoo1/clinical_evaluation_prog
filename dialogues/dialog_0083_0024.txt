DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, well, it’s a bit of a strange request, actually. I need a letter confirming I’m able to fly. It’s for…travel insurance, mostly. They need it before they’ll cover my ticket.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you need a physician’s note stating you are cleared for air travel for insurance purposes. That's perfectly reasonable. To do that properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions to ensure it's safe for you to fly. First, do you have any current medical conditions that might be affected by air travel?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean…my husband passed away last year. It was…sudden. But physically, I’m healthy. I had a check-up with my primary care doctor about six months ago, and everything was fine. Just…grief, really. But that shouldn’t affect flying, should it? I haven’t been officially diagnosed with anything related to it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I am very sorry for your loss, Ms. Sayar. That must have been incredibly difficult. And you are right, grief itself isn’t a medical condition, but it can sometimes exacerbate existing conditions or, in rare cases, contribute to new ones. It’s good you’ve had a recent check-up with your primary care physician. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a little more about that check-up?
PATIENT: Sure. It was with Dr. Lee, over at St. Joseph’s. Routine stuff, mostly. Blood pressure was good, cholesterol was normal, weight was stable… she listened to my heart and lungs, did the usual reflexes, you know? She did mention my Vitamin D was a little low, so she prescribed me some supplements. Other than that, she said I was in pretty good shape for my age. She didn’t find anything that would prevent me from travelling. I can get you the details from the office if you need them.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. Knowing your Vitamin D is low is good to know. And it's reassuring to hear your primary care doctor didn't identify any issues preventing travel. To make absolutely sure, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, just to cover all bases. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like heart disease, lung problems, blood clots, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I used to be a dancer, so I always kept myself in good shape. Even now, I try to walk every day. I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week. I’ve never had any major surgeries or been hospitalized for anything serious. Honestly, I feel like I'm bothering you with all this… it's just a letter, right?
DOCTOR: You are not bothering me at all, Ms. Sayar. It’s my job to gather all the necessary information to ensure your safety, even for something seemingly simple like a letter. It’s good to hear about your active lifestyle and healthy habits. Let’s talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements, other than the Vitamin D?
PATIENT: Just the Vitamin D supplements, like I said. Dr. Lee recommended I take 2000 IU daily. That’s it. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it, so I try to stay healthy naturally. I do use a prescription eye cream, but that's topical… I don’t think that counts, does it? I just… I want to get this letter and go. I have a trip planned, and I'm worried about losing my deposit if I can't get this sorted out quickly. It’s a long story, but it's important to me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the trip and the deposit, Ms. Sayar. We’ll do our best to get this letter for you as quickly as possible. And no, the eye cream doesn’t count. Just a few more questions to cover all bases. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I know of, anyway. I've eaten pretty much everything, and I've never had a reaction. My husband was the one with allergies, pollen mostly. I've always been lucky that way, I guess. Is this almost done? I really appreciate you taking the time to help me. It’s just… everything feels so complicated these days.
DOCTOR: Almost done, Ms. Sayar. Just a few questions about your family history, and then we can move on to a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. Has anyone in your immediate family – parents, siblings, or children – had any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, lung problems, blood clots, or a history of stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure when she was older, but she managed it with medication. My father was healthy as a horse, really. Never sick a day in his life. And I don’t have any siblings or children. So… just my mother's high blood pressure, I suppose. Nothing too serious, really. Can we… do the exam now? I'm starting to feel a little anxious, just thinking about flying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Sayar. We can certainly proceed with the physical exam. It will be quick and simple – just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and a quick look in your ears and throat. Would you mind if I had you sit up on the examination table?
PATIENT: No, not at all. That sounds fine. Go ahead. The sooner this is done, the better. I'm just hoping everything checks out. I really don't want to cancel this trip. It means a lot to me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sayar. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Try to breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Ears are clear bilaterally. Everything sounds good so far. Everything checks out, Ms. Sayar. Your heart and lungs sound healthy, blood pressure is within normal range, and your throat and ears are clear. Based on what you’ve told me and the findings of this brief examination, I don't see any medical reason why you shouldn’t be able to fly.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful! That’s such a relief. Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you. So… you’ll write the letter? Is there anything else I need to do? I'm happy to fill out any forms or sign anything you need. I just want to make sure I get this sorted out before my travel date. It's on August 15th, by the way, if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I’m glad I could reassure you. Yes, I’ll certainly write the letter. It will state that you are medically cleared for air travel. I’ll also include the date of this examination and a statement about your healthy heart and lung sounds and normal blood pressure. I’ll have my assistant print it out for you now. It should only take a few minutes. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You've really put my mind at ease. I appreciate your time and your thoroughness. I'm looking forward to my trip now. It's… it’s to visit my daughter. She moved to Australia last year, and I haven’t seen her since. It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Sayar. It's lovely that you're going to visit your daughter. Family is very important. My assistant will bring the letter to you shortly. In the meantime, do you have any questions about potential risks associated with long-haul flights, such as deep vein thrombosis?
PATIENT: Oh, um… no, not really. I haven't thought about that. I mean, I've flown a few times before, but it was always short flights. Is it something I should be worried about? I don’t want to add another layer of stress to this trip. Honestly, I just want to get there and see my daughter. I’m not really good with medical details, if you don’t mind. I tend to just trust the doctors to take care of things.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Sayar. It’s perfectly fine to trust your healthcare providers. For long-haul flights, the main concern is indeed deep vein thrombosis, or DVT – blood clots in the legs. However, the risk is generally low, especially if you’re healthy and mobile. To minimize the risk, I recommend staying hydrated during the flight, avoiding prolonged periods of sitting without moving, and doing some simple leg exercises while you're seated. My assistant will also include a brief handout with some general travel tips when she brings you the letter. But don't worry too much about it. Just enjoy your trip and spend quality time with your daughter. Do you have any other questions for me before I let you get ready to leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your patience and for explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. I'm looking forward to seeing my daughter, and I'm so glad this is finally sorted out. I’m ready to go whenever you are.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I’m glad I could help. My assistant will be right with you to provide the letter and the travel tips handout. Have a safe and wonderful trip, and please give your daughter my best. And if you experience any concerning symptoms during or after your flight – such as pain or swelling in your legs, or shortness of breath – please don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. Now, let me have my assistant bring you the letter and you'll be all set. Have a wonderful day.
