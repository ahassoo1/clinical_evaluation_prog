DOCTOR: “Bula vinaka, Teah. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor! It's nice to meet you too. Just in for my shots, I think. Routine stuff, you know? Gotta keep up with all that, even though I always forget which ones I've had!
DOCTOR: “Bula! It’s good to meet you as well, Teah. That’s very sensible of you to stay on top of things, even with a bit of forgetting – it happens to the best of us! Let’s take a quick look at your chart to see what’s due, and then we can get you all caught up. Do you happen to know when you last had a tetanus shot, or a flu shot?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Honestly, I really don't remember. It's been a couple of years, I think? Maybe last fall for the flu shot... but the tetanus one... I'm drawing a blank. I usually just let whoever's giving the shot decide what I need! Is that bad?
DOCTOR: “No, not at all bad, Teah! A lot of people prefer to leave it to the professionals. It's just helpful for me to have a little history if possible. Okay, well, let’s take a look at your record here… Ah, okay. It looks like you did get a flu shot last fall, which is great. Your last tetanus booster was… seven years ago. That means you're due for one today. And, given your age, it's also a good time to check if you’ve had your pneumococcal vaccines. Have you ever received those before?
PATIENT: Pneumo... what now? No, I don't think so. That doesn't ring a bell at all. Honestly, Doctor, all these names just go right over my head! What is a pneumococcal vaccine even for? Is it something bad I need to be protected from? I live out in the country, mostly, so I don't get around a lot of people.
DOCTOR: “That's perfectly alright, Teah. Medical terms can be… a bit much! Pneumococcal vaccines protect against pneumococcal disease, which can cause things like pneumonia, ear infections, and meningitis. It’s spread through respiratory droplets – coughing, sneezing, things like that. Even though you don’t get around a lot of people, it’s still good to be protected, as you can encounter it even with less frequent contact. It’s especially important as we get older, because our immune systems can become a little less strong. There are two main types, and we’ll want to discuss which one is best for you. Do you have any underlying health conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Oh, that makes sense. I hadn't thought about just coughing, even if it's just me! No, not really. I'm pretty healthy, all things considered. A little arthritis in my hands, but that's about it. My husband, bless his heart, has a bit of high blood pressure, but I don't have any of that. I work construction, so I'm pretty active, you know? Lots of lifting and moving around. I thought that would keep me healthy!
DOCTOR: “That's wonderful to hear, Teah! Staying active like that is fantastic for your health. Arthritis doesn't necessarily change the vaccine recommendations, so that's good. Okay, given your age and health status, I recommend we get you vaccinated with the pneumococcal 20-valent conjugate vaccine, PCV20. It gives broader protection than the other option and only requires one dose. How does that sound to you?
PATIENT: PCV20… okay. One dose sounds good! Less poking around is always better, right? If you think that’s the best thing for me, then go for it, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just tell me what to expect, and I'm game. Is it gonna hurt a lot? I'm not afraid of needles, but I don’t particularly like them either!
DOCTOR: “That's a great attitude, Teah! And you are absolutely right, one dose is always preferable! As for the poke… it’s not entirely painless, but it’s usually pretty quick. You might feel a little pinch, and there could be some soreness at the injection site for a day or two. It’s very common, and a cool compress can help with that. We’ll start with the tetanus booster, and then the PCV20. Would you like to roll up your sleeve now, or would you prefer I give you a moment?
PATIENT: Let's just get it over with, Doctor. The sooner it’s done, the sooner I can forget about it! Go ahead, I’m ready. Just… be quick, okay? No need to rush, but… you know. Needles.
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, Teah. I completely understand. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. This might sting for a moment… There we go, that’s the first one done. Now, onto the PCV20… This one might feel a little bit more substantial, just because it's a slightly larger volume. Ready?
PATIENT: Okay, here we go. Just do it, Doctor. Rip the band-aid off, so to speak. I can handle a little sting. Don’t worry about me! I've built houses, after all. A little needle isn’t gonna scare me.
DOCTOR: “There we go. All done.” “How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Okay, well... that wasn’t too bad, honestly. A little sore, but nothing I can’t handle. Feels about like getting a shot when I was a kid. Thank you, Doctor. I’m glad that’s over with. Is there anything else I need to do, or just keep an eye on the spots for redness or swelling?
DOCTOR: “You're very welcome, Teah! And I'm glad it wasn't too unpleasant. Yes, that’s right. Just keep an eye on both spots for any excessive redness, swelling, or warmth. You might have some mild soreness or tenderness for a day or two, but that should resolve on its own. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with that if needed. Also, if you develop a fever or any other concerning symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You explained everything really well. Thank you for being so patient with my… forgetfulness and general lack of medical knowledge! I appreciate you taking the time to get me all caught up. I'll be sure to keep an eye on the spots, and I'll call if anything seems off. Is there a co-pay or anything I need to take care of now? I don't have insurance, so I'm always a little worried about that.
DOCTOR: “You are very welcome, Teah! It’s my pleasure. And don’t worry about the questions – it’s always better to ask! Given your lack of insurance, the cost for the tetanus and pneumococcal vaccines today is $130. We do have a payment plan available if that’s easier for you. Would you like me to get you set up with that, or would you prefer to pay today?
PATIENT: $130… okay, that’s not terrible. Let’s just go ahead and pay it today, if that’s alright. I’d rather just get it over with, you know? No need to worry about a payment plan or anything. Just let me know how you want me to pay.
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, Teah. That's perfectly fine. We accept cash, credit, and debit cards. “Here’s your receipt. Thank you for coming in today. It was lovely meeting you, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Stay healthy!” "Vinaka vaka vakalevu!"
PATIENT: Vinaka vakalevu to you too, Doctor! You’ve been wonderful. I appreciate everything. Have a good day!
