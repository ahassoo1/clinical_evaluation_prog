DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, well, it's this... puffiness, I guess you'd call it. Face and legs, mostly. It's been… a while now, I reckon. Don't rightly remember when it started, to be honest. Old age, probably. It's not like it's hurting or anything. Just… looks funny.
DOCTOR: “Old age” is a rather vague diagnosis, Mr. Miner. While I appreciate your…self-assessment, we need to be a bit more specific. You say it’s been a “while.” Can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate? Hmm… ...I suppose… since the winter. Yeah, definitely since the winter. That was a cold one, that was. Makes your joints ache, you know. And then… well, then it just sort of… stayed. Not getting worse, not getting better, just… there. Doesn't bother me much, really.
DOCTOR: “Since the winter.” Right. And you've noticed this puffiness primarily in your face and legs?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. My ankles feel a bit thick sometimes, and… well, look at my face! It's like a balloon. Not as bad as it used to be, mind you. Used to be I couldn't even see my eyes. But still. It’s… noticeable. And it’s just there, like I said. Don't rightly know what to do about it.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Urine? What do you mean, changes? It looks… yellow, I guess. Like it always does. I don’t… pay much attention to it, to be honest. Why would I? It’s just… pee. Is something wrong with my pee?
DOCTOR: Mr. Miner, I am attempting to gather information to determine the cause of your edema. Changes in urine output or appearance can be indicative of various underlying conditions. Have you been urinating more or less frequently than usual?
PATIENT: Edema? Is that what you call it? Fancy words. Look, I go when I gotta go. Sometimes more, sometimes less. It depends, you know? What I drink, what I eat… if it's hot out. Can't rightly say I've noticed a change, change. It's just… normal for me, whatever it is. I'm a simple man, Doctor. Don't go lookin' for trouble where there ain't any.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any shortness of breath, or noticed any fatigue?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. I get a little winded climbin' stairs, but that's just… being out of shape, I reckon. I haven't been doin' much lately. And fatigue… well, I'm an old man, Doctor. I get tired. What kind of question is that? It's normal! I’m not exactly runnin’ marathons here.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any weight gain recently?
PATIENT: Weight gain? Well, I wouldn't say gain, exactly. Maybe… a little softer around the middle. But that's been happenin' for years! It's just… getting older, Doctor. Things shift. I haven't been weighin' myself or anything. I'm not one for all that fuss. Don’t see what that has to do with my puffy face, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner. I’m going to need to conduct a physical exam. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your legs and ankles. Then, I'll need to order some blood work and a urine analysis. If you'll just step over here…
PATIENT: Blood work? Urine analysis? Now hold on a minute, Doctor. That sounds… complicated. And expensive. I don't have insurance, you know. Is it really necessary? I just have a little puffiness. Can't you just… give me something for it? A pill or something? I don't like needles, and I certainly don't like havin' folks pokein' around in my… you know. Can't we just skip all that fuss? It's probably just old age, like I said.
DOCTOR: Mr. Miner, I understand your concerns, however, dismissing your symptoms as “old age” without proper investigation is irresponsible. The blood work and urine analysis are necessary to rule out serious underlying conditions, such as kidney disease, heart failure, or liver problems. I cannot prescribe medication without knowing the cause of your edema. We can discuss payment options with the clinic administrator, but I am not willing to simply offer a “pill” without a diagnosis. Now, if you’ll allow me to conduct the exam…
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fine. But I don't like it. Not one bit. And if it's somethin' serious, I'm holdin' you responsible. Get it over with, then. But be gentle, alright? My bones ain't what they used to be. This is a waste of time, I tell ya. A complete waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner. Deep breaths, please. Sounds are somewhat diminished bilaterally, but no obvious wheezes or crackles. Now, let’s take a look at your legs and ankles. Please point your toes. Significant 2+ pitting edema bilaterally in the lower legs and ankles. Dorsalis pedis pulses are present, but somewhat weak. Skin is intact, no obvious signs of cellulitis or ulceration. Alright, that will be all for the physical exam. Now, we need to obtain a urine sample and draw some blood.
PATIENT: Pitting edema…bilaterally… I don't even know what that means. Sounds awful. Fine, fine. Let's get this over with. A urine sample, you say? Where am I supposed to… do that? Is there a bathroom around here? And blood? How much blood are you gonna take? I get faint easily, you know. This is all very… upsetting. Just… try to be quick about it, alright? And be gentle. Please.
DOCTOR: There is a restroom just down the hall. I will provide you with a collection cup. Once you have obtained a sample, please bring it back to me. As for the blood work, we will only need a standard vial. The phlebotomist will be as quick and gentle as possible. I will be with you throughout the process. I understand your anxiety, Mr. Miner, but these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. The sooner we have the results, the sooner we can develop a treatment plan. Here you go. Please let me know when you are finished.
