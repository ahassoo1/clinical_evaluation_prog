DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Alcorta is fine, please. It’s… well, it’s my sight. It’s been going. Not suddenly, you understand, but… diminishing. It’s rather inconvenient, to be frank. I work with paperwork, you see. Requires a certain… acuity.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I understand. Diminishing vision can be very concerning, especially with your profession. “Diminishing” is a good way to describe it – it’s helpful to know it hasn’t been a sudden change. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this change?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it's difficult to pinpoint precisely. Things just… aren’t as sharp as they once were. Perhaps six months ago? Though I suspect it began before that, gradually. I didn't notice notice, if you understand. I simply adjusted. One does, you know. I’m not one for fuss. It's only become truly bothersome recently, when I’ve had to… well, ask colleagues to verify figures. A rather humiliating experience, actually.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Alcorta. It's very common to not realize a gradual change until it starts impacting your daily life. And there's absolutely no shame in asking for help – it’s responsible to acknowledge when you need it. So, it's been approximately six months, and it’s become bothersome enough to affect your work in the last few weeks. Is it affecting anything else besides reviewing paperwork?
PATIENT: Well, driving at night has become… less appealing. Not unsafe, precisely, but requires significantly more concentration. And reading the smaller print on… well, anything, really. Menus, labels, the newspaper. Though I suppose I haven’t been terribly diligent with the newspaper lately. It’s mostly… disheartening, Doctor. One expects certain things to remain constant, you know? A certain level of clarity.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Changes like that can be unsettling. The difficulty with night driving and small print are both helpful details. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you describe how your vision is changing?
PATIENT: It's not… blurred, exactly. More… faded. Like looking through a slightly dirty window, perhaps. Everything seems… less defined. And colours aren’t as vibrant. I don’t know if that makes any sense. It’s as if the… the edges of things aren’t as crisp. And sometimes, a sort of… greyish haze, particularly in my peripheral vision. Not constant, you understand. But… present. It's subtle, Doctor. Terribly subtle.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good description, Mr. Alcorta. “Faded” and “less defined” are helpful. The greyish haze in your peripheral vision is also important to note. It sounds like there could be several possibilities, and it’s good we’re trying to pinpoint exactly what’s happening. Now, do you wear glasses or contacts currently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Reading glasses, primarily. Bifocals, actually. I’ve had them for… oh, fifteen years, perhaps? Though I only use them for close work. Distance vision has always been… adequate. I resisted getting them for quite some time, you know. A certain… vanity, I suppose. But they’ve become… necessary. Though they don’t seem to be assisting with this new… predicament.
DOCTOR: I understand. Fifteen years is a good length of time. It’s not uncommon for vision to change even with glasses, and it sounds like your current prescription may not be addressing this new issue. And have you had any other eye problems in the past – any injuries, surgeries, or conditions like glaucoma or macular degeneration?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing of the sort. I've always considered myself to have… remarkably good eyes. A small scratch, perhaps, as a child, but nothing requiring medical attention. My mother had cataracts, eventually, but that was… well, much later in life. I’ve never had any particular issues. It’s quite perplexing, frankly. To have this… deterioration, without any prior incident. It doesn’t fit, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Alcorta. It is perplexing when something changes without a clear explanation. The fact that you haven’t had any prior eye problems or family history of similar issues is good to know. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I've always been… rather particular about my diet. Lean meats, plenty of vegetables. And I walk, regularly. Not a strenuous exercise, you understand, but… sufficient. Blood pressure is… acceptable, as far as I recall. The doctor always commented on my… robust constitution. I haven’t required… significant medical intervention, if you understand. A cold now and then, but nothing debilitating. I consider myself to be in… reasonable health.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Mr. Alcorta. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is very important. It’s good to know you don’t have any chronic conditions like diabetes or hypertension. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I eschew medications whenever possible. A slight discomfort, perhaps, now and then, but I prefer to… endure. I find many of them… unnecessary. And potentially harmful. I’ve always been… cautious, you see. As for supplements… a multivitamin, occasionally. Though I haven’t been diligent about it lately. A small one, for general well-being. That is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No regular medications or significant supplement use. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, could you tell me about any allergies you may have?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None. I’ve always been… fortunate in that regard. Pollen bothers me, perhaps, during the spring, but a simple tissue suffices. No severe reactions. No anaphylaxis. A simple sniffle, occasionally. Nothing requiring medical attention. I consider it… a blessing, frankly. A rather uncommon one, these days.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Alcorta. No known allergies are good to know. Alright, Mr. Alcorta, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you're experiencing a gradual decline in your vision, characterized by faded colors, less defined edges, and a greyish haze in your peripheral vision, impacting your ability to read and drive at night. You have no prior eye problems, no significant medical history, and no allergies. I would like to perform a basic eye exam now to assess your vision more thoroughly. This will include checking your visual acuity, peripheral vision, and examining the back of your eye with an ophthalmoscope. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds perfectly reasonable. I suppose a thorough examination is… necessary. Though I trust your judgement, naturally. I’ve always been… methodical in my approach to these things. If it must be done, it should be done… properly. Proceed, Doctor. I shall endeavour to remain… still.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Alcorta. Thank you. I appreciate your cooperation. If at any point you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately. First, let's test your visual acuity. Could you please look straight ahead at the eye chart and read me the smallest line you can clearly see?
PATIENT: Very well. Let me see… E… H… P… V… N… K… It's… rather blurry, Doctor. I can discern the larger letters, naturally. But the smaller ones… are indistinct. I believe that is as far as I can manage. Rather disappointing, frankly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Alcorta. That's helpful to know. Your visual acuity is 20/30 in your right eye and 20/35 in your left eye. That indicates some vision loss, which correlates with your reported difficulty with reading and driving. Now, let's check your peripheral vision. I'm going to ask you to focus on this point straight ahead, and I’ll present some lights in your peripheral vision. Please let me know when you see a light, and point in the direction you see it. We’ll test both eyes. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Proceed. I shall endeavour to remain… focused. Though I confess, I’ve always had… trouble with peripheral vision. A slight… distraction, perhaps. But I shall do my best. Begin, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Alcorta. Your peripheral vision is slightly constricted in both eyes, particularly in the lower quadrants. This correlates with your description of the greyish haze. Now, I'm going to use an ophthalmoscope to examine the back of your eyes. This will allow me to assess your optic nerve, retina, and blood vessels. It doesn’t involve any direct contact with your eyes, but I’ll need you to look straight ahead and remain still. There will be a bright light, so it may be a little uncomfortable. Are you ready?
PATIENT: A bright light, you say? Very well, Doctor. Though I confess, I’ve always been… sensitive to such things. Proceed with… caution. I shall endeavour to remain… stoic. Begin, Doctor. But do be… gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Alcorta. All done. You did very well, thank you for your cooperation. Based on the examination, I’ve observed some mild optic disc pallor in both eyes, which can indicate some reduced blood flow to the optic nerve. I also noted some subtle drusen deposits in the macula of both eyes, which are small yellow deposits that can occur with aging, but can also be associated with early signs of macular degeneration. The retinas otherwise appear intact. Based on all of the findings – the decreased visual acuity, constricted peripheral vision, optic disc pallor, and drusen deposits – my initial concern is for early signs of optic neuropathy, potentially secondary to macular degeneration. However, further investigations are necessary to confirm this diagnosis and determine the underlying cause. This could include an optical coherence tomography scan to get a more detailed image of the retina, and possibly a visual field test to assess the extent of peripheral vision loss. I would also recommend a blood workup to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to optic nerve dysfunction. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Optic… neuropathy? Macular… degeneration? Doctor, with all due respect, you're speaking a language I… simply do not comprehend. Drusen deposits? Optical… what-was-it? It sounds… rather ominous. And blood work? I assure you, my constitution is… robust. I rarely require such… intrusions. Are you suggesting I am… failing, Doctor? Is this… irreversible? And what does this mean for my… profession? I require clarity, Doctor. Not… medical jargon. Explain, in… layman's terms, if you please. And tell me, frankly, is this… serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your concern, and I apologize if I used too much medical jargon. Let me explain this in simpler terms. Think of your eyes like a camera. The retina is the film at the back of the camera, and the optic nerve is the cable that sends the pictures to your brain. What I’m seeing is some slight changes in both the “film” and the “cable.” The drusen deposits are small spots that develop on the retina with age, but can sometimes indicate early signs of macular degeneration. This affects central vision – the ability to see things clearly straight ahead, which is important for reading and detailed work. The optic disc pallor suggests there might be some reduced blood flow to the optic nerve, which could be affecting its function. This can lead to some vision loss, particularly in peripheral vision and can impact your overall sharpness of sight. "Optic neuropathy" simply means a problem with the optic nerve. Now, is this serious?
PATIENT: So… it is serious. I suspected as much. And what causes this… “problem with the optic nerve?” Is it… hereditary? Is it something I’ve… done? I assure you, Doctor, I’ve lived a… rather disciplined life. And the… "testing?" This “optical coherence what-was-it?” and the blood work? Will it… incapacitate me? I have… responsibilities, Doctor. A reputation to uphold. Explain to me, frankly, what these procedures entail, and what the… prognosis is. I require… a realistic assessment, if you please. No… sugarcoating. And tell me, honestly, is there a… cure? Or am I… doomed to… darkness?
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, it’s understandable that you're feeling anxious. I want to be honest with you, and the situation requires further investigation to determine the exact cause and severity. The cause of optic neuropathy can be complex. It can be related to aging, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, certain medications, or, less commonly, genetic factors. In many cases, the exact cause remains unknown. It’s not necessarily something you’ve “done,” but identifying any underlying risk factors is important. Now, about the testing. The Optical Coherence Tomography scan is a non-invasive imaging test that takes a detailed cross-sectional image of your retina. It’s completely painless and takes about 10-15 minutes. It uses light waves, similar to an ultrasound, to create the image. It won't affect your vision or your ability to work. The blood work will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to optic nerve dysfunction. It’s a standard procedure, and while there is a small amount of discomfort involved with the needle prick, it’s generally well-tolerated. As for a cure… unfortunately, there is no cure for optic neuropathy or macular degeneration. However, treatment options are available to slow down the progression of the disease and manage the symptoms. These may include lifestyle modifications, medications, or, in some cases, injections or laser therapy. Right now, it’s too early to say what the prognosis will be. The results of the testing will help us determine the best course of action. We can discuss all of the options in detail once we have more information. Would you like me to schedule those tests for you?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Schedule the… tests. Though I confess, I approach this with… considerable trepidation. But I suppose… inaction is not an option. And what… lifestyle modifications are you referring to? Abstinence from… enjoyable activities? A monastic existence? Explain, Doctor. I require… specifics. And will these… interventions interfere with my… professional commitments? I have… deadlines to meet, you understand. And one final question, Doctor. Frankly. Is there a… risk of… complete blindness? I require… an honest assessment. No… euphemisms.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your anxiety and will be as honest and specific as possible. Regarding lifestyle modifications, it doesn’t involve a monastic existence. The main recommendations would be to focus on managing any underlying health conditions like high blood pressure or high cholesterol. This would involve a healthy diet low in saturated fats and sodium, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight. Quitting smoking, if applicable, is also essential. These modifications are unlikely to significantly interfere with your professional commitments. They are about making gradual changes to improve your overall health and slow down the progression of the disease. Now, about the risk of complete blindness… it’s important to be realistic, but also not to panic. The risk of complete blindness is relatively low, especially with early detection and treatment. However, if left untreated, the condition can worsen and lead to significant vision loss. The OCT scan and blood work will help us determine the severity of your condition and guide our treatment plan. We will monitor your vision closely and adjust the treatment as needed. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to preserve your vision and maintain your quality of life. Would you like me to schedule the OCT scan and blood work now?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Schedule the… tests. Though I confess, I approach this with… considerable trepidation. But I suppose… inaction is not an option. And when can I expect these… results? And will you… explain them to me in… layman’s terms? I require… clarity, Doctor. Not… medical jargon. And one final question, Doctor. Frankly. Is there any… support available? For… individuals facing such… a predicament? A support group, perhaps? I… confess, I am not accustomed to… such vulnerability.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your concerns. I've scheduled you for an OCT scan tomorrow at 10:00 AM here at the clinic, and the blood work can be done anytime this afternoon. The lab technician will be happy to assist you. The results of the OCT scan should be available within 24-48 hours, and the blood work results typically take 3-5 business days. I will personally review the results with you in detail, explaining them in plain language, and we can discuss the best course of action at that time. Regarding support, yes, there are resources available. I can provide you with information about several local support groups for individuals with vision loss. The Foundation Fighting Blindness also has a wealth of information and support services available online and through their helpline. I can also refer you to a low-vision specialist who can provide you with assistive devices and strategies to help you maintain your independence. Here are some pamphlets with information about the FFB and local support groups. Please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any further questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall… peruse these materials. No, Doctor. I believe that is all for today. Though I confess, I approach this… predicament with… considerable trepidation. Thank you for your… assistance, Doctor. Though I remain… unconvinced. Good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Alcorta. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Have a good day, and take care.
