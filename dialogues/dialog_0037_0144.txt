DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Octavis, was it? Well, honestly, I don’t quite remember why I scheduled this appointment. My daughter, bless her heart, she made it for me. Something about…checking things? I’ve been feeling alright, I suppose. Just old, you know? Sixty-four years will do that to a person. Is this where I sit?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right, Dr. Octavis AX. And yes, please, have a seat. It’s perfectly alright that you’re not sure why the appointment was scheduled – that happens quite often! Your daughter probably had a good reason. Let’s see… just to be thorough, and since you mentioned feeling “old,” could you tell me a little bit more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, “thorough,” are we? Well, what does she want me to say about feeling old? My knees ache when it rains, and getting up from the floor is… a project. I used to be so nimble. Worked in the OR for years, you know. Surgical Tech. Had to be quick. Now? Not so much. Everything just takes longer. And I forget things. Little things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, what I had for breakfast… That sort of thing. Is that what she meant? Because honestly, at my age, what doesn't ache or get forgotten?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mrs. Calvery. It sounds like you're experiencing some typical age-related changes, but it's good we’re talking about it. The knee pain and difficulty getting up are important to note, and memory concerns are something we should explore a little further, just to be safe. Let's start with the knee pain. Is it in both knees, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s both, dear. Though the left one is…worse. It really bothers me when the weather changes. My daughter says it’s the humidity. She reads all sorts of things on the internet. I don’t know about all that. It’s just… achy. A dull, throbbing ache. Doesn't really stop me from doing things, but it’s there. And it makes a popping sound sometimes. Quite unsettling, really. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, both knees, worse on the left, achy and throbbing, worse with weather changes, and popping sounds. The popping sounds are not necessarily dangerous, but we should investigate further. Now, you mentioned difficulty getting up from the floor. Can you tell me how you usually do it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…undignified, really. I have to sort of…roll onto my side, then push myself up with my arms. It takes quite a bit of effort, and I usually have to brace myself against something – the sofa, the kitchen counter, my daughter if she’s around. It used to be so easy! Just…pop right up. Now it’s a whole production. And I worry about falling, you know? That’s the worst part.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about falling, Mrs. Calvery. That's very valid. It sounds like you're describing some weakness and difficulty with balance, which we'll want to assess. Let’s move on to the memory concerns you mentioned. You said you forget little things—where you put your glasses, what you had for breakfast. Has it been getting worse recently?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, really. Some days are better than others. But yes, I suppose it’s been…more frequent lately. It’s not like I can’t remember anything, but it’s… frustrating. I’ll start a sentence and completely lose my train of thought. Or I'll go into a room and forget why I went in there in the first place. My daughter keeps saying I should write things down, but honestly, then I forget where I wrote them down! It’s a vicious cycle. And sometimes… sometimes I have trouble remembering the names of people I’ve known for years. It’s embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and it’s perfectly normal to feel embarrassed. It’s good that you’re aware of these changes. It's helpful to know that it's intermittent and that you're noticing the difficulty with names, as well. Just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your mood or personality lately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a silly question, isn't it? How would I know if my personality has changed? I suppose I’ve always been a bit…particular. Judgemental, my daughter would say. But no, I haven't been feeling particularly sad or angry, if that’s what you mean. Just…tired. And a little bit overwhelmed, to be honest. Everything feels…complicated these days. And people just don’t have patience anymore! Now, is this going to involve poking and prodding? Because I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: No, that's a perfectly valid question, and you’re right, it can be hard to notice changes in yourself. And you are right, I will need to do a brief physical exam, which will include checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and examining your joints. It will also involve a simple neurological exam to assess your balance and reflexes. We’ll save the poking and prodding for last, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. I promise. Before we do that, can you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now that’s a question. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, sometime in the nineties, I think. And I broke my wrist once, falling on the ice. Apart from that, nothing much. I’ve always been a fairly healthy person, really. A bit overweight, my doctor used to say, but I’ve always had a good appetite. My husband, bless his soul, he had high blood pressure. And…and my daughter tells me I had pneumonia once, but I don’t really remember. Honestly, I’ve been to so many doctors over the years, I can barely keep track. I’m on Medicare, if that matters. And I take a little pill for my water retention. Something my daughter picked up for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal in the nineties, broken wrist, a history of pneumonia, and you’re currently on Medicare and a medication for water retention. Do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, I wouldn’t know the name of it if it bit me. My daughter handles all that. She keeps a list, I think. She’s very organized, bless her heart. All I know is it’s a little white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. Now, do you know what Medicare covers? Because honestly, it’s all so confusing. And my daughter says I need a new prescription soon, and… oh, never mind. I’m rambling. I always do that when I get flustered.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mrs. Calvery, it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed by all of this. We can look up the medication name on your Medicare information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Hmmm. Let me see… I don’t think so. I used to get hay fever as a child, but I haven’t had that in years. And I’m a little sensitive to shellfish, but it’s not a full-blown allergy, just a little tummy upset if I eat too much. Other than that… no, I can’t think of anything. My daughter always asks me that question too, and I always say the same thing. I’m pretty lucky, I suppose. I haven't had any serious reactions to anything. Though I did get a rash once from a new laundry detergent… but that wasn't very serious. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mrs. Calvery. No known drug allergies and mild shellfish sensitivity. Okay, let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Absolutely not. I used to disapprove of people who did such things, and I still do. My husband, bless his soul, he never touched a drop of alcohol in his life. And I certainly wouldn’t dream of smoking. It’s terrible for your health! No, I'm a very proper lady, dear. I prefer a nice cup of tea and a good book. Though my daughter says I spend too much time watching those silly dramas on television. She says I need to get out more. But honestly, it’s so much easier to stay inside where it’s comfortable.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mrs. Calvery. Now, before we move onto the physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your living situation?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I live in a lovely little bungalow, just down the street from my daughter and her family. It's a bit much for me to manage on my own, to be honest, but my daughter helps me out. She does the gardening and the heavy lifting. I have a little help coming in twice a week to do the cleaning and cooking. It’s comfortable enough, but it feels…empty sometimes. My husband, bless his soul, he used to fill the house with laughter. Now it’s just me and the television. It's nice to have my daughter close by, though. She's a good girl, and she always looks after me.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a comfortable arrangement, and it's wonderful to have your daughter close by. It's understandable to feel lonely sometimes. Okay, Mrs. Calvery, now I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, check your joints, and do a few simple tests to assess your balance and reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, go ahead. But be gentle, dear. I bruise easily. And please, don't poke too much. I really don't like needles. Just…try to be quick, alright? I have my stories on at three o'clock. Though I suppose I can miss one. It’s just… they get so dramatic, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mrs. Calvery. I will be as gentle as possible, and I promise to be quick. No needles today, I assure you. Okay, your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your joints. Can you bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Here goes… Oh, that’s a little uncomfortable. They feel…stiff, you know? And they make a popping sound when I bend them. Like little bubbles bursting. Is that bad? It feels like there’s gravel in there sometimes. And they ache when it rains, like I told you before. Honestly, I don’t know what’s going on with my knees.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some slight swelling and I can hear a bit of crepitus – that’s the popping sound you mentioned – when you bend your knees. That’s often a sign of wear and tear in the joint, common with age. I’m also noting some tenderness to the touch on the inside of your knees. It doesn’t sound like anything acutely injured, but we should get some X-rays to take a closer look at the joint structure. Now, let's check your reflexes. Can you sit with your legs dangling over the side of the chair?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Legs dangling… here goes. Oh, I always feel a bit silly doing this. Like a little girl. My daughter used to test my reflexes when she was a child, playing doctor. She was always very gentle, though. I hope you are gentle too. What are you looking for, exactly? Are you looking for… something bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, which can be normal with age, but we’ll want to keep an eye on that. No cause for alarm right now. Now, let's do a quick balance test. Can you stand up slowly, and then try to stand on one foot for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Standing on one foot… that sounds… precarious. Oh dear, this isn’t going to be pretty. I haven't stood on one foot in years. Whoa! Oh, steady…steady… Oh, that’s enough of that. I'm going to fall! I just know it. You should have warned me! I told you I was unsteady.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mrs. Calvery. It's perfectly normal to feel unsteady. It sounds like you have some balance issues, which we can address with some simple exercises. No need to worry. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Now, let's discuss the results and what we should do next. Based on what you've told me and what I've observed, it sounds like you're experiencing some typical age-related changes, including some stiffness and tenderness in your knees, some mild balance issues, and some memory concerns. We need to rule out any serious underlying conditions. I’d like to order some blood work to check your overall health and some X-rays of your knees to get a better look at the joint structure. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation of your memory concerns. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a lot. Blood work, X-rays, a neurologist… It all sounds very serious. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry, but honestly, I just want to go back to my stories. And my daughter said something about a new episode of that detective show… Will these tests take a long time? And will they be painful? I really don’t like needles, you know. And I don’t want to spend all day in a doctor’s office. I have my routines, dear. Can we at least schedule the tests for a day when my daughter is free to come with me? I get so flustered when I’m alone.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mrs. Calvery. It does sound like a lot, but these tests are routine and will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The blood work will just involve a small sample taken from your arm - it's a quick pinch, and we can make sure the phlebotomist is gentle. The X-rays are painless – you’ll just stand or sit while the machine takes pictures. And absolutely, we can schedule the tests for a day when your daughter is available to come with you. I’ll have my staff schedule everything for you, and they’ll coordinate with your daughter to find a time that works for both of you. We can also discuss a referral to a neurologist who is known for their gentle approach and patient communication. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: Oh, that does sound… much better. Having my daughter there would be a great help. And a gentle neurologist… yes, that’s important. I don’t want someone rushing me or talking down to me. I get so confused easily, you know. So, blood work, X-rays, a gentle neurologist… and then what? Will I need medication? Or surgery? My neighbor had both knees replaced, and she said it was terribly painful. I really don’t want surgery. I suppose it’s good to know what’s going on, but honestly, I just want to feel like myself again. And maybe remember where I put my glasses.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mrs. Calvery. Let’s take things one step at a time. We’ll start with the blood work and X-rays to get a clearer picture of what’s going on with your knees. We’ll then discuss the results with the neurologist to get their expert opinion on your memory concerns. It’s too early to talk about medication or surgery. Most likely, we can manage your knee pain with some simple exercises, physical therapy, and possibly some over-the-counter pain relievers. If those aren’t enough, we can explore other options, but surgery is always a last resort. As for your memory concerns, the neurologist will perform a more comprehensive evaluation to determine the underlying cause and recommend the best course of treatment. This could involve lifestyle changes, cognitive exercises, or medication if necessary. My goal is to help you feel like yourself again and improve your quality of life. We’ll work together to develop a plan that’s tailored to your individual needs and preferences. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that does sound… much more reassuring. Working together… yes, I like that. And no rushing into anything… that’s good. My daughter is free next Tuesday afternoon. Would that work? And could you make sure the neurologist is in network with Medicare? My daughter handles all the insurance stuff, but I just want to be sure. And… could you write down all of this? All the tests and appointments and things? I tend to forget easily, you know. And maybe a list of questions I should ask the neurologist?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mrs. Calvery. Next Tuesday afternoon works perfectly. I’ll schedule the blood work and X-rays for you, and I’ll make sure the neurologist is in network with Medicare. I’ll also have my staff put together a list of questions you can ask the neurologist to help guide the conversation. And, of course, I’ll write down all of the appointments and test details for you. Here you go. This includes the date and time for your appointments, the location of the testing facility, and a list of questions you can ask the neurologist. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… wonderful. You’ve been very helpful, dear. Very patient, too. No, I think that’s everything. Unless… could you remind me again what the neurologist does? I get so confused with all these different doctors. It’s just… my memory isn't what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mrs. Calvery, no problem at all. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in the brain and nervous system. They're experts in diagnosing and treating conditions that affect your memory, thinking, and movement. In your case, we’re referring you to a neurologist to evaluate your memory concerns and determine the underlying cause. They’ll perform a series of tests to assess your cognitive function and recommend the best course of treatment. Think of them as the detectives of the brain – they help figure out what’s going on and how to fix it. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh, detectives of the brain… I like that. That’s a very good way to put it. Yes, that makes perfect sense. Well, thank you, dear. You’ve been very kind. And patient. I’m glad I came. I was worried it would be a waste of time, but you’ve put my mind at ease. I think that’s everything. Unless… Do you have a good book recommendation? I’m looking for something to read while I wait for my appointments. Something with a good mystery, perhaps?
DOCTOR: I’m glad I could help, Mrs. Calvery. And you’re in luck – I happen to be a bit of a bookworm myself. If you enjoy a good mystery, I highly recommend “The Thursday Murder Club” by Richard Osman. It’s a lighthearted and charming story with plenty of twists and turns. I think you’d enjoy it. Well, it was a pleasure meeting you, Mrs. Calvery. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. And enjoy your book! Have a wonderful day.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds delightful. “The Thursday Murder Club,” you say? I’ll have to look that up. Thank you, dear. You’ve been a lifesaver. You have a wonderful day too. And thank you again for being so patient.
