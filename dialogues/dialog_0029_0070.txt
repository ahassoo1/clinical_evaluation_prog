DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Hmm… let me see. New to the area, that’s why. Just…checking things, you know? Old man stuff. Not much to it, really. I do makeup, for the theatre. Big productions. Used to be, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, “checking things,” I understand. And you said you used to do makeup for theatre productions?
PATIENT: Used to. Yes. A long time. Many faces. Very important faces. Now… mostly quiet. Not so much demand for fancy makeup these days, I think. People just want to look… normal. Sad, really.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, regardless, it’s good you’re taking the time to get a check-up, especially being new to the area. Let’s talk about what “checking things” means specifically. Are you experiencing any particular symptoms or concerns?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… You mean, like… feeling bad? Not really. Just… old. Everything aches a little, you know? Is that a symptom? Back is… not what it used to be. And sometimes I forget things. Small things, mostly. Like… where I put my glasses. Though, I have them on now, see? It's the age, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, aches and some forgetfulness. That’s helpful. The aches—where specifically are you feeling them besides your back?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My knees, a little. When I go up stairs. And my hands. They get… stiff. Hard to hold the brushes sometimes. Very delicate work, you know? Need steady hands for good makeup. Not like… painting a wall.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees and hands as well. Stiffness in the hands, especially impacting your ability to do your makeup work. When did you first start noticing these aches and stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I start? That’s a hard one. Years, I think. Slowly, slowly it got worse. Not suddenly. It just… happened. Maybe five years ago? Ten? Everything blurs together after a while, you know? Don’t remember dates so well anymore. It’s not like I was writing it down. Just… felt a little creakier each year.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It sounds like it’s been a gradual process. Now, you mentioned some forgetfulness. Can you give me an example of what you’re forgetting?
PATIENT: Hmm… like… names. Faces too, sometimes. Not important faces, thankfully. Just… people I meet in the store, or the mailman. Little things. And… where I parked the car. That happens. Once I looked for twenty minutes! Very embarrassing. Not so bad now, though. Mostly small things. Nothing… serious, I hope?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, some difficulty recalling names and faces, and occasionally misplacing things like your car. No significant memory loss, like forgetting important events or getting lost?
PATIENT: Lost? No, never lost! I know where I am. I might not remember why I’m going somewhere sometimes, but I know where I am. It’s… frustrating, mostly. Makes me feel… old. And… less useful. People need to remember things for the theatre, you know? Important things. I used to be very good at it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like these changes are concerning to you. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Hmm… alright. If you must. I don't like doctors poking and prodding, you know? But… alright. Just be gentle, please. Old bones.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your joints. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Scale, eh? Alright. Don’t tell me my weight, though. I don't need to know. It's a sensitive subject. Just tell me if it's… bad. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Now, could you please sit back on the exam table?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Cold, this table is cold. You have any blankets? My old bones get chilly easily.
DOCTOR: Apologies about that. Here you go. Now, let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, breath sounds are normal. Now, let’s check your joints. Can you bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Alright, knees. Oh, that’s… not comfortable. It creaks. Like an old door. See? Old bones. Not as good as they used to be, that’s for sure. Used to be very flexible. Could do… things.
DOCTOR: There’s some mild tenderness and crepitus—that’s the clicking sound—in both knees. No significant swelling. Now, can you make a fist with both hands?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… stiff. Very stiff. Hard to close them all the way. And… achey. Like someone’s been hammering on them. Used to be very delicate hands. Very good for makeup. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: I see some mild swelling and tenderness in both hands, especially around the knuckles. Range of motion is limited. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems consistent with some mild arthritis, likely age-related. We'll need to get some blood work done to rule out other potential causes. I'm also going to order some x-rays of your knees and hands to get a better look at the joints. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Arthritis, eh? Figures. Old age. Always something. Blood work and… x-rays. Alright. If you must. But… will it hurt? I don’t like needles. And I don’t like being… looked at. But… alright. Do what you need to do. Just be quick about it. And… gentle. Remember, old bones.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. The blood work is just a small needle prick, and we'll be as quick and gentle as possible. The x-rays are completely painless – you’ll just stand or sit while the machine takes the pictures. Okay, I’ll order those tests for you. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll be expecting you. I’ll also give you a requisition for the x-rays. You can schedule an appointment at the radiology center – I'll have my nurse give you the information. While we wait for the results, I recommend trying some over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help with the aches and stiffness. And gentle exercises, like walking, can help keep your joints mobile. I will also provide you with some information on arthritis and how to manage it. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… I think my doctor back home gave me that once. Alright. And… walking. I suppose I can manage some walking. Not too fast, though. Old bones, remember? Information… alright. Give me the information. Maybe I can… read it. When I have time. And… thanks. I think. It's… good to know what's wrong. Even if it's… old age.
DOCTOR: Here’s some information about arthritis, including symptoms, treatment options, and exercises. And here’s the requisition for the lab and the information for the radiology center. My nurse will be in shortly to go over everything with you. Once we have the results of the tests, we can discuss a more specific treatment plan. In the meantime, if your pain worsens or you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions…? Hmm… No, I don’t think so. You’ve told me a lot. Old age, arthritis… I think I understand. Just… hoping it won’t be too bad. And… I’m not good with… paperwork. Is it complicated? The tests… the x-rays? My nurse will help, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, my nurse will absolutely help you with all the paperwork. She’s very good at explaining things and making sure everything is clear. The tests and x-rays are pretty straightforward – you’ll just need to follow the instructions. We’ll make sure you’re comfortable and understand each step. I have another patient waiting, so I’ll let you get settled. My nurse, Elena, will be in shortly. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Szmyd. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. Elena, you said? Alright. I’ll wait for Elena. Thank you… for everything. Old age… just what I needed.
