DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Lonell Bahta. I am here, if I understand correctly, to discuss… eligibility for care at home? My daughter, she arranged this visit. Something about… hospice, perhaps? I confess, the details were a bit much for me to follow completely. I hope that is alright.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bahta. It can be a lot to take in. Your daughter was wise to schedule an appointment to discuss all of this thoroughly. It sounds like we’re exploring options for care at home, and potentially hospice care. We want to make sure you understand all the possibilities and what’s involved. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your current health situation?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you know, I am 54 years of age. I have… well, a problem with my lungs, a condition that makes breathing… difficult. It has worsened these last few months. I tire easily, even with small tasks. I was a surgeon, you see – pediatric, for many years – so I am accustomed to being… active. It is frustrating, to be honest. My daughter says I need assistance now. I’ve been… seeing specialists, of course, but… she felt this was the next step. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very clear, Mr. Bahta. Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you've been dealing with a progressive lung condition, and it’s understandably frustrating to have your activity level limited, especially after a career like yours. It’s good that you’ve been under the care of specialists. Do you happen to know the specific name of the lung condition you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Ah, yes… let me think. The doctor… Dr. Moreau, he used a rather long name. It involved… fibrosis, I believe. Pulmonary fibrosis, yes, that was it. And something about… scarring. It was a complicated explanation. I do recall he spoke of the lungs becoming… stiff. I apologize, I am not very good with these medical terms. It was all quite overwhelming, to be truthful.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Mr. Bahta. It is a lot to process. Pulmonary fibrosis does involve scarring of the lungs, which can make it difficult to breathe as you’ve noticed. To get a better understanding of how this is affecting you currently, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A typical day… well, it is rather subdued, I am afraid. I wake up… quite tired. It takes me some effort to get out of bed. I usually have a light breakfast, perhaps some toast and tea. I try to read, but I find I tire quickly, and my concentration… wavers. I used to enjoy gardening, but I can only manage a few minutes at a time now, before I become breathless. Most of the day is spent… resting, I suppose. My daughter, she is very helpful. She does the majority of the housework and the cooking. I… attempt to assist when I can, but truthfully, I am not much use anymore. It is… humbling. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Bahta, thank you. It sounds like the pulmonary fibrosis is significantly impacting your daily life, and I can certainly understand how frustrating and humbling that must be. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Besides the… difficulty breathing and the fatigue, there is a cough. It is… persistent. It doesn't produce much, just a dry, hacking cough. It is worse when I lie down, which makes sleeping… difficult. I also experience… aches. Not severe, but a general feeling of discomfort in my joints and muscles. And, if I am honest, I have been feeling… quite anxious. Worrying about the future, of course. It is difficult to accept this… decline in my health. I hope that is sufficient detail?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very thorough, Mr. Bahta. Thank you for being so open with me. The cough, the aches, and the anxiety are all common symptoms associated with pulmonary fibrosis, and it’s completely understandable to feel anxious given the situation. Now, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. My medical history is… relatively unremarkable, until recently. I have always been in good health. No major illnesses or surgeries… aside from a tonsillectomy when I was a child, of course. I do not have any allergies to medications, as far as I am aware. I used to smoke, many years ago, but I quit over twenty years ago. I have been a bit overweight lately, but I have always maintained a reasonably active lifestyle… until recently, as we have discussed. My blood pressure is a little elevated, I believe, but it is usually well-controlled with medication. Does that provide the necessary information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Mr. Bahta. Thank you. So, no known allergies, past tonsillectomy, a history of smoking that you've thankfully stopped, and slightly elevated blood pressure that’s managed with medication. That's good to know. Do you happen to know what medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ah, let me see... My daughter handles most of that now, truthfully. But I believe it is... Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. I take it in the mornings. She keeps a list, of course, but I do not always pay close attention to the details. I trust her implicitly. She is very organized. Is that… sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect, Mr. Bahta. Lisinopril 20mg daily. And just to confirm, you haven’t experienced any side effects from the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven't experienced any… unpleasant side effects, as far as I am aware. Perhaps a slight dizziness occasionally, but nothing significant. It could be due to other factors, such as fatigue or… the condition itself. I cannot say for certain. I haven't mentioned it to my daughter, as it is not bothersome enough to warrant a visit to the doctor. I do not wish to… trouble her unnecessarily. Is that… what you were seeking?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Bahta. It’s wise to be mindful of potential side effects, and it sounds like the occasional dizziness hasn't been a major concern. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… That is a difficult question, Doctor. My parents… they both lived to a ripe old age, thankfully. My mother… she passed away peacefully in her sleep, at 92. My father… he had some heart trouble in his later years, but it wasn't particularly severe. My sister… she is in good health, as far as I know. There were some cases of… arthritis in my grandmother’s family, but that is all I can recall. Nothing particularly… alarming. I suppose it is a relatively healthy family, overall. Does that… assist you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Bahta. A relatively healthy family history is good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you feel is important for me to know about your current situation or your concerns?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, Doctor, my daughter, she is quite worried. She is insistent on this home care, and possibly… hospice. I must confess, the thought of hospice… it frightens me. It sounds… final. I still have hope, you see. I wish to remain… independent for as long as possible. I do not wish to be a burden to anyone. And I am concerned about… the loss of dignity. I suppose those are my main concerns. I trust my daughter implicitly, but… I am hesitant. Is that… clear enough?
DOCTOR: That is very clear, Mr. Bahta. And your feelings are completely valid. It's natural to be frightened by the thought of hospice, and your desire to maintain independence and dignity is understandable. We’re not here to push anything on you. The goal is to explore all your options and make a decision that you feel comfortable with. Hospice isn’t about giving up; it's about focusing on quality of life and providing comfort and support when curative treatments aren’t effective. It can actually allow you to remain more comfortable and independent at home with the right support. Before we discuss those options further, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your current condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… reasonable. A physical exam would be… helpful, I suppose. I trust your judgement. Please, proceed when you are ready. I confess, I am a bit… apprehensive, but I understand it is necessary. Is there anything I should… prepare for?
DOCTOR: No special preparation needed, Mr. Bahta. I’ll just be listening to your lungs with my stethoscope, checking your heart rate and blood pressure, and taking a look at your general appearance. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. If you could just sit here on the table, please. We'll start with listening to your breathing. I’m hearing some crackles in both lungs, particularly at the bases. That’s consistent with the pulmonary fibrosis. Your breathing sounds slightly diminished as well. Now I’m going to check your heart rate and blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 84. That's a little elevated, but not significantly. Finally, I'm just going to take a quick look at your hands and feet for any swelling or changes in color. No significant swelling or changes in color. Overall, your findings are consistent with what we’ve discussed. Now, do you have any questions about what I’ve found so far?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all quite… understandable, I suppose. The crackles, the elevated blood pressure… It does not surprise me, given my condition. I confess, I have been feeling increasingly… breathless lately. It is reassuring to know you have confirmed my suspicions, so to speak. What… what are the next steps? My daughter is quite anxious to begin… the home care, if that is advisable. And what about… hospice? Is it inevitable? I apologize for repeating myself, but… I am rather worried.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bahta. It’s completely natural to feel worried, and you’re not repeating yourself at all. Let’s talk about the next steps. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, we’re definitely at a point where exploring additional support is warranted. Home care, as your daughter suggested, could be very beneficial. This could include assistance with activities of daily living, medication management, and skilled nursing care to help manage your breathing and overall condition. Regarding hospice… it is not inevitable. Hospice is an option for patients with a limited life expectancy, typically six months or less, who choose to focus on comfort and quality of life rather than curative treatments. It's a decision made based on your prognosis, your wishes, and your overall goals. Before we discuss hospice further, I’d like to order some additional tests to get a more accurate understanding of your lung function. This would include a pulmonary function test, and possibly a CT scan of your chest. These tests will help us determine the severity of your pulmonary fibrosis and provide a clearer picture of your prognosis. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… perfectly reasonable. Additional tests would… provide clarity, I suppose. I am happy to undergo whatever is necessary. A CT scan and a pulmonary function test… my daughter would be pleased. She is very proactive, you see. And… if the tests confirm a… limited life expectancy, then we can discuss hospice? Is that correct? And… what does hospice involve, exactly? I confess, I am rather ignorant about the details. I have heard… frightening stories.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. If the tests confirm a limited life expectancy, then we can have a more detailed conversation about hospice. And it’s perfectly understandable to have heard frightening stories; unfortunately, there are many misconceptions about hospice. Hospice is not about giving up; it’s about maximizing your quality of life and ensuring you’re as comfortable as possible. It provides a team-based approach to care, including a doctor, nurses, social workers, and chaplains. They can provide pain and symptom management, emotional and spiritual support, and assistance with daily living. The care is typically provided in your home, although it can also be provided in a hospice facility if needed. It focuses on your wishes and goals, and your family is actively involved in the care planning process. It’s about living as fully as possible, for as long as possible, with the support you need. We can discuss all of this in more detail once we have the results of the tests. In the meantime, would you like me to provide you with some brochures or websites with more information about pulmonary fibrosis and hospice care?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be… most helpful. Brochures or websites… anything that might alleviate my… anxieties would be greatly appreciated. It is reassuring to hear you speak of hospice in such… a compassionate manner. It is not what I had envisioned, truthfully. And… what about the tests? When can I expect to undergo them? And… will they be painful? I apologize for asking so many questions. I am simply… trying to understand.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary at all, Mr. Bahta. Your questions are perfectly valid, and I’m happy to answer them. I’m going to order a pulmonary function test and a CT scan of your chest. The pulmonary function test can be scheduled at the clinic’s pulmonary lab as early as tomorrow morning. It involves breathing into a mouthpiece connected to a machine that measures your lung capacity and airflow. It’s not painful, but it does require some effort. The CT scan will need to be scheduled at the imaging center across town. We can get that scheduled for you within the next few days. The CT scan involves lying on a table while an X-ray machine takes images of your lungs. You may be asked to drink a contrast dye before the scan, but we can discuss that in more detail when we schedule the appointment. I’ll have my assistant schedule these appointments for you and provide you with all the necessary instructions. I’ll also print out some brochures and website links for you to review. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly acceptable. Tomorrow morning for the pulmonary function test, and a CT scan within the next few days… It is reassuring to know everything is being… organized. Thank you for your… patience and compassion. You have alleviated a great deal of my… anxieties. I confess, I was quite frightened, but I feel… much better now. I believe that is all for now, unless you have any… further questions?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bahta. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxieties. It’s completely natural to feel frightened in these situations, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. No further questions for now, I think. Just remember to take things one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. My assistant will be in shortly to schedule your appointments and provide you with the brochures. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Bahta. I look forward to discussing the test results with you soon.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor Chagaris. I appreciate your kindness and expertise. I feel… much more at ease now, thanks to you. .
