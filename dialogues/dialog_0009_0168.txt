DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s a bit delicate, frankly. I’m dating someone new, and I thought it prudent to have a check-up before things…progressed. One must be sensible, you understand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. That’s very sensible of you. It's always best to be proactive about your health, especially when starting a new relationship. We’ll cover everything you need to ensure you're comfortable and safe. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, my overall health is…adequate. I maintain. I wouldn’t say I’m a robust athlete, but I don’t spend my days on the sofa either. I have Medicare, of course, and I see Dr. Abernathy for my annual physicals. He’s…competent. Though he doesn’t always understand the nuances of things, if you catch my meaning. I haven’t had any serious illnesses, thankfully. Nothing that requires…extensive attention.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Pandolfi. It sounds like you’re generally quite healthy. And it's helpful to know you see Dr. Abernathy – we can certainly coordinate care if needed. I understand what you mean about doctors having different approaches. Let’s go through a more detailed history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries…let me see. Yes, I had my tonsils removed when I was quite young, naturally. And…oh, a rather unpleasant incident involving a chipped tooth a few years back. Dr. Evans fixed it, though he wasn’t very considerate of my time, I must say. Other than those two minor procedures, no. Nothing substantial. I’m quite fortunate, really. I’ve always been careful to avoid risks.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And you're right, avoiding risks is always a good approach. Now, thinking about your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that’s been prevalent?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history…a bit of a mixed bag, truthfully. My mother’s side had a tendency towards high blood pressure, I believe. And my aunt, bless her soul, had breast cancer, though she lived a very long life after treatment. My father’s side…well, they weren’t terribly forthcoming about such things, if you understand. It was considered rather…indelicate to discuss illnesses. Let’s just say they weren’t known for their longevity. A rather stoic bunch, really. Not much in the way of preventative care, either.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for families to have varying levels of openness about medical history. High blood pressure and a history of breast cancer are good things to know, thank you for sharing that. Now, let's talk a little about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no! Absolutely not. I find such habits…unsavory, quite frankly. I might have a small glass of sherry on very special occasions – perhaps Christmas or a particularly good book – but that’s the extent of it. And my husband, thankfully, shares my…discretion. We believe in moderation in all things. A calm and ordered life is a healthy life, Doctor. It’s quite simple, really.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Pandolfi. A calm and ordered life certainly sounds conducive to good health. Now, finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. No, not that I’m aware of. I recall a slight rash when I used a new brand of hand lotion a few years back, but that hardly counts, does it? And I’m rather careful about what I ingest. I wouldn’t dream of trying exotic foods; one never knows what one might be allergic to. So, no, Doctor. No allergies to report. I’m quite fortunate in that regard, as well. Everything seems to agree with me, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Pandolfi. It sounds like you’ve taken very good care of yourself. Now, considering you came in to discuss preventative care before starting a new relationship, let’s talk about what screening tests are recommended, and if there's anything specific you’re concerned about. I also want to get a little more detail about your current health status. Are you experiencing any symptoms at all – anything out of the ordinary, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… there has been a slight… irregularity with my menstrual cycle, lately. Nothing terribly alarming, mind you. Just a bit unpredictable. And… occasionally, I experience a rather unsettling fatigue. It doesn’t last long, but it’s… noticeable. I assumed it was simply the stress of…adjusting to a new situation, but perhaps it warrants further investigation. It's not something I would normally trouble a doctor about, truthfully. But since I’m here…
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned that, Ms. Pandolfi. Changes in your menstrual cycle and unexplained fatigue are certainly worth investigating. It’s always best to address these things proactively. Could you tell me a little more about the irregularity?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, for years, everything was… predictable, shall we say. Reliable. But in the last few months, it’s become…sporadic. Sometimes it’s early, sometimes it’s late, and the flow… varies. Not drastically, mind you, but enough to be… disconcerting. And the fatigue… it usually sets in mid-afternoon. A sort of… listlessness. It doesn't prevent me from functioning, but it's definitely noticeable. I find I need to lie down for a bit, and a cup of Earl Grey usually helps. But it's unsettling, Doctor, particularly at my age. One doesn’t expect these things.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Pandolfi. Changes like that can be unsettling. And it's good you're paying attention to your body. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be…acceptable. I suppose it’s best to be thorough, even if it is… a bit intrusive. I trust your professional judgment, Doctor. Though I do hope it won’t take too long. I have a luncheon appointment afterward, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. I’ll be as efficient as possible. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also palpate your abdomen. And, with your permission, a pelvic exam would be helpful to assess your reproductive health. It’s standard practice in situations like this. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Well… a pelvic exam seems… rather excessive, doesn’t it? I mean, I’ve already explained the irregularity. Surely, that’s enough. I hadn't anticipated such… a thorough investigation. I suppose… if it’s absolutely necessary. But I do hope it won’t be too uncomfortable. And please, be gentle. I have a… low tolerance for such procedures.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Pandolfi. You are absolutely right to question any procedure you're uncomfortable with. A pelvic exam allows me to assess for any physical abnormalities that might be contributing to the changes you're experiencing, and it’s often helpful in guiding further investigation. However, it’s entirely your decision. We can proceed without it if you prefer. If we skip the pelvic exam, we can order some blood work to check your hormone levels and rule out other potential causes. Would that be a more comfortable approach for you at this time?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that sounds… considerably more reasonable. Blood work is… less intrusive, isn't it? I’d prefer that, Doctor. Definitely. I’d be quite grateful if we could proceed with the blood work instead. It’s… sufficient, I believe. And frankly, less… upsetting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. That’s perfectly fine. We’ll start with a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a hormone panel to check your estrogen, progesterone, and thyroid levels. We can also test your iron levels, as fatigue can sometimes be related to iron deficiency. I’ll write you a requisition form, and you can have the blood drawn at the lab downstairs. They're very efficient and the phlebotomists are excellent. The results should be back in about a week, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… excellent. A week is perfectly acceptable. And I’m quite familiar with the lab downstairs; they are, as you say, efficient. Very professional. And… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you accommodating my… sensitivities. It’s… reassuring to find a physician who understands the importance of discretion.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Pandolfi. My priority is ensuring you feel comfortable and informed. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. In the meantime, I’ll give you a written summary of our discussion and the tests we’ve ordered. And do try not to worry – we’re simply gathering information to ensure your continued good health. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is all, Doctor. You have been… most helpful. And thank you again for your… understanding. I daresay, I feel much better equipped to face… the future now. Perhaps a sherry is in order. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pandolfi. I’m glad I could help. Enjoy your sherry, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes to mind. Have a lovely day.
