DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, my left leg is quite swollen, and I… I have a heart thing, you see. The fluttering. I was told it’s called… atrial fib… something like that. It’s been happening for a bit now, but the leg is new.
DOCTOR: Okay. Atrial fibrillation, yes, I see that noted in your chart. And you said the leg swelling is recent?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. It started maybe… three days ago? It wasn't much at first, just a bit bigger than usual, but it’s gotten worse each day. It feels… tight, and a bit achy, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. And is it just the left leg that's swollen, or is it affecting your right leg as well?
PATIENT: Just the left, Doctor. The right leg is perfectly normal, as far as I can tell. I haven't noticed any difference there at all. It's only the left one that’s giving me trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything specific made it worse – like standing for long periods, or activity, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’ve noticed, sir. I’ve been trying to take it easy, to be honest. I teach at the college, so I’m on my feet a fair bit, but even when I sit down for a long time, it doesn’t seem to make much difference. It just… is. It's a bit worrying, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned the atrial fibrillation – are you currently taking any medications for that?
PATIENT: No, sir. I haven’t been prescribed anything for it. The doctor… well, the one back home, said to just… keep an eye on it. They said sometimes it goes away on its own, and sometimes it doesn’t. I haven’t been back to see them since. I suppose I should have, but I've been quite busy with the teaching.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness along with either the leg swelling or the atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No chest pain at all. And I can breathe just fine, thankfully. No dizziness either. It’s just… the leg is swollen, and my heart feels like it's fluttering. It's mostly the leg that's bothering me now, though. It feels… strange. Not painful, exactly, but not right.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look at your leg. Could you please sit on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, sir. Here we are. Is there anything specific you'd like me to do? Should I keep my leg straight, or…?
DOCTOR: No, just relax. I'm going to gently feel your leg and measure the circumference to get a better sense of the swelling. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. It will only take a few minutes. Okay. Your leg is warmer than your right leg, and there is some tenderness when I press here. Hmm. Your left leg is approximately 3 centimeters larger in circumference than your right leg at the calf. Your heart rate is a little fast, and I can hear some irregularity, which is consistent with atrial fibrillation. Lungs sound clear.
PATIENT: Oh, three centimeters? That sounds… quite a lot, doesn't it? I wasn’t aware it was that much bigger. And the irregularity… is that bad, Doctor? I don't mean to be a bother, but I get a bit anxious when I hear things like that.
DOCTOR: It is a significant difference, yes. And you're right to be concerned about the irregularity. It's not immediately an emergency, but it warrants further investigation. Based on what you've told me and the exam, I'm concerned about a possible deep vein thrombosis – a blood clot in your leg – and the atrial fibrillation could be related. We need to rule that out. I'm going to order a D-dimer blood test and an ultrasound of your left leg. The D-dimer will help us determine if there’s a clot forming, and the ultrasound will give us a visual confirmation. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, or any bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A blood clot… that sounds very serious, Doctor. I hadn’t even thought of that. No, I don't have any allergies that I know of, and I don't think I have any bleeding disorders. My family… well, my mother had a bit of trouble with nosebleeds sometimes, but nothing major. I've never had any problems myself. What does the ultrasound involve? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know about the allergies. The ultrasound is non-invasive - it doesn't involve any needles or radiation. A technician will apply a gel to your leg and use a handheld device to create images of the veins. It shouldn't be painful, although it might feel a little cold. While we’re waiting for the results, I want to start you on a low-molecular-weight heparin injection, just as a precaution, to help prevent any further clotting. It's a simple injection you'll administer yourself, and I'll have the nurse walk you through it. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An injection…? Oh dear. I’ve never given myself an injection before. I'm not very good with needles, to be honest. Would it be possible to… perhaps wait for the ultrasound results before starting the injection? I just feel a bit… anxious about it. And what if I do it wrong?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Nixon. It's perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about giving yourself an injection, especially if you've never done it before. However, given your symptoms and the possibility of a blood clot, it’s important to err on the side of caution. The risk of not treating a potential blood clot outweighs the discomfort of a simple injection. I can absolutely have the nurse go over the procedure very carefully with you, step-by-step. They are excellent at explaining things and making patients feel comfortable. And I will review it with you as well. We won't leave you to do it alone. We can start with a very low dose and monitor you closely. While we wait for the ultrasound results, starting the heparin will significantly reduce your risk of complications. Are you willing to try that with the nurse’s guidance?
PATIENT: Well… if you truly think it's best, Doctor. And if the nurse is very good at explaining… alright. Yes. I suppose I can try it, with the nurse's help. But please, tell them to be very patient with me. I'm really not good with needles. And… what if it hurts a lot?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I appreciate you trusting my judgment. I'll personally speak with the nurse and let her know about your anxiety and request she take extra time to explain everything thoroughly and be as patient as possible. The injection itself shouldn’t be painful, although you may feel a brief stinging sensation. It's similar to a bug bite. We'll also monitor you closely for any signs of bleeding after the injection. Let me order the D-dimer and the ultrasound now, and I’ll have the nurse come in to speak with you about the heparin. In the meantime, try to elevate your left leg and avoid prolonged standing or sitting. Do you have any questions before I call the nurse?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, and for being so patient with me. I'm still quite anxious, but knowing the nurse will help makes it a bit easier. Please, just tell her to go slow.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. I understand your anxiety, and we will take things at your pace. I’ll let the nurse know to expect you and to take her time. I’ll be back in a few minutes to check on you. .
