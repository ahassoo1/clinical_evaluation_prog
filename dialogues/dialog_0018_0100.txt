DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Let me see… the reason I’m here… well, it’s about a test, isn’t it? A drug test, I think. Something my… someone told me I needed to get done. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here on your chart a request for a drug test. No need to apologize for a lapse in memory, Ms. Hughston; it’s perfectly common. To clarify, was this test requested by another physician, or is it related to employment or another specific circumstance?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Employment… no, I don’t think so. I’m retired now, thankfully. And a doctor… hmm. I think it was… something to do with a program? A help program, maybe? My late husband… he arranged a lot of things for me after… well, after he passed. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I just know someone said I needed this test done, and here I am. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Hughston. It sounds like your husband was very thoughtful in setting up support for you, and it's understandable that the details might be unclear after some time and with everything you've been through. Let's try to narrow things down. Do you recall if this program involved any specific medications or treatments?
PATIENT: Medications… treatments… I… I take something for my arthritis, of course. And blood pressure, a little pill for that. But beyond that… not that I remember. It wasn’t… a big program, I don’t think. More like… a check-in, maybe? Someone making sure I was alright. I really wish I could be more helpful, I feel like I’m just rambling.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Hughston. You are not rambling, and it's perfectly alright that the details are hazy. It sounds like this program was perhaps a supportive service to ensure your well-being. To clarify, and for documentation purposes, could you please tell me the names of the medications you take for your arthritis and blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me think… The arthritis one… it’s a white pill, smallish. Oh, what is the name… Ugh. It starts with an ‘N’ I think. Naproxen? Is that right? And the blood pressure… that’s blue. Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril. I take one of each, every morning. I think that’s everything. Unless… no, that’s it. Definitely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Naproxen and Lisinopril, that's very helpful. Just to be thorough, are you experiencing any side effects from either of those medications?
PATIENT: Side effects… Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, really. Sometimes my ankles swell a bit, but I always figured that was just… old age, you know? And the arthritis, well, it still bothers me, so the Naproxen can’t be completely working, can it? But nothing… terrible. I haven’t felt sick or anything. Just the usual aches and pains.
DOCTOR: I understand. Some ankle swelling can be a side effect of Lisinopril, and it’s good that you’ve noticed that. We can discuss that further if it becomes bothersome. Now, returning to the drug test request. Do you have any idea what substances this test might be screening for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, not a clue. I don’t… I don’t really do anything, if that makes sense. I used to enjoy a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I haven’t had that in ages. Mostly just tea, these days. I suppose it could be for anything, really. I just want to get it done and over with. It’s all a bit stressful, honestly.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your stress, Ms. Hughston. It's perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about a test when you’re unsure of the purpose. Given your history of occasional wine and your current medications, a standard urine drug screen is likely appropriate. Before we proceed, I want to ensure you’re comfortable with the testing process. The test itself is non-invasive, and we maintain strict confidentiality. Do you have any questions about the procedure?
PATIENT: Non-invasive… good. That’s a relief. Confidentiality… yes, that’s important. No, I don’t think I have any questions, really. Just… how long will it take? And will it hurt? I’ve never had one before, you see. I always let my husband handle these things. I’m just… not very good with medical stuff. .
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to feel apprehensive, Ms. Hughston. The test is very straightforward. It involves providing a urine sample – it doesn’t involve any needles or blood draws, so it won’t hurt at all. It usually takes just a few minutes to collect the sample, and then we send it to the lab. Results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. I will step out to give you some privacy to collect your sample. The collection room is just down the hall, and there are instructions inside. Please let the nurse know if you have any difficulties. Would you like me to accompany you to the room, or would you prefer to go on your own?
