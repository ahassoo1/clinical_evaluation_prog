DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kobler. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been getting harder, slowly. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry, even when I drink water. It's a bit difficult to explain, honestly. I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it’s definitely been going on for a while now.
DOCTOR: "For a while now," is… not terribly helpful, unfortunately. We need to get a timeline here. Is this something that came on suddenly, or was it gradual?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. You are right. It wasn’t sudden, no. More… little by little. Like the tide coming in, perhaps? I… I truly wish I could be more specific. Things haven't been very clear in my mind lately. I apologize for the vagueness. It feels like it was… worse a few months ago, maybe? But it hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: Alright. A few months ago… we’ll work with that. And this difficulty breathing, is it with exertion?
PATIENT: Exertion… does that mean when I… do things? Like walking, or… climbing stairs? Yes, I think so. It's harder then, definitely. But even when I’m resting, sometimes. Not as bad, but… present. It's a strange feeling. A tightness, mostly. And the dryness… that's almost constant now.
DOCTOR: Hm. And are you experiencing any chest pain with this tightness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain. Just… uncomfortable. Like I’m not getting enough air. It’s not a sharp feeling, or anything worrying like that. More… a lack of something, if that makes sense? It’s mostly in my chest, yes, but it doesn't hurt. I hope that clarifies things a bit?
DOCTOR: A bit. Okay. And what about a cough?
PATIENT: A cough… I do sometimes. It’s not a bad cough, not really. It’s… dry, like my mouth. Not much comes up, if anything. It mostly happens at night, I think. Or when I lie down. It doesn't keep me up, but it’s there. It's… a minor thing, really. Compared to the breathing, at least.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s go through some other things. Any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I haven’t felt warm or unwell in that way. No shivering, and certainly no sweating at night. I sleep… normally, I suppose. As normally as I ever do, anyway. I haven’t taken my temperature, if that’s what you mean. I don't usually get sick like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… I haven’t really paid attention, to be honest. Let me see… They look… normal, I think? Perhaps a little puffy, now that you mention it, but I always thought that was just from being on my feet. I don't think it's anything significant. I haven't noticed any pain, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh! Just a small thing, for my blood pressure. The doctor prescribed it a few years ago. It's… a little white pill. I take it every morning. And… that’s all, I believe. Nothing else. I don’t really like taking pills, so I try to avoid them when I can. I don’t recall the name, unfortunately. I leave that to the pharmacy. I hope that’s alright?
DOCTOR: It's alright. Let me just pull up your records… Ah, here we are. You're on Lisinopril, 20mg daily. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Lisinopril, yes! That’s it. Thank you. And allergies… no, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat most things, and I haven't had any trouble with… pollen, or animals, or anything like that. I don't think I have any allergies, Doctor. I truly don't. Though, sometimes, my skin gets a little itchy… but I assumed that was just from the dry air.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart. Please take a deep breath in through your mouth... and exhale slowly. ...and again. Okay. I'm also going to check your oxygen saturation. Hmm. Your oxygen is a bit low, at 92%. And I’m hearing some mild wheezing in your lower lungs. Also, your heart rate is slightly elevated.
PATIENT: 92%? Is that… bad? And wheezing? Oh dear. I'm afraid I don't understand what any of that means, Doctor. Is it serious? My heart rate being high… that doesn’t sound very good. I do get anxious sometimes… could that be it? I just wish I knew what was happening. Is it my breathing, then? The thing I came here about?
DOCTOR: It's not immediately alarming, but it's concerning enough to investigate further. 92% is a little low for comfortable breathing. And the wheezing suggests some airway constriction, meaning it's harder for air to get in and out. Your anxiety could be contributing to the elevated heart rate, certainly, but we need to rule out other causes. Given your symptoms and these findings, I suspect you may be experiencing some early signs of asthma, or perhaps a related condition called COPD. However, we'll need to do some tests to confirm. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test - that involves breathing into a machine to measure how well your lungs are working. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Asthma? Or… COPD? Oh dear. Those sound… serious. I haven’t been feeling well at all. Breathing tests… that sounds… difficult. I’ll do whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. And smoking… no, never. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother… she was very against it. I’ve always avoided smoke, even being around people who smoke bothers me. I don’t understand how anyone can do that. So, no, never smoked. Is that helpful? Does that rule anything out? I'm just… a little scared, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful. Not smoking rules out one of the common causes of COPD. We'll get these tests done as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler. This will help open up your airways and make breathing easier. It's a rescue inhaler, so you use it when you feel short of breath. I also want you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in one week to discuss the results of the tests and develop a long-term treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A plan… yes, that sounds very good. A rescue inhaler… I can do that. Just when I feel short of breath? That doesn’t sound too difficult. And a follow-up appointment in a week… yes, I can certainly do that. I trust you, Doctor. I’m grateful for your help. I’ve been feeling so… uncertain. It's good to know what we’re doing, even if I don’t understand all of it. Would you… explain how to use the inhaler? Just to be sure I’m doing it correctly? I wouldn’t want to do it wrong.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It’s important to get the technique right. You’ll want to shake the inhaler well. Then, exhale completely, and put the mouthpiece in your mouth, creating a tight seal with your lips. As you start to inhale slowly and deeply, press down on the inhaler to release the medication. Continue to inhale slowly and deeply for about ten seconds, then hold your breath for ten seconds. That allows the medication to reach your lungs. Here, you try it. I’ll watch and correct your technique if needed. And don’t worry, it takes a little practice. We want to make sure you’re comfortable with it before you leave. I'll also give you a written instruction sheet, just in case. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That felt… strange. And I coughed. Did I do it wrong? It's hard to breathe slowly and press down at the same time. And I'm worried I didn't get enough air. I'm afraid I'm not very good at this. Is there a simpler way? Or maybe I just need more practice? I don't want to do it wrong and not get the medicine where it needs to go.
DOCTOR: It is a bit tricky, and many people struggle with it at first. Don’t worry, it’s perfectly normal. You were trying to do too much at once. Let’s break it down. First, focus on the slow, deep breath. Exhale completely first, then inhale slowly and deeply through your mouth. While you’re inhaling, press down on the inhaler. It shouldn't be a quick puff; it’s a coordinated movement. See?
PATIENT: Oh… that feels a little better. Still strange, but less… rushed. I think I was trying to do everything at once. Slow breath… and press down. Slow breath… and press down. It's just… a little scary, feeling like I'm not getting enough air. But I think I'm getting the hang of it. I really appreciate you showing me so patiently. I'm afraid I'm not a very quick learner. Would it be alright if I practiced a few more times before I leave, just to be sure? And maybe take the instruction sheet home with me? Just in case I forget?
DOCTOR: Of course. That's perfectly fine. Practice makes perfect. And absolutely, take the instruction sheet home with you. It has helpful diagrams and reminders. I want you to feel confident using this inhaler. You're doing much better now. Remember, it's not about getting it perfect immediately; it’s about consistency. Use it as prescribed, and if you’re still having trouble, don’t hesitate to call my office. We can schedule another appointment to review your technique. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve explained everything so clearly, and you’ve been so patient with me. I feel much better knowing what’s going on, and I’m grateful for your help. I'll take the instruction sheet home and practice, and I won't hesitate to call if I have any questions. Thank you… truly. It's a relief to finally have some answers, and a plan. I appreciate your kindness. I think… I think I can manage this.
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad to hear that. Remember, you're not alone in this. We'll work through it together. Here's the instruction sheet, and a card with my office number. Please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms, or if you have any concerns at all. Get some rest, and try not to stress too much. And remember to schedule your follow-up appointment for next week. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Kobler. I look forward to seeing you next week.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Osterholm. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. I appreciate everything. I will schedule the appointment right away. And I will definitely call if I have any questions. Have a good day. .
