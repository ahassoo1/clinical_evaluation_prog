DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's August 2nd, 2025. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, honestly, it’s my memory. It’s been…slipping, I guess you could say. It’s a little worrying, to be frank.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're addressing this now. Memory concerns are worth investigating. Can you tell me a little more about what you mean by "slipping"?
PATIENT: Hmm, where to start? It’s not like… forgetting where I put my keys sometimes, you know? It’s more… like forgetting things that happened recently. Or… struggling to find the right words. It’s frustrating. And sometimes… I feel like I’m repeating myself. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Recent memory loss and difficulty finding words are definitely things we should explore. To get a clearer picture, could you give me an example of a recent incident where you noticed this?
PATIENT: Let me think… Okay. Just last week, my neighbor, Frau Schmidt, came over for coffee. We talked for ages, about her garden, and her cat… and then, like an hour later, I couldn’t remember what we’d talked about at all. Not a single detail. I had to ask her husband later, just to… fill in the gaps. It was embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I see. That does sound concerning, Ms. Heidenthal. And it's alright to feel embarrassed, but it's important you brought this to my attention. So, this has been happening for a little while now, not just last week?
PATIENT: Yes, it’s been… creeping up on me, I suppose. It wasn’t sudden. Maybe the last… six months? It started with just little things, misplacing stuff more often than usual, forgetting appointments. But it's definitely gotten worse lately. Like I said, asking Frau Schmidt’s husband… that wasn’t the first time I’ve had to do something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of a gradual increase in memory issues. That’s helpful to know. Now, besides the memory concerns, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… other changes? Let me think… I don’t know. I’ve been a bit more… irritable, maybe? My assistant at the practice says I’m more easily frustrated. And… I think I’ve been sleeping a little more. Not like, constantly exhausted, but needing more naps during the day. Is that… related?
DOCTOR: Those are both potentially relevant, Ms. Heidenthal. Increased irritability and needing more sleep can be associated with memory issues, though they can also have other causes. Do you have any trouble with tasks you used to find easy, like balancing your checkbook, following a recipe, or driving?
PATIENT: Oh, driving is fine, thankfully. I still feel very comfortable with that. Balancing the checkbook… that’s gotten harder, yes. I used to do it without thinking, but now I have to double-check everything, and sometimes even then I make mistakes. Recipes… usually okay, as long as they’re simple. But anything complicated… forget it. I just order takeout. It's easier.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no difficulties with driving, some challenges with complex financial tasks and cooking. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, nothing major. High blood pressure, diagnosed about ten years ago, but it’s been well-controlled with medication. Otherwise… pretty healthy, actually. I eat reasonably well, I try to exercise, you know? No history of… head injuries or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Appendix removal, well-controlled hypertension, no head injuries. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20mg daily, for the blood pressure. That’s it. Just the Lisinopril. And a multivitamin, but I wouldn’t really count that as a medication.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat whatever, breathe whatever… no problems there.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And finally, before we move on to a brief physical exam, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… my mother had dementia, diagnosed in her late 70s. It was… difficult. That’s partly why I’m so worried about this. My father had heart disease, but that’s about it. No other family history of… memory problems, really. Just my mother. It was Alzheimer's, I think, but it was a long time ago. They didn't really know as much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of Alzheimer's in your mother. That’s important information. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out any other potential causes for your memory concerns. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I understand. Anything to figure out what's going on. I’m a little nervous, but… let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Heidenthal. Everything seems generally within normal limits. Your reflexes are normal, your balance is good, and your cranial nerves are intact. However, I noticed some difficulty with the serial seven subtraction test, and you had some trouble recalling the three words I asked you to remember. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but consistent with your history of hypertension. I'm going to document these findings. Based on your history and this brief examination, I think it's important we order some blood tests and a brain scan to investigate this further. Specifically, I’d like to check your thyroid function, Vitamin B12 levels, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. The brain scan will help us look for any structural abnormalities. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. Blood tests and a scan, yes. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what’s going on, and if those tests can help figure it out, then please, let’s do them. What kind of scan? Is it… scary? I’m not good with enclosed spaces, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. We'll likely start with an MRI of the brain. It provides detailed images and doesn't involve radiation. It does require lying in a fairly narrow tube for about 30-45 minutes, but you'll be able to communicate with the technician throughout the process. If you have claustrophobia, we can discuss medication to help you relax, or potentially consider a CT scan, although it provides less detailed images and involves some radiation. We can also arrange for an open MRI if that would be more comfortable for you. Let's start with ordering the blood tests, and we can discuss the scan options in more detail after we get the results back. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. Blood tests first, then talk about the scan. Okay. Definitely blood tests first. I think I’d prefer to avoid the enclosed space if possible, so maybe we can keep the open MRI in mind? But let's see what the blood tests say first. What do I need to do for the blood tests? Fasting? Anything special?
DOCTOR: Good. We'll hold off on the scan specifics for now. For the blood tests, you do need to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water. We’ll also need a list of all medications you're currently taking, which you’ve already provided. I'll give you a lab requisition form, and the nurse will explain the process to you. The results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have those, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if you notice any sudden changes in your memory or experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Fast for 8-12 hours, no food except water, and wait 3-5 days for the results. I’ll schedule a follow-up. And call if anything changes. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I feel… a little better, knowing we’re doing something. It’s just been hanging over me, you know? I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I understand it can be unsettling when you’re experiencing changes in your memory. That’s exactly what we’re here for – to investigate and provide answers. I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood now. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll just wait here for the nurse. I really appreciate your help.
