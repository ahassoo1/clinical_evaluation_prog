DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Trendler. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good afternoon to you too. Look, I don't have all day. It’s about… well, it’s about this. It ain’t what it used to be, and frankly, it’s botherin’ me. I want it fixed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. “Something’s not right with your stomach and you’d like to get to the bottom of it as efficiently as possible.” Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Fair enough. Though "get to the bottom of it" sounds a bit… childish, don't you think? I just want it… tighter. Everything’s saggin’. I used to be a strong man, pile drivin’ and all. Now… now it just jiggles. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you’re experiencing some changes that are concerning and affecting your quality of life, and you’d like to address them. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to feel strong and comfortable in your body. When did you first start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Noticin’ changes? Years ago! But it’s gotten worse lately. Maybe… six months? A year? Time blends together when you’re alone, you know. After my wife… well, never you mind about that. Point is, it’s botherin’ me now. I ain’t got time to go back through every year since she passed.
DOCTOR: I understand. Six months to a year then, and it’s been progressively worsening. I'm very sorry for your loss, Mr. Trendler. It's understandable that things feel different now. Let's focus on what's happening now. Besides the feeling of things being “sagging,” are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? It… it feels weak, that’s a symptom, isn't it? And sometimes, after I eat… a bit of discomfort. Not pain, mind you. Just… unsettled. And it’s lookin’ bad. Real bad. I don’t want to be walkin’ around lookin’ like… like a melted ice cream cone.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and discomfort after eating. And you’re concerned about the appearance. That’s all very helpful, thank you. When you say discomfort, could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… bloatin’, mostly. Feels full even when I haven’t eaten much. And… sometimes a little gassy. Not all the time, but enough to be annoying. And it feels… loose, you know? Like nothin’s holdin’ it together. It’s a mess, I tell ya. A complete mess.
DOCTOR: Bloating, gas, and a feeling of looseness. Okay. And is this happening after every meal, or just certain foods?
PATIENT: Certain foods, I think. Heavy stuff. Fried chicken, for example. Or a good plate of dumplings. Things like that. Light things don’t bother me as much. Salad… fish… though what’s the fun in just eatin’ salad, eh? A man needs his comfort food.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Trendler. A man does need his comfort food! So, it sounds like richer, heavier foods tend to trigger these symptoms. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What are you tryin’ to ask me? Look, I ain't here to talk about… that! I told you, it’s the saggin’. The look of it! It's unseemly. Are we gonna fix this or what? I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Trendler. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. It's important for me to get a complete picture of your health, and sometimes that involves asking questions about things that feel personal. But we can absolutely focus on what you want to discuss. Let's talk about the appearance. You're concerned about the "sagging." We can discuss options to address that. Before we do, would you mind if I just did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? You wanna poke around? Look, I ain’t afraid of a little proddin’, but what good is that gonna do? It’s a cosmetic issue, not some illness! Just tell me what can be done to tighten things up. Is there a cream? A… a bandage, maybe? Something quick and easy. I don’t want any surgery.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about surgery, Mr. Trendler, and we will definitely not discuss that unless you want to. The exam is just to help me understand what we’re dealing with and rule out anything else that might be contributing to the problem. It will be a simple abdominal exam – just listening and feeling. And you're right, there are some non-surgical options we can explore. Things like exercises, diet changes… and yes, there are some topical treatments we might consider. But I need to do the exam first to determine what would be most appropriate. It will only take a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. A few minutes. But if you start pokin’ and proddin’ too much, I’m walkin’ out. And no lectures about diet. I eat what I like. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. No lectures, I promise. Just a quick exam. Please lie back on the examination table for me. Okay. I'm not feeling any masses or tenderness. There is some mild laxity of the abdominal muscles, which is common with age and weight loss. I also notice some… mild distension. Your weight is currently 122 pounds, and your height is 178 centimeters. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Unintentional weight loss? Now that you mention it… yeah, a bit. Not much, but a few pounds, maybe? My wife used to keep track of things like that. Cooked good food, she did. Kept me well fed. Now… I mostly fend for myself. It’s just… harder to bother with it all now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. Losing a partner can make everyday things much more difficult. And unintentional weight loss, even a small amount, is something we should pay attention to. Given your weight loss, the abdominal laxity, and your symptoms of bloating and discomfort, I think it would be helpful to run a few tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would you be willing to have some blood work done?
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking and prodding? Look, I came here about the saggin’! Not to have my insides checked! What’s the point of blood work? It won't tighten anything up. Are you even listenin’ to me? I want a quick fix, not a whole medical investigation.
DOCTOR: You’re right to focus on what’s most important to you, Mr. Trendler. And I apologize if I’m not making myself clear. I understand you want a solution for the "sagging," and we will get there. However, the blood work isn’t about ignoring your primary concern. It's about making sure there isn't something else going on that’s contributing to your symptoms and weight loss, which could affect any treatment we consider. For example, sometimes nutritional deficiencies can cause muscle weakness and discomfort. We’re not ignoring the “sagging,” we’re just being thorough. If everything comes back normal, then we can focus entirely on cosmetic options. Would you be willing to consider the blood work, just to rule things out?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Just get it over with. But don’t expect me to come back if it’s all a waste of time. And don't tell me I need to eat more vegetables. I've heard it all before. Just do the blood work and let’s be done with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. No lectures, I promise. I'll have the nurse draw a few vials of blood. It’s a standard panel to check your overall health, including your nutritional levels. It should only take a few minutes. Nurse, could you please come in and draw some blood for Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Hmph. Get it over with then. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can get outta here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler, the blood work is done. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, we can discuss some options for addressing your concerns about the appearance of your abdomen. There are some non-surgical procedures, like radiofrequency skin tightening, which can help improve the tone and texture of the skin. We can also discuss exercises that can strengthen your abdominal muscles. What are your thoughts on those options?
PATIENT: Radio… what now? Sounds complicated. And exercises? I’m 76 years old, doctor! I ain't gonna start doin’ sit-ups. Look, I was hopin’ for somethin’ easier. A cream, maybe? Or a… a wrap, like they do on TV? Somethin’ quick and painless. Is there anything like that?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Mr. Trendler. There are some topical creams that claim to tighten skin, but unfortunately, their effectiveness is often limited. They generally provide a temporary improvement at best. And wraps can provide some temporary contouring, but the results aren't long-lasting. Given your age and preference for a less invasive approach, I think the most realistic option would be to focus on strengthening your core muscles with gentle exercises, if you're able, and maintaining a healthy diet to support your overall health. We can work with a physical therapist to develop a safe and effective exercise program tailored to your needs. If the blood work comes back normal, we could also explore the possibility of a consultation with a dermatologist to discuss topical options, but I want to be upfront that they may not provide the dramatic results you’re hoping for. What are your thoughts on those options?
PATIENT: A physical therapist? More poking and prodding, I suppose. Look, I came here for a cosmetic fix, not a fitness regimen. And I don’t want any fancy creams that don’t do anything. Honestly, I’m startin’ to think this was a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. I apologize if I’m not meeting your expectations. You are right to want a straightforward solution. It's important to me that you feel heard and that we explore all possible options, but I also want to be realistic about what can be achieved. Given your concerns, and if the blood work comes back normal, perhaps the best approach would be to manage your expectations and focus on maintaining your overall health and well-being. That means a balanced diet, gentle exercise, and focusing on activities that bring you joy. We can also discuss some resources for senior wellness programs in the area. Would you be interested in learning more about those?
PATIENT: Senior wellness programs? Look, I appreciate you tryin’, doctor, but I think I’ve heard enough. I came here hopin’ for a quick fix, and all I got was lectures about diet and exercise. I’ll wait for the blood work results, but I’m not holdin’ my breath. And frankly, I doubt I’ll be back.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Trendler. I apologize again that I couldn’t provide the solution you were hoping for. The nurse will call you with the blood work results in a few days. If you change your mind about exploring any of the options we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. And I wish you all the best in maintaining your health and well-being. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Trendler. .
PATIENT: Hmph. Good day.
