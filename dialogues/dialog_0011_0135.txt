DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Neppl. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because… well, my ear. It is… leaking something. A little bit of fluid, you see. It started, hmm, maybe three days ago now?
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Radillo. Leaking fluid from the ear for three days… I understand. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the fluid a little more?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… clear. Not blood, thankfully. And not thick, like… honey. More like water. A small amount, though. I wipe it away with a tissue. It does not hurt exactly, but it feels… strange. A little bit uncomfortable, you understand?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Radillo. Clear, watery fluid, no blood, and a bit of discomfort… That’s helpful. Has there been any pain associated with it at all, even a dull ache?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes. Not all the time. If I press on it, yes, then I feel a small pain. But usually, no. It is more… a feeling of fullness, you see? Like something is inside. And a little bit of… ringing. Not very loud, though. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, fullness and intermittent ringing along with the clear discharge and pain with pressure. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… a good question, Doctor. My hearing… it is a little bit muffled. Like someone is… covering their hand over my ear, but not completely. It is hard to explain. I have to ask people to repeat themselves sometimes. Especially my daughter. She speaks very softly.
DOCTOR: I understand, muffled hearing, especially noticing it with softer voices. Now, have you had any recent illnesses like a cold, the flu, or a sinus infection?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I had a bad cold, maybe two weeks ago now? It lasted for almost a week. A lot of coughing, and a stuffy nose. I used many tissues, you see. I thought it was gone completely, but perhaps… perhaps it was not.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cold two weeks ago. And before that, have you had any issues with your ears – pain, infections, or discharge – in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, when I was a young man, in Somalia, I had many ear infections. The doctor… they did not have good tools then. It was very painful. They used… something like a cloth, and hot oil. Not good. I have not had problems since I came to this country, though. Not until now. Perhaps this is the same?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that history, Mr. Radillo. It's important to know about those past infections. Now, let's move on to some other questions. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I take a pill for my blood pressure, every morning. It is called… amlodipine, I think? And sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take ibuprofen. The blue pills, you see. Just when I need them, though. Not every day.
DOCTOR: Alright, amlodipine for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat many things. My daughter makes very spicy food sometimes, but that is just… spicy! Not an allergy, you understand? Just… hot.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, before we proceed with an examination, could you briefly tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: My family… my father, he had problems with his heart. Very serious. He died when I was young. My mother, she was very healthy, though. She lived a long life. My daughter… she is very healthy as well. No problems, thankfully. I do not know about my grandparents, you see. I did not meet them. Things were… difficult in Somalia.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Radillo. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle? Well, I am retired now. I used to be a teacher, at the community college. I enjoy reading, and I like to walk in the park when the weather is nice. I live alone, but my daughter visits often. She is very good to me. I do not smoke, and I do not drink alcohol. Very simple life, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired teacher, enjoy reading and walking, live with your daughter nearby, and maintain a healthy lifestyle without smoking or alcohol. Now, I'd like to take a look at your ear. Could you please sit forward and let me examine it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. I will sit forward. Please be gentle, you see. My ears… they are sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. I see some fluid in the ear canal, as you described. The eardrum itself appears slightly… retracted, meaning it’s pulled inward a bit. There’s a little bit of redness as well. The right ear shows similar findings – fluid, retracted eardrum, and some redness. I don’t see any obvious signs of a foreign object or severe damage. This suggests you likely have an inflammation of the middle ear, possibly due to the recent cold. It's what we often call an otitis media, or middle ear infection.
PATIENT: Ah… an infection, you say? Like when I was a young man in Somalia? Is it serious, Doctor? Will I need… the hot oil again? I do not want the hot oil, you see. It was very painful.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Radillo, thankfully we have much better treatments now than hot oil! This is not likely to be as severe as what you experienced in your youth. We have antibiotics to help clear the infection. We will also manage any pain or discomfort. I do not think it is an emergency, but it does need to be addressed to prevent complications. We will start with a course of amoxicillin, 500mg, three times a day for seven days. I'm also going to prescribe some ibuprofen for the pain. Is there anything preventing you from taking either of those medications?
PATIENT: Amoxicillin and ibuprofen… no, Doctor, I do not think so. I have taken both before, without any problems. My daughter always reminds me to take my pills, you see. She is very careful. Is the amoxicillin… a strong pill? Will it make me feel sick? I have to attend a meeting next week. It is important.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Radillo. Amoxicillin is generally well-tolerated, but some people experience mild side effects like nausea or diarrhea. It's unlikely to interfere with your meeting, but if you experience any significant discomfort, please let me know. I'm also going to recommend that you avoid getting water in your ear for the next week. When you shower, try to use earplugs. And refrain from swimming until the infection has cleared up. I'll print out a prescription for you now. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Earplugs and no swimming… yes, I can do that. My daughter has some earplugs for when she goes to the pool. I will use those. No, Doctor, I do not think I have any other questions right now. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you for your help. I was very worried about the… hot oil.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could reassure you. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within three to five days, please schedule a follow-up appointment. And if you experience high fever, severe pain, or changes in your hearing, please come in immediately. Here is a handout explaining the medication and what to expect. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. This is all very helpful. I will follow your instructions carefully. I will take the pills, avoid water, and see my daughter if I feel worse. Thank you again for your kindness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. Please take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day. .
