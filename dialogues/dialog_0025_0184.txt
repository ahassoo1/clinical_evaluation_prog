DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I ain’t got all day. I’m here 'cause… well, look in the mirror, you see? Everything is droopin’. Just… droopin’. It's embarrassing. Used to be strong, now it's all… soft. Don't know what's happenin', but I want it fixed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. So you’re noticing a loss of muscle tone, generally. And it’s causing you some… distress. Let's try to be a little more precise, shall we?
PATIENT: Precise? What more precise you want?! It's my body, ain't nobody else's! It’s saggin’ everywhere! Arms, belly… even my face! I just want it tight again, like it used to be. Is that so hard to understand? Look, I worked hard my whole life, buildin’ things, drivin’ piles… I don’t want to look like… like a melted candle.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand you're frustrated. But "sagging" isn’t a medical term that helps me figure out why this is happening. Is this something that's come on suddenly, or has it been gradual over time?
PATIENT: Gradual, I suppose. Not like one day I woke up lookin’ like this. But… definitely gettin' worse. Maybe the last… five, ten years? Hard to say, exactly. I don't sit around lookin' at myself all day, you know. But my clothes don't fit the same. And people… they look at me different. It’s disrespectful, that’s what it is. I want to feel strong again.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What kinda changes? I told you, everything’s droopin’! You askin’ me to list every little wrinkle? Look, I’m not a doctor. I just know I'm not happy with how I look. I’ve lost some… pep, I guess you could say. Not as much energy. And my skin… it feels loose. Like an old glove. Is that helpful? Because I'm runnin' outta patience here.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. "Loose skin," decreased energy. And have you noticed any weakness?
PATIENT: Weakness? Well, I ain't liftin' piles no more, if that’s what you mean. Retired a few years back. But I still do things around the house, you know? Carryin’ groceries, workin’ in the yard… It takes a little more effort than it used to, maybe. My grip ain't what it used to be. And I get tired quicker. But I ain't bedridden or nothin'. Still a strong man, just… older.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk a little about your medical history, Mr. Trendler. Do you have any existing conditions?
PATIENT: Existing conditions? Let me see… I had a bad knee a few years back, needed some work. But that’s fixed now. And the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high once, but he gave me a pill for that. Take it every day. Other than that… just old age, I reckon. I don't go to the doctor much. Waste of time, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Amlodipine for blood pressure. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to a pill in my life. I take what the doctor gives me. I ain't picky. Just want to get this fixin’ started, if that’s alright with you. This talkin’ ain’t gettin’ me any closer to feelin’ strong again.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I am trying to figure out what's going on. What you’re describing – the gradual muscle loss, loose skin, decreased energy – could be a number of things. It could be simply age-related muscle loss, but it could also be related to your blood pressure medication, or something else entirely. I need to do a physical exam to get a better idea. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical exam? You mean poke and prod? Fine, get it over with. But don’t take all day. I got things to do. And don’t tell me nothin’ I can’t fix. I want options. And I want ‘em quick. Now, let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie back on the exam table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, then take a look at your muscles and skin. I’ll also check your reflexes and strength. Heart sounds are regular, rate approximately 72. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Muscle tone is diminished in all extremities, with mild fat deposition in the abdominal region. Skin turgor is decreased, consistent with age. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Grip strength is… somewhat reduced bilaterally, as you reported. Okay, Mr. Trendler. Everything seems to be within normal limits, considering your age and medical history. What you're describing is likely age-related sarcopenia – loss of muscle mass – which is common as we get older. However, we should also rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Sarcopenia? What kinda fancy word is that? Sounds like a disease. Look, I don’t need a name for it. I need a fix. Can you tighten me up or not? Is there a pill? A shot? Something? I ain’t lookin’ to learn medical terms, I’m lookin’ for results. And if it's somethin’ the pill is causin’, I want off it. Don't need blood pressure if I can't even hold a grocery bag properly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration, but it’s not about “tightening you up.” We need to determine the underlying cause before we consider any treatment options. Simply stopping your blood pressure medication without a proper plan could be dangerous. Your blood pressure has been well-controlled on Amlodipine. We can discuss alternatives, but we need to monitor your pressure closely. As for the muscle loss, we can look at options like physical therapy to help rebuild strength. There are also nutritional interventions that can help. As for a “quick fix”… unfortunately, there isn’t one.
PATIENT: Physical therapy? You want me doin' exercises at my age? Look, I worked hard my whole life, I don't need to be bendin' and stretchin' like a young man. Nutritional interventions? What, you want me eatin’ rabbit food? I eat a perfectly good diet. I want somethin' that works. Is there a shot? A cream? Somethin' I can rub on? I’m payin’ you good money, Doctor, I expect somethin’ better than tellin’ me to exercise and eat carrots. Look, I’m startin’ to feel like you ain’t listenin’ to me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I am listening to you. And I understand your desire for a quick and easy solution. However, I have a professional obligation to recommend treatments that are safe and effective, and that address the underlying cause of your condition. There are some cosmetic procedures, like dermal fillers or skin tightening treatments, that could improve the appearance of loose skin. However, these are not covered by insurance, and they don't address the underlying muscle loss. Furthermore, they carry risks and potential side effects. Before we discuss any cosmetic options, I recommend a consultation with a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation. They can assess your muscle strength and develop a personalized exercise plan. I'm also going to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your muscle loss. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests and specialists? This is gettin’ ridiculous. Look, I came here for a fix, not a whole series of appointments and tests. But… alright. Fine. Do the tests. See the specialist. But I ain't promisin’ nothin’. And if they tell me to do push-ups, I'm walkin’ out. Just… get it done. Quickly. And tell me how much these tests and specialists are gonna cost. I ain’t made of money, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll order the blood tests now. They'll check your thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and basic muscle enzymes. It should give us a better picture of what's going on. The blood tests will cost approximately $300, depending on your insurance coverage. I’ll also get you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation. The cost of the consultation will vary depending on his fees and your insurance plan. I will have my staff contact you to schedule both appointments and discuss the costs in more detail. I understand this isn't the quick fix you were hoping for, Mr. Trendler. But I believe this is the best course of action to determine the underlying cause of your muscle loss and develop a personalized treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it done. Quickly. And don't call me back unless there's a pill.
DOCTOR: Very well. My staff will be in touch.
