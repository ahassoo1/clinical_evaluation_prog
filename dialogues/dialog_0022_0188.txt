DOCTOR: Good morning, Criston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, my pee… it’s orange. I noticed it a couple days ago. It’s a bit… worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, orange urine. That is something we should look into. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: How much water do you drink in a day, Doctor? I try to drink… maybe two liters? Sometimes less when I'm busy with work. I work outside a lot, fixing things. Maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Two liters, okay. And working outside, that could definitely play a role. Let's talk about other things, just to get a clearer picture. Besides the color, is there any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not burning, nothing like that. It just… looks different. Like, really orange. Not a little bit, but a lot. I don't feel sick, though. No fever, no stomach ache. Just the pee. It’s just…strange.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain or other symptoms, that’s good. And you said it started a couple of days ago. Has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I eat mostly… couscous, vegetables, sometimes meat. My wife cooks. I don't think she’s changed anything. Maybe a few more oranges than usual? But not a lot. She likes to make juice.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few more oranges. That's good to know. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll just listen to your abdomen and check your hydration status. Then we can talk about possible causes and whether any tests are needed. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s making my pee orange. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don’t hear anything unusual. Your skin feels a little dry, which could indicate mild dehydration. Capillary refill is a bit slow, also pointing to that. Now, let's take a quick urine sample, if you're able. We'll send that off to the lab to check for a few things. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, a urine sample is fine. Where do I… do it? I’m happy to do whatever you need. Is there a bathroom here?
DOCTOR: Yes, right through there. There’s a sterile cup in there for you. Just collect a mid-stream sample, and bring it back to me when you're finished. I'll give you a moment of privacy. Let me know if you have any trouble.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. Sorry for the wait. It wasn’t easy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Criston. No need to apologize. We’ll send this to the lab right away. While we’re waiting for the results, which should be back tomorrow, let’s talk a little more about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or liver problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve never had any problems with my liver, or… sugar. My wife makes sure I eat good food. I get tired sometimes, with the work, but everyone gets tired, right? I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time, maybe five years?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions and haven't seen a doctor in five years. That's alright, we can catch up. Tiredness with work is common, but we should rule out other possibilities. Do you take any medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't like taking pills if I can help it. My wife sometimes gives me ginger tea when I have a cold, but that’s it. She worries about me getting sick, especially with all the dust at work.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or supplements. And you said you work outside, fixing things. Could you tell me a little bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, I fix… pipes, mostly. And electrics. Sometimes I’m climbing on roofs, sometimes digging holes. It’s hard work. Lots of sun, lots of sweat. I drink water, but maybe not enough. It’s important work, people need water, you know? But it’s tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay, a physically demanding job with sun exposure. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical problems that run in your family – things like kidney disease, liver problems, or cancers?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had problems with his stomach. He needed… operations. But he was old. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. She took pills for that. Nothing else I can think of, really. My family is… small. Not many people left.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of stomach problems in your father and high blood pressure in your mother. That’s helpful to know. Just a few more questions, then we’ll wait for those lab results. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never. And I don't drink alcohol, not even a little bit. My wife doesn't like it. And definitely no… other things. I just want to fix pipes, Doctor. I'm a simple man.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. That’s very good. So, to recap: orange urine for two days, no pain or fever, working a physically demanding outdoor job, a family history of stomach problems and high blood pressure, and you generally feel well apart from some tiredness. We've sent a urine sample to the lab. The results should be back tomorrow afternoon. While we wait, I'm going to suggest you increase your fluid intake – aim for at least three liters of water a day. And try to rest when you can. The orange urine could be due to dehydration, especially with your work, but we need those lab results to rule out anything else. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Three liters. I can try. I'll rest more too. Thank you for… everything. It’s good to know what’s happening. I hope it’s just the water. I don't want to worry my wife.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Criston. I understand your concern. It’s entirely possible it’s just dehydration, and we're taking the right steps to find out. I'll give you a call as soon as the results are back tomorrow afternoon. In the meantime, if you notice any new symptoms – like pain, fever, or changes in your urine – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s my card. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. Thank you again for seeing me. I will drink more water. And rest. I will wait for your call. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You take care, Criston. And don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. It was nice meeting you. Goodbye.
