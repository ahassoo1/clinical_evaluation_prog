DOCTOR: Alright then, Mykeisha. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor. It’s my blood pressure, really. It’s been a bit high lately, and my sister, she kept on at me to come get it checked. She's a real worrier, that one!
DOCTOR: “A bit high,” you say. Right. And how high is “a bit high,” exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, um... honestly, I don't really know the numbers. I just know it felt… funny when I took it at the pharmacy last week. Like, a bit thumping in my head, and the machine beeped red, you know? And the pharmacist, she said I should see a doctor, so here I am. I don't usually bother with numbers if I can help it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It… partially makes sense. But numbers are rather important, dear. "Feeling funny" isn't a diagnosis. Do you own your own blood pressure cuff, or was it only at the pharmacy that you noticed this?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have one at home. Just the one at the pharmacy. I was getting my allergy meds, and I figured while I was there, I’d just check it. I haven't really bothered with it before, to be honest. My mother always had perfect blood pressure, so I never really thought much about it. It's kinda scary thinking about it now, though.
DOCTOR: Well, genetics aren't everything, you know. Just because your mother was fine doesn't mean you automatically will be. Alright, let's get a reading now. I’ll need to check it myself. Please don’t move or talk while I do. It's important to get an accurate number, and all this talk isn't helping.
PATIENT: Okay, okay, no problem. Quiet as a mouse. I’ll just sit here. I hope this doesn’t take too long. I have to get back and water my plants… they’re kinda thirsty.
DOCTOR: Hold still. Right arm is always best. And breathe normally. We're not trying to set records here. 148 over 92. Hmm. Not ideal. Let’s take it again, just to be sure.
PATIENT: Oh. Is that… bad? 148? I don’t even know what that means. Is that a lot? Maybe the machine is wrong? They can be, right? My cousin had to get a new one last year 'cause it was always giving funny readings.
DOCTOR: Machines can malfunction, yes, but let’s not jump to conclusions. 152 over 94. See?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… higher, isn’t it? What does that mean for me, Doctor? Is it something serious? I don't want to have to take pills if I can help it. My sister keeps saying I need to cut down on salt, but I love my cooking!
DOCTOR: It means your blood pressure is elevated, dear. Significantly. And yes, it is serious. Untreated high blood pressure can lead to…well, a whole host of problems. Heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure...the list goes on. As for the pills...we'll see. But lifestyle changes alone are rarely enough at this stage. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… scary. Hmm... let me think. Not really. I had the flu a few times, naturally, and a bad sprain in my ankle when I was younger, playing netball. But nothing major. I've always been pretty healthy, honestly. A bit of arthritis in my hands now and then, but my sister says that’s just old age creeping up. I’m 36, but she always makes me feel ancient. Oh, and I get migraines sometimes, if I’m stressed. But that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Migraines… and arthritis. Alright. Any family history of heart disease, stroke, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm... that’s a good question. My grandfather, on my mother's side, he had a stroke, I think. A long time ago, though. And my uncle, he had something with his heart… he had to get a little operation, but he’s fine now. He's still kicking! But other than that, not really. My mother was healthy as a horse until she passed, and my sister's fine. She’s always running around, full of energy. Oh, wait! My aunt, she has diabetes. Is that connected?
DOCTOR: Diabetes can be connected, yes. It's all related. Alright. Let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. My mother would have a fit if I even thought about it. She always said it was the worst thing you could do to your body. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though. Just one, maybe two, on a Friday night. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: One or two glasses of wine…occasionally. And what about exercise?
PATIENT: Well… I don’t really exercise, exercise. I do a lot of walking though! I walk to the market, and I walk around the garden tending to my plants. That must count for something, right? And I do a bit of dancing at home when I'm cooking, you know, just to have fun. But nothing formal. I never really liked gyms. Too stuffy, and too many people.
DOCTOR: Walking to the market and dancing while you cook… is not a substitute for proper exercise, dear. We need to get your heart rate up, get you sweating. Now, before we get to a plan, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. If you’ll just lie down, please.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. A proper exam. I haven't had one of those in ages. Is it going to be… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: Just relax. Deep breaths. Heart sounds are a little…irregular. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure, again, 158 over 96. Soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Alright. Everything seems…stable, for now. But we need to address this blood pressure, and quickly.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Irregular heartbeat… So, what do I need to do, Doctor? Pills? A whole lot of exercise? I really don't want to change too much. I like my life the way it is.
DOCTOR: Look, dear, I understand you don't want to change your life. But ignoring this problem isn’t an option. We’ll start with medication – a low dose to begin with. And yes, you will need to increase your exercise. At least 30 minutes of brisk walking, five times a week. And reduce your salt intake. No more processed foods, no more seasoning packets. And limit the wine to one glass, maybe twice a week. I'm going to prescribe Lisinopril, 10mg, once daily. And I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to check your progress. If your blood pressure isn't under control, we’ll need to consider other options. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. That… that’s a lot. Pills and exercise and no salt… and less wine? What if I just… try harder with the exercise and salt for a month and see what happens? Could we maybe delay the pills? I really don’t like taking medication if I can avoid it. And what are the side effects of this… Lisinopril?
DOCTOR: Look, dear, I appreciate your concerns. But this isn't something to take lightly. We can try the lifestyle changes first, but I'm not optimistic. And frankly, delaying treatment could have serious consequences. As for side effects… Lisinopril can cause dizziness, fatigue, and a dry cough. It’s usually well-tolerated, but it’s important to be aware of the potential risks. I'll write down a list of the common side effects for you. And I'll also give you a handout on low-sodium cooking. Now, I want you to understand that this medication isn’t a magic bullet. It’s just a tool to help you manage your blood pressure. You still need to take responsibility for your health. Are you willing to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I suppose so. I’ll try. I really will. It just… it's a lot to take in, you know? And I'm a bit worried about feeling unwell with the side effects. But I don't want to end up with a heart attack or stroke, so I’ll do my best. So, one pill a day, exercise, less salt… and one glass of wine, sometimes? And a follow-up appointment in a month?
DOCTOR: Precisely. One pill a day, 30 minutes of brisk walking five times a week, drastically reduced salt intake, and limit the wine to one glass, occasionally. And the follow-up appointment is crucial. Don’t cancel it. I’m also going to refer you to a nutritionist. They can help you with meal planning and reducing your sodium intake. Here. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And if you experience any severe side effects from the medication – dizziness, fainting, swelling – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll try my best to follow everything you’ve said. And I’ll schedule those appointments. I hope it works.
DOCTOR: See that you do. Now, if you'll excuse me… .
