DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Mr. Drahota. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. My wife insisted. Said I was looking… unwell. Something about my skin. Frankly, I’ve been busier than usual with the construction. A lot of sun, naturally. And a great deal of… exertion. It’s tiring work, reinforcing iron. Always has been. I simply haven’t the time for… appearances. Is this going to be a long visit, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Drahota. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. It’s good your wife encouraged you to come in, though – it's always best to check things out, especially with increased sun exposure and exertion. It’s good to be proactive. So, regarding your skin… can you tell me more about what your wife noticed?
PATIENT: Oh, she’s always noticing something. Said my hands… darker, I suppose. And my face. I barely look at myself these days. Truthfully, I don't recall exactly when it started. Perhaps a few weeks ago? It's all a blur, frankly. A lot of work, a lot of… dust. And frankly, I don't understand why we're dwelling on something so… cosmetic. Are you going to give me something for energy, Doctor? That's what I need.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of noticing some darkening of your hands and face. We can certainly talk about energy levels too. Sometimes changes in skin can be a sign of something else going on, which is why we want to take a look. And it’s good to rule things out. Just to get a better picture, has there been any itching, pain, blistering, or any changes in the texture of your skin at all?
PATIENT: Itching? No. Pain? Good heavens, no. I’m a tradesman, Doctor, I expect a little discomfort. Blistering… now that you mention it, perhaps a small one on my thumb last week, but I simply covered it with a bandage and got on with the work. I don't have time to coddle myself, you see. As for texture… no, it feels… like skin. What is all this questioning about? Are you suggesting I’m… ill? Honestly. My wife… she worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a small blister on your thumb last week, otherwise it feels normal. I understand your concern about taking up too much time, Mr. Drahota. We just want to get a full understanding of what’s going on. Before we move on, have you noticed any other symptoms at all, like fatigue, weight loss, fever, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Doctor, I’m 85 years old! Of course, I’m fatigued. That's a given. Weight loss… possibly. My wife does insist on preparing smaller portions these days, says I “don’t have the appetite I used to.” As for fever… no. I haven't felt a fever in decades. And frankly, I resent the implication that I’m… failing. I'm still perfectly capable, thank you very much. Is this all necessary? I have a job to oversee. A very important job.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota, and I absolutely respect that you're still very capable. These questions aren’t meant to imply anything about your abilities. It's just a standard part of assessing any changes in your health. It sounds like your wife has noticed some changes in your appetite and portion sizes, and that’s good information to have. Now, let's talk a little about your past health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. Now we’re delving into ancient history? I’m not even sure I remember everything. Let me think… My wife handles all the doctor visits. I vaguely recall something about… blood pressure, perhaps? Years ago. They gave me a little pill. Didn’t seem to make much difference. As for diabetes… no, I don’t believe so. I enjoy a good meal, always have, and I’ve never had any particular issues. Honestly, I’m a very healthy man, considering. It's all this fussing that's making me feel unwell! Are you going to examine me, Doctor? Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of blood pressure, managed with medication at some point. I understand it's difficult to recall details, and it’s perfectly alright if you’re unsure. Your wife likely has a more complete record, and we can access that if she’s given permission. Yes, let's do a quick exam. I’d like to take a look at your skin, just to get a better visual assessment. Could you please roll up your sleeves and loosen your collar for me?
PATIENT: Honestly. All this bother over a little… darkening. I've spent a lifetime in the sun, Doctor. It's what tradesmen do. But fine, examine away. Just… be quick about it. I have a schedule to keep, you know. A very important project… and frankly, I’m wasting precious daylight sitting here. And don't tell me I need to apply sunscreen. I've been doing this for decades. A little tan never hurt anyone.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. I'm just going to take a look at the color and texture of your skin. Okay, I see some increased pigmentation, especially on your forearms and face, as you mentioned. Your skin also appears quite dry and a bit scaly. There's some mild thickening in this area here… … does that bother you at all?
PATIENT: Thickening? No, it doesn’t bother me. It’s… calloused, perhaps? Years of handling iron, ropes, tools… I’m a tradesman, Doctor. My hands are not meant to be soft and delicate. It's a sign of… hard work. Honestly, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. I've felt worse things on a construction site, I assure you. Is this going to require… creams or lotions? Because I have no time for such things. My wife will have to apply them, I suppose. She's always fussing over my hands. Is that all? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: I understand. And it's good that you’re still actively working. We want to keep you that way. Based on what I'm seeing – the increased pigmentation, dryness, and mild thickening – it's likely a combination of sun exposure and chronic skin irritation from your work. We call this likely chronic dermatitis or sun damage. However, to be absolutely certain and rule out anything else, I would like to do a quick skin scraping just to check for any fungal infection. It's a very simple procedure, doesn't hurt, and can give us a clearer picture. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: A scraping? Good heavens. Are you serious? Is this really necessary? I’ve handled everything from rusty nails to concrete mixers, and you want to scrape my skin? Honestly, the indignity of it all. I’ve never had a scraping in my life. I’m a tradesman, Doctor, not some… delicate flower. My wife will be furious. She hates any sort of… procedure. No. Absolutely not. I’m perfectly fine. I simply need to rest, perhaps. And a good meal. It's all this fussing that's making me unwell. I think I've had enough of this examination. I'm going home. And frankly, I suggest you find a less… robust patient. I'm wasting my time here. Is there a bill for this… ordeal? I expect it won't be excessive.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Drahota, and I respect your decision. I wouldn’t want to do anything you’re uncomfortable with. Given your strong feelings, we can certainly skip the scraping. However, I do want to emphasize the importance of protecting your skin moving forward. Prolonged sun exposure can lead to more significant problems down the line, and the chronic irritation can worsen over time. I'm going to recommend a very emollient moisturizer – something thick and hydrating – to apply several times a day. Also, if possible, try to limit your direct sun exposure, especially during peak hours, and wear protective clothing and a wide-brimmed hat. I'll write a brief summary of our conversation and these recommendations for you. As for a bill… there is a small consultation fee, which the front desk can discuss with you. It’s significantly less than the cost of treating a more serious skin condition. And I’ll have the nurse give you a handout on sun safety and skin care. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. None whatsoever. Moisturizer… fine. I'll tell my wife. She’ll be pleased. Sun safety… I've been doing this for 85 years, Doctor, I think I can manage. Honestly, all this fuss over a little tan. Just… get it over with. I want to go home. And tell your nurse to keep the handout brief. I haven't got all day. And good day to you. I sincerely hope I don't have to return.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. I understand. The nurse will be right with you. I hope you have a good rest of your day, and please do take care. And if you do experience any changes, or if you have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to reach out to the clinic. .
