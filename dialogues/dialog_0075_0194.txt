DOCTOR: Good morning, Terasa. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it's my ears, mostly. They’ve been… acting up. And my daughter, she insisted I come. Something about a family thing, and… dizziness. It comes and goes, you see. Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. I just want to get it sorted, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, Terasa, we'll certainly try to sort it out. Let’s start with your ears. When did you first notice them “acting up”?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when, exactly? It feels like… a while now. Months, I think. Maybe longer? It’s hard to say. It’s not constant, you see. It’ll be fine for weeks, then suddenly… muffled hearing. And that wobbly feeling. It’s… unsettling. I don’t remember anything specific that started it, if that makes sense. Just… gradually.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Terasa. Gradual onset is common. And it’s helpful you mention the dizziness along with the muffled hearing. Can you describe the dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s… not like being seasick, not exactly. More like the room is spinning around me. Or… I’m spinning. It's hard to tell which! It doesn't last long, usually just a few minutes. And then it’s gone. But it’s enough to make me… hold on to things. My daughter worries something awful when it happens. She says it’s dangerous to just ignore it. And she's probably right. I just… don't always feel like it's anything serious, you know? It's just... a wobble.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good your daughter encourages you to seek medical attention; it’s always best to be cautious. So, the room spins, lasts a few minutes. Do you notice anything that triggers these episodes – certain movements, positions, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so. It seems to come on randomly. I haven't noticed doing anything specific when it starts. Sometimes I'm just sitting and reading, and then whoosh, there it is. Or I'll be walking around the house. I honestly can't pinpoint anything. It's frustrating, really. My daughter asked me the same thing, and I couldn't tell her anything useful. It just… happens. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “normal,” Terasa, but it's not uncommon for dizziness to have no obvious trigger. Let’s move on to your ears specifically. Besides the muffled hearing, do you experience any pain, ringing, or discharge from your ears?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. And no discharge, thankfully. Just… the muffling. Like someone turned down the volume. Sometimes it’s in one ear, sometimes both, but not usually at the same time. The ringing… now that you mention it, sometimes I think I hear a faint… buzzing. But it’s very quiet, and it doesn’t bother me much. It's more like… I think I hear something, but I could just be imagining it. My hearing isn't what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And you mentioned the buzzing is faint and infrequent. Now, thinking about your overall health, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had a little cold back in, oh, February maybe? Nothing major, just a sniffle and a cough for a few days. It didn’t last long. And… that's about it, really. I try to stay healthy, you see. I eat my fruits and vegetables. I don’t go out much these days. Just a quiet life. I don't think that cold had anything to do with this though. It was ages ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just the usual for my age, I suppose. A little something for my blood pressure, but that’s it. And allergies… well, I get a bit itchy sometimes in the spring, but nothing serious. No medications for that, just try to stay indoors when the pollen is bad. I don’t have any serious allergies, no. Nothing I'm aware of, anyway. My daughter always asks me this too, and I always tell her the same thing. I think I'd know if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You certainly would, Terasa. Okay, just to confirm, the medication you take is for high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. High blood pressure. A small tablet, every morning. I don't even really notice it anymore, to be honest. It’s just part of my routine. I’ve been taking it for… oh, a long time now. Several years, at least. Is that important? Does that have something to do with my ears? I always worry these things are connected somehow.
DOCTOR: It’s good you mention that, Terasa. Certain medications can have side effects, so it's important to know everything you're taking. I’m just making a note of it. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a bit of a long story, isn’t it? I suppose… I had my appendix out when I was a little girl. And a bad bout of pneumonia when I was in my twenties. Other than that… not much. I've been generally healthy, all my life. I’ve always been lucky, I think. My mother always said I had strong bones. My daughter keeps reminding me to tell you about my father, though. She says it’s important. He… he had problems with his balance. That’s why she made me come, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendix removal as a child, pneumonia in your twenties, and a family history of balance problems with your father. That’s helpful. Now, I'm going to do a quick examination of your ears, eyes, and perhaps check your balance a little bit. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Go ahead. I'm not really worried, honestly. I just want to know what’s going on. And if it’s nothing serious, that would be wonderful. It's just… unsettling, you know? This wobbliness. I'm ready when you are. Just… be gentle, alright? My bones are getting old, after all.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Terasa. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, a little look inside your right ear. Everything looks relatively normal, just a bit of wax buildup. Now, let me check your left ear. Okay, your left ear also looks relatively normal. Now I'm going to check your eyes with a light, just to assess your balance reflexes. Now, let’s try standing on one leg for a few seconds. Just to assess your balance. Which leg would you prefer to start with?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That didn’t hurt a bit. Just… a little bright. Standing on one leg… hmm. I'm not as steady as I used to be, you know. Let's try my right leg first, I suppose. It's usually a bit stronger. Oh dear… this is harder than it looks! I’m not very good at this, I’m afraid. It's all a bit wobbly. I'm afraid I might fall!
DOCTOR: Okay, Terasa, that's alright. It's good you grabbed the chair. Balance can be affected by many things. Now, let’s try the other side, just to compare. And again, please hold onto the chair if you need to. Okay, that’s enough for now. Please sit down. Alright, Terasa. Based on the examination and your history, it sounds like you may be experiencing something called Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, or BPPV for short. It's a relatively common condition where small crystals in your inner ear become dislodged, causing brief episodes of dizziness with certain head movements. The slight nystagmus I observed and your difficulty with balance supports this possibility. However, to be certain, I'd like to order a simple test called a Dix-Hallpike maneuver to confirm the diagnosis. It involves quickly moving you from sitting to lying down to see if it triggers your dizziness. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear… crystals in my ear? That sounds… alarming. Is it serious? Will I need surgery? I don’t like the sound of being moved quickly, especially lying down. I get a bit dizzy just thinking about it! Is there anything else we can do? Could it be… my blood pressure? Or something else entirely? I just don't like being moved around, you know. It's all a bit unsettling. Perhaps we could just… try medication for now?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Terasa. It sounds alarming, but it's generally not serious. Most people respond very well to treatment, and surgery is rarely needed. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver is very quick, and I would be right there to support you. It helps us pinpoint the exact cause of your dizziness. However, we can certainly discuss other options first. It’s possible your blood pressure could be contributing, so we’ll review your readings. We can also consider other possibilities, like a viral inner ear infection, although your symptoms don’t quite fit that picture as strongly. Before we decide on a plan, let's quickly check your blood pressure again just to be sure. Then, we can talk about the benefits and risks of each option - the maneuver, medication, or further testing. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… much better. Checking my blood pressure again would be good. And talking it through. I just don’t want to be rushed into anything, you know. I get a bit anxious when things are quick. So, yes, checking the blood pressure, then a nice, slow conversation. That would be wonderful, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Terasa. That's perfectly fine. Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. It's not drastically high, but it's worth keeping an eye on. It could contribute to your symptoms, but it doesn’t fully explain the dizziness and balance issues. So, let’s recap. You’re experiencing episodes of dizziness, sometimes with muffled hearing and a slight buzzing in your ears. Your examination showed some slight wax buildup and a subtle nystagmus. Your balance is a little unsteady, and your blood pressure is slightly elevated. The most likely diagnosis at this point is Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, or BPPV. Now, the treatment for BPPV is a simple maneuver called the Epley maneuver. It involves a series of head movements designed to reposition the crystals in your inner ear. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes, and it's generally very effective. However, it can sometimes cause temporary nausea or dizziness. Alternatively, we could try medication to manage your symptoms, like meclizine, which can help with nausea and dizziness. However, it won't fix the underlying problem and can cause drowsiness. We can also adjust your blood pressure medication if needed. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a lot to take in. Crystals… maneuvers… medication… It's all a bit overwhelming. The nausea sounds… unpleasant. And drowsiness isn’t good, I need to be alert. I think… I think I’d rather try the medication first. Just to see if it helps, you know? I don’t like the sound of being moved around. And if the medication works, that would be wonderful. If it doesn’t… then we can talk about the other things. But let's start slow. Just the medication, please. And perhaps a lower dose, if that’s possible? I don’t want to be too sleepy.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Terasa. That's a perfectly reasonable approach. We can certainly start with medication, and a lower dose is absolutely possible. I'll prescribe meclizine 12.5mg to be taken once a day. It’s a relatively low dose and shouldn't cause significant drowsiness, but please let me know if you experience any side effects. I’ll also give you a handout with information about BPPV and meclizine. And I’d like to see you back in two weeks to assess how the medication is working. If your symptoms haven’t improved, or if they get worse, we can discuss the Epley maneuver or further testing. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe dizziness, vision changes, or difficulty speaking, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… much better. Two weeks, that’s good. Not too long. And I'll be careful about the side effects. Thank you. Let me think… Will the medication interact with my blood pressure tablets? And… is there anything I should avoid doing while I'm taking it? Like driving? Or… swimming? I haven't been swimming in years, but just in case. And… thank you again, Doctor. You've been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Terasa. I'm happy to answer your questions. To address your concerns, meclizine generally doesn’t interact significantly with most blood pressure medications, but it’s always best to be cautious. I will double-check your current medications to be absolutely sure. As for activities, it’s best to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how the medication affects you. And while there’s no strict prohibition against swimming, it’s best to avoid it initially, especially if you feel dizzy. It's always safer to avoid situations where you could get into trouble if you lose your balance. I'll write down these precautions on your handout, along with the dosage instructions and potential side effects. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. And patient. I really appreciate it. I'm just glad to have some sort of plan now, you know? It's been worrying me for a while. Thank you again. I'll see you in two weeks. And I'll be careful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Terasa. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
