DOCTOR: Hello, Soila. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me? Well, my tummy… it feels big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to, anyway. It just doesn’t… feel right.
DOCTOR: Okay, your tummy feels big and you haven’t been as hungry as usual, and it just doesn't feel right. I understand. That sounds a little concerning, and we should definitely look into that. Now, about how long has your tummy been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long? That's a tricky one. Seems like… a while now. Maybe a few weeks? Or was it months? It’s hard to say, Doctor. Time… it goes so fast. I mostly just noticed it getting bigger and… well, less interested in food. I used to love my borscht, you know. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: A few weeks or months… that's alright, don't worry about being exact. It’s common to lose track. And you’ve noticed it’s been affecting your appetite, especially for foods you used to enjoy, like your borscht. Okay. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Let me think… Not much, really. I mostly stay home. My daughter, Irina, she visits sometimes. She brings me groceries, nice of her. Oh! And the weather has been very warm, hasn’t it? Warmer than I remember. Did something change with the… the news? I try not to listen to much of it. It's mostly upsetting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major life changes, Irina visits and brings groceries, and you've noticed the warm weather. You prefer to avoid the news. That’s good to know. Now, aside from your tummy feeling big and not being as hungry, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… Let me see… Sometimes I feel a little tired, yes. More tired than usual. And… oh! My ankles. They swell up sometimes. Not all the time, but when it’s very hot, like now. And… is feeling a little… empty… a symptom? Like, not just my tummy, but… inside.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, swelling in your ankles, especially when it's warm, and a general feeling of emptiness… I'm writing all of this down. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… movements? Oh dear… Well… I go to the bathroom, yes. But… I don't know if anything has changed. Everything feels a little… slow these days. Slow and… not very strong, if you understand. I don't want to talk about it too much. It’s not very polite.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Soila. You don’t have to go into details if you’re not comfortable. “Slow” is good to know. Now, I’m going to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been told you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, medical conditions… Doctor… I've lived a long life! I've seen many doctors. I think… when I was younger, one doctor said my heart… it was a little weak. But that was a long time ago. And… I had a bad flu, many years ago. Almost didn't make it. Other than that… not that I remember. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Soila, don’t worry about remembering everything perfectly. A weak heart a long time ago and a bad flu… I'm making a note of that. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… Yes! When I was very old, they took out my gallbladder. It was causing me a lot of pain. But that was many years ago. And… I think I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. But I was so young, I barely remember it.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removed and tonsils removed a long time ago. I'm noting that down. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or have you taken any recently?
PATIENT: Medications… oh dear. No, not really. The doctor told me to stop taking the little white pills a while ago. Said they weren't helping. I think they were for my… my nerves. But I don't take anything regularly now. Just a little chamomile tea sometimes, to help me sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, you stopped taking little white pills for your nerves, and you drink chamomile tea. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of, Doctor. I eat mostly everything. Irina brings me good food. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy, but I think that's just from the heat. And… I don't like cats. Does that count as an allergy?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Soila. No known allergies. And disliking cats doesn’t count! Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll feel your tummy. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. Do what you need to do. My heart… it's probably not very strong anymore, like I said. And my tummy… it's been bothering me, so you should definitely feel it. But be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. Your heart rate is a little slow, but regular. I can hear some crackling in your lungs, which could be from fluid buildup, but we'll need to investigate further. Your abdomen is… soft, but I do feel some fullness in the lower abdomen. It's not particularly tender, but it’s definitely enlarged. I also notice some fluid shifting around. Do you experience any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor… not really pain. Just… a little uncomfortable. Like when my tummy is full after a big meal. But it doesn't hurt. It just… feels heavy. And… sometimes I feel a little bit of pressure, like something is pushing down. But it comes and goes. Is something wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s good that it's not painful, Soila. The fullness and pressure are things we need to investigate. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found in the exam, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be fluid buildup in your abdomen, which can happen for a variety of reasons. It could also be an enlarged organ, or something else. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order some blood tests and a scan of your abdomen. The scan will help us see what’s going on inside. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… a scan? Oh dear… a scan sounds… scary. Will it hurt? And blood tests… I don’t like needles. Is it really necessary, Doctor? I don't want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Soila. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about these things. The scan is not painful, it’s like taking a picture of the inside of your body. You’ll just lie still for a little while. And the blood tests are quick, just a little pinch. These tests are important because they’ll help us figure out what’s causing your symptoms, and make sure you get the right treatment. It’s better to know what’s going on, so we can take care of you properly. I’ll explain everything in detail before we do anything, and you can ask any questions you have. We'll take things at your pace, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. If you think it's necessary, Doctor, I trust you. But please… be gentle. And explain everything very slowly. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know. And… what if it's something bad? I've lived a long life, Doctor.
DOCTOR: We’ll take it one step at a time, Soila. We don’t know what’s going on yet, so there’s no need to worry about something bad. We’ll get the test results, and then we’ll talk about the best course of action. I'll order the blood tests now, and schedule you for an abdominal scan. The nurse will explain everything to you about the blood tests, and I'll personally go over the scan details with you before we schedule it. .
PATIENT: Oh… alright, Doctor. Thank you. You're very kind. I feel a little better now, just knowing someone is taking care of me.
