DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Wartick. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… a delicate matter, really. Not something one discusses easily, you understand. It’s about… a discharge. A problem down there, if you must know. And honestly, at my age, one expects better quality control, don't you think?
DOCTOR: “Quality control,” yes. Right. Well, we'll certainly try to ascertain what’s going on. Can you tell me a bit more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, must you be so… blunt? It’s… well, it’s not pleasant. It’s… coming out. And it’s not a normal color. More… yellowish, I’d say. And there’s been a… smell. A rather unfortunate smell. It's quite distressing, really. I keep everything very clean, you know. Very clean. So, I’m not quite sure what could be causing it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Wartick. I understand it's unpleasant to discuss, and I assure you, I'm not trying to be insensitive. Yellowish discharge with an odor… that does warrant investigation. Has this been happening for a long time?
PATIENT: "A long time?" Doctor, I haven't been keeping a precise calendar, have I? Perhaps… a week? Maybe a little longer. It started gradually, you see. I thought it was just… a bit of irritation, perhaps. But it’s gotten progressively… worse. And frankly, it’s quite unsettling. I've always been a very… particular person. A clean person. This simply shouldn’t be happening.
DOCTOR: A week or so, gradually worsening. Alright. And is this accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, there's been a bit of… discomfort. Not pain, exactly. More of an… irritation. And a slight burning sensation when I… well, when I use the facilities. It's not debilitating, of course. But it's… noticeable. And it makes one feel rather… unclean. Honestly, it's just dreadful. Have you seen many cases like this, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Discomfort and burning with urination… yes, that's helpful. We do see a number of cases presenting with similar symptoms. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no fever. I’m quite healthy, usually. And chills? Goodness, no. It’s August, Doctor, it’s far too warm for chills. And abdominal pain? No, just the… irritation, as I said. Lower down, naturally. It’s… well, where the problem is, isn’t it? Honestly, Doctor, I’m quite fastidious about my health. I eat a good diet, I don’t go out much… I really don’t understand how this could be happening. Perhaps it's the water?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Excuse me? Doctor, really! At my age? That’s a rather… forward question, don’t you think? I mean, really! I came here for medical assistance, not… not that. Honestly, the impropriety of it all. I am a respectable woman!
DOCTOR: My apologies, Mrs. Wartick. It’s a standard question, part of the process of determining the cause of these symptoms. It simply helps us to rule out certain possibilities. You are, of course, perfectly entitled to decline to answer. However, I do need a complete picture to provide the best possible care. Would you like me to proceed with a physical exam then?
PATIENT: Well! If you must know… no. Absolutely not. Not currently. A physical exam? The thought of it! No, I’d prefer to… explore other avenues first. Perhaps some sort of… medication? Something to simply… rectify the situation? Honestly, all this probing and questioning is quite distressing. I assure you, I take very good care of myself. It’s probably just a minor… imbalance. A simple adjustment, that's all. Can't you just prescribe something?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Wartick. We can proceed without a physical exam for now, though I strongly advise one for a proper diagnosis. However, without a clear understanding of the cause, prescribing medication could mask the symptoms and potentially delay appropriate treatment if something more serious is present. Given your symptoms – yellowish discharge with odor, discomfort, and burning with urination – it is possible you have a bacterial infection, such as bacterial vaginosis or a sexually transmitted infection, although we can't confirm that without further investigation. I recommend a urine test to rule out a urinary tract infection and a pelvic exam with cultures to determine the cause of the discharge. Would you be willing to consider those tests?
PATIENT: Cultures? Oh, goodness. The thought of all those… tests. It sounds terribly invasive. And frankly, I’m not convinced it’s necessary. I’ve already told you, I’m a very clean person. It must be some sort of… temporary irritation. Perhaps I should try a different brand of soap? Or perhaps a sitz bath? Honestly, all these medical procedures seem a bit… excessive. Perhaps… perhaps I'll just monitor it for a few more days. If it doesn't improve… well, then maybe. But for now, I think I'd prefer to avoid any unnecessary… probing. It’s simply too distressing. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Wartick. However, I must document that you declined recommended testing. I strongly advise you to return if your symptoms worsen or do not improve within 48 hours. Delaying appropriate treatment can lead to complications. Here’s a prescription for a mild topical cream for the irritation. Use as directed. Please understand I cannot offer a definitive diagnosis without further investigation.
