DOCTOR: Hi Brad, it’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, “nice to meet you” feels… generous. But alright. It's my stomach. Been bleedin'. Not a little, either. It's… unpleasant. Real unpleasant. And frankly, it shouldn’t be happening. I take care of myself. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, “unpleasant” is a good way to put it, and bleeding is definitely not normal. I understand your concern, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. “Mostly” is okay, too – everyone has their days. Can you tell me a bit more about the bleeding?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I don’t need a lecture about habits. I eat fine. I keep things clean. It just… started a couple of weeks ago, maybe three. At first, I thought it was somethin’ I ate. You know? But it hasn’t stopped. It's in my stool, mostly. Dark, like… well, you know. And sometimes, there’s just… blood. Straight blood. Not a lot, but enough to worry a man. Especially a man my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate you sharing that with me. And you're right to be concerned. Dark stool and seeing blood directly is something we need to investigate. It sounds like it's been going on for a few weeks now. When you say “straight blood,” is that bright red blood, or darker, almost black?
PATIENT: Darker. Not…fresh, if you get what I mean. More like… old. And it doesn’t happen every time, thankfully. But when it does… it's enough to make a grown man queasy. And the stool… it smells different too. Sort of… metallic. I don’t know if that means anything to you doctors.
DOCTOR: It absolutely means something to me. Dark, old-looking blood and a metallic smell are both things that definitely point us in a certain direction. It sounds like the bleeding isn’t constant, but when it happens it's noticeable. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let's see… I've been tired. Real tired. More than usual. And weak. Like I haven’t got the strength to lift a full box anymore. I thought it was the heat, to be honest. This summer's been brutal. And… I've been a little short of breath, walkin' up the stairs. Just a little. But noticeable. Not like I'm gasping for air, just… winded easier.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath… those are important things to note, especially combined with the bleeding. It sounds like you’re experiencing more than just a stomach issue. Have you had any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite’s… off. Not gone, but definitely less. I used to eat a good sized dinner, no problem. Now I pick at it. Mostly just… don't feel hungry. And when I do eat, it feels like somethin’s sittin’ heavy in my stomach. Bloated, you know? And I haven’t been… regular, either. If you catch my drift. Fewer trips to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Okay, reduced appetite, feeling full quickly, bloating, and changes in your bowel habits… we're getting a clearer picture here. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions. Have you had any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmph. Not much. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, that's about it. Nothing serious. No heart trouble, no diabetes, no nothin'. I’ve been lucky, I guess. My wife… she wasn't so lucky. But I’ve always been healthy. Until now, that is. And I haven’t seen a doctor in… well, a long time. Didn't need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know – appendix out as a kid and otherwise generally healthy. And you’re right, it's great when you don’t need to see a doctor often. Have you ever had any surgeries besides your appendix?
PATIENT: No. Never. Just the appendix. I avoid hospitals like the plague. Always have. My wife… well, she spent a lot of time in them. Makes a man nervous, you know? I prefer to take care of things myself. And I do. Or, I used to. This… this is different.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just the appendix removal. I understand your feelings about hospitals, and it's perfectly reasonable to prefer taking care of things yourself when you can. This situation sounds like it’s beyond what you can handle on your own, though, and that’s why you’re here. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… mostly heart trouble, on my mother's side. Several uncles and cousins died young from it. And my grandfather… he had somethin’ with his stomach. Ulcers, I think. Real bad. Spent years sufferin’ with it. But that’s about it. Nothing on my father’s side that I know of. We didn't talk much about health. A strong, silent type, my father.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know – a history of heart trouble on your mother’s side and stomach issues, possibly ulcers, in your grandfather. And finally, do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No. Not a one. Never have. Don’t believe in pumpin’ chemicals into your body unless you absolutely have to. I get by on good food, clean livin', and a strong constitution. Well, used to. This bleedin’… it’s got me thinkin’ maybe I wasn’t as strong as I thought.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no medications. That’s good. Alright Brad, thank you for answering all of those questions. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, changes in your appetite and bowel habits, along with the bleeding. Given your family history and the nature of the bleeding, we need to investigate this further. I'd like to do a physical exam now, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll also palpate your abdomen to see if we can identify any areas of tenderness or masses. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, alright? I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded. And don’t tell me everything's fine if it's not. I want the truth. No sugarcoatin’. I can handle it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and I promise to be honest with you. No sugarcoating. Okay, I’m listening to your heart now. It sounds… a little rapid, but otherwise regular. I don't hear any murmurs or unusual sounds. Now, your lungs sound clear. No wheezing or crackling. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: A little… right there. Not sharp, but… uncomfortable. Like somethin's… swollen. Just a dull ache, really. Not like a stabbin’ pain. But definitely somethin’s not right under there. And… wait a minute. Feels harder than it should.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some discomfort and a feeling of fullness, and it feels harder than it should in that area. I'm continuing to palpate now. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No… not really. Just… that spot. The upper right quadrant. It’s definitely… tender. And… feels warm. Not like a fever warm, but… warmer than the rest. And… Doc, if you don’t mind me sayin’, you’re pressin’ on it pretty hard.
DOCTOR: You’re right to say something. I apologize – I was perhaps being a bit too forceful. I sometimes get focused on trying to get a good assessment. Okay, I'm being more gentle now. It sounds like there's definitely tenderness in your upper right quadrant, with some firmness and warmth. Your bowel sounds are… a little quiet. Not absent, but not as active as they should be. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be something like gallbladder inflammation, liver congestion, or even a possible mass. To get a clearer picture, we're going to need some further testing. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: CT scan, huh? That sounds… serious. I was hopin’ it wasn’t gonna come to that. But… alright. Do what you gotta do. Just… tell me straight, Doc. What are we lookin’ at here? What’s the worst-case scenario? Don’t sugarcoat it. I can handle the truth, even if it’s bad. I’d rather know.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, and I appreciate your honesty. A CT scan is more involved, but it's the best way to get a detailed look at what's going on inside your abdomen. The worst-case scenario, based on your symptoms and the exam findings, could be a tumor in the liver or gallbladder, or a serious infection. However, it’s very important to remember that this is just a possibility. It could also be something less serious, like inflammation or a blockage. The CT scan will help us determine the exact cause of your symptoms. We're also checking your blood work to look for signs of infection, anemia, and liver function. I want to be clear: We don't have a diagnosis yet. We're gathering information to make the most accurate assessment. Do you have any questions about the testing or what we're looking for?
PATIENT: A tumor… real bad. Alright. So… how long until we get the results? And what happens after the scan? Do I gotta stay in the hospital? I don't like hospitals, Doc. I really don't. And… what if it is somethin' serious? What are my options?
DOCTOR: You’re asking all the right questions, and I understand your anxiety, especially about the hospital. The CT scan should be scheduled within 24-48 hours. The results usually take a few hours to interpret, and I’ll call you as soon as I have them. We should have a clearer picture by the end of the week. Whether or not you need to stay in the hospital depends on the results. If it’s something minor, we can manage it as an outpatient. If it’s more serious, we may need to admit you for further evaluation and treatment. I will do everything I can to avoid a hospital stay if possible. If the scan reveals something serious, your options will depend on the type and stage of the condition. They could include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of treatments. We'd discuss all your options in detail and come up with a plan that's best for you. I’d also refer you to a specialist, likely a gastroenterologist and possibly an oncologist, to discuss these options further. For now, let’s focus on getting the scan done. I’ll also write you a prescription for some pain medication to help manage the discomfort. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had 'em. Just… I don’t like takin’ pills, Doc. Makes me feel… sluggish. But alright. Pain meds are fine, I guess. It’s better than feelin’ like somethin’s eatin’ a hole in my side. So… what about now? Do I gotta do somethin’ special before the scan? Empty my stomach? Drink somethin’? Anything? Just tell me straight. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the allergies, and I understand your reluctance to take pills. We’ll try to use the lowest effective dose. For the CT scan, you’ll need to fast for at least 6 hours beforehand – no food or drinks, except for water. You will also need to drink a contrast solution an hour before the scan, which helps to improve the image quality. The radiology department will give you detailed instructions when they call to schedule the appointment. They'll also let you know if there's anything else you need to do. I’m also going to write you a referral to a gastroenterologist, Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s an excellent doctor, and she’ll be able to help us interpret the scan results and develop a treatment plan if needed. Would you like her contact information?
PATIENT: Alright, 6 hours fastin’. And drink somethin’… sounds awful. But alright. Do what you gotta do. Yeah, give me Dr. Sharma’s number. Just… in case. Don't want to be caught short. Look, Doc… I appreciate you bein’ straight with me. Most doctors just… pat you on the head and tell you everything’s fine. You ain’t doin’ that. So… thanks.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I believe in being honest with my patients, even when it's difficult. It's the best way to make informed decisions. Here's Dr. Sharma's number: 555-123-4567. Her office is located at 123 Main Street, Anytown. I’m also going to have my nurse, Sarah, give you a copy of these instructions, along with the prescription for the pain medication. She’ll also answer any questions you might have. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No. I think that's it. Just… get the scan done. That's all I ask. And… thanks again, Doc. You've been… alright. I guess I’ll see you when the results come back. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brad. I'll be in touch as soon as I have the results. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you soon.
