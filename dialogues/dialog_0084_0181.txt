DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I'm Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Voytek. A pleasure to make your acquaintance. I requested a general wellness check, a full lab panel, if you will. Just wanting to see how things are holding up, you know? At my age, one likes to be proactive. I believe the results are in?
DOCTOR: Yes, they are. And that’s a very good idea to be proactive, Mr. Mombrun. We appreciate you thinking ahead. Let’s go over those results. Before we dive in, can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, generally speaking, quite good, thank you. I maintain a fairly active lifestyle – still do some work with my hands, you see, construction. No major complaints, no aches or pains that haven’t been there for years – the usual wear and tear. Appetite is good, sleep is… reasonable. Perhaps a little less than it used to be, but nothing alarming. I try to stay positive, you know? And I walk most days. Do you want me to be more specific about anything?
DOCTOR: That’s all helpful, thank you. "Reasonable" sleep is good to know. And staying active is excellent. Just trying to get a complete picture. You mentioned some work with your hands. Have you noticed any new or worsening joint pain, weakness, or stiffness with that?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, good question. There is a bit more stiffness in my left hand lately, particularly in the mornings. It eases up after I get moving, but it takes a little longer to do so than it used to. And perhaps a slight weakness in my grip, nothing significant. I attributed it to just getting older, honestly. The work I do isn't terribly strenuous, but it is repetitive. I've been doing it for… well, a very long time. Do you think that might be something to be concerned about?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’ve noticed that and are telling me about it. Repetitive hand work can certainly contribute to stiffness and weakness. Let's do a quick exam of your hands and wrists, just to get a better feel for things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Yes, please do. I’d appreciate your assessment. I trust your judgment. I’ve always believed in listening to what the body tells you, and getting a professional opinion is always wise.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm checking your range of motion now... and your grip. A little weaker on the left, as you mentioned. Some slight tenderness when I press here at the base of your thumb, and a little bit here on the wrist. Not significant, but present. Do you feel any pain with these movements, or when I press there?
PATIENT: Yes, just a slight twinge when you press at the base of the thumb, on the palm side. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. And yes, a little discomfort when you bend my left wrist that way, toward the pinky. It’s not something that stops me from working, mind you. I simply ignore it, as one does. But I suppose that’s not the best approach, is it?
DOCTOR: No, ignoring it isn’t ideal. It sounds like you may have some early signs of osteoarthritis in your left hand and wrist, possibly with some tenosynovitis – inflammation of the tendons. It’s common with repetitive use, as you've described. We caught it early, which is good. Now, let's go over the rest of your lab results. Everything looks good overall – cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function… all within normal limits. Your vitamin D is a little low, which is also common, especially if you don’t get a lot of sun exposure. Do you have any questions about those results so far?
PATIENT: That is… not entirely unexpected, I suppose. My wife has been urging me to spend less time in the sun, worried about skin damage. Perhaps I’ve been too diligent. And osteoarthritis... well, I've felt something wasn't quite right. I appreciate you putting a name to it. Vitamin D… I do prefer to work indoors when possible. I suppose that explains that. Could you elaborate on the osteoarthritis a bit? What does that mean for me, practically speaking? Are we talking about needing to stop working, or are there ways to manage it? And what about the tenosynovitis? Is that related?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Osteoarthritis means the cartilage in your joints is starting to wear down. It’s a normal part of aging, but repetitive use can accelerate it. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need to stop working. For now, we’ll focus on management. That includes things like over-the-counter pain relievers – ibuprofen or naproxen – when you have discomfort. We can also discuss some simple hand exercises to maintain range of motion and strength. The tenosynovitis is related, in that it's often seen with osteoarthritis. It’s inflammation of the tendons in your wrist and hand, often caused by the repetitive movements and stress on the joints. I'd like to recommend a trial of a wrist brace, especially when you're doing work with your hands. It can help to stabilize the joint and reduce inflammation. We can also discuss a possible referral to a hand therapist, who can teach you specific exercises and techniques to manage your symptoms. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that all makes perfect sense, Doctor. A brace… that seems reasonable. And a hand therapist… I hadn't considered that, but it sounds very helpful. I'm quite willing to try anything that will allow me to continue working, within reason, of course. Are there any lifestyle changes you recommend, aside from the brace and therapy? Anything I should be avoiding, or focusing on? And what about the Vitamin D? Is supplementation sufficient, or should I attempt to get more sun exposure, despite my wife's concerns?
DOCTOR: Good questions. Lifestyle-wise, try to avoid prolonged gripping or repetitive movements when possible. Take frequent breaks to stretch your hands and wrists. Maintaining a healthy weight can also help reduce stress on your joints. Regarding the Vitamin D, supplementation is usually sufficient. I’ll write you a prescription for 2000 IU of Vitamin D daily. We can recheck your levels in a few months to see if that’s enough. You don't need to increase sun exposure if you're already diligent about sun protection. I'm also going to write a prescription for a mild topical anti-inflammatory cream for your hands and wrists. It can help with any pain or inflammation. Would you like me to write a note for your wife explaining the recommendations, so she’s aware of everything?
PATIENT: That would be exceptionally kind of you, Doctor. My wife worries, you see. She means well, of course, but sometimes she overreacts. A note from you would carry a great deal more weight than anything I might say. And thank you for the prescriptions. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I feel much more informed, and considerably less anxious, than I did when I arrived.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. That’s my job. And absolutely, I’m happy to write a note for your wife. I’ll have the nurse print that out for you before you leave. So, to recap: we discussed osteoarthritis and tenosynovitis in your left hand and wrist, a trial of a wrist brace, a referral to a hand therapist, a topical anti-inflammatory cream, and Vitamin D supplementation. Do you have any other questions for me today, before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. You have been most helpful, and I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. I feel quite confident in following your recommendations. I suppose I should schedule a follow-up appointment? Perhaps in three months, to review the results of the Vitamin D test and assess the effectiveness of the other treatments?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds good. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment for November 2nd, at the same time. The nurse will confirm that for you before you leave. If you experience any significant worsening of your symptoms before then, or if you develop any new pain, please don’t hesitate to call the office. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Mombrun. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you then.
PATIENT: The pleasure was entirely mine, Doctor Voytek. Thank you again for your excellent care. I believe I have everything I need. Have a wonderful day.
DOCTOR: You as well, Mr. Mombrun. Please let the nurse know if you need help getting to the checkout desk. Have a good day! .
