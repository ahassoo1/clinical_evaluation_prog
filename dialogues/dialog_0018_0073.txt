DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Stilaire. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the nurse. It’s my stomach. Been… bad. Really bad. And nothing seems to help. I’ve tried everything the pharmacy suggested. I don't have time for this, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. It sounds quite distressing to have something persistent and not respond to over-the-counter remedies. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the nature of your stomach issues?
PATIENT: Describe? It’s… diarrhea, okay? I go to the bathroom a lot. It's… watery. You don't need a description of watery. It's embarrassing, and frankly, it’s wasting my time being here explaining this. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questioning seemed insensitive, Ms. Woodring. You are right to want a swift resolution. It is certainly not my intention to make you uncomfortable, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. To help determine the cause and best course of action, could you tell me when this started?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't remember exactly. A while ago. Maybe a week? Two? It all feels like one long bathroom trip, if I’m being honest. It’s not like I’m keeping a calendar for when I have… problems. It just started and hasn’t gone away. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Woodring, that’s helpful. Approximately a week or two is a good starting point. And it's perfectly understandable you haven't been keeping track. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it or make it worse?
PATIENT: Not really. I eat what I normally eat. I haven’t changed anything. Maybe…stress? My husband passed last year, and…well, life’s been stressful. But I've always been able to handle things. It's just…this won't stop. It's not like I'm eating bad clams or something.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Woodring. Grief can manifest in many ways, and it certainly can have an impact on our physical health. Thank you for sharing that with me. Given the duration and your description, and to rule out other possibilities, could you describe any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I go to the bathroom a lot, okay? That's the symptom! I’m tired, probably, from…you know. But I'm always tired. It's not like I'm throwing up or anything. Just… this. And it’s inconvenient. Really inconvenient. Are you going to give me something that actually works or not?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I assure you I want to find a solution that works for you. I'm asking about other symptoms simply to get a more complete picture and ensure we consider all possibilities. Have you experienced any fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Are you serious right now? No, I haven't seen any blood. And no, I haven't been vomiting. I told you, it’s diarrhea. I'm not sick with everything at once. This is ridiculous. I feel like I'm being interrogated for a crime. Just give me something to stop it, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the thorough questioning, Ms. Woodring. It’s important to rule out any serious causes. Okay, no fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or blood in your stool. Now, just to clarify your history, have you had any similar episodes of diarrhea in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. Maybe a stomach bug here and there, like anyone gets. Nothing like this. This is… persistent. And embarrassing. I really don’t understand why it won’t go away. I don’t usually complain about things, you know? But this is… a lot. Are we getting anywhere, or are we just going to keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Ms. Woodring, thank you. It's helpful to know this is unusual for you. And I appreciate you being so forthcoming, despite your discomfort. Now, could you please tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the usual. Multivitamin, sometimes. And I took some of that stuff from the pharmacy – Imodium, I think it was called. Didn’t do a thing. Honestly, I don’t even remember the names. It all just seemed like water down the drain. I don’t take a lot of pills. I’m a healthy person, usually. This is just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a multivitamin and you tried Imodium without significant relief. Thank you. And, to complete your medical history, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I'm Tlingit, you know. We're pretty sturdy people. We don’t get sick easily. I think that's what the doctors used to say, anyway. Honestly, I just want this to be over. Are you going to prescribe something or not? I have an appointment later.
DOCTOR: I understand your urgency, Ms. Woodring, and I will certainly work towards a solution. Before I make a recommendation, I would like to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve listening to your abdomen and checking for any tenderness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Really? Now you want to touch me? After all these questions? Look, I’m a private person. And honestly, I doubt listening to my stomach is going to tell you anything I haven’t already said. I just want a pill. That’s all. Are you going to give me a pill or not? I’m wasting my time here. This is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I understand your discomfort and frustration. However, a physical exam is a standard part of a medical consultation and helps me to rule out other potential causes and ensure I’m making the safest and most appropriate recommendation. It's not to cause you discomfort, but to provide the best possible care. Given your strong reluctance, and in the interest of respecting your wishes, I am hesitant to proceed without it. However, without a physical exam, I am limited in my ability to provide a diagnosis and a safe and effective treatment plan. Given your description and the lack of fever, blood in the stool, or significant vomiting, it's possible this is a mild case of infectious gastroenteritis or even a reaction to something you’ve eaten. However, without further investigation, I cannot definitively rule out other possibilities. I am concerned about dehydration given the persistent diarrhea. I am happy to provide you with a prescription for an anti-diarrheal medication, but I strongly recommend a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician if your symptoms do not improve within 48 hours. I will also provide you with instructions on how to prevent dehydration. Does that sound acceptable to you?
