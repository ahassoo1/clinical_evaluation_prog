DOCTOR: Hi Jaxston, welcome in. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Right, well… it’s my head. It’s been… bad, on and off. And I get really sweaty when it happens, and my heart kinda races, you know? It’s hard to explain, it just… feels awful. I don’t really remember when it started, to be honest. It’s been a while though.
DOCTOR: Okay, “bad headaches with sweating and a racing heart.” That’s a good start. And you said it's been going on for a while – can you try to give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm… a while… jeez. Honestly? Maybe… six months? Or was it longer? I’m really not good with dates. It feels like it’s been getting more frequent recently, though. Like, happening maybe once a month at first, now it's… more like every couple of weeks. Does that make sense? It’s all a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increasing in frequency over the last six months, now happening every couple of weeks. And you said it feels awful… can you describe the headache itself?
PATIENT: Right. Uh… it's not like a normal headache, you know? It’s… all over, kinda. Not just in my head, it feels like it’s behind my eyes too. And it’s really… pounding. Like someone’s hammering away in there. And it makes me feel kinda sick to my stomach sometimes, but I haven’t actually been sick, if that makes sense. It just… feels like I might be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a pounding headache, all over, including behind the eyes, with nausea but no vomiting. And you mentioned the racing heart and sweating. Do these symptoms – the headache, racing heart and sweating – happen at the same time?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. It usually starts with the headache, and then… kinda quickly after that, I start getting all hot and sweaty. And my heart starts going like… thump-thump-thump. It's all kinda at once, really. I don’t think I’ve ever had just one of those things happen on its own. Always all together. Does that… help? I’m trying to remember exactly how it goes.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. So, headache, sweating, and racing heart occurring simultaneously. Do you notice anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger…? Hmm. That's a good question. I haven't really noticed anything specific. Sometimes it happens when I’m stressed, I guess, but I’m always kinda stressed. Work’s… well, it’s work. And sometimes it just happens out of nowhere. I haven’t been able to figure out if there’s anything that sets it off. Honestly, I just try to get through it when it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, no clear triggers identified. And you mentioned work is stressful. Can you tell me a bit more about your work?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah, sure. I work in a… a factory, I guess you’d call it. Production stuff. Mostly just… standing and doing the same thing over and over for hours. It’s not glamorous, that’s for sure. And the boss… well, he’s not the nicest guy. A lot of pressure to keep up, you know? It's just… a job. I don’t really enjoy it, if that makes a difference. Long hours, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, factory work, long hours, stressful environment, and a demanding boss. Let's move on to some other things. Have you had any head injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Head injuries…? Uh… I think I bumped my head a few times when I was a kid, messing around, but nothing serious. Like, no concussions or anything like that. Nothing I ever went to the doctor for, anyway. Just little knocks. Definitely not recently, though. I can’t remember ever having anything bad happen to my head as an adult.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant head injuries reported. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. I haven't really been to the doctor in… well, a long time, to be honest. I’m usually okay, just get a cold sometimes. Nothing major. I don’t take any regular medication or anything like that. I’m not really one for doctors, if that makes sense. I just try to tough things out.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known medical conditions and no current medications. And you said you haven’t been to the doctor in a while. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… allergies. Hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything that I can remember. I'm pretty sure I'm not allergic to anything, but… honestly, I haven’t really paid attention. If I ate something weird, I guess I'd notice, but I can't think of anything specific. Nothing comes to mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you mentioned you’re 22 years old. Do you have any family history of headaches, migraines, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Neurological conditions…? Jeez, that’s a big word. Uh… my mum gets headaches sometimes, pretty bad ones. She says they’re “migraines”, but I don’t really know what that means. And my grandad… he was always a bit forgetful, but I don’t know if that counts. He was old, you know? Nothing else springs to mind, really. I don’t really talk about health stuff with my family.
DOCTOR: Okay. Family history of headaches and potential memory issues in grandfather. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. Just checking your blood pressure, pulse, and doing a basic neurological assessment. That includes checking your reflexes and things like that. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I guess it's a good idea to check everything. I'm not great with all the medical stuff, but… go ahead. I’ll just sit here, right? Let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable or anything.
DOCTOR: Great. Please just relax. First, I'm going to take your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, we'll do a few quick neurological checks. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 88 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Look straight ahead and don’t resist. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I'm going to check your cranial nerves. I'm just shining a light in your eyes and asking you to follow my finger. Everything looks normal so far. No obvious deficits. Now, just a quick assessment of your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah, okay. Let me close my eyes… Woah, a little off. Sorry, I'm not very good at this. It feels kinda weird with my eyes closed. I think I got it this time… Is that better? I'm not usually this clumsy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It's not a test of coordination, just a quick assessment. A little bit of variability is normal, especially when you're not used to it. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, your symptoms – the headaches with sweating, racing heart, and the family history – are concerning for a few possibilities. One thing we need to rule out is something called a pheochromocytoma, which is a rare tumor that can cause these kinds of symptoms. It's unlikely, but important to investigate. Also, your blood pressure is a little elevated, which we need to keep an eye on. I'm going to order some blood work and a urine test to check for certain hormones. And, to be on the safe side, I'm going to recommend an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Uh… a tumor? Wow. That sounds… scary. Blood work and a… EKG? I guess so. If you think it's important. I don’t really like the sound of a tumor, but… I trust you. What does the EKG do exactly? And will the blood work show if I have one of these… pheo-things? I just… don’t like being poked and prodded, you know? Is it gonna be expensive? I don't have insurance...
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and it is a lot to take in. A pheochromocytoma is rare, and we’re just being thorough. It’s important to rule things out. The EKG is a simple test – it just measures the electrical activity of your heart. It won't hurt at all, just some stickers on your chest. The blood work can help us identify if there’s an issue with the hormones produced by this type of tumor. It won't be definitive on its own, but it's a good starting point. I know you don't have insurance, and I understand that's a concern. I'll see if we can get a discount through the lab, and we can discuss payment options. I can also write a letter explaining the necessity of these tests to a local charity that may offer financial assistance. I’m also going to recommend keeping a headache diary, noting when your headaches occur, how severe they are, and any associated symptoms. And try to manage your stress levels as much as possible. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… a diary. I can probably do that. And a discount would be… really helpful, honestly. And the letter for the charity… yeah, that would be great. I appreciate that. So… blood work, EKG, diary, and try to… not be stressed. That’s a lot. When do I need to do the blood work and EKG? Will someone tell me how to do it, or do I just… show up? And is there anything I need to do before the blood work? Like, fast or anything? I always forget these things…
DOCTOR: I’m writing you a referral to the lab here on Elm Street. They’ll schedule your blood work and EKG appointment. You do need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood work – no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. They will give you specific instructions when you call to schedule, but it’s best to be prepared. And yes, the EKG is usually done right after the blood work. It’s a quick procedure – it should only take about ten minutes. Here’s the number for the lab. Call them first thing tomorrow, and they’ll get everything set up. I’ll also have my nurse print out a headache diary template for you to take home. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I think that’s everything. Fast for eight hours, call the lab… and diary. I guess so. Thanks. I really appreciate you explaining everything. And for the letter, and trying to get a discount. It’s… a lot, but I feel better knowing we’re doing something. I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaxston. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, even if it’s just to clarify something. And remember, we’re just being cautious. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I’ll see you back here once you’ve had the tests done. .
