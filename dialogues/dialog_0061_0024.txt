DOCTOR: Talofa, Kiante! Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kimm. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Dr. Kimm. Um, I need a letter. A letter confirming that I’m able to fly. It’s for… well, my travel insurance company. They need it before they’ll let me book a flight. It’s a bit of a long story, but my husband… he passed away recently, and I’m trying to go home to Mongolia to… to sort things out. They just need the letter.
DOCTOR: I’m so sorry to hear about your husband, Kiante. That must be incredibly difficult. Of course, I can help you with a letter for your travel insurance. To make sure it’s accurate, I’ll need to ask you a few questions, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. Ask away. I don’t mind at all. Just… the quicker we get it done, the better, if that’s okay. I’ve got a lot on my plate, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. First, let's just confirm some basic information. I see here your name is Kiante Sayar, you’re 33 years old, and your height and weight are listed as 176 cm and 131 lbs. Is that all correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s all correct. And I have Medicare, just in case that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And just to be clear, the insurance company is asking for a letter stating you are medically fit to fly, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Medically fit to fly. They didn’t give a specific reason, they just said it's standard procedure after… well, after a bereavement. It's a bit frustrating, to be honest, but I need to get this sorted.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It's good they're being cautious, even if it’s a hassle right now. To be thorough, and to make sure the letter is comprehensive, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Um, general health… I’m usually quite healthy. I don’t really have any… conditions. I don't take any regular medication. I try to eat well, although it's been difficult since… everything. I haven't been to the doctor in a while, honestly. Just for check-ups, nothing serious. I had all my vaccinations when I was younger, of course. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Kiante. No major health concerns, generally healthy, no regular medications, and up to date on vaccinations. Have you had any recent illnesses or been hospitalised for anything in the last six months?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Not even a cold, thankfully. It's been… stressful, mostly. But physically, I’ve been okay. I mean, as okay as one can be, given the circumstances. I did have a bit of a sleepless spell for a few weeks, but that’s… that’s all. I haven’t needed to go to the hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No recent hospitalizations or illnesses. Just some stress and sleep difficulties. And just to be complete, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None at all. I can eat anything, take any medication... I've always been pretty lucky in that regard. My husband… he had a nut allergy, so I'm very careful about checking labels for him, but I don’t have any myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s very good to know. Now, the travel insurance company might ask about any recent surgeries or serious medical procedures. Have you had any of those in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been very fortunate, really. I broke my arm when I was a child, but that was it. Nothing major. No surgeries, no serious procedures… I can honestly say that’s all clear. Is there anything else you need to know? I’m happy to answer whatever you ask, I just… I’d like to get this letter sorted as quickly as possible. It's just… a difficult time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or serious medical procedures. You mentioned your husband's passing recently. I'm very sorry for your loss. Approximately how long ago did this happen?
PATIENT: Thank you. It was… three weeks ago, yesterday, actually. Three weeks and one day. It was… unexpected. We were planning a trip to… well, it doesn't matter. It was quick. I’m still… processing everything, to be honest. That’s probably why I’m a bit… distracted. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks ago. I understand completely, Kiante. It’s perfectly normal to feel distracted and overwhelmed. And just one last thing, before I write the letter. Has anything changed in your medical condition since your husband passed away?
PATIENT: Um… no. No, nothing at all. I mean, I've been more stressed and anxious, and sleeping a bit less, as I said, but nothing that would stop me from travelling. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no new symptoms… I’m perfectly capable of travelling, I just need the letter to prove it. I just want to go home. Is that okay? Will that be enough information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Kiante. It sounds like you are medically stable to travel. Okay, let me summarise: You're a 33-year-old female with a recent bereavement three weeks ago. You have no known allergies, no current medications, no recent illnesses or hospitalisations, and no significant past medical history. You're reporting some stress and sleep disturbance, but no new acute symptoms. Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s absolutely perfect. That sums it up exactly. Thank you. I really appreciate you listening. Will this letter be enough for the insurance company, do you think? I don't want to have to come back again.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm writing a letter stating that based on your history, you are medically fit to fly. I will include a sentence stating that some stress and sleep disturbance are noted, but not contraindicating travel. This should be sufficient for most insurance companies. Here you go. I’ve also included my clinic details and contact information should they require further clarification. Please read it over to ensure everything is accurate. Is there anything you want me to add or change?
PATIENT: Yes, that looks… perfect. Everything is accurate, and it says everything I need it to say. Thank you so much, Dr. Kimm. You’ve been very helpful, and very understanding. I really appreciate it. Is there anything I need to pay? I didn’t ask about the cost, I just… I was so focused on getting the letter.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Kiante. Given the circumstances, I’ll waive the consultation fee today. Please, take care of yourself. And my condolences again for your loss. If you need anything else in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out.
