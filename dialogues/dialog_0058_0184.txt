DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get straight to it. It's... well, it's my body. I don't like what I see in the mirror anymore. It's falling apart, you see? Everything is just... sagging. And I want it fixed. I used to be strong, you know? A proper pile driver operator needs to look strong.
DOCTOR: Right. “Falling apart,” you say. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? What kinda specific you want? I told you, everything is going down. My stomach, my arms... even my chest! It ain’t firm like it used to be. Used to be able to feel the muscles, now it's just... soft. And loose. It's embarrassing, plain and simple. I wear shirts to hide it now, which is ridiculous. A man shouldn’t have to hide his body. You understand?
DOCTOR: So, you’re concerned about loss of muscle tone and changes in the appearance of your abdomen, arms, and chest. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradual over time?
PATIENT: Gradual, of course gradual! You think I woke up one morning lookin’ like this? It’s been years, slowly gettin’ worse. Ever since I stopped workin' so much, I suppose. Not as much strain on the body, you see. But that don't mean I want to stay like this. It’s just… disappointing. And my wife, bless her soul, she always liked a strong man. It’s important, you know? Appearance.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from noticing these changes in your physical appearance, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kinda symptoms? I don’t feel sick, if that's what you mean. Just… unhappy with how I look. Is that a symptom? It's not like my insides are broken. It's the outside that's the problem. Look, are you gonna fix this or what? I haven’t got all day to answer riddles.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, changes in body composition can sometimes be related to underlying medical conditions. Just to rule things out, let’s go through a quick review of your overall health. Have you noticed any recent weight loss or gain, changes in your appetite, or fatigue?
PATIENT: Weight? A little bit, maybe. Lost a few pounds when my wife… passed. Didn’t have much appetite after that, you understand? And yes, I get tired easier now. Everything's harder. Used to be able to work all day, no problem. Now I need a nap after just a bit of gardenin’. But that ain't what's botherin’ me the most, you see? It’s not about bein’ tired, it’s about lookin’ like… this. Is there a way to just… tighten things up? Like with… bands or somethin'? I seen things on the television.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no real pain. A little ache in my back sometimes, from bendin' over in the garden. But that's just old age, you understand. Nothin’ serious. I ain’t complainin’ about pain. I’m complainin’ about lookin’ like a deflated balloon! Are we gettin' anywhere with this, or are we just talkin’ in circles? I need somethin' done, not a life story asked for.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you're concerned about age-related changes in your body composition and appearance. While I understand your frustration, it's important to manage expectations. What you’re describing could be due to a number of factors, including muscle loss, decreased skin elasticity, and fat redistribution. Before we discuss potential cosmetic options, I need to do a physical exam to rule out any underlying medical issues. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. A physical exam. Get it over with. But don’t tell me I’m just gettin’ old. I ain't acceptin' that. And hurry it up, will ya? I got things to do. And I want to know what options there are after the exam. Bands, injections, I don’t care. Just fix it. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat and lie back. I'll start with your vital signs, then we'll move on to a general physical assessment. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. I'm noting some decreased muscle mass. Now, let's take a look at your arms and chest. There’s noticeable loss of subcutaneous fat and skin elasticity. Your muscle tone is reduced in all these areas.
