DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Pehrson. Thank you for seeing me. I'm hoping you can help me with a wee bit of paperwork, if you don’t mind. I’m going on a cruise next month, and they require some medical information before I can travel. Just a confirmation of things, really.
DOCTOR: Paperwork. Right. Look, I’ve got a waiting room full of actual patients, but I suppose I can glance over some forms. Just…try to be concise, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. I understand completely. I wouldn’t want to take up too much of your valuable time. It’s mostly just a list of conditions and treatments, and if I’m up-to-date on my… what do you call them… jabs? I had a tetanus one about five years ago, I believe. And a flu shot every year, without fail.
DOCTOR: Five years... okay. Let's just pull up your record… Squiers…Squiers…Ah, here we are. No prior records on file with this clinic. So, you’re telling me no regular doctor, just…jabs when you need them?
PATIENT: That is… mostly correct, Doctor. My husband, bless his soul, always handled the doctor’s appointments. Since he passed… well, I haven’t had much reason to visit regularly. Just the yearly flu shot at the chemist, and the occasional thing if I felt poorly. I did see a doctor about my knee a few years back, when I tripped in the garden, but that was at a different practice entirely. I don't recall the doctor's name, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no history here. Look, Ms. Squiers, this is why regular check-ups are important. Alright, let's just get this cruise paperwork done. Any major medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I have a touch of arthritis in my hands, mostly just a wee bit of stiffness in the mornings. And I get a bit of… indigestion now and then, nothing serious. I used to suffer from migraines, but they’ve been much better since I retired. They were quite debilitating, but they haven’t bothered me in years. I had a hysterectomy twenty years ago, if that’s relevant. I’m otherwise quite fit and healthy, Doctor, for my age.
DOCTOR: Arthritis…indigestion…hysterectomy twenty years ago… Alright. Any medications you’re currently taking for anything?
PATIENT: Just a wee bit of ibuprofen now and then for the arthritis, Doctor. Usually only if it’s a particularly damp day. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the chemist recommended it, as I don’t get out much in the winter. That’s it, really. Nothing regularly, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Squiers, ‘now and then’ isn't a dosage. It's…vague. What strength ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it’s the 200 milligram tablets, Doctor. The standard ones, you get them over the counter. Usually one or two, if I need them. I really don’t take them very often, honestly. I try to manage with hand exercises and warm compresses whenever possible. I'm afraid I'm not very good with remembering specifics, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: 200mg…as needed…Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I enjoy a good bit of shellfish, and I eat most fruits and vegetables without any bother. My husband used to tease me for having an iron stomach! I did have a slight rash once when I used a new hand cream, but I stopped using it immediately, and it cleared up fine. It wasn’t a serious allergy, more of an irritation, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A rash… Alright. Look, Ms. Squiers, this is taking too long. We need to do a quick physical exam just to cover everything, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to comply. I understand you’re very busy. Just let me know what you'd like me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure first. 130 over 80. Not terrible. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Lungs clear. Heart sounds…normal. Any trouble breathing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. I walk up and down the stairs without any trouble, and I manage a good bit of gardening, although bending down is getting a wee bit difficult these days. No shortness of breath, or wheezing, or anything like that. I used to enjoy a good bit of dancing, but I haven’t done that in years.
DOCTOR: Abdomen soft. No tenderness. Alright. Just going to check your reflexes. Normal. Well, everything seems…within normal limits. For someone who doesn't see a doctor regularly.
PATIENT: That’s very reassuring to hear, Doctor. I’m glad everything seems alright. I do try to keep active, as best I can. So, will that be enough for the cruise paperwork, Doctor? I'm hoping to get it sorted before I leave, so I don't have any unnecessary stress.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers, I’ll fill out the form stating you’re generally healthy, no major medical problems, and you take ibuprofen as needed. I strongly recommend you find a regular primary care physician. This is just a band-aid. Here. Get this signed and take it with you. Now, if you'll excuse me…
PATIENT: Oh, thank you very much, Doctor. I appreciate your time and assistance. I’ll certainly consider finding a regular doctor. It’s just been difficult since my husband passed, to be honest. Everything feels a bit… unsettled. I won’t take up any more of your time. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Right. Have a good cruise. Next! .
