DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, well, Doctor… Havird, is it? Look, I haven't got all day. I need a quick sign-off for some… adjustments. Cosmetic surgery. My daughter insisted I get cleared by someone before I go ahead. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: Adjustments, right. Cosmetic surgery. Yes, well, we always want to make sure you're healthy enough for any procedure, even elective ones. It’s my job, you see. Now, just to be clear, what sort of adjustments are we talking about?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s… eyelids. They’re drooping. Makes me look tired, apparently. And old. My daughter says it’ll make me look “fresher.” I don’t know why a man needs to look “fresh,” but here we are. It’s not like I’m doing it for me. It's a quick nip and tuck, that's all. Not expecting a major operation or anything.
DOCTOR: Eyelid surgery… blepharoplasty, as we call it. Alright. And your daughter is the primary reason you're seeking this out?
PATIENT: Yes, she is. She handles all my appointments, you see. Since my… well, since my wife passed, she’s taken over a lot. Good girl, really, but a bit… insistent. Always telling me what’s best. It’s just… I’d like to get this over with and be done with it. Is that alright? Do you need a list of medications or something? I take a little something for my blood pressure, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it’s always good to have someone looking out for you, even if they are a bit insistent. And yes, a medication list would be helpful. And just so I have a full picture, have you had any problems with your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision? Not really. A little blurry when I wake up, but that's just getting old, isn't it? I’ve had glasses for… well, decades, I suppose. The usual. Nothing sudden or alarming. Look, I’m a practical man, Doctor. I’ve spent my life working with terrazzo, you know. Hard physical work. I’m not one for complaining about a few aches and pains. Is this going to take long? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Terrazzo, alright. Physical work. Yes, well, even practical men need a proper check-up before undergoing any procedure. Blurry vision upon waking could be relevant. Do you experience any double vision, or difficulty closing your eyes completely?
PATIENT: Double vision? No. Never had that. And I can close my eyes just fine, thank you very much. They might be a little… slow, perhaps, but they close. Look, I'm telling you, I'm a perfectly healthy 81-year-old man. This is just a little cosmetic thing. My daughter is making a mountain out of a molehill. Are we almost done? I really don't see what all the fuss is about. It's not like I’m asking for a heart transplant.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I understand your frustration. However, even seemingly minor procedures carry risks, and it's my responsibility to assess your overall health. Let's just do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and a brief neurological check. Just a standard procedure. Will that work?
PATIENT: Oh, fine. But make it quick, Doctor. I haven't got all day, you know. Terrazzo doesn't lay itself. And don't poke and prod too much. I’m a sensitive man, despite appearances. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure first. Please extend your arm. And try to relax, Mr. Orwin. It will be quicker if you do. Okay. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and again…
PATIENT: There. Happy? I always had strong lungs. Years of breathing in dust, you know. Builds character. Just get on with it, Doctor. I’ve got a perfectly good lunch waiting for me. I'm not one for wasting time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's just check your reflexes. Please sit back and relax. And finally, just a quick check of your eye movements. Please follow my finger with your eyes… left, right, up, down… Okay. That's all for the physical exam. Everything seems… generally okay, but there are a few things I want to note. Blood pressure is a little elevated, reflexes are slightly diminished, and eye movements are a little slow.
PATIENT: “A few things”? What “things”? I told you, I’m perfectly healthy! A little slow? That’s just age! I’ve worked harder in a week than most doctors do in a year. Look, is this going to prevent me from getting the surgery, or what? I haven’t got time for a long discussion about “things.” My daughter will be furious if I cancel. Just tell me yes or no, Doctor. Yes, I’m cleared, or no, I’m not.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration, but I cannot simply give you a “yes” or “no” answer without proper consideration. Your medical history, combined with these findings, warrants further investigation before I can clear you for elective surgery. The slightly elevated blood pressure and diminished reflexes could indicate underlying cardiovascular issues. The sluggish eye movements could suggest neurological concerns. I recommend a cardiology consult and a neurological evaluation before proceeding. It’s not about preventing you from getting the surgery, it’s about ensuring your safety.
PATIENT: Neurological evaluation? Cardiology consult? Are you serious? This is ridiculous! I came here for a simple sign-off, and now you’re telling me I need a battery of tests? My daughter is going to kill me! Look, Doctor, with all due respect, I think I’ll get a second opinion. This is a complete waste of my time. Just give me the paperwork for the visit. And don't expect me to be coming back. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I understand your decision. Here is the paperwork for today's visit. Please do consider the referrals. Your health is the priority. And please, inform your daughter of my concerns. .
