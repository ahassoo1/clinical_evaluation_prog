DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Quicksey. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been experiencing a rather… persistent pressure in my bladder. It’s become quite bothersome, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent pressure in your bladder for a few weeks. I understand. Can you describe that pressure for me?
PATIENT: It’s… a feeling like I constantly need to go, even when I’ve just gone. Not painful, exactly, but definitely uncomfortable and… distracting. It’s there most of the time, but it seems worse when I’m trying to relax or sleep. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. So, a constant feeling of needing to urinate, even after you've emptied your bladder, and it's more noticeable when you’re relaxing or trying to sleep. How often would you say you're urinating throughout the day, compared to what's normal for you?
PATIENT: Hmm… normally, I would say I go about every three to four hours. But lately, it’s been more like every hour or two, sometimes even less. And the amount… it’s not a large amount each time, if that makes sense. It’s like my bladder is just… constantly signaling me, even when there isn’t much there there, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so an increase in frequency – going every hour or two instead of your usual three to four – and a small amount of urine with each visit. And you describe it as a constant signaling, even when you don't feel full. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… let me see. No, not really the color, I don’t think. And no blood, thankfully. I have noticed it sometimes smells a bit stronger than usual, but I’m not sure if that's just me imagining things. I drink a lot of water, so maybe it's that?
DOCTOR: No change in color or blood, possibly a stronger odor. Drinking a lot of water can certainly affect the smell. Have you experienced any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no pain or burning at all. That’s a relief, at least. It really is just the pressure and the constant feeling of needing to go. It’s… unsettling, more than anything. It's been interfering with my sleep quite a bit. I toss and turn, worrying about it, and then end up having to get up several times during the night.
DOCTOR: I understand. Interrupted sleep is very disruptive. Okay, let’s move on to some other questions. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain recently?
PATIENT: No fever or chills, no. And no lower back pain. Just this… bladder issue. Everything else feels normal, if that makes sense. I haven’t felt generally unwell, just… preoccupied with this constant pressure. My husband has noticed I’ve been a bit more anxious lately, probably because of it. I apologize for rambling.
DOCTOR: No apologies needed at all, Marialena. It’s helpful for me to get a complete picture. You’re not rambling. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever had any urinary tract infections – UTIs – before?
PATIENT: You know, I think I had one when I was younger, maybe in my early twenties? But it was so long ago, and I don’t remember the details very well. It was treated with antibiotics, and I recovered quickly, so it wasn’t a big deal. I haven’t had one since, to my knowledge. I've generally been quite healthy, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible UTI in your early twenties, treated with antibiotics. And generally good health since then. Have you ever had any other medical conditions, like diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, no diabetes or kidney problems. My annual check-ups are always normal. I do have slightly high blood pressure, which my doctor monitors, but it’s well-controlled with medication. Otherwise, I’m pretty straightforward, medically speaking.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And that’s it, really. Just the Lisinopril for my blood pressure, and a multivitamin. Nothing else regularly. I did take some ibuprofen a couple of times last week for a headache, but that was just a one-off thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily, multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed for headaches. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no allergies that I know of. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, and I haven’t had any reactions to medications in the past. I did have a bit of a rash once with a new laundry detergent, but that wasn't a medical allergy, just a sensitivity.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And now, just a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – had problems with their bladder or kidneys?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother did have a few urinary tract infections when she was older, I believe. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had some kidney stones, but that was many years ago. Other than that, I don't recall any major bladder or kidney problems in the family. It’s not something we’ve ever really discussed in detail, to be honest. My aunt had diabetes, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal grandmother with UTIs, paternal grandfather with kidney stones, and an aunt with diabetes. Now, finally, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke, and I never have. I actually have a bit of an aversion to it. My husband used to smoke, but he quit several years ago, thankfully. We both try to live a healthy lifestyle. I drink water regularly, I eat a balanced diet, and I try to get regular exercise.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Do you drink caffeinated beverages, such as coffee or tea?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I drink about two cups of coffee in the morning, usually. And sometimes a cup of tea in the afternoon. I haven't noticed it affecting my bladder, but I’m happy to cut back if you think it might be contributing to the problem. I’m willing to try anything to figure this out.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s good you are proactive about this. Given your history, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen and a gentle pelvic exam, just to rule out any obvious issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Dr. Quicksey. I trust your judgement completely. Please, go ahead. I understand it’s just to rule things out, and I want to get to the bottom of this as much as you do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie back on the examination table, and I’ll begin. I'll start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Your bowel sounds are normal. I’m not detecting any abnormalities in your abdomen. I’m not noticing any obvious tenderness or masses. Your pelvic muscles are normal in tone. I don’t feel any signs of infection. Everything seems normal on the exam, but that doesn't rule everything out. We’ll need to run a urine analysis, and I’d also like to order a complete blood count to rule out infection. I’m also going to order a post-void residual check. That tells us how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate.
PATIENT: That all sounds very thorough, Dr. Quicksey, and I appreciate it. A urine analysis, a complete blood count, and a post-void residual check… yes, that makes sense. Will I be able to do the post-void residual check here in the office, or do I need to go somewhere else? And how long will it take to get the results back? I’m eager to find out what’s causing this pressure.
DOCTOR: We can do the post-void residual check right here in the office. It’s a non-invasive test – you’ll simply urinate as you normally would, and then we’ll use a small handheld device to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It takes just a few minutes. As for the urine analysis and complete blood count, the lab usually takes 24-48 hours to get the results back to us. We’ll call you as soon as we have them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend trying to limit your caffeine intake to see if that makes a difference. Also, avoid bladder irritants such as alcohol, spicy foods, and artificial sweeteners. If the pressure worsens, or you develop any fever or pain, please contact the office immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good. Limit caffeine, avoid bladder irritants… I can definitely do that. And I will contact the office immediately if anything changes. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Dr. Quicksey. It really puts my mind at ease. When would be a good time to schedule that follow-up appointment, assuming the tests don’t reveal anything urgent? Perhaps next week?
DOCTOR: Next week works perfectly. How does Tuesday afternoon at 2:00 PM sound?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:00 PM works wonderfully. Thank you. I appreciate your time, Dr. Quicksey. I feel much better having a plan in place. I’ll see you then. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Or any paperwork I need to fill out?
DOCTOR: No, that’s all for today, Marialena. The nurse will give you instructions for the post-void residual check and the lab order for the urine analysis and complete blood count. Just bring a sample when you come in for that test. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before your appointment. And remember, we’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day!
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Dr. Quicksey. I appreciate your kindness and thoroughness. I will. You have a wonderful day as well.
