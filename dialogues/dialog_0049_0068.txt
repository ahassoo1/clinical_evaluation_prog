DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… my legs, mostly. They’re swelling up. It started after… well, after the cancer stuff. The treatments. It’s not painful painful, just… big. And uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: “Cancer stuff,” you say. Right. And these treatments… were they chemotherapy, radiation, surgery… or a combination?
PATIENT: Oh, um… a little of everything, I think? Chemotherapy for sure, lots of that. And some… the machine, you know? The radiation. I don’t really… remember all the names, to be honest. It was a long time ago, and a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, these things can have lingering effects. And memory issues are… common. So, the swelling… is it in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, mostly. But my right leg… it’s worse. Like, much bigger than the left. It’s hard to get my shoes on, you know? And it feels… heavy. It's been getting worse for maybe a month or so now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month… and the right leg significantly more affected. Do you notice any redness or warmth to the skin on either leg?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, not really red. Warm… maybe a little warmer than usual, but not… burning hot or anything. It’s just puffy, you know? Like a balloon.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any pain in your chest, shortness of breath, or any difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no chest pain. And I can breathe fine. A little tired, maybe, but that's just… me. I don't get short of breath, no. I walk to the market, you know? It's not that bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in the skin on your legs?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… what kind of changes? I mean, it’s a little dry, I guess. Old lady skin, you know? Nothing… cracked or anything. Just… not as smooth as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to do a quick examination of your legs, if you don’t mind. We’ll start with your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your lower extremities. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Yes, yes, of course. This old body doesn’t move like it used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing sounds are clear bilaterally. Heart sounds… regular rhythm, no murmurs detected. Now, let’s take a look at your legs. I’m just checking for tenderness and comparing the size and circumference of both legs. Hmm… as you said, the right leg is significantly larger than the left. I’m also noting some pitting edema – that’s when the swelling leaves an indent when I press on it. It’s more pronounced on the right side. Pulses are present in both feet, but slightly weaker on the right. Do you have a history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Blood clots? Oh dear. I… I don't think so. The doctors would have said, wouldn't they? I had tests, lots and lots of tests. Maybe? I really don't remember. It was all a bit of a blur. But I don't think I’ve ever had a blood clot.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, your chart does indicate you had a DVT – deep vein thrombosis – in your left leg about five years ago. It was treated with anticoagulation at that time. Do you recall that?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh my goodness. Yes… yes, I think so. That awful pain in my calf! I had to take… pills. Thinning the blood, was it? I remember being worried about bleeding, but… yes, that must be it. Five years ago? Time goes so fast.
DOCTOR: Yes, it does. Given your history of DVT and the unilateral leg swelling, it's quite possible this is a recurrence. We need to rule out a current DVT or pulmonary embolism. I’m going to order a Doppler ultrasound of both legs to assess for blood clots, and a D-dimer blood test. We will also order a CT scan of the chest to check for pulmonary embolism. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Oh, um… I don't think so. I've had scans before, and I don't remember anything about allergies. I mean, they gave me something to drink… but I don't think it was dye. I always just told them I had no allergies. Oh, dear. I'm not very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll proceed cautiously, then. I'm also going to start you on a course of compression stockings, Class II, to help reduce the swelling. It’s important to wear them every day, as much as possible. We will review the results of the tests once they are available and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or worsening leg pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Compression stockings… and be careful. Emergency room if it gets worse. That sounds… sensible. How long will it take for the tests?
DOCTOR: The ultrasound should be able to be completed today, within a few hours. The CT scan may take a little longer, perhaps tomorrow morning. I'll have the results sent to me as soon as they're available. I’m going to write you a referral to a vascular specialist for a consultation, regardless of the test results, to further evaluate the circulation in your legs. They can advise you on long-term management. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A specialist… That’s a lot of doctors. Um… will the stockings be uncomfortable? I don't like things too tight, you know. And… will I have to take more pills? I really don’t want to take more pills. Other than that… no, I think that's all for now. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: The stockings should be snug, but not painfully tight. We can adjust the size if they’re uncomfortable. And regarding medication… we’ll see what the test results show. We may or may not need to start any new pills. It's too early to say. I understand your concerns. We will proceed cautiously and only do what is absolutely necessary. I’m going to have the nurse bring you a prescription for the compression stockings and provide you with instructions on how to wear them. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the test results. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with an old lady who doesn’t remember much. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Queener. It's my job. Just try to rest and elevate your legs as much as possible. The nurse will be in shortly with the prescription and instructions. Please take care. And don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. .
