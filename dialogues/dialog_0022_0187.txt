DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Chest… feels funny. And heart… goes fast sometimes. Blood pressure, they said, is… too much. Old man problems, you know? Just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Funny” is a good way to describe it – can you tell me a little more about what “funny” feels like?
PATIENT: Like… a bird flapping inside. Not really flapping, but… pressure. And sometimes, just… boom boom boom. Too fast. It’s annoying. I don’t like it. Is that good enough? I got things to do, you know. Not much time for… feelings.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. "Pressure" and a fast heartbeat – okay. And you mentioned your blood pressure was high, according to someone else?
PATIENT: Yes. Nurse… at the pharmacy. She checked it. Said it was… dangerous. I don’t remember the number. Numbers… they all look the same to me now. Just told me to see a doctor. A waste of time, if you ask me. I feel… okay. Mostly. Just this chest thing.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. Even if you feel mostly okay, it’s good to check things out. High blood pressure can sometimes be silent. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me when you first started noticing this “chest thing” and the fast heartbeat?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Maybe… a week ago? Hard to say. Old man, remember? Things… blur. It comes and goes. When I walk up the stairs, sometimes. Or when my wife yells at me. She yells a lot. Is that important? Just… happens. I don’t make a big deal of it.
DOCTOR: It can be important, yes. Stress can definitely affect things. So, it seems to be related to activity and sometimes when you're feeling stressed. Do you have any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I get tired, sure. I'm eighty-six years old! Tired is normal. No… no dizzy. No pain in my arm. Just… uncomfortable. And the heart… beats fast. That's it. Don't ask me to list a lot of things. I forget things.
DOCTOR: No dizziness or arm pain – that’s good to know. Just the uncomfortable feeling and fast heartbeat with activity and stress. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Wife says I had… something with my water when I was young. But that was a long time ago. And… maybe high cholesterol? They told me to eat less… fat. I like fat. No, nothing serious. I don't remember anything serious. Mostly just… old age. Is that a condition?
DOCTOR: It’s definitely a part of life, Mr. Sobkowicz. It sounds like you may have had a urinary tract infection in the past, and possibly high cholesterol. Do you currently take any medications for anything?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see. Just a little blue pill. For… you know. Helps me sleep sometimes. And my wife makes me take a vitamin. Small white one. That’s it. I don’t like taking pills. Too many chemicals. Makes me feel… funny. Different kind of funny. Not the chest funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for sleep and a vitamin. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental things?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Used to be a soldier, you know? Ate whatever they gave us. No allergies. Dust maybe? Makes me sneeze. But that's not an allergy. That's just… dust. I don't need a list of things I'm allergic to. Waste of time. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you, Mr. Sobkowicz. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Whatever. Just be quick about it. I have things to do. And don't poke me too much. Old bones, you know. They break easily. Get it over with. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this. Please take a deep breath for me… I hear a slightly rapid heart rate, but no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is elevated, 160/95. I also note some mild edema in your ankles. Okay, everything else seems within normal limits for your age, but the elevated blood pressure and rapid heart rate warrant further investigation.
