DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. My name is Dr. Bradlee Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's my foot. It’s been…troubling me for some time now. There's a sore, a bad one, and it won't seem to get better. It hurts when I walk, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. A sore on your foot that’s been persistent and causing pain with ambulation. Could you elaborate on that pain, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Hmm… Well, it’s not a sharp pain, not always. Sometimes it’s just a dull ache, like a heavy feeling. But when I stand up after sitting for a while, or if I try to walk too far, it really hurts. Like… a burning feeling, maybe? And it’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. I don't know exactly where, it's just…there.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, exacerbated by standing and ambulation, with a burning component. Near the toes on the plantar surface… a rather imprecise localization, unfortunately. How long has this been going on, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh dear… plantar surface? You mean the bottom? Yes, that's it, the bottom. And it’s been…a long time. Maybe three, four months now? It started small, I thought it was just a blister, you know, from my slippers maybe. But it didn't go away, and it got bigger, and now it hurts. I tried some ointment, but nothing really helped much.
DOCTOR: Three to four months, initially thought to be a blister, unresponsive to topical treatment. And what kind of ointment did you try, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it was something my daughter brought over. She's a nurse, very good girl. It was in a little tube… a white tube, I think. It smelled a little…herbal? I don't remember the name, I’m sorry. I just put it on like she told me. It didn't make it worse, but it didn't help, you see?
DOCTOR: Unidentified topical agent… insufficient information. Very well. Let's move on. Now, aside from this foot pain, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Hmm. Well, I get more thirsty than I used to, maybe? And I go to the bathroom… more often, I suppose. Especially at night. I just thought I was getting old, you know? But I haven’t been feeling sick, no fever, no chills, just…tired sometimes. And this foot, of course. That's the main thing.
DOCTOR: Increased thirst and nocturia… fatigue. We’ll need to investigate those further, Mr. Stoegbauer. Now, do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well… the doctor told me a long time ago, maybe ten, fifteen years now, that I have the sugar. You know, the…diabetes? That's what she called it. I try to eat right, but it’s hard sometimes. And I take pills for it, I think. My daughter helps me keep track of them. I forget things these days, you see.
DOCTOR: Diabetes… that is important information. And you are currently on oral medication for it, assisted by your daughter. Do you happen to know the name of the medication, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no. I wouldn't have the slightest idea. A little white pill, I think. Sometimes a little yellow one, but mostly white. My daughter fills the little box for me every week, and I just take what she gives me. She knows everything about it. I'm afraid I don't remember the name.
DOCTOR: Unidentified oral hypoglycemic agent… reliance on daughter for medication management. Alright. Let's discuss your past surgical history, if any. Have you had any operations in the past, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Operations… hmm. Let me think. Oh! Yes, a long time ago, when I was a young man, I had my appendix taken out. And…and I had my gallbladder removed, too. That was a bit painful, I remember. But that was… a long, long time ago. Nothing else, I don’t think. Just those two.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy and cholecystectomy… noted. And your family history, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Family history… well, my mother, she had the sugar too, just like me. And my father, he had trouble with his heart when he got older. A lot of heart trouble. My sister, she was healthy as a horse, but she passed away a few years back, not from anything in particular, just… old age, I suppose. It happens.
DOCTOR: Diabetes in mother, cardiac issues in father, sister deceased due to age-related causes… Alright. Now, your social history, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh… well, I’m retired now. I used to work at the preschool, teaching the little ones. I loved that job. Now, I mostly stay home. I like to watch TV, and I like to sit on my lanai and look at the ocean. I don't go out much these days. My wife… she passed away a few years back, and I haven’t been much for socializing since then. I miss her very much.
DOCTOR: Retired preschool teacher, widowed. Limited social activity… I understand. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I don’t think so. I eat everything, pretty much. My wife, she was allergic to shellfish, but I never had any allergies myself. No trouble with any medicines, either. I just take the little white pills my daughter gives me. No allergies. I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Stoegbauer, I would like to conduct a physical examination of your foot, and then a brief general examination. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. I just want this pain to go away.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m going to palpate your foot. Please let me know if anything is particularly tender. Hmm. There is some tenderness here, near the base of your fifth metatarsal. And I observe some erythema and induration. It appears you have a plantar ulcer. It's approximately 1.5 centimeters in diameter. Now, I'm going to check your pulses in your foot. Your dorsalis pedis pulse is present, but somewhat diminished. Your posterior tibial pulse is also present, but weak. Finally, I’ll briefly listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Based on my examination, it appears you have a plantar ulcer, likely exacerbated by diminished circulation. The murmur warrants further investigation, but we'll address that later. It's important to determine the cause of the ulcer and ensure it doesn't become infected. I suspect this is related to your diabetes and potentially some peripheral vascular disease. We'll need to perform some laboratory tests to confirm this. Are you able to provide a urine sample?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. A murmur? I didn’t know anything about that. Diminished circulation… that doesn't sound good. Urine sample… yes, I suppose I can. Where should I… go? I haven’t done that in a long time.
DOCTOR: The bathroom is just over there, Mr. Stoegbauer. There is a specimen cup on the counter. Please try to collect a midstream sample, if possible. I will provide instructions if needed. While you are doing that, I will begin ordering some laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a hemoglobin A1c to assess your diabetes control, and a wound culture to check for infection. After that, we'll need to discuss a potential referral to a podiatrist for wound care and potentially a vascular surgeon to evaluate your circulation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. A podiatrist… and a vascular surgeon? That's… a lot of doctors. But if it will help my foot, then I suppose it's necessary. I'll go and… try to collect a sample now. Midstream…? Oh dear. Please let me know if I'm doing it wrong. I don't want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Stoegbauer. I will be right here if you need assistance. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask for clarification if you are unsure. I will wait for your return.
PATIENT: .
