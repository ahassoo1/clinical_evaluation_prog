DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It's August 2nd, 2025. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. Um, it's my chest. It… hurts a little. Not all the time, but it does hurt. It's kinda weird, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little chest pain. I understand. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: It's… hard to explain. It's not like a bad pain, more like…sore. Like when you use muscles you don't use much. It's… on this side. And sometimes, it feels like it's… inside? Not just on the skin.
DOCTOR: Alright, soreness on your left chest, sometimes feeling deeper than just the muscle. That’s helpful. When did you first notice this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… a couple weeks ago? It started small, and I didn’t really pay attention. It got worse a few days ago, that's when I decided to come. It’s not stopping me from working, but it’s… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of weeks ago, gradually worsening over the last few days. And it’s not interfering with your work, just a general annoyance. Can you describe what makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Well… nothing really makes it better, not that I've noticed. When I'm resting it's not so bad. But when I'm… up on the roof, moving around a lot, it gets worse. Like, when I lift stuff or reach for things. It's harder when I'm tired too.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting helps, exertion and fatigue make it worse. Do you notice any other symptoms when the pain occurs?
PATIENT: No, not really. It just… hurts. No fever, no coughing, no… anything else. It’s just the pain. Sometimes it feels… kinda achy in my shoulder, on the same side. But not always. Is that normal? I don't know much about this stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just the chest pain, sometimes with some aching in the left shoulder. No fever, cough, or other symptoms. That’s good to know. And it's perfectly okay not to know medical terms; that’s what I’m here for. Now, let’s get a bit of your medical background. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like heart problems, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I’ve never really been sick. Just… small colds, sometimes. I work hard, eat okay… I don’t think I have anything. I never went to the doctor much. My wife, she goes when she needs to, but I usually just tough it out. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense. You generally stay healthy and haven’t had many medical issues. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never been in the hospital. No surgeries either. Just… a few stitches when I was a kid, falling out of a tree. Nothing serious. My wife says I’m too stubborn to go to the doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s good you’re here now. Let's talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family—parents, siblings, grandparents—has had any heart problems, lung disease, or other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mom, she had… high blood pressure, I think. She took pills for it. And my grandpa… he died when I was young, but I think it was something with his heart. But I don’t really know much about it. My dad, he's still healthy, as far as I know. He's a strong man, works on his farm all the time. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had high blood pressure, and your grandfather had some kind of heart issue. That's good information to have. And now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't smoke. Never have. I drink… sometimes, a beer with my dinner. Not much. Maybe a couple of times a week. And no, no drugs. Never done that. I need to be strong for work, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, lastly, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing. Just… water. And sometimes, coffee in the morning to wake up. My wife tries to get me to take vitamins, but I forget. I'm terrible with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Just water and coffee. Alright, Mr. Bulaong, thank you for that thorough history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just… try not to poke too much.
DOCTOR: I’ll do my best to be gentle. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Take a deep breath in… and out… Okay, good. Now I'll listen to your back. Everything sounds clear so far, but I'll listen again after you take a few deeper breaths. Next, I'm going to feel your chest to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: It's… a little sore when you press here. Not a bad pain, but I can feel it. It’s kinda like when I’m working and I push too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the same area on your left chest. And now I'll check your pulse in your wrists and ankles. Your pulses feel strong and regular. Finally, I'm going to have you take a few deep breaths while I watch your chest move, just to make sure everything is expanding properly. Alright, everything looks good so far, but the tenderness is something we need to investigate further. I don’t hear or see anything immediately alarming, but based on your history and this quick exam, it could be a few things. It could be a muscle strain, inflammation of the cartilage in your rib cage, or something related to your lungs. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest x-ray. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An x-ray? I… never had one before. Is it… safe? I don’t want any radiation or anything. I've heard things… Is it expensive? I don't have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Bulaong. It’s understandable to be concerned about radiation. The amount of radiation from a chest x-ray is very low, about the same as what you're exposed to naturally from the environment over a few days. It’s considered very safe, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis outweigh the small risk. As for cost, I understand you don’t have insurance. The x-ray will cost around $150 - $200. We can also look into some lower-cost options at other facilities, or see if we have any programs available to help. The x-ray will help us rule out any issues with your lungs or heart, and give us a better idea of what’s causing the pain. Would you like me to proceed with ordering that?
PATIENT: $150…? Okay. That’s… a lot, but I guess I need to know what's wrong. My wife will be mad, but she'll understand. Yeah, go ahead and order the x-ray, Doctor. Let's see what's going on. I just… hope it's nothing serious. Where do I go to get it done?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bulaong. I’ll write you a referral for the x-ray now. The imaging center is just across the street, at 123 Main Street. They usually have appointments available quickly. Here’s the referral and the center’s phone number. Once they’ve taken the x-ray, they’ll send the results to me, and I'll contact you to discuss them. This usually takes 24-48 hours. In the meantime, if your pain suddenly gets worse, you develop a fever, or have any trouble breathing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about the x-ray, the imaging center, or what to expect?
PATIENT: No, sir. I think I understand. Across the street, call them, wait for results. No fever, no trouble breathing. I can remember that. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very well. I appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before we get the results. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
