DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good morning to you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Well, my tummy… it feels… big. And I don't want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to. It's just… not feeling right.
DOCTOR: “Big,” you say. Can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It’s… swollen, I think that's the word. Like it’s full of water, maybe? I don't know. It wasn’t like this before. And…it’s just uncomfortable. Not painful, just…full. And heavy, you know? I used to have a good appetite. Loved my soup. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has your stomach been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That’s a good question. A few weeks, I think? Maybe a month? Time… it goes so quickly, you know? It feels like longer, but I don’t really know. Not a long time, but long enough to bother me. It wasn’t sudden, it just… got bigger slowly.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any other changes besides the fullness and loss of appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think… Oh! I do get tired easier. Used to walk to the store every day, now I need to rest halfway. And…sometimes I feel a little… windy. Excuse me for saying so! Yes, a bit of gas. Not much, but enough to notice. Everything else… I don't know. I just feel… old, I guess. Is that a change?
DOCTOR: Okay. And has there been any change in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh, you mean… going to the bathroom? Well, it's a bit… irregular. Sometimes I go, sometimes I don’t. Not bad, but not like it used to be. A little… harder too, maybe? I drink plenty of tea, though! Does that help? I always thought it did.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nausea… that’s feeling sick to your stomach, right? No, no vomiting. Not sick to my stomach, exactly. Just…not hungry. And sometimes, if I eat too much – which isn’t often anymore – I feel a little…bloated. Like a balloon! But not sick. Never sick. No, no sickness.
DOCTOR: Do you have any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Pain? Well, my knees ache sometimes. But that’s just old age, I think! And my back gets a little stiff, especially when it’s cold. But not like…sharp pain, you know? Just…aches. Nothing major. And no, not anywhere else. Just the usual old lady aches. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Medical history… that’s a long time ago. I think I had the flu a few times, when I was younger. And… oh! I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… I don't really remember much else. I went to the doctor when I needed to, of course. But it was so long ago. I don’t think I have any serious problems. Just…getting old. I wish I could be more help. It was a different time then, you know? Not like now, with all the…tests and things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any surgeries besides your tonsils?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. No, I don’t think so. Just my tonsils, when I was a little girl. That’s all I remember. Maybe…maybe a small thing on my hand, years and years ago? But it wasn't important. Nothing big. No important surgeries. Just the tonsils, I’m pretty sure. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know? It’s like…a sieve. Things just slip through.
DOCTOR: And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh, that's a hard one. My mother… she lived to be a good age, I think. But I don’t remember her being sick much. And my father… he was strong, a farmer. He… They both are gone now, a long time ago. I don’t really remember any special illnesses in the family. Just…ordinary things, I suppose. No one with anything…serious. I wish I could tell you more, but my memory… it’s just not very good anymore. Things slip away, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see… Oh! Just a little something for my knees, sometimes. When they really bother me. It's just… a cream, you rub it on. And… I don’t think that’s all. No, I’m pretty sure that’s it. Just the cream for my knees. I don’t take pills or anything. I try to stay natural, you know? Is that helpful? I really don’t take much.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I eat most things. No problems with food. No problems with…well, anything. I don’t think I have any allergies. I’m pretty lucky that way, I suppose. Is that helpful? I really don’t think so. I’ve always been quite healthy, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A physical exam… I hope it won’t be too… uncomfortable. I’m not as strong as I used to be, you know. But yes, go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart and lungs sound reasonably clear. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is a little swollen, and tender to the touch, but nothing too concerning. No lumps or bumps. Your bowel sounds are a little quiet.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's where it's tender. Down there. It’s not painful, just… uncomfortable. Like a heavy feeling. And quiet, you say? My tummy is quiet? I suppose I haven’t been feeling much… movement lately. Not like before. It's just…different. Is that bad, Doctor? Being quiet? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Given your age, the abdominal tenderness, distention, and decreased bowel sounds, my initial thought is that you may be experiencing constipation or a possible bowel obstruction. It could also be a sign of diverticulitis, but we’ll need some tests to be sure. I’m going to order some blood work and an abdominal X-ray to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Constipation… and… what was the other word? Obstruction? And…diverti-what? Oh dear. Tests… and blood work? That sounds…serious. Is it something bad, Doctor? Am I very sick? I don’t like tests. They make me nervous. But… if you think it’s necessary… yes, alright. Do what you need to do. But please… be gentle.
DOCTOR: It's likely not anything terribly serious, Ms. McConnon. These tests are just to rule out anything concerning. Diverticulitis is an inflammation of small pouches that can form in the colon, and the X-ray will help us see what's going on in your abdomen. The blood work will tell us if there's any sign of infection. I'll write the orders now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and explain the X-ray procedure. It's a very simple procedure, you'll just lie on a table while a technician takes some images. While we wait for the results, I recommend a clear liquid diet and avoiding any strenuous activity. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Clear liquids… and no activity. Alright. I can do that, I think. Soup, then? That sounds nice. But… inflammation? Is that painful, Doctor? Will it hurt? I do get a little windy sometimes, like I mentioned. Maybe that’s it? Perhaps it’s just gas? I really hope it’s nothing serious. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: It's possible, Ms. McConnon, but we need to rule out other possibilities first. While gas can certainly cause discomfort, it doesn’t explain the distention and decreased bowel sounds. That's why we’re doing these tests. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible, and I’ll explain everything to you in detail. In the meantime, try to relax and focus on staying hydrated with clear liquids. The nurse will be in shortly to assist you. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. Just… thank you. For everything. I hope it's nothing bad. I really do. And… Please…be gentle. With the tests, and with me. I’m an old lady, you know. Not as strong as I used to be. Thank you again, Doctor.
