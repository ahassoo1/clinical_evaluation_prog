DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Obarr, welcome. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, to start us off, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Good to meet you. It’s this… feeling full really quick. Like, I haven’t even finished a plate of food, and I feel like I could burst. It's been happening for a few weeks now, and my wife, bless her heart, she’s been worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds concerning. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, about three, maybe four weeks now. It started kinda slow, just noticing I wasn't finishing my meals like I used to. Now it’s… well, it's a real bother. Doesn't matter what I eat, really. Soup, fish, even just a little bit of bannock… fills me up fast.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this fullness accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really pain, no. Sometimes a bit of… discomfort, a little bloated feeling afterwards. And I suppose I haven't been as energetic lately. Just feel a bit tired, you know? Nothing major, but noticeable. My wife keeps telling me I look a bit pale too.
DOCTOR: Okay, bloating and fatigue, and your wife has noticed you looking pale. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – anything different with your stool, or how often you're going?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, actually. I haven’t been going as often. Used to be pretty regular, but now it's… every other day, maybe. And it's not… well, it's harder to pass, if you get my meaning. Sorry to be so blunt.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, it's important information. Harder to pass, and less frequent… Okay. And have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: No blood, thankfully. And weight loss… that’s a good question. I haven’t been trying to lose weight, but my clothes might be a little looser. I hadn't really put it together until you asked. It's hard to say for sure, though. I'm an old man, things shift a bit, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're noticing these changes, though. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and such, but nothing serious. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, that was a bit rough, but I've been pretty healthy otherwise. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothing like that. Just the aches and pains of getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed in your youth, otherwise generally healthy. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 92, so good genes on that side, I suppose. She had a bit of trouble with her stomach later in life, but the doctors never said exactly what it was. My father… he wasn’t around much, so I don’t know much about his health. He passed when I was young. And my brother, he had some trouble with his… well, he had cancer, but that was years ago. Not stomach, though, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with some stomach issues, father's history unknown, brother with cancer . Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My wife doesn’t allow it! And I might have a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but nothing heavy. Just a small glass, maybe a couple of times a week. I'm not much of a drinker, never have been. I prefer a good cup of tea, myself.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, occasional small glass of wine. And are you currently taking any medications, or any supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. And I don't really bother with supplements. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fish and vegetables. My wife makes sure of that. She’s very good at looking after me. She always says a good diet is the best medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. Mr. Obarr, given your symptoms - the early fullness, changes in bowel habits, fatigue, and unintentional weight loss - and your age, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. And I think it's important to order some blood work and possibly a stool test to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. A quick exam and some tests… that's fine with me. I just want to get to the bottom of this. It's been unsettling, not feeling like myself.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s start with the exam. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, then I’ll gently press on it to check for any tenderness. It might be a little uncomfortable, but let me know if anything causes significant pain. "Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are present, though a little diminished. No palpable masses. " "Lymph nodes are not enlarged."
PATIENT: Alright. Not too bad, just a little pressure. Diminished bowel sounds… that doesn't sound good, does it? I just hope it’s nothing too serious. It’s good you're checking everything so thoroughly. What does all this mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's good we’re getting a clearer picture. Diminished bowel sounds can indicate a number of things, Mr. Obarr, and it doesn't necessarily mean something serious, but it is something we need to investigate. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I'm concerned about a few possibilities, including a potential blockage or inflammation in the colon. It could also be something simpler, like a change in diet or a mild infection. To be thorough, I’d like to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , and a stool test to check for any signs of infection or blood. We should also consider a colonoscopy, but let’s start with the blood work and stool test first. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… that sounds a bit… invasive. But if you think it’s necessary, I suppose. The blood work and stool test sound reasonable enough. Let's start with those, then we can talk about the… the colonoscopy later. I trust your judgement, Doctor, but I’m a bit nervous, to be honest. How long will it take to get the results back?
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Mr. Obarr. A colonoscopy isn’t the most pleasant procedure, but it’s the most definitive way to assess your colon and rule out any serious problems. We can definitely discuss it further once we have the results of the initial tests. The blood work should be back within 24-48 hours. The stool test may take a little longer, about 3-5 business days. Once I have the results, I’ll give you a call to discuss them and schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I'm a little worried, but I feel better knowing we’re taking steps to figure things out. I’ll keep an eye on things, and I’ll call if anything changes.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, we’re going to get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, Mr. Obarr.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
