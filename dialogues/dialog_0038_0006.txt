DOCTOR: Good morning, Jeannemarie. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… well, I have been coughing up some blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come and see what is happening. It’s not… a lot, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Coughing up blood, even a small amount, is definitely something we need to investigate. It's good you came in. To help me understand what's going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it started maybe three days ago? At first, I just thought it was a normal cough, you know, like a cold. But then… I saw the blood. It’s usually with my cough first thing in the morning. Not every time, but mostly then. It’s… bright red. And not a huge amount, like I said. Maybe a teaspoon? Is that… a good way to describe it? I’m sorry, I don’t really know how much is… a lot.
DOCTOR: No, a teaspoon is a perfectly good description, thank you. It helps me get a sense of the amount. And bright red blood is also useful information. So, it started three days ago, mostly in the morning, about a teaspoon’s worth each time. Have you been having any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Yes. Um… I have been a little tired, more than usual. And a small fever, I think. Not very high, but enough to feel warm. Also, maybe a little… short of breath when I walk up the stairs. It is not so bad, but I notice it. I am usually very active, so that is different for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, a low-grade fever, and some shortness of breath with exertion. That's helpful. Now, have you had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. I have had colds, of course, but nothing like this. And I have never coughed up blood before. It is… very worrying. I lost my husband last year, and I am usually quite healthy. I just want to know what is happening, if it is something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jeannemarie, and it's completely reasonable to be worried. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it's good you're taking care of your health now. We’ll certainly get to the bottom of this. Let’s go through some of your medical history. Do you have any past medical problems – things like asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I had the flu a few times, like everyone, but nothing serious. And I broke my arm when I was a child, but that healed completely. I don’t have any long-term problems. I was always very healthy, until now. I try to eat well and exercise regularly. My husband… he always said I was too active!
DOCTOR: It sounds like you generally have been very healthy, which is good. And I’m sorry to hear about your arm, and about your husband. Have you ever had any surgery?
PATIENT: No, never any surgery. I have had all my vaccinations, of course, and regular check-ups with my doctor before, but nothing like… cutting. I don’t like hospitals very much. It reminds me of… well, never mind.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, you don’t need to share anything you’re not comfortable with. No surgery, that's good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um… my mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had some kind of heart problem when he was older. Nothing too serious, I don’t think. And my brother… he has allergies, mostly just hay fever. I don’t have any allergies myself, though. I am not sure if that is helpful? I am not very good with remembering family history.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, you’ve given me some useful information. High blood pressure in your mother and a heart problem in your father are worth noting. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. And I have never smoked. My husband… he used to smoke, but he stopped many years ago. He said it was very bad for him. I always told him so!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, not really. I have a small glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. But not very often. Maybe once a month? It’s not a habit, I don’t really enjoy it very much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I am not taking any medications. I try to stay healthy without them, if possible. Just vitamins sometimes, a multivitamin. Nothing else. Is that everything, Doctor? I hope it is not anything too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, just a multivitamin. That’s very helpful, thank you. Alright, Jeannemarie. Thank you for answering all those questions so thoroughly. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take your temperature. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Alright, if you could just sit back and relax. Okay, take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Alright. Your heart sounds are regular, but I am noting a slightly elevated heart rate. Blood pressure is 138/85. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. Temperature is 99.8 Fahrenheit. A low-grade fever, as you mentioned. I'm also going to gently feel your neck for any swollen lymph nodes… everything feels normal here. Ears look clear. Okay, everything seems fairly normal on initial examination, but the slightly elevated heart rate and the low-grade fever, combined with the blood you've been coughing up, do warrant further investigation. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work. The X-ray will help us see if there's anything going on in your lungs, and the blood work will help us check for infection and other potential problems. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best to find out what is happening. A chest X-ray and blood work… I can do that. I just hope it is not anything too serious. When will I get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Jeannemarie. We're taking the necessary steps to figure out what's going on, and hopefully, it's something easily treatable. The lab usually takes about 24-48 hours to get the blood work results back. The X-ray results are usually available within a few hours. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they come in. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest and drinking fluids. If you experience any increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that is everything, Doctor. You have explained everything very clearly. Rest and fluids… and I will go to the emergency room if it gets worse. Thank you very much for your help. I feel… a little better just knowing we are trying to find out what is happening. When should I leave?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jeannemarie. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. It's good you're taking this seriously. You can head out whenever you’re ready. My nurse will come by to give you the paperwork for the X-ray and blood work. She’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results once they come in. I'm also going to put a note in your file about your husband and your anxiety regarding hospitals, so the staff is aware and can be extra sensitive to your needs. Is there anyone you’d like me to notify about this visit?
PATIENT: Oh, that is very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. No, I don’t have anyone to notify. I am mostly on my own now. Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I will wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jeannemarie. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. We're here to support you. Alright, take care.
