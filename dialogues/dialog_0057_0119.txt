DOCTOR: Good morning, Jinnie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… rather unpleasant, to be frank. It’s about… a personal matter. A man’s personal matter, actually. Though I am the one having to deal with it.
DOCTOR: I understand. These things can be difficult to discuss, so please feel comfortable sharing as much or as little as you're comfortable with. Perhaps you could start by telling me what's been going on?
PATIENT: It’s… a discharge. Yes. A rather nasty discharge. It started a few weeks ago, I suppose. Not immediately alarming, mind you, just… concerning. And it’s been getting… more noticeable. Honestly, it’s quite embarrassing. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't. It's simply… not normal, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it's certainly not normal, and you did the right thing by coming in to get it checked out. It’s good you're addressing it. A change in discharge can indicate a number of things, and we want to figure out what’s going on. When you say a few weeks ago, can you recall roughly how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It was… after the garden club luncheon, I believe. Yes, definitely after that. So, perhaps three weeks? Maybe a little longer. It’s difficult to be precise, you understand. I don’t spend a great deal of time… inspecting myself, generally. It simply isn’t something one does.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. So, roughly three weeks. And can you describe the discharge to me?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… it’s not like water, certainly. It’s… thicker. And yellowish. Not a bright yellow, more… a sort of faded, unpleasant yellow. And… there's an odour. A rather… fishy odour, I’m afraid. Not overwhelming, but definitely present. It's most noticeable after… exertion, shall we say. Or after a warm bath. It's simply dreadful.
DOCTOR: Okay, thicker, yellowish, with a fishy odor, more noticeable after exertion or a warm bath. Thank you for being so descriptive, Jinnie. That helps a lot. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this discharge?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… a little discomfort. Not pain, exactly. More like… a burning sensation. When… well, during. And after. Though it doesn’t last long. Just a brief stinging. And… I’ve been feeling rather… tired lately. But honestly, who isn't tired these days? It could be anything. The weather, the price of groceries… It’s hard to say. I haven't been running a fever, if that's what you're thinking. I would know if I had a fever.
DOCTOR: Burning sensation during and after, and some fatigue. Good to know. Have you had any changes in your urinary habits?
PATIENT: Urinary… habits? What precisely do you mean? I go to the bathroom when I need to, naturally. More or less the same as always, I suppose. Though… perhaps I have been going a little more frequently. But I drink a lot of water, you see. It's good for the complexion. I wouldn't want to become… dehydrated. Is that what you're asking about?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I was asking about. Increased frequency is helpful to know. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Absolutely not. I’ve always been a very healthy woman. I watch my diet, I get plenty of rest, and I’m very careful about… exposure. I take my Vitamin D, of course. My mother always said, "A healthy body is a happy body." I had a touch of the flu last winter, but nothing serious. Just a little sniffle and a sore throat. That was all. No chronic conditions whatsoever. I don't believe in coddling oneself, you see. One must be strong.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, I don’t believe so. Nothing major, certainly. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I think. But that was so long ago, it hardly counts. And… a wisdom tooth removed, perhaps? It’s all rather hazy. It was a long time ago, and I don’t make a habit of dwelling on unpleasantness. Definitely nothing recent. No, no surgeries to speak of.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and possible wisdom tooth extraction, both a long time ago. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well… I've always found shellfish a bit… disagreeable. But I wouldn’t call it an allergy, precisely. More of a… dislike. It disagrees with my stomach, you see. And I had a rather unfortunate reaction to a perfume once. A rash, it was. But that was years ago, and it was a very cheap perfume. So, no, I don't have any serious allergies. I’m a fairly robust constitution, you see. I can tolerate most things.
DOCTOR: Okay, dislike of shellfish and a past rash from perfume. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just my Vitamin D, of course. And… I take a little something for my arthritis. Just when it flares up, you see. It's a mild one. Ibuprofen, I believe. Just a couple of tablets when my knuckles get a bit stiff. And occasionally, a laxative. Just when… well, you understand. Nothing regular. I try to avoid medications whenever possible. They can't be good for you, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Vitamin D daily, ibuprofen PRN for arthritis, and laxatives occasionally. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members—parents, siblings, or children—who have had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. My family… a rather unfortunate lot, if I’m honest. My mother, bless her soul, had diabetes. A very unpleasant illness. She was quite frail towards the end. And my brother, he had heart trouble. Very sudden, it was. A shock to us all. My father was… remarkably healthy, actually. A sturdy man. As for siblings, well, I don't really keep in touch with my sister. She made some… questionable life choices. So, I can't say much about her health. A sad state of affairs, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with diabetes, brother with heart trouble. Now, let's talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I find such habits… deplorable. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I find alcohol… rather vulgar, to be honest. I prefer a nice cup of chamomile tea. And as for recreational drugs… the very idea! I’m a respectable woman, you see. I’ve always led a very… temperate life. I find that moderation in all things is the key to good health. Really, it’s quite shocking that you even ask.
DOCTOR: Of course. I apologize for asking. And finally, I'd like to ask about your sexual history, if you don’t mind. This is important for understanding the potential causes of your symptoms. I understand this can be a sensitive topic, and you only need to share what you're comfortable with. Are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Good heavens! I… I hardly think that's relevant! A woman of my age…! Really, Doctor, I am quite taken aback. I… I lead a very private life. I find that personal matters are best kept… personal. I fail to see how my… intimate affairs could possibly relate to a discharge. It's simply… inappropriate. I thought you were a professional. I would like to stop this line of questioning immediately. This is simply… unseemly.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to be upset. I apologize sincerely. It was inappropriate of me to ask, and I should have been more considerate. I was attempting to gather a complete medical history, but I overstepped. Please accept my apologies. We can absolutely stop this line of questioning. Now, let's proceed with a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will help me better understand what might be causing your symptoms. We can focus on a pelvic exam, but only if you are comfortable. We can also discuss some initial tests, like a urine sample and a swab, to check for infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Well… a urine sample, I suppose. That seems reasonable. And a… swab. Very well. But I insist on a female nurse present during the… examination. I’m simply not comfortable with a male physician… poking around. And I would like a very thorough explanation of everything you find. I don't want any surprises. And… please be gentle. This is all very… distressing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I completely understand. We will absolutely have a female nurse present during the exam, and I will explain everything I am doing and finding as we go. I will be as gentle as possible, and we will go at your pace. I'll just excuse myself for a moment to arrange for the nurse and gather the necessary supplies. Please just sit here and change into the gown I'll leave for you. I'll be right back.
