DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Muscle weakness, like the chart says. It’s…well, it’s been getting worse lately. I’m not a fan of wasting time, so I figured I'd just tell you the main thing.
DOCTOR: “Wasting time,” you say. Efficiency is admirable, I suppose. Very well. “Muscle weakness.” Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific…right. Okay. It’s mostly in my legs, feels like they just…give out sometimes. Not all the time, thankfully. But lifting things, even walking up stairs…it's getting harder. And it feels…heavy, you know? Like I’m dragging weights.
DOCTOR: "Heavy," yes. Vague descriptors are…unhelpful. When did this begin?
PATIENT: Unhelpful, I get it. Sorry. It started…maybe six months ago? Gradual, at first. Thought it was just getting old, honestly. But it’s definitely not getting better, and now it’s…worrying. I don’t know exactly when it started, it just sort of…was there one day.
DOCTOR: "Sort of was there one day." Hmm. And has anything specific happened around the time it began?
PATIENT: Specific… let me think. No, not really. Work’s been the same. No accidents, no big changes at home… I did help my cousin move some furniture around that time, but nothing that heavy, just boxes and a small sofa. Honestly, that’s all I can think of. It’s frustrating because I can’t pinpoint anything.
DOCTOR: Very well. And you mentioned it’s in your legs. Is it both legs equally affected?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much both. It’s…hard to tell if one is worse, exactly. They both feel weak and heavy. It's not like one leg is completely gone, but they both just…aren’t what they used to be. Makes it hard to stand for long periods too, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Not what they used to be.” Right. And do you experience any numbness, tingling, or pain in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. No pain either, thankfully. Just…weakness and that heavy feeling. It's weird. It doesn’t hurt to move them, they just…don’t want to sometimes. Like they’re tired all the time, even when I’ve been resting.
DOCTOR: Fatigue is a common symptom of… many things. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I’ve been a little more tired overall, yeah. But I work long hours, so that could just be that. I haven’t really noticed anything else. No fever, no changes in weight, no… I don’t know, anything obvious. I'm generally pretty healthy, if that matters. I try to eat okay, even with the job.
DOCTOR: “Generally healthy.” Let us not rely on generalizations. Now, I need to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. Had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, measles…but nothing major. Never been hospitalized, never had any surgeries. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. My family… we don't have a lot of health issues, really. It's why this is so confusing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. I can eat anything, take any medicine. That's one less thing to worry about, I guess. I haven’t had a reaction to anything ever. I wish it was just something simple, like an allergy. This weakness… it's unsettling.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the table. We’ll start with a neurological assessment. I need you to cooperate fully, and please inform me if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Sounds good. Just want to get this figured out. Let me know if you need me to do anything special. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes… 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes… 2+ bilaterally as well. Now, can you flex your feet upwards against my resistance?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can. It’s… harder than it used to be, though. It takes a bit more effort, and doesn't feel as strong. It's not painful, just…weak. How's that?
DOCTOR: Moderate resistance. Now, can you flex your feet downwards against my resistance?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can do that too. That’s… even harder, actually. It feels like my muscles are just giving out, even though I’m trying as hard as I can. Is that what you're looking for? It's definitely weaker than it should be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like you to sit up and I’ll check your strength in your upper extremities as well. Please lift both arms straight out in front of you. Can you hold that position?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can hold them… for now. It’s not easy, to be honest. They’re already starting to shake a little. Is that okay? I’m trying my best.
DOCTOR: Moderate resistance, slight tremor noted. Now, please push your hands against mine. I'm going to resist.
PATIENT: Okay, I’m pushing… it’s… harder than it looks. It feels like my arms are just… giving out. They're definitely weaker than they should be. How’s that? I’m trying to push as hard as I can. It’s just…not very much.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to check your gait. Please stand up and walk a few steps forward, then a few steps backward. I need to observe your walking pattern.
PATIENT: Okay… walking forward… and back. It feels…different. Like I have to concentrate harder just to keep my balance. And it feels…stiff. I don't usually walk like this. Is that what you're looking for? It’s definitely not normal.
DOCTOR: Yes. Thank you. Please sit back down. Based on my examination, and your history, you present with weakness in both upper and lower extremities. Your gait is slightly abnormal, and there is noticeable weakness upon resistance. We need to rule out several possibilities. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a Vitamin D level. Additionally, I want to order an MRI of your lumbar spine and a nerve conduction study.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds like a lot. MRI and nerve study… is that…serious? I just thought it was muscle weakness. What are we looking for exactly? And how long will it take to get the results? I appreciate you running tests, but I’m already getting a little worried.
DOCTOR: “A little worried,” you say. These tests are standard procedure to rule out a number of potential causes. We need to ascertain if there is any underlying neurological issue, muscle disorder, or vitamin deficiency contributing to your symptoms. The MRI will visualize your spinal cord to identify any structural abnormalities. The nerve conduction study assesses the function of your peripheral nerves. As for the timeline, the blood work should be available within 24-48 hours. The MRI and nerve study will likely take a few days to schedule, and the results will take approximately a week to be processed. Here are the requisitions for the blood work, MRI and nerve conduction study. Please schedule these as soon as possible. I will review the results once they are available, and we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A week… okay. That feels like a long time to wait, honestly. No, I don’t think so… not right now. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Like, should I be resting? Or avoiding any certain activities? I don’t want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: Rest is advisable, yes. Avoid strenuous activities that exacerbate your weakness. Do not attempt to lift heavy objects. And most importantly, do not attempt to self-diagnose or self-treat. I understand your anxiety, Mr. McKinnon, but we must proceed systematically. We will gather the necessary information, and then we will formulate a plan. I have other patients waiting. Please schedule these tests immediately. We will discuss the results next week. Good day. .
PATIENT: Okay… right. I’ll schedule them. Thank you, Doctor. .
