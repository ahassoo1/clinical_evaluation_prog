DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… fine. I suppose. It’s this discoloration, really. It’s quite bothersome, and frankly, I expect a proper explanation. It’s on my hands, mostly. And it's not something I just noticed, you know. It’s been… developing.
DOCTOR: Developing… alright. And where exactly on your hands are you noticing this discoloration?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not all over, Doctor. That would be… dreadful. It’s mostly on the backs of my hands, and around my knuckles. And it’s not even a consistent color, you see. It's… patchy. A sort of brownish hue, but with lighter spots. It’s quite unattractive, frankly. It wouldn’t be so bad if it were even, but it’s just… messy.
DOCTOR: Patchy, brownish hue… I understand. And how long would you say this has been developing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It started… well, it was before the holidays, certainly. November, maybe? Yes, November of last year. It was subtle at first, barely noticeable, really. I thought it was just the changing light, or perhaps a trick of the eye. But it’s… progressed since then. Steadily, I assure you. Not overnight, mind you. I'm not prone to exaggeration.
DOCTOR: So, starting around November of last year, and gradually worsening… Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the discoloration?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, no, not really. Not that I’ve noticed. My hands don’t… ache, or itch, or anything dramatic like that. They feel perfectly normal, honestly. Just… look rather unpleasant. I haven't been feeling unwell, if that’s what you mean. No fatigue, no fever, no… odd bumps. Nothing like that. Just this… blemish. It’s a purely cosmetic issue, as far as I can tell. Although, one can never be too careful, can one?
DOCTOR: Alright, no other symptoms. That’s good to know. Have you tried anything to treat it yourself?
PATIENT: Treat it myself? Doctor, really. As if I would. I’m an archivist, not a… a dermatologist. I’ve used hand cream, of course. A very good, expensive hand cream. But that hasn’t done a thing, naturally. It’s a proper medical issue, this, and requires proper medical attention. I certainly wouldn't slather some random ointment on it. That sounds… barbaric.
DOCTOR: Of course, you're right to seek medical attention. Let's take a closer look. Would you mind extending your hands for me, palms up and then palms down?
PATIENT: There you are. Be gentle, please. I have delicate skin. And do try to be thorough. I want to be certain we don’t miss anything. It's rather subtle in some places, you know. A keen eye is required. It’s not a uniform discoloration, as I've mentioned. Mostly on the backs of my hands, but it is creeping towards my wrists now. I noticed it this morning. It's quite distressing, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see what you mean. Patchy hyperpigmentation, some areas slightly raised. It doesn’t appear inflamed, and your skin feels normal to the touch. No noticeable tenderness. It does seem to be… extending, as you said. Have you been spending a lot of time outdoors recently?
PATIENT: Outdoors? Doctor, are you suggesting…sunspots? Honestly. I work indoors, surrounded by documents. I haven’t seen proper sunlight in… well, months, probably. I do walk in the garden occasionally, but I always wear gloves. Proper gardening gloves. I'm not one to expose my hands needlessly. It's the documents that are the problem, I suspect. The age of them, the chemicals they use for preservation… Something in the archives is causing this, I'm certain of it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so limited sun exposure and potential contact with chemicals in the archives. That’s helpful. Just to be thorough, let's review your medical history. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Let me see… I have a slight sensitivity to dust, I suppose. It makes me sneeze, occasionally. And I can’t tolerate shellfish, no. It’s… unpleasant. Beyond that, no. No known drug allergies, no reactions to any medications. I'm generally a very healthy person, you know. I watch what I eat, I exercise… within reason, of course. I’m not an athlete. Mostly walking. And I get my annual check-ups. Regular as clockwork. My doctor is very pleased with me. Although, she doesn’t deal with… discoloration. That's why I'm here, with you.
DOCTOR: Alright, dust and shellfish allergies. No drug allergies. And you mentioned you take medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just a small dose of levothyroxine, for my thyroid. It’s been stable for years, though. My endocrinologist says it’s nothing to worry about. A very small dose, really. And I take a multivitamin, of course. Just a standard one. Nothing else. I don't believe in self-medicating. It’s quite foolish, really. I leave that to the professionals.
DOCTOR: Okay, levothyroxine and a multivitamin. That’s good to know. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have a family history of skin conditions?
PATIENT: Skin conditions? Hmm. Let me think… My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… eczema, I believe. When she was a child. It cleared up eventually. And my uncle, I think, had some sort of… mole that needed to be removed. But that was decades ago. Nothing serious. Beyond that, no. No known history of… anything particularly concerning. Mostly healthy people, my family. We take pride in our good health. We eat a lot of vegetables, you know. And we stay out of the sun. Unlike some people.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of eczema in your grandmother and a mole removal in your uncle. And you mentioned you work as an archivist?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. At the Historical Society downtown. It’s… demanding work, actually. A lot of delicate handling, a lot of research. And a lot of… old paper. Which, as I've said, I suspect is the root of this problem. The chemicals they use for preservation, the age of the documents… It can’t be good for one’s skin, can it? I’ve been meaning to speak to the director about proper ventilation, but… well, one thing leads to another, you know. It’s always busy. And now this discoloration… It’s rather inconvenient, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. Thank you for providing all of that information. It's very helpful. Based on what you've told me, and my examination, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing the discoloration. Several things could be contributing - the chemicals you handle at work, potential sun exposure, even a mild allergic reaction. However, given the gradual progression, and the lack of other symptoms, a few possibilities come to mind. One is contact dermatitis, an inflammation of the skin caused by irritants. Another is melasma, which can be triggered by hormonal changes or sun exposure. It could also be a pigmentary change related to your thyroid condition. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. A complete blood count to rule out any underlying issues, and a skin biopsy to examine the pigment cells and identify the cause of the discoloration. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? A biopsy? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds rather… drastic. I was hoping for a simple explanation, perhaps a cream, or a change in hand soap. A biopsy sounds… invasive. And frankly, I'm not certain I’m comfortable with it. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t we try something less… aggressive first? Perhaps a different hand cream? Or some sort of protective gloves? I do have a rather busy schedule, you know. And I don't relish the thought of… excising bits of my skin. It seems a bit excessive, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Bartock. You're right, a biopsy is more invasive. However, without knowing the cause of the discoloration, it’s difficult to recommend the most effective treatment. Simply trying creams or gloves might not solve the problem, and could even delay a proper diagnosis if it's something more serious. We could start with a patch test to see if you're reacting to any common irritants. That’s a less invasive option. We also could try a prescription-strength topical cream with corticosteroids to see if it reduces the inflammation. However, if those don’t provide improvement after a few weeks, a biopsy would be the next step to rule out other possibilities. Would you be comfortable starting with a patch test and the topical cream?
PATIENT: A patch test… and a cream. That sounds… reasonable. Less drastic, certainly. And if it doesn’t work… well, we can discuss the biopsy again. But I must say, Doctor, I'm not keen on the idea. I’d prefer to exhaust all other options first. What kind of cream are we talking about? Is it… greasy? I need something that won’t interfere with my work. I handle delicate documents, you know. A slippery cream would be disastrous. And how long would I need to use it for? I don’t want to be slathering anything on my hands indefinitely.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll exhaust all other options first. The cream I’m thinking of is a mid-potency topical corticosteroid. It's not overly greasy, but it does require consistent application twice daily for about four to six weeks to see if it's effective. We can discuss the specific brand, and I can recommend a formulation that’s less likely to leave a residue. As for the patch test, it involves applying small amounts of common allergens to your back for 48 hours, then having a dermatologist evaluate the reaction. It's generally well-tolerated, and can help identify if you’re sensitive to any specific substances. If neither of these measures provide improvement, then we can discuss the biopsy in more detail, and address any concerns you may have. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Alright. A patch test and the cream. Very well. But I expect a detailed explanation of everything, Doctor. The ingredients in the cream, the potential side effects, the purpose of the patch test… I want to be fully informed. And I need a clear schedule. When will I need to come in for the patch test? How long will it take? And how long will I need to wait to see the results? I have a rather busy schedule, you know. I can't simply drop everything on a moment’s notice. I expect a certain level of efficiency, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I completely understand. I'll write down everything for you. The cream is a betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% ointment. It's a mild corticosteroid, and the potential side effects are usually minimal – some temporary redness or itching at the application site. I’ll also give you a detailed information sheet with a full list of side effects. As for the patch test, we can schedule it with the dermatologist next week. You’ll need to come in on Tuesday afternoon, and the test itself will take about 30 minutes. You’ll then return on Thursday for the dermatologist to evaluate the results. The whole process takes about two days. I'll also provide you with a referral to Dr. Anya Petrova, a highly-regarded dermatologist in the area. Her contact information is on this sheet. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Dr. Petrova… Tuesday and Thursday. Yes, that should be manageable. Although, I’ll need to rearrange a few meetings. I trust Dr. Petrova is thorough? I don't want a rushed examination. And she understands the importance of delicacy, I presume? Alright, Doctor. I suppose we’ll proceed with this. But I expect regular updates. And if this doesn't work, I’m not keen on further… invasive procedures. I’m an archivist, not a medical experiment. Do we understand each other?
DOCTOR: We absolutely understand each other, Ms. Bartock. Dr. Petrova is an excellent dermatologist, known for her thoroughness and meticulous approach. She's very patient and will take the time to address all of your concerns. I will certainly keep you updated on the progress and we’ll discuss all available options at each stage. I will also document your preferences regarding invasive procedures and we won't proceed with any tests or treatments without your full consent and understanding. Here is the referral information, the prescription for the cream, and the information sheet. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… patience. Although, I must say, I'm not entirely optimistic. But we shall see. I shall schedule an appointment with Dr. Petrova. And I shall try this cream. But I remain skeptical. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Bartock. I understand your skepticism, and I hope we can find a solution that works for you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns along the way. Have a good day as well.
