DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, it’s…well, it’s the job. It’s simply dreadful. I’ve been a teacher for…a very long time. Longer than you’ve likely been alive, I suspect. And it’s…wearing on me. Though what exactly is “wearing on me,” I couldn’t precisely articulate. It’s just…a general unpleasantness. I hope we can make this quick. I have papers to grade, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. A general unpleasantness. And this has been going on for…?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long…? That’s…difficult. Years, certainly. Several years. Perhaps…five? Six? Time rather blurs when one is surrounded by…students. Honestly, the youth of today. No respect for proper grammar, let alone…discipline. It’s a tragedy, really. But, to answer your question, a long time. A very long time. And it’s only getting…more pronounced, I suppose.
DOCTOR: So, this feeling of…unpleasantness, is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant? No, thankfully. That would be unbearable. It…ebbs and flows, like a particularly unpleasant tide. Worse during grading periods, naturally. And whenever I have to deal with…administrative matters. Honestly, the paperwork alone is enough to drive a man to distraction. It’s…a weight. A persistent, nagging weight. And it’s…growing, I believe. More frequent, more…intense.
DOCTOR: And this "weight," does it manifest in any particular way?
PATIENT: Manifest? Doctor, really. You want me to describe feelings? I’m a librarian, not a…a poet. It's…a lack of enthusiasm, I suppose. A certain…disinclination. I find myself…irritated more easily. Short-tempered. And I sleep poorly. Though whether that’s the job, or simply the general decline of age, I couldn’t say. It's just...everything feels like an effort. A monumental, pointless effort.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or perhaps any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Appetite? Well, I eat. Certainly. Though perhaps not with the…gusto of my younger years. As for weight loss…I haven't been precisely weighing myself, Doctor. I have more important things to occupy my time than measuring my…circumference. Though my trousers do feel a little looser, if that’s what you’re asking. But that could be the dry cleaning, quite frankly. They’ve been shrinking everything lately, the dreadful service.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any difficulty with your memory, or concentration?
PATIENT: Now there’s a question. Memory…well, one forgets things, naturally. At my age, Doctor, it's practically a requirement. Names escape me. Dates…certainly. Though I assure you, it doesn’t interfere with my professional duties. I still manage the library quite efficiently, thank you very much. Concentration…perhaps not as acute as it once was. Distractions are…more distracting, if you follow. But it’s nothing to worry about. I simply require…a quiet environment. Which, with students running about, is rarely available.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I refuse to poison my system with those…concoctions. A bit of chamomile tea now and then, if I’m feeling particularly…agitated. Allergies? Dust, I suppose. Who isn’t allergic to dust? Beyond that, no. Perfectly healthy, for a man of my age, thank you very much. Though this job…it’s a different matter entirely. It’s a chronic ailment, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schlatterer. Based on what you've told me—and I understand you find this…unpleasant—it could be a number of things. It sounds like there’s a component of stress and potentially some mild depressive symptoms. While I don’t want to jump to conclusions, it’s worth exploring further. I'd like to order a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying physical causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. And I also want to do a brief cognitive assessment, just to get a baseline. It’s a simple test, nothing to worry about. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A blood panel? A cognitive assessment? Doctor, with all due respect, I came here to discuss my workplace stress, not to be treated like a…a specimen. I assure you, my mind is perfectly sharp. And frankly, I haven’t time for such…frivolous examinations. I have papers to grade, you know. And a library to manage. I simply wanted a note, perhaps, for my administrator? Something to explain my…reduced efficiency? Is that so much to ask? This is becoming rather…cumbersome.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, with all due respect, a proper medical evaluation requires gathering information. I can certainly write a note stating you're experiencing stress, but that doesn’t address the underlying cause, and could potentially be overlooking something serious. I am concerned about your well-being. However, I will not simply write a note without attempting to rule out other possibilities. If you are unwilling to proceed with basic tests, I am happy to refer you to another physician. But I strongly advise against dismissing these concerns. Do you want me to proceed with the blood panel and cognitive assessment, or would you prefer a referral?
PATIENT: This is…preposterous. Utterly preposterous. Very well. Very well. If it will get you off my back. But I assure you, it will be a waste of time and perfectly good resources. A blood panel… honestly. Fine. Do your tests. But I expect a swift conclusion. And a note. A detailed note, explaining my diminished capacity due to…workplace demands. And please, do hurry. My students are quite capable of causing…havoc, when unsupervised.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. And we can do the cognitive assessment while you wait. It will take about fifteen minutes. I’ll also have the nurse bring you a questionnaire about your recent mood and sleep patterns. It's standard procedure, Mr. Schlatterer. Please just try to answer honestly. It will help me get a clearer picture of what’s going on. And yes, I will write a note for your administrator, once we have some results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Absolutely none. Just get it over with. The sooner this is finished, the sooner I can return to my…duties. And do try to find a comfortable chair for me. My back isn't what it used to be. Honestly, the indignity of it all.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be with you momentarily. Please let her know if you have any discomfort. .
