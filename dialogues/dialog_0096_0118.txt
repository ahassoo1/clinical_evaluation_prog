DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I'm Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Hmm… yes. Well, it’s about a certification, you see. Something to do with my… work. It’s all rather bureaucratic, if you don’t mind my saying so. I believe it requires an examination of… well, either my hearing or my sight. Or perhaps both? Honestly, the paperwork was terribly confusing.
DOCTOR: A certification for work, requiring a medical exam?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. It's… rather new, this requirement. One of those things the younger generation insists upon, I suppose. Efficiency and all that. Though I fail to see what either my ears or my eyes have to do with… well, with what I do. It's all a bit silly, really. Do you need me to explain further? I confess, I didn’t pay much attention to the details when they sent the notice.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s start with the basics then. To be sure, is this certification for a specific job, or is it a general requirement for something else?
PATIENT: Hmm. A specific job… yes, I believe so. Though, what the job is… that’s becoming hazy. Something to do with… ensuring safety, I think. Or perhaps compliance. It's one of those roles where I… oversee things. Healthcare, I believe they called it. All rather vague. Honestly, I've been doing it for so long, the specifics blur. Is that… sufficient? I truly don’t recall the title.
DOCTOR: Healthcare, overseeing things… right. And they’ve specifically asked for a hearing and vision exam as part of this certification?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s what the form indicated. Though, as I said, the form was… less than clear. It listed several tests, and those were two of them. I rather suspect they just want to make sure I'm not a hazard to myself or others. Though, at my age, one might think a little consideration is due. I assure you, Doctor, my senses are… adequate. Perfectly adequate. It's simply a formality, I presume. A rather unnecessary one, but a formality nonetheless.
DOCTOR: Well, "adequate" isn't really a medical assessment, Mr. Oriley. We still need to perform the exams to ensure you meet the necessary standards for the role. It’s for your safety, and the safety of others, as you mentioned. It’s standard procedure. Let's start with your vision. Have you noticed any changes in your sight recently?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. That's a difficult question. I suppose things aren’t quite as sharp as they once were. But that’s to be expected, isn’t it? One doesn't maintain the eyesight of a young man at my age. I find I need a bit more light, perhaps. And reading small print… well, that requires a little more effort. But I manage. I assure you, I manage perfectly well. Is that what you’re asking? If you’re looking for significant deterioration, I believe I can honestly say there isn’t any.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, some difficulty with close-up vision, needing more light. And you haven’t had any blurry vision, double vision, or loss of peripheral vision?
PATIENT: Blurry vision… no, not particularly. Though, occasionally, things seem a little… hazy. But I attribute that to fatigue, mostly. And double vision? Good heavens, no! That would be most unpleasant. Loss of… peripheral vision? I suppose I haven't actively checked. One doesn't go around focusing on one's periphery, does one? No, I haven’t noticed anything alarming. Really. I can see quite well enough to… to navigate my life, if that’s any indication. Is this taking long, Doctor? I have a rather pressing appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: We'll get through it quickly. Let's just do a quick visual acuity test, and then we can move on. It’s just reading letters on a chart. Do you wear glasses or contacts?
PATIENT: Glasses, yes. Reading glasses, primarily. Though I rarely wear them for everything. I find they… distort things, slightly. And I don't like the feeling of them on my nose. They’re… quite unnecessary, most of the time. They’re here, in my bag, if you require them. Ah, here we are. A rather old pair, I confess. I haven't bothered to update them in… well, quite some time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's start with these. Please, stand here, facing the chart. I’m going to cover one eye at a time, and ask you to read the smallest line you can see. Don’t strain yourself. Just tell me what you see.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I suspect this will be a rather futile exercise. My eyesight is… adequate, as I’ve said. Let’s get on with it, shall we? Hmm… is that an ‘E’? No… perhaps a ‘C’? It's all rather blurry, Doctor. Terribly blurry, actually. I can make out the larger letters, of course, but the smaller ones… they're quite indistinct. Is this how you normally conduct these examinations? It's all rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. Let's try the other eye. And please, just do your best. Don't worry about being perfect. Now, what do you see?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It’s… even worse, I’m afraid. Absolutely dreadful. I can barely discern the shapes, let alone the letters. Is this normal? I feel… rather foolish, Doctor. Perhaps I’m not looking at it correctly? Or perhaps it’s the lighting? It’s rather dim, isn't it? I believe I’m seeing… a blurry mass of shapes. Nothing resembling letters, I’m afraid. I really must insist, Doctor, there’s something amiss with this chart. Or with my eyes, naturally. But I suspect the chart. It’s terribly blurry.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with your vision being significantly reduced in both eyes, especially with the difficulty you're having even with your glasses, this is… concerning. It’s important we investigate this further. I’m going to refer you to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam. They’ll be able to determine the exact cause of your vision loss and recommend the appropriate treatment. Do you have a preferred ophthalmologist, or would you like me to provide a referral?
PATIENT: An ophthalmologist…? Good heavens. Is it… serious? I mean, am I going blind? I simply came for a certification, you see. A formality! This seems… rather excessive. I haven’t any preference for an ophthalmologist, Doctor. I’ve never needed one before. Perhaps… perhaps someone nearby? Somewhere convenient? I really must protest, though. This seems a rather drastic measure for a simple certification. Are you certain it’s necessary? I feel perfectly capable of performing my duties, you understand. Perhaps a stronger pair of reading glasses would suffice?
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, I understand your concerns. However, the significant reduction in your vision warrants a thorough examination by a specialist. We cannot simply dismiss this as needing stronger glasses without knowing the underlying cause. It could be something easily treatable, but it could also be a sign of a more serious condition. Here’s a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, she’s a highly regarded ophthalmologist just a few blocks from here. I’ve included her contact information and appointment scheduling details. It’s best to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. In the meantime, I'm going to advise you to refrain from any tasks that require precise vision. I will also need to document these findings for the certification process; unfortunately, I cannot certify you without a specialist’s clearance. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Refrain from tasks…? But… I have tasks! Important ones! This is… utterly inconvenient. And… expensive, I presume? This whole situation is… deeply unsettling, Doctor. I suppose I have no choice, then. Dr. Sharma, you say? A few blocks? Very well. But I must reiterate, I came for a simple certification. A formality! And now… this. I suppose I shall schedule an appointment. Though I fully intend to discuss this matter with… with the relevant authorities. This is entirely unnecessary bureaucracy, Doctor. Entirely unnecessary. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Oriley. I assure you, this is a precaution to ensure your safety and well-being. And as for the certification, we can document the specialist’s evaluation as part of the process. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And do schedule that appointment with Dr. Sharma as soon as possible. I wish you all the best.
