DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for, oh… maybe three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache, you know? Not a bad bad pain, but… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright, a headache for three days, coming and going. A dull ache, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Dull ache. It’s… hard to explain. Not like a pounding. More like… someone is squeezing the back of my head. Sometimes it feels better when I sit still. But when I walk too much… or bend over… it gets worse. I used to work with the trains, you know. Lots of bending and lifting. Maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Trains, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. For many years. Rail yard. Dinkey operator, hostler… all sorts of things. Lots of work. Strong work. Stopped a few years back, though. Old man now. But this headache… it started after I stopped working, I think. Not right away, but… eventually. It’s not every day, but it’s there now. And it worries me a little. My wife… she passed last year, and… I don't have anyone to ask about things like this anymore.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's not uncommon to have aches and pains after a physically demanding job. It could just be muscle strain, settling in now that you're not using those muscles as much. But we should rule out anything more serious. Have you noticed any other symptoms with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No… no dizziness. Not really. No blurry vision. Sometimes… sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, but I thought that was just from sleeping wrong. No fever. No… nothing else, really. Just the ache in the back of my head. And the worry, I guess. It just feels… different than the aches from working. Like it’s inside my head, not in my muscles. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's… helpful. So, no fever, no vision changes, no dizziness. Just the headache and some neck stiffness. You said the neck stiffness is occasional?
PATIENT: Yes, occasional. Not every day. Sometimes I wake up and it feels a little tight, but I can usually work it out with some stretching. But the headache… it’s the headache that bothers me. And it's been going on for three days now, like I said. It's not getting worse, but it's not going away either. I’m just… worried it’s something serious. Old man worries, you know? Especially without my wife to ask. She always knew what to do.
DOCTOR: Well, we’ll have a look. Let's do a quick neurological exam, just to be sure everything is functioning as it should. Then we can discuss some possible causes and treatment options. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can stand. A little slow, but I can stand. What will you be… looking for? It’s alright if you tell me what you’re doing, you know. Makes an old man feel a little better.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat again. I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. And I'll take a look at your neck. This is just standard procedure. Now, let me see… Right arm. And now the left.
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s… surprising. Is that normal, Doctor? It felt… a little strong. Left arm… yes. Go ahead. Just tell me if anything doesn't seem right.
DOCTOR: It’s normal to feel a little surprised. Reflexes can be a bit variable. Okay, now squeeze my hands as tightly as you can.
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Not as strong as I used to be, I'm afraid. Old man strength. Worked with the trains for too long, maybe. Is that… alright? Should I squeeze harder?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… adequate. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m following. It’s a little… hard to keep up. My eyes aren’t what they used to be, you know. Is this alright? Should I just… try my best? It feels… a little dizzying.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to feel around your neck. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender.
PATIENT: Ooh! There… that’s a little sore, Doctor. Right… right there. Not bad bad, but… definitely tender. Like a knot, almost. My wife used to rub it out, but… Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Likely just muscle tension. It’s not uncommon in someone your age, especially given your previous occupation. Honestly, Mr. Brum, it sounds like you’re just experiencing typical age-related aches and pains. Nothing to worry about unduly.
PATIENT: Typical aches and pains… But it started after I stopped working, Doctor. And it feels different than the aches from working. My wife… she always said I worried too much. But this feels… inside my head, you know? And it hasn’t gone away. Is there… is there anything you can do for it? Something for the pain? Or maybe something to… to make sure it’s not something serious? I just want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Brum, I understand your concerns. But based on the examination, it’s highly likely this is just muscle tension and age-related discomfort. I can prescribe you a muscle relaxant and some over-the-counter pain relievers. If the pain doesn't improve within a week, or if you develop any new symptoms – fever, vision changes, dizziness – then, then we can consider further investigation. But frankly, I don't think that's necessary at this point. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: A muscle relaxant… and pain relievers… I suppose that’s something. No… no, Doctor. I don’t think so. Just… thank you. I appreciate you taking the time. It’s just… hard getting used to things without my wife. She always knew what to do. But thank you. I’ll… I’ll take the prescription. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome. Have a good day. .
