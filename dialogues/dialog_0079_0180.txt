DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're 57 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have all day. It’s… tiredness. Just really, really tired. And… and I’ve been eating dirt. Not like… on purpose, but I just… feel like I need it sometimes. Don't look at me like that. It's embarrassing enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Dirt. Clay. Whatever it is, from the ground. I don't… I don't know why. It just… helps. A little. It’s stupid, I know. And it’s not like I’m out there digging up the garden every day, but when I'm feeling… low, I find myself… you know. Don't make me explain it further. It's gross. Is that what you’re going to ask me? How much dirt I eat? Really?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Cantoran, I wasn't going to pry into the quantity. However, it is rather unusual, and it's important to understand all aspects of your symptoms. It may indicate an underlying deficiency, or… other issues. Let’s focus on the tiredness for now. How long have you been feeling this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Months, I guess? Honestly, time… it all kinda blurs together these days. Since… well, since Harold passed, mostly. It’s just gotten worse lately. I used to be able to push through it, you know? Get things done. Now… Now I just want to lie down. All the time. It’s… frustrating. Don’t think it’s just grief, though. Grief doesn't make you crave… that.
DOCTOR: Since the passing of your husband, Harold. And you feel this fatigue is more than simply a result of bereavement?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. It’s not just… sad. It's like… my body is heavy. Like I'm dragging weights around all day. And weak. Very weak. I used to do all the gardening, all the housework. Now… Now I have to ask Mrs. Rodriguez next door to help me with the groceries. It's humiliating, honestly. I don't want to be a burden. Is that… is that making sense? You doctors always make me feel like I’m explaining things wrong.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Cantoran, you are explaining yourself perfectly well. We're simply trying to gather a comprehensive picture. You mentioned weakness alongside the fatigue. Are there any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Ugh. Let me think… Well, my stomach’s been… off. Not like throwing up, just… upset. And I’ve been having headaches. Dull ones. Not migraines, just… there. Always there. And I feel cold. Even when it’s warm. Harold used to say I was always cold-blooded. But it’s worse now. Does that help? Look, I work with computers, okay? I don’t do symptoms. I do code. This is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Stomach upset, headaches, and feeling cold. Do these symptoms come and go, or are they constant?
PATIENT: Mostly constant. The stomach thing… that comes and goes, kinda flares up. But the cold and the headaches? They're just… always there. Low-level, you know? Not debilitating, just… annoying. And they make me more tired. It's a whole cycle of awful, honestly. Is there a point to all this questioning? Are you going to find something wrong with me? Because frankly, I don't have time for a lot of tests. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: We are attempting to ascertain the cause of your symptoms, Ms. Cantoran. It's possible, given your description, there are several potential avenues to explore. We'll need to conduct a physical examination and likely some bloodwork to rule out deficiencies or other underlying conditions. I understand your time is valuable, but a proper diagnosis is paramount. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Harold always handled all that. I haven’t seen a doctor in… goodness, years. Maybe a flu shot now and then, but that’s it. I don’t like taking pills. Always felt like they just made things worse. And bloodwork? Seriously? Must I? Look, I don't faint, I don't get dizzy… I just feel tired. And I eat a little dirt. It can't be that serious. But fine. If you insist. Just… try to be quick, okay? I have deadlines.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with a physical examination and bloodwork. Please follow me to the examination room. I will need you to disrobe from the waist up and put on a gown. I will return shortly. And Ms. Cantoran… perhaps it would be best if you refrain from consuming any… soil… until we have the results of your tests. It could interfere with the analysis.
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Don't tell me what to do. This is ridiculous. Just… point me to the room. And don't expect me to be cheerful about it. Honestly, doctors these days.
