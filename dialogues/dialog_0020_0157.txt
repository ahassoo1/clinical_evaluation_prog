DOCTOR: Good morning, Tasmia. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, the nurse said. Honestly, I don’t see what the big deal is. My husband made me come. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. It’s good that your husband is looking out for you, and it’s certainly better to check things out. High blood pressure can be serious if left untreated, even if you aren't feeling any symptoms right now. To get a better understanding of things, could you tell me a little more about when you first found out about it?
PATIENT: Found out? I guess…last week, when I went for a check-up with my regular doctor. He said something about the numbers being a little high, and then boom, here I am. I don’t remember exactly what he said, numbers aren't my thing. He just looked…concerned. And my husband latched onto that “concerned” look and wouldn’t let it go. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. It sounds like it was a bit sudden. Vague recollections are common, especially when things are unexpected. So, your regular doctor mentioned elevated blood pressure at a routine check-up last week…and you haven’t had any symptoms yourself that you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I feel…normal. I mean, maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn’t tired? I work, you know. It’s a physical job, running surveys and checking sites…doesn’t leave a lot of energy leftover. It’s not like I’m sick or anything. Honestly, I think this is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your frustration, and I appreciate you being honest. It is possible to have high blood pressure without feeling any symptoms, which is why routine check-ups are so important. And it’s good that you have a physically active job, that can actually be beneficial for your overall health. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a little more about your work?
PATIENT: Fine. I’m a technician. Civil engineering. I go out to different construction sites, make sure things are level, the land is right, things are according to plan. Lots of walking, lots of measuring, lots of being outside. Sometimes it’s hot. Sometimes it’s cold. Sometimes I have to deal with…difficult people. It’s a job. A good job. But it’s not exactly relaxing, if that's what you're getting at.
DOCTOR: That doesn’t sound relaxing at all, actually. It sounds physically demanding, and dealing with difficult people is stressful in itself. Stress can definitely contribute to high blood pressure. Now, aside from work, are there any other major stressors in your life currently?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t really do stress. I just…deal with things. My husband worries about everything. The kids, the house, my job…everything. He’s a good man, but he overthinks things. That’s probably the biggest “stress” in my life – listening to him worry. Honestly, I tune most of it out. Is that a good enough answer? I don’t need a therapy session here.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, and I’m not trying to give you a therapy session! It sounds like you’re very resilient, and that’s a good thing. It’s helpful to know about your husband’s worries, though, as that can sometimes indirectly affect things. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven’t been seriously sick a day in my life. I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, measles, whatever, but nothing major. I don’t take any medications regularly, either. Just…the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, if needed. My regular doctor did a basic blood panel last year, everything was fine then. Honestly, I think they’re making a big deal out of nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No pre-existing conditions, and a normal blood panel last year. Ibuprofen occasionally is fine. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Not even when I had my tonsils out as a kid. That was…a long time ago. I was, like, seven. Other than that, nothing. I’m pretty healthy, if you need me to say it again. This is a complete waste of my time, you know. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tasmia. I'm just trying to gather as much information as possible to get a clear picture of your overall health. Let's talk about your family. Do you have a family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history…okay, let me think. My dad…he had some heart trouble when he got older, I think. He was a smoker. He died when I was in high school. My mom…she had diabetes, I think. She was…healthy until the end. My grandmother on my mother’s side…she had high blood pressure, I think. Everyone in my family had something, if that’s what you want to know. It’s not like it’s a surprise. But honestly, I don't pay attention to all that. People get sick, it happens. It doesn’t mean I’m going to get sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a little more information. A family history of those conditions does increase your risk, but it doesn’t guarantee you’ll develop them. It’s good to be aware of, though. Now, one last few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Seriously? You think I smoke? Or do drugs? That’s…insulting. I’m a professional woman. I work hard. I don’t have time for…that. And I maybe have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on a Saturday. A small glass. That’s it. My husband doesn’t drink at all, so I don’t really either. He’d have a fit. Is that good enough? Honestly, I’m starting to get a headache. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions offended you, Tasmia. I assure you, I wasn’t trying to imply anything. I’m required to ask about those things as part of a routine health assessment. And I understand your frustration. Okay, so no smoking or recreational drug use, and occasional, small glass of wine. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just checking your blood pressure again, listening to your heart and lungs, a quick look in your ears, and feeling your pulse. It shouldn’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have better things to do. But if it takes long, I’m leaving. My husband is waiting in the car.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll be as quick as possible. First, let's just measure your blood pressure again. Please relax your arm and try to breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 146 over 90 on your right arm. That’s consistent with what the nurse measured. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your pulse is 78 and regular. I'm just going to take a quick look in your ears…everything looks normal there as well. Everything looks good so far. Based on your blood pressure readings and your family history, it seems we should investigate this further. While your blood pressure is elevated, it is not at a level that requires immediate hospitalization. I would like to order some blood tests to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and other indicators. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Of course. Just what I needed. More wasted time. Fine. Whatever you think is necessary. But I’m telling you, this is a waste. I feel perfectly fine. Just order the tests, so I can get this over with. And can you please hurry? My husband is probably worried sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. I’ve ordered the blood tests, and the lab results should be available in a few days. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results, and we can determine the best course of action from there. In the meantime, I would like to discuss some lifestyle modifications that can help lower your blood pressure, even before we get the test results. Would you be open to discussing things like reducing your salt intake, increasing your physical activity, and managing stress?
PATIENT: Reduce salt? Increase activity? Manage stress? Are you serious? I already do all those things! I work a physical job, I barely add salt to my food, and I’m already good at ignoring my husband’s worries. Honestly, I think you’re just trying to scare me into taking unnecessary medication. No. I’m not interested. Just give me the test results, and I’ll deal with it myself. I don’t need a lecture. Look, I appreciate your time, but I really need to go. Just send me the results when they’re ready. And please, don’t call me unless it’s absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tasmia. I understand. I will have the lab results sent to you as soon as they are available. Please do remember that managing blood pressure is important for your overall health, even if you're feeling fine now. If you experience any symptoms like severe headaches, vision changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please seek immediate medical attention. Here is some information for your reference. Have a good day. .
