DOCTOR: Hi Murry, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Morenomartinez, is it? Yes, yes. Well, it’s this… pain. When I breathe deep. It’s not… constant, you know? Comes and goes. Old man stuff, probably. I just… want to get it checked. If that’s alright. I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Murry. No need to worry about taking up my time – we’ll get to the bottom of this. It's good you came in to get it checked. "Pain when you breathe deep," you said. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm. More… where exactly does it hurt? That’s a good question. It’s… in my chest, I think. But not… like a squeezing pain. More of a… ache. And it feels worse when I… try to take a big breath. Like it’s pulling something. I used to do a lot of heavy lifting, you know, construction work. Maybe it’s something from that. It’s hard to say. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain with deep breaths, described as an ache that worsens with inhalation. And you have a history of heavy lifting. That’s helpful. Is the pain on one side of your chest, or both?
PATIENT: Oh… one side, or both… I… think it’s more on this side. Yes, left side, I believe. But sometimes… it feels like it spreads a little. It’s not sharp, though. Never sharp. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, left-sided chest ache that sometimes spreads, worsened with deep breaths, and not sharp. Have you noticed anything else that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Let me think… Worse… when I climb stairs, definitely. That’s when I really feel it. And… when I bend over. Makes it tighter. Better… when I’m sitting still, I guess. Or lying down. Doesn’t go away completely, but it’s… less noticeable. I haven’t really tried anything specific to make it better. Just try not to move too much, you know? Old man habits.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s exacerbated by exertion – climbing stairs, bending over – and relieved somewhat by rest. Have you had any coughing, shortness of breath, or fever recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. Not that I’ve noticed. Coughing… a little bit. Just a little tickle in my throat sometimes. Old age again, probably. Nothing serious. Shortness of breath… sometimes. When I’m walking uphill, maybe. But I get tired easily these days, so it’s hard to say if that’s different. It’s always been a bit of a struggle, especially with this heat.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, some coughing, a little shortness of breath with exertion, and you get tired easily. Now, have you ever smoked, or been around a lot of smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke… I used to, when I was younger. Not a lot, mind you. Just a few cigarettes here and there. A long time ago. Stopped… oh, maybe forty years ago? And no, not around a lot of smoke these days. My wife… she didn’t like it. Good woman, she was.
DOCTOR: Okay, past smoking history, quit about forty years ago. Good to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh dear. That’s a tough one. I… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… something with my blood pressure, I think? The doctor put me on pills for a while, but I stopped taking them. Didn’t feel like they were doing much good. And… my knees are bad. Real bad. But that’s just old age, isn’t it? Everything hurts when you get old.
DOCTOR: Alright, so gallbladder removal in the past, history of high blood pressure with prior medication use, and knee pain. Do you remember what medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. It was a little white pill, I think. Small one. That's about all I remember. I don't recall the name. My wife used to handle all that for me. She was very organized. I'm not good with names and numbers these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small white pill for blood pressure, but you don't recall the name. That's alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little sniffle with certain flowers, but nothing serious. No, I don't think I have any allergies. I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take something for my knees. Something for the pain. This. Just when they really bother me. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, just ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. That's helpful. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll need to check your chest to see if anything feels tender. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I trust you, Doctor. Just… be gentle, alright? My chest is a bit sensitive these days. It's old age, you know. Everything aches.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be gentle. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and another one… Good. I'm hearing some slightly diminished breath sounds on the left side, and there is some tenderness when I press here. Not anything alarming, but it does correlate with what you’re describing. Your heart sounds are regular, but a little bit faint. Let’s get your blood pressure and oxygen level checked, and then we'll discuss some possible causes and next steps.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Diminished breath sounds… sounds serious. What does that mean? And faint heart sounds… Oh dear. Just tell me what you think, Doctor. I don't want to be kept in the dark. Is it something bad? I just want to get this sorted out, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay Murry, it’s good you’re asking questions. Diminished breath sounds simply mean that the airflow in that area of your lung isn’t quite as strong as it should be. And faint heart sounds can be normal, especially with age, but we want to investigate further. Given your history of smoking, chest pain, and the findings on the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be something as simple as muscle strain, or it could be a sign of a lung issue like bronchitis or even pneumonia, though you don’t have a fever, which makes that less likely. It’s also important to rule out anything heart-related. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. The X-ray will help us see what's going on in your lungs, and the EKG will check your heart's electrical activity. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray and… EKG? Oh dear. Sounds… complicated. But alright, alright. If that's what you think is best, Doctor, then yes, let's do it. I just want to know what's going on. I don't want to be left wondering. Is it going to be painful? And… how long will it take? I have an appointment later this afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: No, neither test is painful at all. The chest X-ray is just a quick picture, you’ll stand in front of a machine and hold your breath for a few seconds. The EKG involves placing some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It’s very quick and doesn’t hurt. The tests shouldn’t take long, maybe 20-30 minutes total. We can get the results back fairly quickly, and then we’ll discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend resting as much as possible and avoiding any strenuous activity. Also, please continue to take ibuprofen for your knee pain as needed. Let me go ahead and get the orders for these tests started. A technician will be in shortly to get you set up. Do you have any questions before I step out?
PATIENT: No, no, I think that covers it. Resting… yes, I can do that. I’m good at resting. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results, alright? I don’t like to be kept waiting. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: Okay Murry, I understand. I’ll make sure to let you know as soon as the results are available. A technician should be in shortly to perform the tests. Please don't hesitate to ask them any questions you have. .
