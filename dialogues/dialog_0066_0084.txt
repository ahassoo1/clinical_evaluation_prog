DOCTOR: Hi Mystery, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is… pleasant to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been… feeling short of breath, I suppose. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. It’s been going on for a little while now, but it’s… worsened recently. I don’t quite recall when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath and dry mouth and eyes… and you said it's been worsening recently. Not remembering exactly when it started is alright, we can try to narrow it down. Can you tell me a little more about the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Certainly. It isn’t… a sudden thing, not like I’ve been running a race. It’s more… like I’m always a little winded. Even with simple tasks. Walking… or speaking for too long. It doesn’t hurt, precisely. It’s just… uncomfortable. And it feels like I can’t quite get enough air, you understand? I find myself… consciously trying to breathe sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it's a gradual onset, not associated with exertion, and you're finding yourself having to focus on your breathing to feel comfortable. And you mentioned the dry mouth and eyes – is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes, I believe. Some days it’s barely noticeable. Other days… it’s quite bothersome. My mouth feels like sand, and my eyes… they itch and feel gritty. I’ve been trying to drink more water, but it doesn’t always help. I’m not sure if it’s related to the breathing, or if it’s… something else entirely. I apologize for being so vague; my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mystery. It's perfectly alright, and it's common to feel a bit unsure when describing symptoms. We'll work through it together. Okay, so the dry mouth and eyes fluctuate. Have you noticed anything that makes them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I believe… being indoors, perhaps? Especially in air conditioning. It seems to make them drier. And… reading for long periods. Focusing my eyes… I don’t know why, but it exacerbates the dryness. Is that… helpful information? I also spend a good deal of time writing, and that makes me focus my eyes as well.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. Air conditioning and prolonged focus… that gives us something to consider. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: That is… difficult. I’ve seen doctors before, of course, but… I don’t recall any specific diagnoses. I had a divorce a few years ago, and… things were rather chaotic then. I may have been to see someone for… general check-ups, perhaps? But I don't have records readily available, and my memory of those visits is… fragmented. I apologize again. It's frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mystery. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it’s completely understandable that medical details might be difficult to recall. We can work around it. Okay, no known medical diagnoses. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, I think… but that was a very long time ago. It wasn’t… a particularly memorable event. Aside from that… no, I haven't had any surgeries. I’ve always been… relatively healthy, I suppose. Until recently, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, otherwise no surgeries. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there any history of medical conditions in your family – things like heart disease, lung problems, autoimmune diseases, or anything else that runs in the family?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My family… wasn’t very forthcoming with medical information. My mother… she had some sort of… breathing trouble when she was older, I believe. But I don’t know what it was. And my father… he was a fisherman, and… well, life was hard. He worked long hours in cold weather. I believe he had some aches and pains, but nothing specific was ever discussed. My grandparents… I didn’t know them very well. I’m afraid I don’t have much information to offer. It's… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, some breathing trouble in your mother, and general aches and pains in your father due to his occupation. That’s helpful, even if it’s not a lot of detail. Let's move on to your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, I have never smoked. I find the habit… unpleasant. My mother smoked, and I disliked it very much. I’ve always preferred fresh air, when possible. Especially by the sea.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I… occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner. Not often. Perhaps once or twice a week, at most. It’s… more of a social thing, really. I don’t drink to excess, and I rarely drink alone. It is… a small indulgence.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional social drinking. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a multivitamin, yes. Just a standard one, for general health. And… occasionally, I take ibuprofen for headaches. But that’s… infrequent. Perhaps once or twice a month, if that. Otherwise… no, I’m not currently taking any other medications or supplements. I prefer to… avoid them, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Thank you, Mystery. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your eyes, and take your blood pressure. It shouldn’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment. I… I would like to understand what is happening, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, heart sounds normal. Now, your lungs. Okay, lungs sound a little quiet, but no obvious signs of congestion. Now, let’s check your eyes. Okay, your eyes seem fine, but I do notice some dryness. And I see a slight… redness to the conjunctiva. Just to clarify, you said the dryness comes and goes, and is worse indoors?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. It definitely seems to be worse when I am indoors, especially in air conditioning. And… reading or writing for extended periods exacerbates it. It’s… a subtle discomfort, but noticeable. It feels like… grit in my eyes, almost. Is that… unusual?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not unusual. The combination of the dry eyes, the shortness of breath, and the fact that it's worse indoors makes me consider a few possibilities. One thing that comes to mind is Sjogren's syndrome, which is an autoimmune disorder that can cause dryness of the eyes and mouth. However, it often comes with other symptoms as well. Another possibility is simply chronic dry eye, possibly aggravated by environmental factors. Given your symptoms, I'd like to order a few blood tests to rule out Sjogren's and other autoimmune conditions. I also recommend using artificial tears several times a day to help with the dryness. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Sjogren’s syndrome… I haven’t heard of that. I… I don’t believe I have any allergies to medications, no. I have never had a reaction to anything in the past, to my knowledge. I am a little concerned about the blood tests, if I am honest. But I understand you are trying to determine the cause of my discomfort. Artificial tears… I can certainly try those. Are they available at a pharmacy?
DOCTOR: Yes, artificial tears are readily available at most pharmacies, over the counter. They come in many different brands. I recommend starting with a preservative-free option, as preservatives can sometimes cause irritation. As for the blood tests, I understand your concern. It's just a standard panel to help rule things out. We’ll be checking for things like inflammation markers and specific antibodies associated with autoimmune conditions. I'll give you a requisition form for the lab, and the results should be back in about a week. In the meantime, if your shortness of breath worsens significantly, or you develop a fever, please contact the office immediately. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: Preservative-free… I will remember that. Thank you for the clarification. No, I believe that covers everything for now, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness, and I will certainly contact the office if my symptoms worsen. I suppose… I will see you in a week, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the blood test results. The receptionist will take care of that for you. In the meantime, try the artificial tears, and try to stay hydrated. If you find yourself in a dry environment, consider using a humidifier. Here’s the requisition form for the lab, and a pamphlet on Sjogren’s Syndrome so you can read a bit more about it. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, Mystery. And please, take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will do my best. You as well. .
