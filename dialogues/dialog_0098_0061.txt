DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, my… my son, I think? He signed me up for somethin’. A… a team? A sports team. I’m… tryin’ out. Yeah, tryin’ out. I need to make sure I’m… okay to do it, I guess. Old bones, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, a team! That’s good, staying active is important. And yes, it's always wise to get a check-up before starting something new, especially with… well, with time passing, as you say. So, you're trying out for a sports team. What sport is it, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: A sport… hmm. That’s… that’s a good question. My memory ain’t what it used to be. I think… somethin’ with a ball? Maybe… baseball? Or… basketball? My grandson plays basketball, so maybe that’s it. I just know my son was very excited about it. He said somethin’ about a league for… older folks.
DOCTOR: Okay, a league for older folks – that narrows it down nicely. And it sounds like it could be either baseball or basketball. No worries at all about not remembering exactly. We can figure things out. To get a better understanding of what you'll be doing, could you describe what the tryouts involve?
PATIENT: Tryouts… oh dear. They… they had me do some runnin’. Not much, thankfully! And throwin’ a ball. And… standin’ a lot. I think they wanted to see if I could… bend over? Yes, bendin’ was involved. And… some people were hittin’ a ball with a stick. It was… kinda confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, running, throwing, bending, and hitting a ball with a stick… that does sound like it could be baseball, or a similar sport. It’s good you’re telling me all of this. Now, besides the tryouts themselves, have you been experiencing any pain or discomfort anywhere – your joints, muscles, chest, anything at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… pain… well, my knees creak a bit when I get up from a chair. Always have. It's just old age, I think. And… sometimes my shoulder feels a little stiff, especially in the mornin’. But nothin’ too bad. I take some… pills for it, sometimes. The little white ones. My wife keeps track of them.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees creaking and shoulder stiffness – that's good information. And you take some white pills for it, that's helpful to know. Do you happen to know the name of those pills, or what they’re for specifically?
PATIENT: The name…? Oh, goodness. No, no I don’t. My wife, Elena, she handles all that. She's very good with… with rememberin’ things. She just tells me to take ‘em with breakfast. They’re for… achin’, I think. Just general achin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, no problem at all. We can get the specifics from your wife later. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Doctor said somethin’ about my pressure bein’ a little high a few years ago. But he gave me some pills for that too! I think they’re blue ones. And… I think Elena said somethin’ about my cholesterol? But I don’t really understand all that. I just try to eat healthy. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and cholesterol, that's helpful. And you're taking blue pills for the blood pressure. We'll need to get a complete list of your medications, but this is a good start. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital…? Oh, yes. Years ago. I broke my arm when I was a young man. Fallin’ off a roof. Elena was very worried. And… I had my appendix out when I was… maybe thirty? But that was a long time ago. No other surgeries that I can remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm and appendix removal – thank you. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family… My father, he had… heart problems, I think. He passed away when he was still young. And my mother… she had… trouble with her sugar. Elena said it was diabetes. But that was a long time ago. Lots of family on both sides, so it’s hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems and diabetes in the family – that's good to know. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke…? Oh no, never. Elena wouldn't allow it. She says it's terrible for your health. Always has been a very sensible woman, my Elena. I drink a little wine with dinner sometimes. Just a glass. Nothing much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, just a glass of wine with dinner – good to know. Alright, Mr. Murph, that gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam…? Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… don't mind my old bones, they creak a lot.
DOCTOR: Of course not. It's perfectly normal. Alright, if you could just sit up straight for me. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. I'm listening for any unusual sounds. Your breathing sounds good and clear. Heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from talking. Blood pressure is 148 over 82. A little high, but not drastically so. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you extend your arms like this?
PATIENT: Arms… yes, like this? Oh, dear. Are you sure I’m doin’ it right? My shoulders feel a little stiff.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, just relax. You have some limited range of motion in your shoulders, and a little tenderness when I press here. It seems like you have some mild arthritis. Now, let's check your knees. Could you bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Knees… oh, goodness. There we go… a little creaky, but they still work. Mostly. It’s just… old age, you know? They don’t bend like they used to.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see some creaking, and a little stiffness. No significant swelling or tenderness. Now, let's just check your feet. Pulses are good, and no significant swelling. Alright, Mr. Murph, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you have some mild arthritis in your shoulders and knees, and your blood pressure is a little elevated. It doesn’t sound like anything that would prevent you from trying out for this team, but it’s important to be cautious.
PATIENT: Oh, good. I didn't want to disappoint my son! Cautious… yes, that sounds wise. I’m an old man, after all. What does cautious mean exactly? Should I… not run too fast? Or bend over too much?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Start slowly and listen to your body. Don’t push yourself too hard, especially at first. Warm up properly before any activity, and cool down afterwards. If you experience any pain, stop immediately. And it’s important to continue taking your medications as prescribed. We'll want to monitor your blood pressure more closely, so I’d like you to schedule a follow-up appointment in one month. Also, I think it would be beneficial to get a referral to a physical therapist. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your shoulders and knees, and help you manage your arthritis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Therapist… yes, that sounds good. If it helps keep my old bones workin’, I’m all for it. Follow-up… one month? Elena can handle the scheduling. She’s very good with appointments. So… no runnin’ too fast, and listen to my body. And see the therapist. Is that everything?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s it. No running too fast, listen to your body, see the therapist, and follow up with me in one month. I'm also going to write a prescription for a mild anti-inflammatory medication you can take as needed for any pain. And I'll have the nurse schedule you for a blood test to check your cholesterol levels, since you mentioned your wife had mentioned it before. Here’s a referral to a physical therapist in the area. They have good reviews, and are very experienced with treating arthritis. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Murph?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. I think… I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. Just… one last thing. Will this team… will they still want an old man like me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Murph, staying active and being part of a team is excellent for your health, both physical and mental. I’m sure they’d be happy to have you. And remember, listen to your body and take things at your own pace. If you’re feeling good, that’s what matters most. Don’t worry about being “old.” Focus on enjoying yourself and staying active. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the paperwork and schedule your blood test. Do you have any difficulties getting to appointments, or would you like a list of transportation options?
PATIENT: No, no difficulties. Elena drives me everywhere. She’s… she’s a wonderful woman. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I think I’ll go tell my son I’m cleared to try out. He’ll be very happy. .
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Murph! You’re very welcome. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a wonderful day, and good luck with the tryouts!
