DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Komarov. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's about my eyes, really. They've been really sensitive to light lately. It's been bothering me for a few weeks now, and it’s getting worse, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensitivity to light…for a few weeks, getting worse. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Sure. It's not just bright sunlight, although that's the worst. Even things like fluorescent lights inside, or even the screen on my phone... they seem really harsh. It feels like… like someone’s shining a spotlight in my eyes, even when they're not. And it gives me a bit of a headache sometimes, behind my eyes.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, not just sunlight, but indoor lights and screens too. Headache behind the eyes… is it a constant headache, or does it come and go with the light sensitivity?
PATIENT: It mostly comes and goes with the light, yeah. If I can get into a darker room, or wear sunglasses, it calms down pretty quickly. It's not a throbbing headache, more like… pressure. Just a bit uncomfortable, really. It's been worrying me, though, because it's interfering with things. I like to read, and I work as a dental assistant, and both of those require good eyesight and… well, not being in pain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're paying attention to it, and that you've noticed it's related to the light. Dental assistant work… that definitely requires good vision. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sensitivity and headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No blurry vision, I don’t think so. Colors seem normal. I haven't really noticed any floaters or anything like that either. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, my eyes do feel a bit gritty sometimes, like there's something in them, even when I've washed them out. But not all the time.
DOCTOR: Gritty feeling… okay. And just to be thorough, have you had any changes in your vision at all?
PATIENT: No, no changes to my vision that I’m aware of. Everything still looks… normal. I can see things up close and far away like I always have. It’s just the brightness of everything that’s the problem. It’s almost like my eyes can’t handle the normal amount of light anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried any over-the-counter remedies for this?
PATIENT: Just eye drops, the regular kind for dry eyes, but they don't really help with the sensitivity, just the gritty feeling a little bit. I've also been trying to wear sunglasses more, even indoors sometimes, which helps a lot, but it's not a proper solution, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that's not a long-term solution. Okay. Before we do a quick examination, let me ask about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I did have a bad bout of the flu a few years ago, but nothing serious. And… oh, I should mention, I lost my wife a couple of years ago. She passed away. It’s been tough, but I’m doing alright.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Mr. Komarov. It takes a great deal of strength to cope with something like that. And thank you for sharing that with me. Now, any medical conditions that you are currently being treated for?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I’m pretty healthy, actually. Just… getting older, I suppose. I have Medicare, if that’s relevant. I get my checkups, but everything’s always been fine. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Okay, and are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to stay away from medication if I can. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but as I said, I haven't been getting many headaches lately, just the ones related to the light.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies, no medications… good. Now, before we move on to the examination, let me quickly ask about your family history. Do you have any family members with eye problems, like glaucoma or macular degeneration?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother had cataracts when she got older, and needed surgery for them. And I think my grandfather on my father’s side had… something with his vision, but I don’t remember what exactly. It was a long time ago. No one else that I can recall had any major eye problems.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, so cataracts in your mother, some unspecified eye issue in your grandfather. I think we have enough information for now. I'd like to do a quick examination of your eyes, just to see what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Let's get on with it. I’m hoping you can figure out what's causing this sensitivity.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please, have a seat and rest your chin here. I'm going to check your visual acuity first, just to confirm your vision is as you described. Then I’ll check your pupils and the back of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. It won't take long. Can you read the bottom line for me?
PATIENT: Okay… um… let me see. E…F…P…T… V… Yeah, I can just make out a V. It's a little blurry, but I can see it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about this line?
PATIENT: A… C… E… K… M… Yeah, I can read that one perfectly fine. No problem at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now I’m going to shine a light in your eyes. Just relax and look straight ahead. Hmm… alright. Your optic nerves look healthy. I do see some mild swelling of the optic disc in both eyes, and a few small hemorrhages. Nothing major, but it’s something to note. I’m going to check your eye pressure now. This will just feel like a puff of air on your eyes. Just relax. Okay. Your eye pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly.
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that bad, Doctor? My pressure, I mean? What does that mean? I don't really understand all the medical stuff.
DOCTOR: It's slightly higher than the normal range, Mr. Komarov. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious on its own, but it’s something we need to investigate further. It could be a sign of glaucoma, which is a condition where the pressure inside your eye damages the optic nerve. But it could also be due to other factors, like inflammation or even just stress. The hemorrhages I saw are also a bit unusual and need to be checked. Given your symptoms – the light sensitivity, the headache, and the slight elevation in eye pressure – I think it would be best to get you a comprehensive eye exam with an ophthalmologist. They have specialized equipment to get a better look at your optic nerve and rule out any serious problems. It's better to be safe than sorry. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a bit more sense, thank you. So, it doesn't necessarily mean I have glaucoma, just that it's a possibility and I need a more thorough check? And the hemorrhages… are those serious? I'm starting to get a bit worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s right, exactly. It doesn't mean you have glaucoma. It means we need to rule it out, and assess the cause of the hemorrhages. The hemorrhages could be harmless, like from a minor injury you may not even remember, or they could be a sign of something else. That’s why I want you to see an ophthalmologist – they’re the specialists who can determine the cause with certainty. I’m going to write you a referral now. I'll also give you instructions on what to expect during the exam. They'll likely dilate your pupils, which means your vision will be blurry for a few hours afterwards, so plan accordingly. In the meantime, continue to wear sunglasses when you're in bright light, and avoid straining your eyes as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything pretty thoroughly, Doctor. The sunglasses and avoiding strain... that makes sense. And you said you'll give me the instructions? That’s good. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Komarov. Here's the referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly-regarded ophthalmologist in the area. And this sheet explains what to expect during the appointment. It also has Dr. Reed’s contact information. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or need to reschedule. And please, if you experience any sudden changes in your vision, like blurry vision or severe pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You've been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you again for taking the time to see me and explaining everything so clearly. I’ll make an appointment with Dr. Reed as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Komarov. I’m glad I could help. Take care of yourself, and I hope you get some answers soon. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the meantime. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
