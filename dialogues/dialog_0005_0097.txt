DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. My husband, he suggested I come. He’s… very concerned with planning. He wants me to have one of those… documents. An advance directive, I believe he called it. Or a POLST form. Honestly, I don’t quite understand why it’s necessary, but he insists. It’s about what happens if… well, if something were to happen to me. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. A bit preemptive, if you ask me, at your age. But husbands… they worry. An advance directive, or a living will, outlines your wishes for medical care if you’re unable to speak for yourself. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a bit more specific; it's a medical order the EMS team would follow. It sounds like your husband is a… thorough planner. Before we get into that, though, is there anything specific going on today that prompted this discussion?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no. Nothing today. Perfectly healthy, thank you very much. It’s just… him. He read something online, I presume, and now he’s convinced I need to fill out forms to state the obvious. I don't require extensive life support, doctor. I eat well, I exercise – when I have the time, of course – and I certainly don't have any… conditions. It seems a rather morbid undertaking, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, even healthy individuals benefit from having these things in place. It simplifies matters for your family, should the… unthinkable happen. It's about your peace of mind, really. Let's at least go through a basic review of systems, just to have a baseline. It’ll be quick. No recent illnesses, fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, I assure you I am in excellent health. I do not have a fever, nor have I experienced any “night sweats,” as you put it. I maintain a very composed demeanor, at all times. This is all rather unnecessary, don’t you think? But, if you must. No, no recent illnesses. A slight headache perhaps, from all the stress my husband is causing, but that is all.
DOCTOR: A headache… alright. And any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, are you questioning my lifestyle? My appetite is perfectly normal. I enjoy a good meal, of course. And my weight is… stable. Let us just say I have always been a… substantial woman. It is a genetic predisposition, nothing more. I find it rather rude to focus on such things when I came here to discuss… planning, not my physique.
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. My apologies. Just covering all bases. Any issues with your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Doctor! Are you seriously asking me about… that? This is becoming quite inappropriate. I came here for a legal document, not a… a medical examination. I believe I’ve answered quite enough personal questions already. My husband should be the one filling out these forms; he's the one obsessed with minutiae!
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, with all due respect, I'm a physician. Part of my job is to assess your overall health, even if you insist you're perfectly fine. These questions are standard procedure. If you're unwilling to cooperate with a basic review of systems, we can certainly skip it. However, I cannot in good conscience complete a document outlining your medical wishes without having some understanding of your current health status. It’s about ensuring your preferences are accurately represented. Now, are you willing to answer a few more questions, or would you prefer I refer you to another physician?
PATIENT: So, you are implying I am not being truthful? That I am somehow… withholding information? Doctor, I assure you, I am perfectly capable of articulating my wishes. And I find your line of questioning to be frankly insulting. Refer me to another physician, please. One who respects a patient’s… dignity. I will not be subjected to this… interrogation.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chilla. I respect your decision. Here is a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma. She may be more aligned with your preferences. I wish you the best in finding a physician who can adequately address your needs.
