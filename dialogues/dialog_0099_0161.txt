DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Trefren. Welcome. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor. It’s… a bit awkward to talk about, honestly. But a friend suggested I look into something… a preventative thing for HIV. PrEP, I think she called it? I don’t really know much about it, but I figured it couldn’t hurt to ask. I just want to be safe, you know?
DOCTOR: PrEP, yes. Preventative measures are… sensible, I suppose. Though frankly, at your age, it's not usually the first thing one considers. Still. We can certainly discuss it. Before we go further, let's get a bit of background. You mentioned a friend suggested this. Are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. It’s… casual, mostly. Nothing serious. And, to be honest, I haven’t always been… the best at making sure things are safe. That’s why my friend suggested this PrEP thing. It's good to know there is something I can do, even now. I haven’t… I haven’t had any tests recently, if that matters.
DOCTOR: “Recent” is a relative term. And “safe” is… often not. Alright. We absolutely need to establish a baseline before considering any preventative medication. PrEP isn’t a free pass, you understand. It requires regular monitoring, and it doesn't protect against everything. Let’s start with a comprehensive sexual history. I need details: types of sexual activity, number of partners in the last six months, and if you’ve noticed any symptoms – unusual discharge, sores, pain… anything at all. Don’t leave anything out. And be precise. "Casual" doesn't tell me much.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is a lot. Okay, okay. Six months… Let me think. There’s been… three partners, I suppose. All men. Mostly just… you know… intimacy. No, nothing rough, nothing unusual. And no, I haven’t noticed anything like sores or discharge. Just… regular intimacy. I haven't been with anyone new in the last month, maybe six weeks. Is this really necessary to go into this much detail? I mean, I understand it's important, but...it feels very personal.
DOCTOR: It is personal, Ms. Trefren. That's why you're here, speaking to me, a medical professional. And yes, it’s absolutely necessary. This isn’t a social call. We're assessing risk, and vague answers don't help anyone. “Intimacy” still encompasses a range of activities. Were condoms used consistently with all partners?
PATIENT: No. That’s… that’s the truth. Not consistently. Sometimes we forgot, sometimes it just… didn’t happen. I know, I know, it was foolish. I should have been more careful. It’s just… it was comfortable, and easy, and I didn’t think anything bad would happen. I feel terrible even saying this.
DOCTOR: "Comfortable" and "easy" rarely equate to "safe," Ms. Trefren. This is precisely why we're having this conversation. And frankly, your… lax approach to protection is concerning. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I take a little something for my blood pressure, a small dose, but that’s it. And no, I haven’t had any reactions to anything, ever, as far as I remember. It's just the blood pressure medicine, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Doctor, are you… are you judging me? I feel like you are.
DOCTOR: “Judging” is a rather… emotive term, Ms. Trefren. I’m assessing risk factors, and documenting relevant medical history. Your choices have implications, and it’s my responsibility to understand them. Alright. Lisinopril. Good. We’ll need to consider potential interactions if we proceed with PrEP. Now, before we even think about a prescription, we absolutely need to run some tests. HIV testing, of course. But also a full STI screening – syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, hepatitis B and C. And a kidney function test, to ensure you're healthy enough for the medication. Do you agree to these tests?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Anything. I just… I want to be safe. And if that means tests, then tests it is. I just… I hope they don’t find anything. This is all very stressful, you know?
DOCTOR: Stress is… understandable. But proactive testing is far preferable to dealing with complications later. Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. It’s standard procedure. I'll review the results as soon as they're available and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I strongly advise abstaining from sexual activity until we have these results. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, perfectly clear. No sex. Until I know. Okay. That… that I can do. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you being… direct. Even if it’s a little… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Directness is… efficient. And frankly, Ms. Trefren, your health deserves nothing less. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
