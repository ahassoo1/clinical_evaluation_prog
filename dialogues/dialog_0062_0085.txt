DOCTOR: Hi Gabbrielle, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s good to meet you too, Doctor. Though, honestly, I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for… this. It’s just… unusual. And I prefer to know these things, you understand. Some people just let things be, but I like to be informed.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s always best to get things checked out if you’re concerned, and being informed is a really good approach. Okay, let's take a look at your forearm. Can you tell me a little more about what's unusual about it?
PATIENT: It’s the color, mostly. It’s…patchy. Not a uniform tan, or anything normal. It almost looks… bruised, but I haven’t hit it on anything. And it’s been like this for, oh, I’d say six weeks now? Maybe a little longer. It doesn’t hurt, thankfully, but it doesn’t look right. Honestly, it’s rather unsightly. I was hoping you could tell me what is right with it, or what should be happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. It is quite patchy, and it doesn’t appear to be a typical bruise. It’s good that it’s not painful, that's a positive. Six weeks is a little while for something to persist without resolving. To get a better understanding, can you tell me if anything else has been going on at the same time?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No, not really. Everything's been… normal, as normal as it gets. I haven’t been sick, no new medications, no changes to my diet… Oh! Except, my husband, Stefan, and I did go on a trip to the coast a little before this started. We were… well, we were trying to get a good tan. Perhaps it’s something to do with that? Though, I always use sunscreen. A very high factor, naturally.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. The trip to the coast and trying to tan, even with sunscreen, is helpful to know. Sometimes even high-factor sunscreen doesn't offer complete protection, and reactions can develop. Let’s do a quick examination of the area and then I’ll ask you a few more general questions, if that's alright. The skin feels normal in texture, no lumps or bumps. The discoloration seems fairly well-defined. I’m also going to check your lymph nodes near your elbow and armpit, just to be thorough. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Thoroughness is appreciated, honestly. I wouldn’t want anything overlooked. And really, anything to get to the bottom of this… unsightly patch. It’s just… distracting.
DOCTOR: Okay, good news – your lymph nodes feel normal. That’s reassuring. Now, just a few general questions. Have you noticed any other skin changes anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Everything else is as it should be. No new moles, no rashes, no itching… Absolutely nothing. I make a point of checking regularly, you see. A woman has to be vigilant, doesn't she? It’s just this one spot. Quite frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, vigilance is important. And it sounds like you're very good about keeping track of things, which is excellent. Okay. Have you had any recent illnesses – even a cold or the flu – in the last few months?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I pride myself on a robust immune system, thank you very much. Stefan always gets everything that's going around, but I manage to avoid it. Perhaps it's the yogurt. I have a spoonful every morning. A very specific brand, naturally. It’s a Ukrainian recipe, you see. Very potent.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful! A strong immune system and a good yogurt recipe certainly can’t hurt. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies whatsoever. I’ve always been… fortunate in that regard. Stefan is the one with the sensitivities. He has to be careful with shellfish, and certain pollens, but I'm perfectly fine. Honestly, it's quite inconvenient for him, all the restrictions. I, on the other hand, can eat anything. Within reason, of course. I'm not completely reckless.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No allergies simplify things nicely. And it sounds like you’re pretty healthy overall. Have you had any significant medical conditions or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a very standard procedure. And… a small cyst removed from my back a few years ago, but that was hardly anything. Stefan always worries about these things, of course. He's a bit of a hypochondriac, bless him. But really, I've always been… robust. Good genes, I suppose. Ukrainian stock, you know. Very resilient.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a very healthy history. And resilience is certainly a good thing to have! Now, just to complete the picture, do you take any medications regularly, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the yogurt, as we discussed. And… a multivitamin, occasionally. When I remember. It’s not terribly important, really. I eat a very balanced diet, you see. Lots of fresh vegetables, lean protein… It's all very sensible. Stefan insists on it, naturally. He reads all sorts of articles about preventative health. Honestly, I think he worries too much. But he means well.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re very conscientious about your health, even if you don't always need a lot of intervention. And having someone who cares about your wellbeing is a good thing! Okay, Gabbrielle, based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it doesn’t seem like this is anything immediately concerning. However, the persistent discoloration for six weeks warrants a little further investigation. I suspect this could be a form of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation – meaning a reaction to sun exposure, even with sunscreen, has caused a change in skin coloring. But, to be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a basic skin biopsy. It’s a very simple procedure – we just take a tiny sample of the skin to look at under a microscope. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Is that… really necessary? It sounds rather… invasive. And frankly, a bit of a fuss over a patch of discoloration. I mean, if it’s just a reaction to the sun, wouldn’t that be obvious? I’ve been very careful with sun protection, you understand. I’m not terribly fond of needles, if you must know.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and you're right to ask. It is a small procedure, but it's the best way to get a definitive answer. A biopsy is often the only way to rule out other, less common possibilities, and ensure we’re not missing anything. The needle we use is very small – it’s more like a tiny pinch. And it will give us a lot of peace of mind. If it is just post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, the biopsy will confirm that, and we can discuss strategies to fade the discoloration. If we don’t do the biopsy, we could simply try topical creams to see if it improves, but it could take a long time to see results, and it wouldn't rule out other potential causes. It’s really your decision, of course, but I would recommend it for a complete and accurate diagnosis. What do you think?
PATIENT: Very well. If you insist. Though, I still think it’s rather excessive. But… I suppose if it will put my mind at ease, and it is a quick procedure… Just please be quick about it. And try not to make a mess. I have a luncheon appointment afterward, you understand. And I’ve just had my hair done.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible, and I promise we’ll keep it neat. We can even provide you with a small bandage to cover it. Alright. Let me explain the procedure quickly, and then we can get started. We'll numb the area with a tiny injection of local anesthetic, then take a very small sample of skin. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes total. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Fifteen to twenty minutes? That's still rather disruptive to my schedule. But… very well. As long as it doesn't involve a lot of discomfort. And will it… scar? I’m rather particular about my skin, you see. Honestly, I expect a flawless result.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I assure you, we’ll take every precaution to minimize any discomfort and scarring. The local anesthetic will ensure the procedure is painless. And we use a technique that closes the tiny wound with a small stitch, which helps to promote healing and minimize any visible scar. Most patients find that any minor redness or discoloration fades within a few weeks, and any scar is barely noticeable. I’ll explain everything step-by-step as we go, and you can let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. Are you ready to proceed, or would you like a few more minutes to think about it?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Let's get it over with, then. But do be quick. And gentle. I really must be on time for my luncheon. It’s with the garden club, you see. And Mrs. Abernathy is very particular about punctuality. Just… get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Gabbrielle. I’m going to clean the area first, and then administer a small injection of anesthetic. It will feel like a tiny pinch, and then the area will become numb. This might feel a little cold. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Oh, that is rather chilly! Honestly, you’d think they’d have a warmer solution. But… proceed. Just be careful not to get it on my hair. It’s freshly styled, you know. And do try to be quick about it. This is terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I'll be as careful as possible, I promise. And yes, a slightly warmer solution would be nice, wouldn't it?
PATIENT: 
DOCTOR: Okay, Gabbrielle, can you feel anything?
PATIENT: It… tingles a bit. And feels a little numb. Not painful, just… strange. Is it supposed to feel like that? It’s rather unsettling, honestly. It’s not completely numb, is it? I certainly don’t want to feel anything during the… procedure.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly normal – the tingling is a sign that the anesthetic is working. It's good that it's not painful. I’ll give it another minute or two to ensure it’s completely numb before we proceed. Just relax, and let me know if anything changes.
PATIENT: Very well. But do hurry. My luncheon guests are likely discussing the flower arrangements already. And I always have the most… discerning taste.
DOCTOR: Alright, Gabbrielle, can you feel anything at all now when I touch here?
PATIENT: No. No, I can’t feel a thing. It’s… completely numb. Finally. Are you certain it’s enough? I wouldn’t want to feel anything during the… excision. It’s rather… distressing to think about.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm certain. It's completely numb, which is perfect. Now we can proceed with the biopsy. I’m going to make a small incision here to remove a tiny sample of skin. It will be quick, and you won’t feel a thing. There we go. That was quick, wasn’t it?
PATIENT: Is that… a lot of blood? It looks rather… messy. And will it… scar? I absolutely cannot have a visible scar. It would ruin everything. Honestly, I expect a flawless result. This is entirely unacceptable if there’s a scar.
DOCTOR: It's a very tiny amount of blood, Gabbrielle, perfectly normal for this type of procedure. And yes, the bandage is helping to stop it. As for scarring, I understand your concerns, and I assure you we'll do everything we can to minimize it. We use a technique called suturing – closing the wound with a small stitch – which promotes healing and helps to reduce scarring. I’ll give you detailed instructions on how to care for the wound at home – keeping it clean and protected – which will further minimize any visible scar. Most patients find that any minor redness or discoloration fades within a few weeks, and any scar is barely noticeable. But let's not worry about that right now. The important thing is that we've obtained the sample, and we'll send it to the lab for analysis. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Very well. But… this is rather inconvenient. I have a garden party next week. Can I… cover it with makeup? Or is that ill-advised? And how long will it take to heal? Honestly, I absolutely must be presentable for the party. Mrs. Abernathy is terribly critical, you see. And what if it does scar? Will you… offer some sort of compensation? This is entirely unacceptable if my appearance is affected.
DOCTOR: Let's take things one step at a time. Covering it with makeup after the wound has closed and formed a scab is perfectly fine, but I advise against applying anything directly to the open wound. As for healing time, it should take about a week to ten days for the wound to close completely. We'll remove the stitch in about a week, and then you can start applying makeup if you wish. And as for scarring, I'm confident that it will be minimal. However, if you’re concerned about it, we can discuss other options later, such as topical treatments or laser therapy, if needed. But let’s focus on healing nicely for now. I’ll give you detailed aftercare instructions to minimize any risk of scarring. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: Very well. But if it does scar, I expect a full explanation. And compensation. I have a reputation to maintain, you see. This is entirely unacceptable if my appearance is affected. And what exactly are we testing for, anyway? Is it anything… serious? I absolutely must know. Honestly, I expect complete transparency. This is entirely unacceptable if I'm kept in the dark.
DOCTOR: Of course, complete transparency is important, and I'll explain everything. We're testing the sample for several things – primarily to rule out any inflammatory conditions or atypical skin cells. In most cases, it's a routine test to determine the cause of skin discoloration. It's highly unlikely to be anything serious, but it's important to rule out all possibilities to ensure we have an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The lab results usually take about a week to come back. I'll give you a call as soon as I have them, and we can discuss the findings and any necessary steps. And if there are any concerns about scarring, we can certainly discuss options for treatment. There are several effective treatments available, such as topical creams, laser therapy, or microdermabrasion, to minimize the appearance of any scar. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: Very well. But if the results are serious, I expect immediate attention. And compensation. This is entirely unacceptable if my health is affected. And please be certain to call me personally with the results. I absolutely must be informed immediately. Honestly, I expect a prompt and thorough response. This is entirely unacceptable if I'm kept waiting. I think that's all for now. But I expect a full follow-up report. Immediately. I have a luncheon appointment, you understand. And I absolutely must be on time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Gabbrielle. I’ll make sure you receive a prompt and thorough follow-up report. And I'll personally call you as soon as the lab results are available. I understand your concerns, and I assure you we'll provide you with the best possible care and attention. Have a wonderful luncheon. And please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
