DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I requested to come in to… to get tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now, and I thought it was finally time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shaub, that's a very responsible decision. Thank you for coming in to address this. We can certainly get you tested for HIV. Before we proceed, can you tell me a little bit about why you're wanting to get tested now?
PATIENT: Well, it’s a bit… difficult to talk about. My husband and I… we haven’t always been the most careful, let’s say. And recently, a friend of his mentioned he’d been tested, and it just… made me think. I haven’t had any symptoms, not that I know of, but I’d just have peace of mind knowing, one way or the other. It’s better to be safe, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It absolutely is better to be safe, Ms. Shaub. And you've done the right thing by coming in. It takes courage to address these concerns. You mentioned your husband – has he also been tested recently?
PATIENT: Yes, he has. He went about a week ago. He… he didn't want to tell me the results right away, said he wanted to wait until we both knew, you know? He's a good man, but sometimes he’s… private. He encouraged me to come in today, though. So that’s good.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear he's supportive, and that he's also taking this seriously. Knowing his results will be helpful, eventually. To get started, let’s go through a little bit of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on some medication and it's been fine ever since. Otherwise, I’m generally healthy. I eat well, try to get some exercise… as much as an old woman can, anyway. I’ve never had any serious illnesses or surgeries, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And you said the high blood pressure is currently well-controlled with medication?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. I take a small pill every morning with my breakfast. It's been years now, and the doctor checks it every time I go for my yearly check-up. She says it's perfectly stable. I haven't had any problems with it at all. It’s just… something I do, part of my routine now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. You know, one of those everyday ones. My daughter sends them to me. She worries I'm not getting enough nutrients. And sometimes, when my joints act up, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that’s only when needed, not regularly. That’s it, really. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your past surgical history, if any. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Not ever. I’ve been very lucky in that regard. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. Nothing else. I've always been a bit afraid of hospitals, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Shaub. Many people feel that way. Let's move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, latex, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything, really. My daughter tries to get me to cut back on sweets, but I have no allergies. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. No trouble with penicillin or anything like that. It’s another thing I’ve been lucky about, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or HIV?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, like me, and she passed away from a stroke. My father had diabetes, later in life. As for anything else… I don’t really know much about my family history, to be honest. My parents weren't really ones for talking about medical things. They came from a very small village, and things were… different then. We didn’t have doctors regularly. I don’t think anyone in my family ever had cancer, but I couldn’t say for sure. And no, as far as I know, nobody had HIV. But again, it wasn't something people talked about.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s understandable. It's common for family medical history to be limited in those situations. Now, a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband used to drink a little bit of beer with his meals, but he gave that up years ago. And drugs… goodness, no. We’re churchgoing people, you see. We believe in living a clean life.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, before we proceed with the HIV test, I want to ask you if you have any concerns or questions about the testing process itself?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I know it’s a blood test. And I’m not afraid of needles, not particularly. I just… I guess I’m a little bit anxious about the results. What if it’s positive? What happens then? I haven’t really thought that through, to be honest. I’m hoping it’s negative, of course. But I want to be prepared, you know? What would I do?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Ms. Shaub, and it’s good you’re thinking about this. If the test results are positive, it means you have HIV. However, it doesn't mean a death sentence. With proper medical care, people living with HIV can live long and healthy lives. We would immediately connect you with an HIV specialist, and start you on antiretroviral therapy, which is medication that controls the virus. We’d also provide counseling and support services. It's important to remember that with treatment, the virus can become undetectable, meaning you won't be able to transmit it to others. I understand it's a lot to take in. We’ll go through everything step-by-step if that happens. But let’s focus on getting the test done first. Before we do, is there anything else you'd like to discuss, or any questions you have?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that explains things. It’s… reassuring to know it’s not an automatic… end. My biggest fear was just being alone with it, not knowing what to do. Knowing there’s help… that makes a big difference. Alright, let’s just get it over with then. I’m ready, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shaub. That takes courage, and I commend you for facing this head-on. Now, I'm going to need to take a quick look at your height and weight. Then we'll do a quick physical exam – just listening to your heart and lungs, and checking your lymph nodes – and then we can draw the blood for the HIV test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready. Just… try not to poke too much. Old woman’s skin is delicate, you know.
DOCTOR: I promise to be as gentle as possible, Ms. Shaub. First, let’s get your height and weight. Alright, your height is 199 centimeters and your weight is 102 kilograms. Now, if you'll just have a seat on the examination table, we'll proceed with the physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your lymph nodes. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll just close my eyes and try to relax. It's been a long time since I’ve had a proper check-up. This is… nice, in a way. Someone paying attention.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shaub. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra noises. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Your lymph nodes are slightly palpable, but not significantly enlarged or tender. That’s not necessarily concerning, as mild lymph node swelling can be normal. Now, I'm going to clean a small area on your arm, and then draw a small sample of blood. It will only take a few minutes. Do you have a preferred arm?
PATIENT: Oh… um… my left arm is probably best. I bumped my right arm a few days ago, and it's still a little sore. Not a bad bump, just a little bruise, but I wouldn't want to complicate things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shaub, we’re all done. Just keep gentle pressure on this spot for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. And avoid heavy lifting with that arm for the rest of the day. I'll send this sample to the lab for testing. It usually takes about 3-5 business days to get the results back. We'll call you as soon as we have them. Do you have a preferred phone number where we can reach you?
PATIENT: Yes, please call me at 555-123-4567. That’s the best number. And thank you, Doctor. You were very gentle, even though I was probably a bit of a nervous wreck. So, now we just wait, I suppose. It’s the waiting that’s the hardest part.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Shaub. And you weren't nervous at all, just understandably anxious, and that's perfectly alright. We’ll do everything we can to make this process as smooth as possible. We’ll call you as soon as the results are back. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything I’ve thought of. I just… want to get home now. And wait. Thank you again, Doctor. For your kindness. And for being so patient.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Shaub. It was my pleasure. Take care of yourself, and please, don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes to mind. The nurse will come in shortly to give you discharge instructions. Have a good day, Ms. Shaub.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day as well.
