DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascondola. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's my foot, see? It's been swelling up something awful. Not all of a sudden, mind you. Been happening for…oh, maybe a week now? It’s mostly on top, and around the ankle bone. Feels kinda tight, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week of swelling in your foot, mostly on top and around the ankle… and you said it feels tight. Alright. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It started after I was moving some boxes. Nothing heavy, really, just a lot of them. Old stuff from the storage unit, you know? Cleaning out. I figured it was just a little strain, would go away on its own. But it just kept getting bigger. I didn’t ice it or anything, thought it was silly. Now I’m regretting that. I was walking a lot that day, too, back and forth to the car.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it began after some moving and walking, about a week ago. You didn’t think much of it at first, no ice… Has the pain been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly when I walk, definitely worse then. If I sit with it up, it throbs a little, but not bad. When I don’t walk, it’s… uncomfortable, maybe? Not sharp pain, just a dull ache. And it feels warm to the touch, if that makes sense. Not feverish warm, just… warmer than my other foot.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pain with walking, dull ache when resting, and warmth to the touch. I see here you haven’t been to the clinic before… do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies, Doctor. Nothing I know of, anyway. My mother always said I was a tough kid, never got sick. And I haven’t taken anything new lately. Just the usual vitamins. I haven't had any problems with medicine, ever. I do get a little nervous around needles, though. Is that important?
DOCTOR: No, that’s good to know. We can certainly work with that. Alright, let’s do a quick exam of the foot. I'm going to gently feel around, check your range of motion, and see how it feels. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go ahead. Just be gentle, if you could. It’s…sensitive, as you can imagine. I'm a little worried it might be broken, honestly. Not that I want to hear that, but… I've seen some bad breaks in my day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Parascondola. There’s definitely some swelling here, as you mentioned, and it's warm to the touch. I'm feeling around for any specific points of tenderness… There’s some discomfort when I press here, on the outer side of your ankle. Your range of motion is a little limited, but not severely. I don't immediately feel a break, but we'll need to get an X-ray to be sure. I'm also going to check your pulses and skin temperature. Can you tell me if you have any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: No numbness or tingling, Doctor. Everything feels…normal, except for the ache and the swelling, of course. The pulses feel okay to me, but I haven’t really paid much attention to that before. I can feel them, if that makes sense. Not like they're gone or anything. Is an X-ray gonna take long? I have a bit of a schedule today.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That's helpful. The pulses feel good as well. An X-ray won’t take too long, maybe 10-15 minutes. We have a technician available right now. It’ll help us rule out a fracture and get a better understanding of what’s going on. While we're waiting, can you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Sure. I work at the bank, as a loan interviewer. Mostly just talking to people, filling out paperwork. Sitting a lot, really. Not much heavy lifting. It’s pretty boring, honestly, but it pays the bills. Been doing it for… oh, close to 30 years now. It's not what I pictured doing when I was young, but… life happens. I used to work construction, that was tough work but at least it was something. I mostly deal with people who are trying to get small business loans, or car loans. It’s… interesting, hearing people’s stories. And stressful sometimes, people get desperate. Does that matter? For the foot, I mean.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Parascondola. Sitting for long periods can definitely contribute to swelling in the feet and ankles. Alright, let's get that X-ray ordered. We’ll have the results back fairly quickly, and then we can discuss a plan. Do you have any questions for me before we head over?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just… hope it’s not broken. That’s my biggest worry, I guess. It’s just… getting older, things take longer to heal. And I don't have insurance, so… it's complicated. But let's get the X-ray, and see what we’re dealing with. Where do I go? Is it far? I'm not great with directions, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: It's right down that hallway, first door on the left. The technician, Sarah, is very good. She’ll get you all set up. It's not far at all, maybe a two-minute walk. Don’t worry, we’ll go over everything once we have the results. And we'll talk about options, regardless of insurance. We’ll figure something out. I'll meet you back in this room once you're done. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Thank you. Down the hallway, first door on the left. I’ll try not to be too long. And thank you for not laughing about the needle thing. It’s silly, I know, but… it’s just always bothered me. I’ll see you in a few.
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all, Mr. Parascondola. We understand all sorts of anxieties here. Take your time, and don't hesitate to ask Sarah if you have any questions. I’ll be right here when you get back. You go ahead, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will.
