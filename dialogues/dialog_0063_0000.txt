DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It's about my legs. They just… gave out, practically. After a really nasty cold, of course. It's not like I’ve been sitting around doing nothing, you know. I keep pretty active.
DOCTOR: “Gave out,” you say. And after a cold… Hmm. Active, you claim. Most people who are truly active don't find their legs simply… failing them. Could you elaborate on what you mean by “gave out”?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t you patronize me, Doctor. I walked three miles yesterday. Before this, of course. It wasn't a complete collapse, not like I just… fell. It's more like they felt incredibly weak. Like trying to wade through molasses. And it happened over a couple of days. Started with a bit of a wobble, and then… well, then it got harder and harder to stand. It’s just… inconvenient, frankly. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: “Inconvenient.” Yes, well, the human body rarely operates on our schedules, does it?
PATIENT: Exactly! And I told my ex-husband I was perfectly fine, so now he’s going to try and make something of it. Men. Always needing a drama. Anyway, it's both legs, right from the knees down. Not like one just decided to quit on me. It's… symmetrical, if that makes any difference.
DOCTOR: Symmetrical weakness… Yes, that is… marginally more useful information. And this all occurred after the cold?
PATIENT: Yes! After the cold. A really awful one, it was. Congestion, cough, the whole unpleasant business. I thought it was just lingering fatigue, honestly. It wasn’t like I expected my legs to just… stop working. It felt like the weakness came on gradually, maybe a day or two after the worst of the cold symptoms were gone. I took some over-the-counter cold medicine, of course, but it didn't touch the legs.
DOCTOR: Over-the-counter medications rarely address the root cause of anything. Now, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your feet or legs?
PATIENT: No, not really. No tingling. Just… weakness. Like trying to lift weights that are far too heavy. And it’s worse when I try to stand for long periods. If I sit for a bit, they feel a little better, but then it all comes back. It’s rather frustrating, honestly. I’m a very independent person, and I don’t appreciate being slowed down.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a look. Please, if you would, have a seat on the examination table. I need to assess your reflexes and muscle strength. And please, try to refrain from offering commentary during the examination. It’s… distracting.
PATIENT: Oh, now I’m not allowed to talk? Just fine. I suppose I can manage a few moments of silence. Though I highly doubt poking and prodding will tell you anything useful. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. Relax your legs… Good. Now, push back against my hand. Don't resist… there we go. And now the other leg… Push… Hmm. And now, flex your feet… Both feet… Good. And point your toes… Your reflexes are… diminished bilaterally, and there’s noticeable weakness in both legs, as you’ve indicated. It's not a complete paralysis, thankfully. This could be related to the post-viral inflammation following your cold, though other possibilities need to be considered. Do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Absolutely not! Are you suggesting I have diabetes? That’s ridiculous. I eat perfectly well. Mostly. And I certainly don’t sit around all day. Honestly, Doctor, I find that rather insulting. My mother had some problems with her joints, arthritis, I think, but I’ve always been perfectly healthy. Perfectly.
DOCTOR: I am merely gathering information, Ms. Firestone. Arthritis is… relevant. Family history is always relevant. Now, have you noticed any pain in your legs, or anywhere else for that matter?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. Not like a sharp, throbbing pain. A bit of a dull ache sometimes, especially if I’ve been on my feet for too long, but nothing I’d bother a doctor about. It’s just… tiredness, mostly. And the weakness, of course. It feels like my legs are filled with lead. Honestly, I’m starting to think it’s just a particularly stubborn virus. They always seem to go around. And people are so careless with their germs these days.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s review your current medications, if any, and any allergies you may have. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Firestone. Please, try to recall everything, even over-the-counter remedies or vitamins. It's important.
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. I told you I took some over-the-counter cold medicine! A decongestant, I think. Something with pseudoephedrine, maybe? And a cough suppressant. Nothing fancy. I don't really believe in taking a lot of pills. As for allergies… I think I was a bit sensitive to penicillin as a child, but that was decades ago. I haven’t had any problems with it recently. Honestly, I’m a very healthy person. A little cold and some weak legs isn't exactly a medical emergency, is it?
DOCTOR: Let me just confirm your records… Medicare, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Medicare. Though I doubt they’ll cover a lot of poking and prodding for a little bit of leg weakness. Honestly, the bureaucracy is appalling. They always make things so difficult. I just want to get this sorted out and get back to my life.
DOCTOR: According to your records, you had a pneumonia vaccination last year…Good. And there’s a note here about a prior diagnosis of…mild hypertension, controlled with lisinopril. Are you currently taking lisinopril?
PATIENT: Hypertension? Oh, that. Yes, I take a small dose of something for that. Lisinopril, you say? Perhaps. I have so many pills in that jar, it's hard to keep track. It's not something I worry about much. My blood pressure is usually perfectly fine. I check it occasionally at the pharmacy. Honestly, Doctor, are we getting anywhere with this leg weakness, or are we just going over ancient history?
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, the information you provide is… inconsistent, and frankly, somewhat unhelpful. However, given your symptoms – the symmetrical weakness, the post-viral onset, and the history of mild hypertension – I suspect this may be related to a post-inflammatory neuropathy, possibly exacerbated by your blood pressure medication. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I am ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. We will also need to perform nerve conduction studies to assess the function of your nerves. I am also referring you to a neurologist for further evaluation. It’s best to have a specialist assess this. In the meantime, I recommend resting your legs as much as possible and avoiding strenuous activity. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Neurologist? Nerve conduction studies? Honestly, Doctor, it sounds rather drastic for a little bit of leg weakness. I suppose I have no choice, if you insist. Is this going to be expensive? And how long is this going to take? I have commitments, you know. As for resting my legs… well, I’ll try, but I can’t just stop living. And what about the medication? Should I stop taking that pill you mentioned?
DOCTOR: The cost is… difficult to estimate, dependent on your Medicare coverage and the facility performing the tests. I will have my staff assist you with that. As for the neurologist appointment, I will submit the referral promptly. Regarding the lisinopril… do not stop taking it without consulting with a pharmacist or your primary care physician. Discontinuation can be… problematic. Continue taking it as prescribed until you’ve discussed it with a medical professional. I am providing you with a list of neurologists in the area, as well as the lab requisition for the blood tests. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Don't stop the pill. See a neurologist. Get blood tests. Honestly, it's all rather inconvenient. I suppose I'll have to rearrange my entire schedule. And I sincerely hope this neurologist is competent. I’ve had bad experiences with specialists before. Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I hope you’re right about this being nothing serious. I have a very busy life, you know. .
