DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, um… it’s my water. It’s been… bothering me. Again. I don’t… remember exactly when it started, but it’s not nice. I just want it fixed, if that’s alright. Quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I understand you’re having some trouble with your water and would like to get it resolved as quickly as possible. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about what you mean by "bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… it hurts when I go to the bathroom. Like a burning, you know? And I have to go so often. It's… uncomfortable. I keep thinking I've gone, and then I have to go again. It's very… disruptive. I'm not sure if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Wease. That sounds very frustrating. Burning with urination and frequent urges… those are important symptoms. To get a better picture, can you tell me if you've noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… I don't think so. It’s been… a while since I really looked. I try not to. It’s… unpleasant. I mostly just notice the burning and the… needing to go all the time. I really can’t recall seeing any red, but I suppose I haven’t been paying close attention.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not always easy to check, and sometimes it can be difficult to notice. Alright. And has this happened before, Ms. Wease?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It has. Several times, I think. My… ex-husband used to take me to the doctor when it was really bad. But it always seemed to go away on its own. I just thought it was… something I ate, or something. It’s been happening more often lately, though. That's why I came.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a recurring issue that seems to be getting more frequent. That’s helpful to know. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Um… let me think. I feel… tired, sometimes. But I'm 66, Doctor, so… who doesn't? And… my back aches a little. But that’s probably just my age, too. I’m not sure if it’s connected. Really, it’s mostly just the… water problem. And the tiredness, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, tiredness and some backache in addition to the burning and frequent urination. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a difficult question. My memory isn’t what it used to be. I had… something with my blood pressure, I think. Years ago. And… my ex-husband always said I worried too much, so I went to the doctor a lot. But I don't remember specific diagnoses, if that makes sense. Nothing serious, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Wease. It’s common to forget details over time. We can try to look through your records if that's okay with you. Do you happen to know what medications you are currently taking, or have taken recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no. I don't take anything regularly. Not anymore. I used to take something for my nerves, but the doctor took me off of it years ago. Said it wasn’t helping. I haven’t taken anything since. Honestly, I try to avoid pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, pretty much. I don’t recall ever having a bad reaction to anything. My ex-husband was allergic to cats, but that’s… not relevant, is it? I’ve never had any trouble with medicine, either.
DOCTOR: No, your ex-husband's allergies aren’t relevant. Alright, good to know. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's… complicated. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. And my father… he smoked too much, and… well, you can imagine. Nothing specific comes to mind, really. I wasn't very close to either of them, if I’m being honest. I don't know much about their medical histories.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease. That’s alright. We can work with what we have. Now, let's talk a little about your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor! Absolutely not. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don't drink alcohol. My ex-husband did, but I always thought it was a terrible habit. And… recreational drugs? Goodness, no! I'm a respectable woman.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wease. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’d like to check your abdomen and possibly do a urine test. That will help me get a better idea of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A test? Oh… well, I suppose so. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have… things to do, you see. And the less poking and prodding the better, if possible. But yes, alright. A test. Just… quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I’ll do my best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I'm not feeling any significant pain when I press here, but there is a slight tenderness over your bladder. Now, I’m going to need a urine sample. I’ll give you a container and instructions. Please try to collect a midstream sample, if possible.
PATIENT: A midstream? Oh… dear. What does that mean exactly? I always forget these things. Is it… difficult? I just want to… go to the bathroom, and put some in the cup. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Wease. Don’t worry, it’s not difficult. A midstream sample just means you start urinating, and then collect the sample after you’ve been going for a few seconds. This helps us get a cleaner sample. You just start, let a little go, then collect the sample in the cup, and finish. Here, let me show you a diagram too. It's mostly just about getting a sample from the middle of your urine stream. Do you think you can manage that?
PATIENT: Oh… a diagram. That's… helpful, I suppose. Let me see… start, then stop, then start again… and collect. Yes, I think so. I’ve been to the bathroom before, Doctor! It’s just… all the instructions. I’ll try my best. Just… where is the bathroom? And… is there a lid for the cup?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wease. The bathroom is just down the hall to your left. And yes, there is a lid for the cup. Take your time. I’ll be right here when you’re finished. Just let me know when you've collected the sample, and we'll send it to the lab for testing. We’ll be looking for signs of infection, and other possibilities.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, Doctor. Signs of… what now? Never mind. I’ll… just go. And I’ll be back as soon as I can. Hopefully, this won’t take long.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. Take your time, and please don't hesitate to call out if you need any assistance.
