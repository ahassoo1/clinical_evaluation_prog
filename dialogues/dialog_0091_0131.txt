DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sladen. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're with Medicare and we are located in an urban setting. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's my blood pressure, really. It’s been a bit high lately, and my sister told me I should get it checked out. She worries about me, you know?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your sister looking out for you. It’s always good to have family support. “A bit high” can mean different things to different people. Could you tell me roughly what numbers you’ve been seeing, if you know them?
PATIENT: Oh, I don't really know the numbers, exactly. I got one of those machines from the pharmacy to check it myself, 'cause the nurse at work mentioned it. Last time I checked, it was...something like 140 over 90, maybe? I wrote it down somewhere, but I can never find things. It was definitely over 130 for the top number, I think. Is that bad? I don't really understand all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, 140 over 90 is certainly elevated, and warrants further investigation. It’s good you took the initiative to check it at home. A single high reading isn’t necessarily cause for alarm, but consistently elevated readings are something we need to address. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to take your blood pressure here in the office. Then, I’ll want to ask you some questions about your medical history, lifestyle, and family history. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Checking it here is good, I guess, 'cause that machine at home could be wrong. And questions are okay too, I don't mind. Just, uh, warn me if it's something personal, alright? I'm a bit shy.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. I will certainly be mindful of that. The questions are simply to help me understand your overall health and determine the best course of action. We'll cover everything at your pace. Let's start with the blood pressure reading. Could you please sit comfortably with your back supported and your feet flat on the floor?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. I always get a little nervous at the doctor's office, you know? My blood pressure probably goes up just being here!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly normal, Ms. Sladen. “White coat hypertension” is quite common – meaning your blood pressure can be elevated simply due to being in a clinical setting. That’s why we’ll likely want to take a few readings over time to get a more accurate assessment. …Alright, your first reading is 148 over 92. A bit elevated, as expected. I'll take another one in a few minutes to confirm. While I do that, let's start with a bit of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major, anyway. I had really bad migraines when I was younger, but those mostly went away. And I get a little arthritis in my hands sometimes, especially when it's cold. But other than that…no. I haven't been to the doctor in a while, to be honest. I usually just stay away if I can. Does that machine at the pharmacy measure my pulse too?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Migraines and arthritis are helpful information. And it's alright if you haven't been to the doctor frequently; we're just getting a baseline now. Yes, most pharmacy machines also measure your pulse. …Okay, your second reading is 150 over 94. And your pulse is 78, which is within the normal range. Those readings are consistently elevated. To understand why your blood pressure is high, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I might take some Tylenol if my head is really bad, but that's about it. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat pretty well – mostly. And I walk a lot, 'cause my job makes me. It's...well, I help people in their homes, mostly with cleaning and stuff. So I’m on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear – maintaining an active lifestyle and a healthy diet are both very important. Being on your feet all day is excellent exercise. Now, thinking about your family history, do either of your parents, siblings, or other close relatives have high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother, she had high blood pressure, I think. She was always going to the doctor. And my grandfather, on my dad’s side, he had a heart attack when he was older. But other than that…not really. My dad is pretty healthy for his age. He loves gardening. It's hard to remember exactly, though. It was a long time ago. They both passed away when I was younger. I mostly remember my sister taking me to the doctors.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. It’s often difficult to recall details from the past. Knowing about your mother’s high blood pressure and your grandfather’s heart attack is helpful information, as those conditions can have a genetic component. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I can’t stand the smell of it. My mother smoked when I was a kid, and it always made me sick. I always told her it would kill her, and…well. So, no, definitely no smoking. And I don’t drink much either, maybe a glass of wine once in a while.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol consumption are both very beneficial for your health. Finally, could you tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Oh, uh…well, I try to eat healthy. I like fruit, especially mangoes when they’re in season. And I eat a lot of fish, 'cause my sister always tells me it’s good for my brain. I cook most of my own food, mostly Caribbean dishes, you know? Rice and peas, stew chicken, that kind of thing. But I do have a sweet tooth, I have to admit. I like a little cake or cookies sometimes. And I eat out maybe once a week, with my friend. We go to that little Jamaican place down the street. Is that too much? I always feel guilty afterward.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a lovely and balanced diet overall. A little indulgence is perfectly alright – and enjoying good food with friends is important for your well-being. It doesn’t sound like anything that would be causing your blood pressure to be this elevated. Alright, Ms. Sladen, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. Based on what you’ve told me, your blood pressure is consistently elevated, and there is a family history of hypertension. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I would like to order some lab work. This will include a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and a complete blood count. I would also like to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds...a lot. But, uh, okay. If you think it's necessary. I just don't like going to the lab. They always poke me so much. But if it helps, then yeah, I guess. What does all that mean, though? Will it hurt? And when will I get the results? I have to go back to work tomorrow…
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Sladen. It’s completely normal to feel anxious about lab work. The blood draw will be quick, and the phlebotomist will do their best to minimize any discomfort. The EKG is completely painless – it involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to monitor your heart’s electrical activity. The tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and help determine the underlying cause of your high blood pressure. They'll check for things like kidney problems, cholesterol imbalances, and any heart abnormalities. The results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. I'll have my nurse call you with the findings, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. We'll take things one step at a time. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Okay. Two to three days...that's not too bad. And they'll call me? That's good. I'm not very good with computers, you know? I barely use my phone. So, no, I don't think I have any questions about the tests. Just...what kind of treatment plan are we talking about? Pills? I really don't want to take pills. Is there anything else I can do? Diet? Exercise? I walk a lot at work. What if it's just stress? I get a little worried sometimes, with my job, you know? People can be difficult.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid question, Ms. Sladen. And it's good you're thinking about all of these factors. A treatment plan will depend on the results of your lab work. It could involve medication, but that’s not always necessary. Many people can successfully manage their high blood pressure with lifestyle modifications. We can certainly discuss dietary changes, stress management techniques, and ways to increase your physical activity even further. We can also explore things like mindfulness and relaxation exercises. It’s very possible that stress is playing a role, and we can address that. Before we decide on a treatment plan, let’s get those tests done and see what they reveal. And I want to assure you, we’ll work together to find the best approach for you. For now, let's get the lab order printed and get you on your way. I will also provide you with a list of resources for stress management and healthy eating. Do you have any questions before I do that?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very well. A list of resources sounds good. And…thank you for not making me feel bad about the pills. I just…I don’t like taking them. Okay, let’s get the order.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sladen. I understand your concerns completely, and we’ll explore all options before considering medication. Here’s the lab order, along with the list of resources. The nurse will come in shortly to give you directions and answer any further questions you might have. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any concerning symptoms, such as severe headaches, chest pain, or shortness of breath. And remember, we're in this together. Have a good day, Ms. Sladen, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
