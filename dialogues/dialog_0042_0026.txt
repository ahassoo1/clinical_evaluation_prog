DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Dr… Vodzak, was it? Yes, well, it’s this tiredness, you see. Just… completely draining. And the young man at the lab said something about my… my numbers being off. Something about my muscles, I think. Honestly, I don’t keep up with all that fuss. It’s just… debilitating, really. I used to be able to do anything.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. VODZAK is correct. Thank you for coming in to discuss this with me. It sounds very frustrating to feel so tired and to have your energy levels change like that. And it’s perfectly alright not to remember all the specifics from the lab results – that’s what I’m here for. When you say “numbers being off,” do you recall what the young man at the lab specifically mentioned?
PATIENT: Honestly? No, not a bit. Something about… a kinase? Or creatine… something like that. It sounded very important at the time, and he kept looking at me like I should know what he was talking about. Young people these days… always assuming everyone understands their jargon. It was… a high number, I think he said. Higher than it should be. Is that helpful? I really don't pay attention to these things. My husband usually handles all of that.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. A high number relating to creatine kinase… or possibly creatinine, is a good starting point. It sounds like the lab work may be pointing to something affecting your muscles or kidneys, and we need to investigate further. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… everything is an effort. Getting out of bed, walking to the shops… even just sitting up straight feels like work. It started… well, I don’t know exactly when. A few months ago, maybe? It’s been getting worse, steadily. I used to be so active, always puttering about in the garden, helping my grandson with his projects. Now… now I mostly just sit. And I ache. Everything aches, even when I’m resting. It’s not like a sharp pain, just… a dull, heavy feeling. It's very… inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. A gradual onset of tiredness and aches, making everyday activities difficult… that sounds very challenging, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel frustrated. To help me narrow down the possibilities, could you tell me a bit about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… let me think. Well, my appetite hasn’t been very good lately. I used to enjoy a good meal, but now… everything just tastes bland. And I’ve been going to the… the little room more often. You know, the bathroom. Not terribly often, but more than usual. And my legs… sometimes they feel a bit… swollen. Not huge, but noticeable. My husband keeps telling me I should put my feet up more. Honestly, it's just old age creeping in, probably. What do you think?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re sharing all of this with me, Ms. Oitker. Changes in appetite, increased urination, and some swelling in your legs are all important pieces of the puzzle. While it could be related to aging, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… My husband handles all that paperwork. I have… I think I have a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, sometimes. He makes me take those little pills. And… and I had a bit of trouble with my heart a few years back, but they fixed it with a… a thingy. A little wire, I think. It wasn’t too bad. I mostly just try to ignore all the medical fuss. It’s better not to dwell on things, you know? Honestly, I mostly just want to feel like myself again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Oitker, that is not too much to ask at all. It’s perfectly understandable you want to feel like yourself again. And it’s helpful to know about the blood pressure medication and the previous heart issue. Did they give you a specific name for the heart condition or the procedure you had?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Names? Doctors always use such complicated words! I just remember it involved a lot of beeping and a very long hospital stay. They said something about… a blockage, I think. And then they put in the… the thingy to open it up. It was years ago, though. Honestly, it doesn't bother me much anymore. I try not to think about it. My husband says I worry too much. He's probably right. He's a very sensible man, my husband. Do you think all this tiredness could be related to that old heart problem?
DOCTOR: It’s possible, Ms. Oitker. A previous heart condition can sometimes contribute to fatigue. However, we need to consider other possibilities as well. Do you have any family history of heart problems, kidney disease, or muscle weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, family… let me see. My mother… she lived to a good old age, but she always complained about her joints. And my brother… he had some trouble with his kidneys, I think. He had to go to the hospital a few times. And my father… he was a strong man, always working, but he did have some trouble walking when he got older. He just… slowed down. Is that helpful? Honestly, everyone gets old eventually, doesn’t it? I suppose these things are just to be expected. Still, I don't want to be slowed down. I just want to get back to my garden.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. A family history of kidney problems and a tendency towards joint issues are good things to know. Now, let's talk about your current medications. Besides the blood pressure pills, are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... just the little white pill for my blood pressure, I believe. My husband handles all of that, you see. He's very organized. Sometimes he gives me a little vitamin, a chewable one, but I can’t remember what it’s for. Something about keeping me… perky, I think. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to these things. I just take what he gives me. He knows best. It’s better not to fuss. Do you think all these pills are making me tired?
DOCTOR: It’s possible, Ms. Oitker, but it’s also important to rule out other causes. We need to get a clear picture of everything you’re taking. I'm going to take a look at your electronic health record to confirm your medications. Okay, I see here you are on Lisinopril for your blood pressure, as you mentioned, and you do take a daily multivitamin. No other medications listed. Now, before we discuss a plan, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A physical exam… very well. I suppose that's sensible. I haven't had one in… goodness, I don't remember when. Just don't poke too much, dear. My bones aren't what they used to be. And please, don't tell me anything too alarming. I don't need any more worries. Just tell me what I need to do to get back to my garden, alright? I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Oitker. I will be as gentle as possible, and I promise to explain everything clearly. We’ll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but that's not uncommon with some anxiety about being at the doctor. Your heart rate is normal. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds good, but I’m hearing a little bit of fluid in your lungs. That could be related to your tiredness. I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. Your reflexes are normal, but your leg strength is a little weaker than it should be. Finally, I'm going to take a look at your feet and ankles. I see some mild swelling in your ankles and your skin is a bit pale. Okay, Ms. Oitker. That completes the exam. Everything I’m hearing and seeing is consistent with your symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and swelling. Now, I believe some blood work is necessary to determine the cause of your fatigue, to check your kidney function, and to rule out other possibilities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More blood work? Honestly, it’s always something with these doctors. Very well. If you think it’s necessary. Just… try to be quick, alright? I don't like needles. And please, don't tell me anything too frightening. I just want to feel normal again. And I really do want to get back to my garden. What exactly are you looking for in these tests? Will it take long? I hope not. I have a biscuit recipe I’d like to try...
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Oitker. I will do my best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. We're looking at a complete blood count to check for anemia, which can cause fatigue. We’ll also test your kidney function, electrolytes, and some muscle enzymes to see if they’re elevated, which could indicate muscle breakdown. And, we’ll check your thyroid function, as that can also cause fatigue. The tests should take only a few minutes to draw the blood, and the results will typically be available in a few days. I'll give you a slip to take to the lab. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant weakness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All that sounds very… complicated. Muscle enzymes? Anemia? I don't understand any of these words. Honestly, I just want to know if I'm going to be alright. And can I still bake my biscuits? Are there any restrictions? I suppose if you think it’s necessary to check all these things, then very well. But please, don't keep me waiting too long for the results. I have a life to get back to, you know. A garden to tend. And a biscuit recipe that’s been passed down for generations. Are you sure these tests are absolutely necessary? It all sounds rather… alarming.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Oitker. It does sound alarming, and I apologize for using medical jargon. Let me explain it in simpler terms. Think of your body like a machine. Sometimes, parts of the machine can get tired or worn out. These tests help us see if any of those parts are functioning properly. Anemia means you don’t have enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to your body. That can make you feel tired and weak. The muscle enzymes tell us if there's been any damage to your muscles. And the thyroid tests check a gland that controls your energy levels. I wouldn’t recommend these tests if I didn’t think they were necessary to find out what's causing your fatigue and weakness. It's the best way to get a clear picture of what's going on and determine the best course of action. And yes, you can absolutely still bake your biscuits! There are no restrictions on that. I’ll give you the lab slip now, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they're available. I will call you as soon as the results are back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you put it that way, it sounds a bit less frightening. A tired machine… I suppose that makes sense. And I can still bake my biscuits? That’s good. Very good. My husband loves my biscuits. He's a very sensible man, my husband. Very well, then. Give me the slip. And please, do call me as soon as you have the results. I don't like waiting. And I really do want to get back to my garden. And my biscuit recipe. I hope it’s nothing too serious. I just want to feel normal again. I'm ready when you are. But do call me quickly. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Oitker. Here is the lab slip. I will personally call you as soon as the results are available, and I promise to explain everything clearly. I understand your desire to get back to your garden and your biscuit recipe, and I will do everything I can to help you feel normal again. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. It was nice meeting you today, Ms. Oitker. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
