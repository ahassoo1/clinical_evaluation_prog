DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Antonis Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's this itchiness, you see. It's been bothering me for a little while now. It’s all over, really. Not terrible, but… persistent.
DOCTOR: I understand. An all-over itch can be quite bothersome. Could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it doesn't really come and go with anything specific, not that I've noticed. It’s just… there. Mostly at night, I think. It keeps me up sometimes. It's not like a rash, exactly. Just… dry skin, I guess, that feels itchy. I've been using lotion, but it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Alright. So it's a generalized itch, more noticeable at night, and doesn’t seem related to any specific triggers. Lotion isn’t providing much relief. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… maybe a month or so ago? It was very mild at first, I didn't think much of it. Just thought it was the change in weather, you know? But it’s gotten a little worse lately. A month, give or take a week or two. Hard to say exactly, I don’t keep track of these things!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. A month is helpful. And it started gradually, worsening over time. Have you noticed anything else along with the itch?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Nothing major. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, maybe? But I’m seventy, Doctor! I figure a little tiredness comes with the territory! No fever, no new bumps, nothing like that. Just… the itch and feeling a bit sluggish. I haven’t really changed anything in my diet or soaps, or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, no rash, no changes in diet or soaps. Just the itch and a bit more fatigue. Have you experienced any weight loss recently, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No, not really. If anything, I think I’ve gained a little! I love my cooking too much to lose weight, Doctor. It’s a blessing and a curse, really. My daughter keeps telling me to watch what I eat, but… No, definitely no weight loss.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And it’s perfectly alright to enjoy your cooking. Now, I'd like to ask about any medical conditions you may have, and any medications you're currently taking. Could you tell me about those, if you don't mind?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control for years now. The doctor took me off the medication about five years ago, said my numbers were good. Other than that… not much. I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was ages ago. As for medications… just a baby aspirin every day, the doctor said it helps with my heart. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis when it flares up, but not every day. That’s about it, really. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of high blood pressure, now controlled, gallbladder removal years ago, baby aspirin daily, and arthritis medication as needed. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question! Let me think… No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything – I’m Puerto Rican, we love to cook with everything! No allergies, to my knowledge. Not to pills, food, plants… nothing. I’m pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a bit about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be ninety-two, very healthy woman. She had a little arthritis, like me, but otherwise she was strong as an ox. My father, he passed away younger, heart problems, I think. And my sister, she has diabetes. That's the main things I can think of, really. No history of skin problems, or anything like that. It’s a pretty healthy family, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of heart problems in your father, diabetes in your sister, and generally a healthy family. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, and taking a look at your skin. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That’s perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead. I’m used to doctor visits at my age.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit back and relax. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs that I can detect. Lungs are clear. Your skin appears generally healthy, though I do notice some mild dryness, especially on your arms and legs. There’s no rash, no evidence of any skin lesions, and no significant swelling. I also note some age-related changes, which is perfectly normal. Okay. Everything seems normal so far, Ms. Cassimatis. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, the itchiness could be due to several things. Dry skin is a common cause, especially with age. However, since it’s been persistent, and is bothering you, we need to investigate further. I'd like to order some blood work, just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it will help figure out what's going on, then absolutely. Blood work is fine. I'm not afraid of a little poke. Whatever you need to do, just let me know. I'm trusting you to take good care of me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. The CBC will check for any signs of infection or inflammation. The CMP gives us a good overview of your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. The TSH will check your thyroid, which can sometimes cause itchy skin. We'll also do a mild allergy test just to rule out potential allergens. The lab work should be covered by the clinic’s financial assistance program, given your insurance status. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we should have the results back in a few days. Once we have those, we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to use a fragrance-free moisturizer several times a day, and avoiding hot showers. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: That all sounds very thorough, Doctor, thank you. And the financial assistance program is a blessing, truly. No, I think you’ve covered everything. Avoiding hot showers… I can definitely do that. My daughter's always telling me I take them too hot! No questions right now. I’ll just wait for the results. Thank you so much for listening to me, Doctor. It’s a relief just to be heard, you know? And to have a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. It’s my pleasure. I understand how reassuring it can be to have a plan. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and try to stay cool. And maybe tell your daughter you'll try to take shorter, cooler showers.
PATIENT: Yes, I will definitely tell my daughter! Thank you again, Doctor Seil. You have a good day too. I appreciate everything.
