DOCTOR: Right. Chellsea, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Chellsea Luft. It's nice to meet you, Doctor Osga.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Look, I’m a busy woman. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, um... it's about the cancer. I... I was told to come see you about it. I don't really know what happens next, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Cancer.” Right. And who told you about this cancer?
PATIENT: It was… Dr. Evans. He was at the hospital. He did some tests and then said I needed to see an occupational therapist. That’s you, right? He didn’t explain much, just said to come here. I’m… a little confused.
DOCTOR: Dr. Evans, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Dr. Evans. He was… very quick. I remember he said something about needing help with… everyday things? Because of the cancer treatments. I don’t know what that means exactly.
DOCTOR: “Everyday things?
PATIENT: Yes, that's what he said. Like… getting dressed, or cooking, or… I don’t know. He said it might get harder. I'm widowed, so I do everything myself. I'm worried about not being able to manage.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Dr. Evans… sometimes gets a little carried away with his pronouncements. Look, you’re very thin. What’s your approximate weight?
PATIENT: Um… one-hundred and twelve pounds, I think. It’s been hard to keep track lately. I haven’t been feeling very hungry. Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: One-hundred and twelve. And your height?
PATIENT: I am one-hundred and seventy-nine centimeters tall. About five foot ten, I think? I always forget the exact conversion.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said widowed?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. My husband… passed away about two years ago. I’ve been on my own since then. It’s… difficult, especially with everything else going on.
DOCTOR: And what sort of cancer did Dr. Evans mention?
PATIENT: He… didn't really say what kind. He just said “cancer” and something about it being… in my chest. He said the treatments might make it hard to do things, like… lift things, or even just get out of a chair. I really wish he’d explained more. I don't know what to expect.
DOCTOR: "In your chest." Hmm. Alright. Let’s just quickly run through some basics. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I haven’t had to take many medications in the past. Just… over-the-counter things for colds, sometimes. Nothing serious. I have Medicare insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Medicare is… adequate. Any current medications you are taking, even vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I am not taking anything regularly. I used to take a multivitamin, but I ran out a while ago and haven't gotten around to buying more. Honestly, I haven't been thinking straight lately. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Right. And you said widowed, two years ago?
PATIENT: Yes, two years ago. It was… sudden. He was a good man. I'm trying to stay strong, but… this cancer news has been a lot to handle on top of everything. I live alone, and I worry about being able to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we need to get a better understanding of what Dr. Evans actually told you. And frankly, I'm surprised he didn't give you a more specific diagnosis. Tell me, have you noticed any shortness of breath, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Yes, I… I have been a little short of breath lately. Especially when I walk up the stairs. And sometimes I get a dull ache in my chest, but I thought it was just… stress. It’s been hard since my husband passed, you know? Everything feels harder. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Right. And any coughing?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. It’s not a bad cough, just… dry. It happens mostly at night. I haven’t been sleeping very well. I just keep thinking about… everything. I'm sorry. I'm probably not making much sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just do a quick physical exam. Stand up for me, please. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart. And then we'll check your strength.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… alright. I hope it doesn't take too long. I have a bit of a headache, actually.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again. Lungs sound… diminished. Heart rate is… elevated. Now, I want you to squeeze my hands as tight as you can. Both hands. Grip strength is… weak. Very weak, actually. Alright, sit back down. Now, can you describe the pain in your chest?
PATIENT: It’s not a sharp pain, Doctor. It’s more of a… dull ache. It feels like… pressure, almost. It’s mostly in the middle of my chest, and it gets a little worse when I breathe deeply. It's hard to explain. It doesn't really hurt all the time, just… comes and goes. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your appetite?
PATIENT: It hasn't been very good, to be honest. I haven't been feeling hungry lately. I mostly just pick at my food. I've lost some weight, I think. It's hard to cook for just one person, and… it doesn't really seem worth the effort when I don't feel like eating.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, based on what you’ve told me, and the preliminary exam… it sounds like you may be experiencing some complications from cancer treatment. I'm going to need to order some blood work and a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. But given your weakness and diminished appetite, I think we need to rule out any underlying causes for your weight loss. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before ordering the tests?
PATIENT: No, I do not have any allergies. I haven't had any reactions to anything before, as far as I know. Blood work and an X-ray… that sounds… okay. Will it take long? And… will I get the results quickly? I'm a little worried about what they might show.
DOCTOR: The tests will take a few days to come back. And frankly, given your history, I’m referring you to an oncologist. They’re better equipped to manage cancer treatment and its side effects. We'll send the results over to them. I'm going to write you a referral. Stop taking any over-the-counter supplements, and if anything changes, or you experience a new symptom, call the clinic immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. An oncologist… that sounds… serious. Stop supplements, call if anything changes. Will the oncologist… will they explain everything better? I just… I feel so lost right now.
DOCTOR: They should. Look, I'm a family medicine doctor. I handle a lot of things, but cancer is… complicated. They'll be able to provide you with more specialized care. Here’s the referral information. Make an appointment as soon as possible. I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Osga. .
