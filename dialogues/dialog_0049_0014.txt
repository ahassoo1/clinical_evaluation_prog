DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm... let me see. My wife, she mostly handles these things, but... something about papers? For work, I think. Something to do with... taking some time off. I’m a bit fuzzy on the details, honestly. It’s about my job, with the... the religious stuff, and needing some forms filled out, I believe. Do you know what I mean? I’m Ronnald, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ronnald, I see that here. You're requesting medical documentation for a leave of absence, related to your religious practice, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right! A leave of absence… yes. It’s… complicated. It has to do with some of my duties, leading things at the church, and… well, things came up. I just need the papers filled out, so I can get things sorted. It’s been a bit stressful, trying to remember everything. My wife usually does all this, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. And what exactly are these duties that are requiring you to take leave?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. Let me think… It’s a lot of coordinating, mostly. Meetings, planning events, visiting people… you know, church stuff. It’s… a responsibility, being a leader. There’s a big conference coming up, and some… some travel involved. And there's been a family matter I've had to assist with. It's all a bit much at the moment, and it’s making it hard to focus on everything. Honestly, I wish I could remember the specifics.
DOCTOR: So, increased responsibility at the church, a conference with travel, and a family matter contributing to stress. And this is impacting your ability to work?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! That's… that’s putting it nicely. It is impacting my work. I’m… a bit worn down, you see. Not feeling myself, not as sharp as I used to be. It’s hard to explain. I still go in, I still do my best, but… things slip my mind. Important things. It’s frustrating, and I don't want to let anyone down. That’s why I need these papers, to take some time to sort things out, maybe get a little rest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm... how long? That's a tricky one. It feels like… a few months, maybe? It started gradually, you see. The extra responsibilities piled up, then the family issue came along, and... everything just got a bit much. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, but I'd say… since around April, maybe March? It’s been getting worse lately, though. I really can't say for sure. My memory isn't what it used to be, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… oh dear. Let me think. Well, I’ve been… a little more tired than usual, definitely. And… I’ve had a bit of trouble sleeping. Just… lying awake at night, worrying about things. Not so much pain, you understand, just… restless. And I suppose… I’ve been a little forgetful, which is what brought me here, isn’t it? Not like… major forgetfulness, but… little things. Where I put my keys, appointments… that sort of thing. Nothing else, really. Just… a bit run down.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No, no, not really. I don’t take anything regularly. Maybe a pain reliever now and then, if I have a headache, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed, just… over-the-counter stuff. I try to stay healthy, you see. Eat well, get some exercise… well, as much as I can these days. No, no medications.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. Not that I know of, no. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t had any issues with medications. My wife always checks, of course, but… no, no allergies that I’m aware of. She’d remember if there were any, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a general baseline. It won't be extensive, but it will help me to have a more complete picture. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, that’s fine. Whatever you need, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever helps. I just want to get these papers sorted out, if we can.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat on the table. I’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. 140 over 85. A little elevated. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal. And just a quick neurological check… follow my finger with your eyes. Good. Strength is normal in all extremities. Alright. Everything seems… within normal limits, physically. However, the elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor.
PATIENT: Oh, well, that's good to know, I suppose. Elevated blood pressure... I do get a bit stressed, you see. Maybe that’s it. I try to stay calm, but... it's hard sometimes. Is it anything I should be worried about? I hope it's not too serious.
DOCTOR: It's something to be aware of. We don't want it to become a consistent issue. It could indicate underlying stress, as you say, but we should rule out other potential causes. For now, let's focus on documenting the current situation, regarding your request for leave and the impact of your work responsibilities on your well-being. I can provide a note outlining the stress you're experiencing, the increased demands at your church and the family matter, and the associated difficulties with concentration and memory. Is that sufficient for your needs?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. That's exactly what I need. Just something to explain things to my employer, and let them know why I need some time off. I appreciate you writing that down. It makes things a lot easier.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here is the note. It outlines the stressors, the impact on your concentration and memory, and recommends a period of leave to allow for rest and recuperation. I’ve also included a recommendation for stress management techniques. I’d also recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment with me in one month to assess your progress and monitor your blood pressure. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Thank you so much, Doctor. This looks very… official. Yes, this will be perfect. And yes, a follow-up appointment in a month sounds good. Let me just see... my wife handles the scheduling. I'm sure she can get something set up. Thank you again, Doctor Nestingen. I really appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that for you. Remember, if your symptoms worsen significantly before your follow-up appointment, please contact the clinic immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you so much for your time and your help, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, even if I was a bit… muddled. It's a weight off my shoulders, knowing I have something to take back to work.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. Please take care, and prioritize your well-being. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
