DOCTOR: Good morning, Chelise. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a little high. Hyper… something, they called it. I don’t really understand all that stuff, but I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a letter from the lab regarding your cholesterol. Hyperlipidemia, that's what they likely said. It just means you have higher than ideal levels of cholesterol in your blood. It’s very common, and we can definitely take a look at it. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if you've had this checked before?
PATIENT: I don’t think so. I see the regular doctor for check-ups, you know, the yearly ones… but I don’t remember them ever saying anything about my cholesterol specifically. They usually just check my blood pressure and… things. Maybe they did, and I just forgot? It happens sometimes, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, it absolutely happens. Memory can be… fickle. Alright, so we'll treat this as a new finding then. Do you have any family history of high cholesterol, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father… he had a lot of problems with his heart when he got older. He had to have… a bypass, I think it was. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had a stroke a few years back. It was pretty bad, she couldn't walk for a long time. So, yes, there’s that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important information. Family history definitely plays a role. And do you have any current medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? And my knees ache a bit when it rains, but I think that’s just old age creeping up on me! Nothing the doctor needs to worry about, I don’t think. I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And Medicare is always good to have. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Just a multivitamin, every day. You know, the basic one, for older people. And sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I take some ibuprofen. But that’s it, really. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright, multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat all sorts of things… I love trying new foods, actually. Never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a cast iron stomach.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Okay, so no known allergies. Now, just a couple of lifestyle questions. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband… he smoked for a long time, but he quit years ago. I always hated it. It smelled awful. And it's just… unhealthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe a couple of times a week. Nothing too much. I like a nice Cabernet Sauvignon, but I don't need it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. And finally, do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Well… I try to. I walk the dog most days, about a mile or so. And I do some gardening. That’s good exercise, right? Lifting pots and bending over… But it’s not like running a marathon or anything. I used to swim a lot when I was younger, but my knees… they don’t cooperate anymore.
DOCTOR: Walking and gardening definitely count! It’s good to stay active. Alright, Chelise, that gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Great. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your knees. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but that can be common in the office. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Your knees have some tenderness and limited range of motion, which likely explains your aches. Now, I'm going to order some blood work. It will be a lipid panel, to get a detailed look at your cholesterol levels, as well as a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly okay. Whatever tests you need to do, I’m happy to have them done. Kidney function and blood sugar… good idea. I never really think about those things. I just hope it’s not too much blood! I get a little faint sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s just a standard amount, and we'll have a nurse nearby just in case. We'll also check your thyroid levels, just to be thorough. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. It might involve lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise, or possibly medication if necessary. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You've explained everything so clearly, Doctor. I appreciate that. It’s just… it’s a little worrying, you know? Hearing about high cholesterol and all. But I trust you to take good care of me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I'm happy to address it. We’ll take things one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’ll give you some instructions after the test. I’ll have the results sent to me, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in about a week. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Fazzina. You’ve been very kind and helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chelise. It was my pleasure. Just remember to take it easy, and we’ll get this sorted out. The nurse will be with you soon. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
PATIENT: Okay, you too, Doctor. Goodbye.
