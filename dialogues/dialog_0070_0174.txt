DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Perhaps you could start by telling me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s good to meet you too, I suppose. To be frank, I haven’t been feeling myself lately. It’s… a bit embarrassing to admit, at my age, but I’ve just been feeling… down. Very down. I hope that’s a sufficient starting point. I'd like to get this over with as quickly as possible, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Derasmo. It’s never embarrassing to seek medical attention, and I assure you, we’ll take things at a comfortable pace. Feeling “down” can have many causes, and we'll work together to understand what’s going on. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about this feeling?
PATIENT: Well, it's… a weight, Doctor. A constant heaviness. Not necessarily sadness, although there is some of that. More like… a lack of anything. I don't find joy in things I used to. My garden, for example. I used to spend hours out there, but now… I look at it and it just feels like work. Even talking to my children feels… strenuous. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, I don't know exactly. A few months, at least. Perhaps longer. I truly don’t keep track of these things anymore. Is this what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mrs. Derasmo. That’s very helpful. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing a loss of interest in things you once enjoyed, along with a general feeling of heaviness. We call that loss of interest anhedonia, and it's often a key symptom when we're trying to understand what's happening. You mentioned this has been going on for a few months, perhaps longer. Has anything specific happened around the time you noticed these feelings starting?
PATIENT: Specific…? Hmm. Well, my divorce was finalized about six months ago. It wasn’t… a particularly amicable split. We were married for a very long time, and… it was a difficult process. I don't know if that's related. I’ve always been a strong woman, you see, and I thought I was handling it quite well. Focused on my work, kept busy... but perhaps I wasn’t, truly. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for dwelling on things. It doesn’t help. Is that useful information? I’d rather not rehash old arguments.
DOCTOR: That is very useful information, Mrs. Derasmo. A significant life change like a divorce, even if it was a long time coming, can absolutely contribute to feelings like the ones you're describing. It's perfectly understandable that you might be experiencing some emotional difficulty after such a process. It's also important to note that it's okay not to be okay, even if you pride yourself on being a strong woman. Suppressing emotions can sometimes make things more difficult in the long run. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your sleep and appetite lately?
PATIENT: Sleep… is… fitful. I wake up several times during the night, usually with my mind racing. I don’t stay awake for long, just… enough to disrupt things. And my appetite… well, it’s not what it used to be. I don’t actively feel hungry. I force myself to eat something, just enough to keep going. My daughter keeps sending me care packages, bless her heart, but I don't have much enthusiasm for it. Everything tastes… bland. It’s not a deliberate thing, Doctor. I just don’t want it. Is this getting us anywhere? I really don't understand all this questioning.
DOCTOR: You’re providing very valuable information, Mrs. Derasmo, and this is absolutely getting us somewhere. Disrupted sleep and changes in appetite are often associated with these kinds of feelings. It sounds like you're experiencing multiple symptoms that warrant further exploration. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?
PATIENT: Energy levels? Doctor, I’m seventy-five years old! Of course, my energy levels aren't what they used to be. But it’s more than just age, I think. I used to be able to spend all day working, and still have energy for my garden in the evening. Now… just getting through the day feels exhausting. I find myself napping a lot, even when I don’t feel particularly tired. It’s… a strange sort of fatigue. A weight, like I said before. It's frankly quite irritating. Are we finished yet?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Derasmo. That’s very helpful. A change in energy levels, especially coupled with the other symptoms you’ve described - loss of interest, disrupted sleep, changes in appetite, and that pervasive feeling of heaviness – does give us some things to consider. Before we proceed, I’d like to quickly review your medical history, if that’s alright. Do you have any allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I’m aware of, no. I've always been quite robust, health-wise. A bit of arthritis in my knees, naturally, but nothing that requires medication. I had the flu a few years back, but that was it. Standard vaccinations, of course. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very healthy person, despite… all this. This is all rather… disheartening. Can we please get to the point? What do you think is wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Derasmo. It’s good to know you have a generally healthy background. Based on what you’ve shared – the feelings of sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, changes in sleep and appetite, all occurring in the context of a recent significant life change – it's possible you are experiencing what we call major depressive disorder. It's a common condition, especially following a stressful event or life transition. It’s not a sign of weakness, and it’s very treatable. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. To do that, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam and order some blood work. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work? A physical exam? Doctor, I came here because I’m feeling down, not because I have a physical ailment! I understand you need to be thorough, but honestly, this feels… excessive. I’m seventy-five years old, not a young child. If you must, do the blood work. But I’d prefer to skip the physical exam, if possible. I assure you, there's nothing physically wrong with me. I just want to feel like myself again. Is there medication for this… this disorder? I’d like to hear about that, rather than poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mrs. Derasmo, and I apologize if this feels excessive. You are right, your symptoms are primarily emotional, but as a physician, it's my responsibility to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to how you're feeling. Certain vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and other conditions can mimic the symptoms of depression. It's a standard part of the diagnostic process. I assure you, the physical exam will be brief and focused. We'll check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological assessment. It will take only a few minutes. However, I respect your wishes. We can proceed with the blood work first, and discuss medication options after we have the results. There are several effective treatments for depression, including both medication and therapy. Would you like me to explain some of the medication options now?
PATIENT: Fine. Medication, then. Explain it to me. Quickly, please. I haven't got all day. And don’t use any complicated medical jargon. I just want to know what my options are, what the side effects are, and how long it will take to feel… better. I truly don't understand why I have to go through all of this fuss when I just know I’m feeling sad. But if you insist on medication, explain it to me. Concisely.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Derasmo. I understand your frustration. There are several types of medications commonly used to treat depression, called antidepressants. Most of them work by helping to balance certain chemicals in your brain that affect mood. The most common types are called SSRIs and SNRIs. They generally have fewer side effects than older medications. Common side effects can include nausea, changes in sleep, and sexual dysfunction, but these are often temporary and can be managed. Another type, called bupropion, works differently and may be a good option depending on your specific symptoms. It typically takes several weeks – usually 4 to 6 – to start feeling a noticeable improvement with antidepressants. It's important to be patient and consistent with the medication, and to continue taking it even if you start to feel better, as stopping abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms. We would start with a low dose and gradually increase it as needed, monitoring your symptoms closely. It's also important to discuss any other medications you're taking to avoid potential interactions. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Chemicals… balance… interactions… It’s all rather overwhelming, Doctor. Honestly, I understand as much as I did before. So, you’re saying you’ll give me pills, and it might take a month or so before I feel any better? And they might make me feel worse before I feel better? That sounds… unappealing. Are there any alternatives? Besides talking, of course. I’ve always been a private person. I just want this… feeling to stop. Is there anything, anything at all, that will make me feel normal again quickly?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about alternatives, Mrs. Derasmo. And your concerns are perfectly valid. It is frustrating to wait for medication to work, and experiencing side effects is not ideal. While medication can be very effective, it's not the only option. Other approaches include psychotherapy – or talk therapy – and lifestyle changes like regular exercise, a healthy diet, and adequate sleep. However, as you’ve mentioned, you prefer to maintain your privacy. There is also a procedure called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, or TMS. It’s a non-invasive treatment that uses magnetic pulses to stimulate certain areas of the brain. It has fewer side effects than medication, but it requires multiple sessions over several weeks and is not always covered by insurance. In the meantime, we can start with a low dose of an SSRI – something with a relatively mild side effect profile – and closely monitor your response. If you’re not experiencing any improvement after a few weeks, or if the side effects are bothersome, we can explore other options. What are your thoughts on starting with a low dose of medication, and we re-evaluate in a few weeks?
PATIENT: A few weeks… more waiting… Fine. Do what you think is best. Just… make it a low dose, as you said. And explain to me again what I need to do. How often do I take it? What if I forget? Will it interact with my blood pressure medication? Honestly, Doctor, I’m feeling more anxious about this than I was before I came here. I just want to feel like myself again. Please, just make it stop.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mrs. Derasmo, and I apologize if I've added to it. It's perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about starting medication, and I want to assure you that I'm here to support you every step of the way. I'm going to prescribe you a low dose of Sertraline, which is an SSRI. You'll take one 50mg tablet every morning, with or without food. It's important to take it at the same time each day to maintain a consistent level in your system. If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's close to your next scheduled dose. In that case, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule. Do not double up on doses. Regarding your blood pressure medication, I’ll check for potential interactions right now to ensure there are no contraindications. ...Okay, good. Sertraline is generally safe to take with your current blood pressure medication, but we'll still monitor your blood pressure closely. I'll also give you a printed information sheet with detailed instructions and a list of potential side effects. If you experience any bothersome side effects, or if you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call my office. We can adjust the dose or explore other options if needed. I want you to know that you're not alone in this, and I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for you. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to assess your response and make any necessary adjustments. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Four weeks… Very well. Acceptable. I suppose. Just… please, remind me to call if I forget. And if this doesn’t work, don’t hesitate to suggest something else. I’m not getting any younger, Doctor. I just want my life back. Thank you. For… trying. I suppose that’s all anyone can do. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need some fresh air.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Derasmo. I’ve made a note to remind you to call if you forget, and I assure you, we will explore every option until we find something that works for you. It was a pleasure meeting you today, and I'm confident that we can get you feeling like yourself again. I’ll have the nurse schedule that follow-up appointment for you before you leave. Please, take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. .
