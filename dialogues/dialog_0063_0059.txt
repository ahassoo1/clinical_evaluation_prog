DOCTOR: Good morning. I am Dr. JULES. Please, have a seat. So, Ms. Swaby, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um... well, it's my speech, I think. It's been… a bit off, lately. Hard to explain, really. I just… stumble over my words sometimes. It's not constant, but it's enough to worry me, you know? I don't… fully remember when it started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "A bit off," is rather vague, Ms. Swaby. And you say you don't recall when it started?
PATIENT: No, I don’t, Doctor. It’s… frustrating, even for me. Things haven’t been the clearest, memory-wise. Not a complete blank, but… details are fuzzy. It feels like it’s been a few weeks, maybe a month? But I really couldn’t say for certain. It’s just… harder to think sometimes, and the words don’t come as easily. I hope that makes some sense.
DOCTOR: A month of… fuzzy thinking. Hmm. And is this accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I've been a little more tired than usual, I suppose. Not exhausted, just… easily worn out. And maybe a bit clumsier? I dropped a hammer at work yesterday – not like me at all, normally. But other than that… not that I can recall, no. Is there anything specific I should be looking out for?
DOCTOR: Tiredness and clumsiness… interesting. And you say this clumsiness is a recent development?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, recent. Very recent. Within the last couple of weeks, I'd say. It’s not like I’m falling over things, but… misjudging distances, dropping things… that sort of thing. I'm a construction manager, you see, so it's… concerning. I need to be steady on my feet and have my wits about me. It's not a good combination.
DOCTOR: A construction manager, yes. Right. And any family history of… neurological issues?
PATIENT: Neurological issues… That's a… difficult question, Doctor. My mother… she had some problems with her memory towards the end, but it was just assumed it was age, you know? She didn’t really go to the doctor much. And my father… he was always very healthy, as far as I knew. I don’t… I don’t think anyone specifically had something neurological, if that makes sense. I’m not really sure. I wasn't very close to my extended family, so I don't know much about their medical history, either. I apologize. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: It complicates matters, Ms. Swaby. Alright. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, supplements—anything at all?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I take a multivitamin every morning, just a standard one. And… occasionally, ibuprofen, for aches and pains from work. Nothing regular, just when I need it. Oh! And my husband gives me ginger capsules sometimes for nausea, but I don't take those very often, maybe once a month if that. That’s… everything, I think. I truly don't take much at all, Doctor. I prefer to avoid medication when I can.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, allergies. Any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I get hay fever sometimes in the spring, but that’s just sneezing and a runny nose, nothing serious. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication before, as far as I know. And no food allergies, either. I eat pretty much everything. I’m quite lucky, I suppose. Is that… alright? Are you expecting me to have allergies? I just want to be sure I'm answering your questions correctly.
DOCTOR: It is… satisfactory. Now, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. I need to assess your reflexes and coordination. Please, follow my instructions carefully.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I'll do my best. Should I… change into a gown? Or is it just a quick look? I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: No, no gown is necessary for this. Simply sit comfortably. I will begin with your reflexes. Please, keep your arms relaxed. I’m going to test your knee reflex.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to do anything. I'm a bit worried, to be honest. I don't like hospitals much.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A little diminished on the right side. Now the other side. Also diminished. Coordination… please, touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger. Repeat several times.
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? And… like this? It feels a bit… off. I’m usually much steadier. I hope I’m not making a mess of things.
DOCTOR: Indeed. As you say, somewhat uncoordinated. And slow. Now, let’s try a simple heel-to-toe walk. Please, walk in a straight line, placing the heel of one foot directly in front of the toes of the other. Slowly, and deliberately.
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? It's… harder than it looks. I keep feeling like I'm going to fall over. I normally have very good balance. This is… worrying me.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. It is…suboptimal. Considering your age and these findings, and the reported vagueness of your memory, I recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. I will also order a full blood panel, including a Vitamin B12 level. It's quite likely nothing serious, but we must be thorough. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An MRI… An MRI? Is that… serious? What are we looking for, exactly? I don’t like being in enclosed spaces, Doctor. And a full blood panel… I don’t really like needles, either. I understand you need to be thorough, but… is it really necessary? Perhaps it's just stress? I've been working very long hours lately. What if it is something serious? What would that mean?
DOCTOR: Ms. Swaby, I assure you, the tests are standard procedure. We are looking to rule out a range of possibilities, from vitamin deficiencies to… other causes of neurological symptoms. Stress can certainly contribute to these symptoms, but we cannot dismiss other potential causes without proper investigation. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique; the machine is large, yes, but it does not pose a significant risk. As for the blood panel, it is a minor discomfort for a wealth of information. Here is a referral for the MRI. The lab requisition will be sent electronically to your primary care physician. I suggest you schedule these appointments as soon as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I… I understand. It’s just… a lot to take in. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should avoid? I work with heavy machinery, and… I’m worried about putting myself or others at risk. I'll schedule the appointments, of course. I just… wish I knew what we were looking for. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Avoid operating heavy machinery, Ms. Swaby. That is my strongest recommendation. And refrain from making any significant decisions until we have the results of the tests. As for what we are looking for… a multitude of things. It's best not to dwell on possibilities. Schedule the MRI and inform your primary care physician. We will discuss the results when they are available. Is there anything further?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's all. Thank you for your time. I’ll schedule those appointments right away. Goodbye, Doctor.
