DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I am Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. But after I eat fava beans – those broad beans, you know? – I get really sick. My skin turns yellow, and I just feel awful. Like really tired and weak. It's happened a couple of times now, and I thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Fava beans, you say. Interesting. And how long after consuming them does this reaction typically begin?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it’s usually within a few hours, I’d say. Maybe 3-4 hours after I eat them. It doesn’t happen every time, but most of the time, yes. It’s always after the beans, though. I’ve noticed that.
DOCTOR: And can you describe this yellowing of the skin more precisely?
PATIENT: It’s… well, it’s like a jaundice, I think that’s what the doctor at home said once. My eyes get it too, not just my skin. It’s not a bright yellow, more of a sickly… pale yellow. And my pee gets really dark, like tea colored. Sorry if that’s too much information!
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. Dark urine and jaundice are important details. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or fever alongside these symptoms?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I do get a bit nauseous, usually before the yellowing starts. I haven't thrown up, but I feel like I could. And sometimes my stomach hurts a little, a dull ache. I haven’t had a fever, though. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I usually just feel really, really tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Haggar. Let's go through some standard questions to get a better picture of your overall health. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything… except, well, fava beans, apparently! But that’s a recent thing, this reaction. It didn’t happen when I was younger.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to stay healthy, mostly just eat well and get enough sleep. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I might take a pain reliever if I have a headache, but that's it, and not very often.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I haven’t had anything major. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, chickenpox and measles, but I’ve been pretty healthy as an adult. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, that's about it. Nothing else really. No chronic conditions or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And was that appendectomy uncomplicated?
PATIENT: Yes, it was. I recovered quickly, no problems at all. It was a long time ago, of course - when I was about sixteen. Everything was fine after that. I haven't had any issues since. Is that important? Should I be mentioning anything else about it?
DOCTOR: It's good to have a complete picture, Ms. Haggar. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had some heart trouble when she was older, but that was many years ago. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had diabetes. Other than that, I don’t really know. My family isn’t very good at talking about health, honestly. We just… avoid the topic. Is heart trouble or diabetes relevant to this? I'm not sure if what I eat can cause that…
DOCTOR: It's always beneficial to have that information, Ms. Haggar. We’ll assess everything together. Now, let's move onto your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. I’ve never smoked, and I very rarely drink alcohol. Just a glass of wine with dinner maybe once a month, if that. And definitely no drugs. I live a pretty quiet life, honestly. I work as a receptionist, and I enjoy gardening in my spare time. Nothing too exciting!
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and look at your eyes. Then we’ll decide if any further testing is needed. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever is needed. I just want to figure out what's going on, and why I get sick after eating those beans!
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table, and we’ll begin. I'm listening to your heart and lungs now... everything sounds within normal limits. Your abdomen is soft, but there is some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Nothing alarming, but we'll keep that in mind. Now, let's take a look at your eyes. I notice some mild scleral icterus… a slight yellowing of the whites of your eyes, which corroborates your report. Your pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… not good, does it? The yellowing? Is that definitely from the beans, or could it be something else? I'm a little worried now, to be honest. I just thought it was a weird food allergy, but this sounds more serious.
DOCTOR: Ms. Haggar, it's important to remain calm. While the scleral icterus is concerning, it doesn’t automatically indicate a serious condition. Given your history of reactions to fava beans, and the findings of this exam, I suspect you may have a condition called Favism. It’s a genetic deficiency of an enzyme called G6PD, which makes red blood cells vulnerable to oxidative damage after exposure to substances like those found in fava beans. However, we need to confirm this with a blood test. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a reticulocyte count, and a G6PD enzyme assay. We’ll also check your liver function. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Wow. That’s… a lot of information. G6PD… I’ve never even heard of that. So, it’s in my blood? And the beans cause a reaction because of that? Is it… serious? Is it something I need to worry about for the rest of my life? And will the blood tests tell us for sure? I’m sorry, I’m just a little overwhelmed. This is a bit frightening.
DOCTOR: Ms. Haggar, let’s take this one step at a time. Yes, G6PD is an enzyme in your red blood cells. In Favism, there’s a deficiency, making the cells susceptible to damage from fava beans. The blood tests will confirm the diagnosis. While it's not typically life-threatening, it's important to avoid foods and substances that can trigger a reaction. It’s a genetic condition, so it is something you’ll need to manage long-term. We'll discuss dietary modifications and potential triggers once we have the test results. I will order those tests now. In the meantime, I advise you to strictly avoid fava beans and any products that may contain them. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No more fava beans. And avoid anything that might have them in it. Strictly. I think I can manage that. When will I get the results? And… will I need to see a specialist? Is there a cure? I know I'm asking a lot of questions… I just want to know what I'm dealing with.
DOCTOR: The tests should be processed within 24-48 hours. The results will be sent to my office, and my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. As for a specialist, we can discuss a referral to a hematologist if the results confirm a significant G6PD deficiency. There isn’t a cure for G6PD deficiency itself, but the management focuses on avoiding triggers and understanding the condition. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done and then we can formulate a plan. Do you have any other questions at this moment?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, even if it’s a bit scary. I’ll just… try to stay away from beans. And I'll wait for the phone call. Thank you again. .
