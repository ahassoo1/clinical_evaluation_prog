DOCTOR: Right. Hedy Cantoran, 57. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day, okay? It's…it's this tiredness. Just always tired. And…and I eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but…I crave it. It's weird, I know. Don't look at me like that.
DOCTOR: "Dirt," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt! Clay, mostly. From the garden. It sounds awful when you say it, doesn’t it? But it…it helps, a little. Not that it should, but it does. Look, I just need something to give me energy. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has this…tiredness been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. Months, I guess? It just…got worse. At first it was just feeling sleepy after work, but now…now it’s all the time. I don’t even remember what it feels like not to be tired. And the dirt eating started around the same time, I think. Maybe. It's all a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… I get headaches, sometimes. And I'm… I don’t know… kinda short of breath when I walk up the stairs. But everyone gets those things, right? Old age, probably. Honestly, I just want to feel normal again. It’s not like it’s a big mystery, just fix me.
DOCTOR: "Old age" isn’t a diagnosis, Ms. Cantoran. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat. I mean, I used to enjoy cooking, but now…it's just fuel. Doesn’t taste good or bad, just…necessary. And I don't really want much, if that makes sense. Except the dirt. I always want dirt.
DOCTOR: Do you have any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Swallowing? No. Not really. Why would I? I mean, I eat… normal food. And the dirt isn’t… chunky or anything. It's… fine. Look, are you going to ask me a million questions, or are you going to do something about this tiredness?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your lungs. Standard things. It will help me get a better idea of what’s going on. Please, have a seat.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just hurry it up, okay? I have appointments. This is a waste of time, probably.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Lungs sound clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Pulse is 88 and regular. Any chest pain with breathing?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Not really. Sometimes a little…tightness, maybe? But that could be anything. Like, stress. Or… just getting old. Honestly, I don’t go to doctors, so I don’t know what’s normal and what isn’t.
DOCTOR: Any abdominal pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No. Not really. My stomach… it just feels… empty. A lot. Even after I eat. And sometimes… sometimes it feels kinda… bloated. But it goes away.
DOCTOR: Your fingernails appear pale, and I notice some slight spooning. Have you ever been diagnosed with anemia?
PATIENT: Anemia? Never. I don't even know what that is! Look, are you saying I'm sick? I just want something for the tiredness, not a list of things wrong with me. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions. But these findings, along with the fatigue and… unusual dietary habit, suggest we need to run some blood tests. A complete blood count, iron studies, and a basic metabolic panel. It's standard procedure, Ms. Cantoran. It will help us rule things out. Do you agree?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. The quicker I get this done, the quicker I can go home and…and probably eat some dirt. But don’t expect me to come back if it doesn’t help.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab is down the hall. They'll draw some blood. It'll take a few days to get the results back. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to rest as much as possible. And...I'm going to strongly advise you to discontinue consuming clay. It may be contributing to your symptoms.
PATIENT: Discontinue…the dirt? Look, I appreciate the advice, really I do. But it helps. It’s the only thing that helps. I'll… think about it. But don't hold your breath. Just get the tests done, and let’s be done with this. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Cantoran. The nurse will see you out. .
PATIENT: .
