DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. They just won’t go away! Started a few days ago, and they’re… persistent, to say the least. It’s a bit embarrassing, really, when they pop up.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, alright. A few days, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Started on… let me think… Tuesday, I believe. So, three days now. It’s not constant, mind you, but they come and go, maybe every ten or fifteen minutes. Sometimes more often if I get excited, or try to drink something. Funny thing, isn’t it? Trying to drink more water to get rid of hiccups, and it just makes them worse!
DOCTOR: Yes, that is ironic. And they seem to be triggered by excitement or drinking… Hmm. Have you noticed anything else that seems to bring them on, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Let me see… Not really, not that I’ve noticed. Oh! Actually… yesterday, my grandson, little Kaito, he was telling me this amazing story about a crab he found on the beach, and I laughed pretty hard. That set off a whole string of them! And eating too quickly, maybe? I had a lovely plate of kokoda yesterday afternoon and, well, I was enjoying it so much I probably didn’t chew as slowly as I should have. But other than that, not much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Laughter and eating quickly… that gives us something to work with. Now, aside from the hiccups themselves, are you having any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, no other symptoms, Doctor. Just the hiccups. No pain, no trouble breathing, no feeling sick to my stomach. Just… hiccups. They’re mostly annoying, to be honest. And a bit tiring when they keep going and going. It's hard to have a proper conversation, you know?
DOCTOR: I can imagine. Alright. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe… thirty years ago now? And I get a bit of arthritis in my hands, nothing too serious. Just a little stiffness in the mornings. Otherwise, I’m generally quite healthy. I try to stay active, walk along the beach most days, and I eat a good diet. Fijian food, mostly. Lots of fresh fish and root vegetables.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, some arthritis… good to know. And you mentioned walking and a good diet, that’s excellent. Any medications you are currently taking for the arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Just a little something for the arthritis when it flares up, Doctor. It's called naproxen, I think. A small dose, only when my hands are really bothering me. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it a while back. I sometimes forget, to be honest, but I try to remember. It’s a small white pill. I don't take anything regularly otherwise. Nothing for blood pressure or anything like that. My usual doctor says I’m doing just fine.
DOCTOR: Naproxen as needed, vitamin D… good. Any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or insects?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of, anyway. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, lived in Fiji all my years, you know? Never had a reaction to anything. I get a few mosquito bites, naturally, but that’s about it. Just part of living in paradise, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure, and have a look in your throat. Just to make sure everything else is alright. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’ve had doctors poke and prod me plenty of times over the years! I don't mind at all. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, if you could just take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. And again… Breathing sounds clear. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, pulse is 72, regular. Now, let's take a look at your throat… Throat looks normal. No redness or swelling. Now, can you say “Ah” for me?
PATIENT: Ahhh. Is everything alright, Doctor? It feels a bit strange having someone shine a light back there!
DOCTOR: Everything looks perfectly normal, Mirriam. No signs of any irritation or infection. Given your history and the exam findings, these hiccups are likely benign and self-limiting. Sometimes they just happen. But because they’ve been going on for three days, and we want to rule anything more serious out, I'd like to do a quick blood test just to check your electrolytes and rule out any underlying medical cause. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. If it puts my mind at ease, I'm happy to have a blood test. Three days is a long time to hiccup! So, just a quick poke, is it? Not too bad, I hope? I’m not the biggest fan of needles, you see. But if you think it's best, then let's do it.
DOCTOR: Just a quick poke, yes. And the phlebotomist is very good, very gentle. We'll send the sample to the lab, and the results should be back within a day or two. In the meantime, try drinking small sips of water, and avoid carbonated beverages. We can also try a teaspoon of sugar; sometimes that can help stimulate the vagus nerve. And if they persist beyond a week, or if you develop any other symptoms—like trouble breathing, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain—please come back immediately. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: That sounds like a good plan, Doctor. Small sips of water, avoid fizzy drinks, teaspoon of sugar… I can manage that! And I’ll come back straight away if anything else happens. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. It's reassuring to know it's probably nothing serious. Now, where do I go for the blood test?
DOCTOR: The phlebotomy lab is just down the hall to your left. The receptionist will get you checked in. Once they're done, they'll let me know the results as soon as they're available. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you again for your time and patience with my… persistent hiccups! I’ll go find the lab now. Have a good day, Doctor Fazzina.
DOCTOR: You too, Mirriam. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We’ll get those hiccups sorted out. .
