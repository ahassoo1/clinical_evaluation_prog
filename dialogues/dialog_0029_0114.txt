DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this breathing. It gets…difficult when I try to lie flat. It's been happening for a few weeks now, I’d say. Not every night, but often enough to bother me. I don’t like it.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, difficulty breathing when lying flat, for a few weeks now. Can you describe what that feels like, exactly?
PATIENT: It’s…like there’s something heavy on my chest. Not pain, exactly. More like…pressure. And I have to sort of…sit up to get a good breath. It’s uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. I used to sleep so soundly, you know. Now I’m waking up.
DOCTOR: Alright, pressure on your chest, relieved by sitting up. And it’s disrupting your sleep. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with that – like coughing, wheezing, swelling in your ankles, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me think… No coughing, no. And no wheezing that I’ve noticed. Swelling… my ankles do seem a little puffy sometimes, now that you mention it. But I thought that was just from being on my feet too long at the library. It comes and goes. I don't know if that's connected, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, puffy ankles on and off. That could be relevant. Now, have you had any chest pain with this – any pain that radiates to your arm or jaw?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Just…the pressure. It doesn’t go anywhere else. Like I said, it feels…right here. And it's worse when I'm trying to get comfortable to sleep. That's when I really notice it. I just want to sleep through the night again.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, just pressure. We'll get to the bottom of this. Let’s go over a little bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like heart problems, asthma, COPD, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Doctor Ramirez, years ago, said my blood pressure was a little high, and put me on a water pill for a while. I stopped taking it after a few years, he said it was okay. I don’t think I have…asthma, no. And COPD…what is COPD, exactly? I don't recall that. I had the flu pretty bad one winter, but that was years ago.
DOCTOR: COPD is a lung disease, often caused by smoking. Don’t worry about it right now if you haven't been diagnosed with it. So, high blood pressure in the past, managed with a water pill. Anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I broke my wrist a few years back, falling in the garden, but that was just a break. They put a cast on it. Otherwise, I’ve been…pretty healthy, all things considered. My mother lived to be ninety-five, you know. Good genes, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about your family history. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a baby aspirin every day, Doctor. My friend told me it was good for the heart. And sometimes I take Tylenol for my arthritis in my hands, when it's really acting up. That's about it. Nothing else. I don't like taking a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, baby aspirin and Tylenol as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental things?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, and I haven't had any problems with pollen or…cats, or anything like that. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to help my grandmother in her garden, and I was around all sorts of plants, and never had a problem. I don’t think I have any allergies, Doctor. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to listen to your lungs and heart. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to be able to sleep again. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice, deep breath for me… and another one… Good. Sounds a little wheezy on both sides, but not terribly significant. Your heart sounds a little bit fast, but again, not dramatically so. I also notice a little bit of swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. Let's check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Alright. That sounds…serious. Is it bad? I just…I don’t want it to be anything awful. Swelling I noticed, but I didn't think… Hurry up, please. I have a cat to get home to.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated – 148/85. And your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low. Those numbers, along with your symptoms and what I'm hearing with the stethoscope, make me think this could be early congestive heart failure. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm that. I’m going to order an EKG, a chest x-ray, and some blood work, including a BNP level – that will help us understand what's going on with your heart. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Congestive…heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds…frightening. What does that mean? Is that…serious? And what will these tests do? Will they hurt? Will I be in the hospital?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take a deep breath. Congestive heart failure doesn't necessarily mean your heart is stopping. It means your heart isn't pumping as efficiently as it should be, which can cause fluid to build up in your lungs and other parts of your body - that's why you're having trouble breathing and your ankles are swelling. The EKG is a simple, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. The chest x-ray will allow us to see the structure of your heart and lungs. And the blood work is to look for specific markers that indicate heart stress. These tests aren't meant to scare you, they're meant to give us information so we can understand what's going on and get you the right treatment. Right now, I don’t think you need to be in the hospital, but we will have a clearer picture after these tests are done. I'll have my nurse draw the blood and get the orders in for the EKG and chest x-ray. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay…okay. That…that makes a little more sense, I suppose. Not stopping is good. So, blood work and…pictures. Pictures are okay. As long as it’s not…painful. And you really think I won’t have to stay overnight? The cat would be lost without me. Yes, that sounds alright. Please hurry, though. I do have a cat. A very demanding cat.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. No pain with any of those tests. And I don't anticipate needing to admit you overnight, but we’ll make the best decision based on your results. I’ll have the nurse come in right away to get started. In the meantime, try to relax. It’s good to be proactive, and we're doing everything we can to figure this out. Just let me know if you start feeling any worse while you wait. She'll be in momentarily.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I do appreciate that. Just…please tell her to be gentle with the needle. I'm not good with needles. .
