DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. My name is Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s about some paperwork I need to get sorted. A friend of mine… she’s applying for a visa to come visit from overseas, and they need proof of certain vaccinations. I believe that’s what I’m here for – to find out what she needs, and to see if I need anything done to help with that process. It’s a little confusing, all the requirements, and I wanted to make sure we’re doing it right.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Skarbek. It is often confusing navigating those requirements. I'm happy to help clarify things and make sure everything is in order for your friend’s visa application. To start, do you know which country your friend is coming from, and which country she is applying to visit?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. She’s coming from… let me think… Ukraine. And she’s applying to visit the United States, of course. She has family here, that’s why she wants to come. It’s been a long time since she’s seen them.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ukraine to the United States. That helps a lot. Alright, let me take a look here… For visa applicants from Ukraine, generally, proof of certain vaccinations is required, specifically measles and rubella immunity, and documentation of varicella immunity or vaccination. Depending on her age, a record of other vaccinations might be recommended, but those are the main ones. Do you happen to know if your friend has records of these vaccinations?
PATIENT: I… honestly, I don’t. She didn’t mention anything about records when we spoke. Everything has been so… difficult for her, with everything going on over there, I don’t think she’s been focused on paperwork. I suppose she might have something, but I wouldn’t know where to begin looking. Would a doctor in Ukraine be able to provide those records, do you think? Or is it too late, with everything? It’s just… a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable, Mr. Skarbek. It's very likely she doesn't have easy access to those records given the current situation. It is possible a doctor in Ukraine could provide records, but it could be challenging, depending on the region and current accessibility of medical facilities. We don’t want to rely on something that might not be attainable. In cases where records are unavailable, a titer test can often determine immunity. A titer tests a sample of your friend’s blood to see if she has antibodies for measles, rubella and varicella, which would indicate immunity. Would you be interested in discussing having her undergo titer testing here, if she were to come to the United States?
PATIENT: A titer test… that sounds… reasonable. If we can do that here, that would be much easier, yes. I hadn’t even thought of that. What does that involve, exactly? And… how accurate are those tests? I want to make sure we’re doing everything correctly, so her application isn’t delayed. It’s important to her family, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Skarbek. It's good you're thinking ahead and wanting to be thorough. A titer test is a simple blood draw, just like any other blood test. We’ll take a small sample of blood and send it to a lab, and they’ll analyze it for the presence of antibodies to measles, rubella, and varicella. The results typically take a few days to come back. They are generally quite accurate – over 95% accurate in determining immunity. However, it’s important to know that a negative result doesn’t always mean she’s not immune. Sometimes, antibody levels can be low even if she is protected. In that case, we could discuss vaccination as an option. Before we proceed with any testing, I’d like to ask a few more questions about her medical history, just to get a more complete picture. Have you, or she, had any previous reactions to vaccinations?
PATIENT: That sounds… alright. No, as far as I know, neither of us have ever had a reaction to a vaccination. I had all my childhood shots, and she mentioned getting them too, when we first talked about this. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t remember specifics. She said she felt fine after them, though. Mostly, she just wants to come and see her grandchildren. They miss her terribly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Skarbek. No known reactions is certainly reassuring. Okay, and has she had chickenpox before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. You know, I think she mentioned having chickenpox as a child… but it was a very long time ago, and she didn't go into much detail. She was talking about things from when she was very young, and it’s hard to remember everything. It’s possible she did, but I wouldn’t swear to it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It’s understandable that memories fade. Given the possible unknown chickenpox history, and to be completely thorough for the visa application, I recommend we proceed with a varicella titer test as well, alongside the measles and rubella titers. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it makes sure everything is right, then yes, let’s do all three. I just want to get this sorted for her. When can we do the blood draw, then? And… how much will all this cost? I need to know for my budget, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Skarbek. I understand your concerns about cost. We can draw the blood today, if you’d like. It’s a quick process – just a few vials. The cost for each titer test is approximately $150, so the total cost for all three would be $450. Your insurance may cover some of this cost – do you have your insurance card with you?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here you are. It's a private plan, but I believe it covers most things. I’ll need to check the details later, of course, but it’s a fairly comprehensive plan. If it doesn’t cover it all, can we set up a payment plan? I don’t want this to be a problem. Getting this sorted for my friend is the priority, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Skarbek. Let me run this through the system to see what your insurance covers. Okay, it looks like your insurance does cover these tests, with a copay of $75 per test, bringing the total out-of-pocket cost to $225. We can draw the blood now, and the lab results should be back within 3-5 business days. Would you like to proceed?
PATIENT: That’s… wonderful news! $225 is manageable. Yes, let’s proceed. The sooner we get this done, the better. Where do we go for the blood draw? And… will I need to fast beforehand? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Our phlebotomist, Sarah, is just down the hall in room 3. You don't need to fast beforehand for these tests, but it’s best to drink plenty of water today. Sarah will explain everything to you. She's very good at what she does. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan for your friend’s visa application. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor Vodzak. You’ve been very helpful and put my mind at ease. I really appreciate your patience and understanding. I’ll go find Sarah now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. And please, give Sarah a moment – she’s currently assisting another patient. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: .
