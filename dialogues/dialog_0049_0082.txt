DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, travel... yeah. I need something for travel. My wife... she wanted me to get checked before we go. But… she’s not here now. It’s… important.
DOCTOR: Travel, alright. And where are you traveling to exactly?
PATIENT: Somewhere… hot. Very hot. And… dusty. I think. She booked it. I don’t really… pay attention to those things. Nepal is… cool. This is not cool. It’s… for the memories, I guess. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Memories. Right. Well, “hot and dusty” doesn’t give me a great deal to work with, Mr. Tayar. Is this a leisure trip, or are you traveling for work?
PATIENT: Work? No. Definitely not work. I have a job, you know. I build… things on planes. Important things. She just… wanted to go. It was her dream. Before… everything. Now it's just… a trip. A sad trip.
DOCTOR: I see. And what specifically is your wife concerned about with this trip?
PATIENT: Concerned? She… she was worried about… bugs. And… sickness. You know, getting sick. She read something… on the computer. About… things you can catch. She wanted me protected. She always worried about things. A lot. Now… I just want to go. But she said to get a… shot? For travel?
DOCTOR: A shot, yes. Well, there are several vaccinations and preventative medications one might consider depending on the location. Do you happen to know where in the world you are traveling to?
PATIENT: Ugh. Look, I told you, I don't know. She handled all the booking. It's… somewhere in Africa, I think? Maybe? She said something about… safari? And… lions? Honestly, I just packed a bag when she told me to. It’s all… a blur. Can't you just… give me something? To not get sick?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand you're frustrated. But I can't simply "give you something" without knowing where you are going. Africa is a very large continent, and the necessary precautions vary significantly based on the specific region. Do you have any paperwork from your wife regarding this trip?
PATIENT: Paperwork? Uh… let me think. She… she left a lot of papers. Bills, mostly. And… recipes. Oh! Here. This. Does this help? It says… Nairobi? Is that a place? It also has a number… for a tour company, I guess.
DOCTOR: Nairobi, Kenya. Alright, that’s something. Kenya does have some specific health concerns we need to address. Have you had any vaccinations in the past?
PATIENT: Vaccinations? Uh… when I was a kid, I think? Something with a needle. But… that was a long time ago. Nepal doesn't really... do a lot of shots. Everything is… natural. I don’t remember anything specific. She always took care of that stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, for travel to Kenya, we’ll want to consider Typhoid, Hepatitis A, and a Yellow Fever vaccination is often recommended. A Tetanus booster is also advisable, if you haven't had one in the last ten years. Do you know when you last had a Tetanus shot?
PATIENT: Tetanus? Is that the one with the… lockjaw? She said something about that once. When I was little, maybe? Honestly, I have no idea. I don't keep track of… needle things. I just… build planes. Is it… important? Can I just skip it? Is it painful?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, skipping vaccinations is not advisable. Lockjaw, as you say, is a very serious condition. And yes, it is important. We will need to determine your vaccination history. Do you have any records – any at all – from a doctor in Nepal?
PATIENT: Records? No. Nepal doctors don't… write things down much. It's more… herbs and talking. She always said I needed to get things checked in… a real hospital. That’s why we came here, right? Before… you know. Honestly, I just want to go and… do what she wanted. Are you saying I have to get a bunch of needles? It sounds awful. Can’t you just give me some pills? To protect me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand your reluctance, but this isn’t simply about making you feel better. We're talking about preventing potentially life-threatening illnesses. Before I can even consider prescribing anything, I need a more comprehensive picture of your health. We'll start with a basic physical exam, and then I'll order some blood work to assess your immunity levels. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? More needles? Honestly, this is… a lot. I just want to go to Africa, and… remember her. Is a physical exam… painful? Can I just take some vitamins? I hear vitamins are good. Maybe a lot of Vitamin C? Will that work?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, with all due respect, vitamins are not a substitute for proper medical care. And yes, a physical exam involves a brief examination of your body - listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, things of that nature. It is not painful. Look, I am trying to help you stay safe while traveling. But I need your cooperation. Can we please proceed with a basic physical exam and some blood work?
PATIENT: Fine. Okay. But… can you be quick? And… gentle? I don’t like needles, or… people touching me. Is there… a lot of touching? Just… tell me what you're doing, okay? I need to know. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will explain everything as I go, and I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. First, I'll check your vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. I’ll also examine your throat and ears. Would you please sit up and loosen your shirt?
PATIENT: Okay… but… please tell me what you’re listening for. And… don't be surprised if I jump. I get… easily startled. Everything is just… a lot right now. This trip was her dream. And I just want to get through it without… something bad happening.
DOCTOR: I’m listening for any unusual sounds in your lungs or heart, Mr. Tayar - anything that might indicate an underlying medical condition. It's perfectly normal to feel a bit anxious during these examinations. Take a deep breath… and exhale slowly. Good. Anything bothering you at all?
PATIENT: No… just… cold. It feels cold. And… tickles a little. I don't like being touched. Can we… hurry? This is making me… uncomfortable. I just want this to be over, so I can go. So I can do what she wanted. It feels… wrong, being here, when she’s not. Everything feels wrong.
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound clear, Mr. Tayar, but your pulse is slightly elevated – likely due to your anxiety. Now, I’d like to examine your throat. Please open your mouth and say "ahhh." And please try to relax. The sooner we finish this exam, the sooner we can discuss appropriate preventative measures for your trip.
PATIENT: Ahhh… That’s… cold, and… plastic-y. It makes me gag. Can we… get this over with soon? I feel… dizzy. I think I’m going to be sick. Everything is just… too much. I just want to go home. Even Africa doesn’t seem worth this right now. It’s just… a sad trip.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s enough for now. Your throat looks normal, but your elevated pulse and anxiety are concerning. Given your history and current state, I’m going to order a comprehensive blood work panel to assess your overall health and immune levels. And, frankly, I strongly recommend delaying your trip until we have those results and can determine a safe course of action. I'll write you a requisition form for the lab. It's located just down the hall. Do you need assistance getting there?
PATIENT: Delay the trip? No… I can’t. I promised her. She… she planned everything. It’s all I have left of her. I have to go. I just… need something to make me feel better. Something for the nerves. Maybe some pills? Please. I don't want to delay. I just want to get through it. I just want to remember her. Is there anything… anything you can give me right now? To calm me down?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand your grief, but taking medication without a proper diagnosis and against my professional advice is not the answer. I am not going to simply prescribe something to “calm your nerves.” I'm concerned about your physical and emotional state. You are exhibiting signs of significant anxiety and distress. Before we proceed any further, I am recommending a consultation with a mental health professional. I can provide you with a referral to a qualified therapist who can help you cope with your grief and anxiety. And frankly, given your reluctance to delay the trip, I strongly advise you postpone it until you’ve had the opportunity to speak with someone. This is for your own wellbeing, Mr. Tayar. It’s important to prioritize your health.
PATIENT: No… no therapist. I don't need a therapist. I just need to go. Just… let me go. I just want to be done with this. This is… too much. All of it. I promised her. And… she always knew best. Just… give me the form for the blood work. I'll go. I'll go right now. And then… just leave me alone. .
