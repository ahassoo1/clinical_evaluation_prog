DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me – and try to be concise – what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s this cough, you see. It just won’t go away. Been hacking at it for…oh, goodness, nearly a month now, I’d say. Feels worse when I lie down, makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a month. Maybe a little longer, honestly. It started small, just a tickle, but now…well, now it really bothers me. Especially at night. I have to prop myself up with pillows, you know? It feels like something's stuck, but I can’t seem to cough it up.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this cough?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My ankles…they’ve been swelling something awful. I didn’t think much of it at first, thought it was just the heat, but they’re puffy even in the mornings now. And I get so tired, Doctor. Just…completely wiped out. Even after a good nap. It's more than usual, you understand.
DOCTOR: Swollen ankles and fatigue...right. Any fever, chills, or night sweats accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. And no chills or night sweats. Just tired and…winded, even walking to the kitchen. It’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I used to be so active. But this…it feels different. Makes me feel weak.
DOCTOR: Weakness... Are you experiencing any chest pain or shortness of breath with the cough, Ms. Sadhu?
PATIENT: Well, not exactly pain, Doctor. But my chest feels tight sometimes, like someone’s sitting on it. And yes, definitely short of breath. Especially when I try to do anything… like climb the stairs, or even just get dressed. It's not a sharp pain, just…uncomfortable. A squeezing feeling, maybe? It goes away if I rest, but it's worrying me.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. Let’s have a listen to your lungs, and I’ll need to check your ankles. Please sit forward.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. It’s just…I get so anxious when I can’t breathe properly. It reminds me of my late husband…he had trouble with his breathing too, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Take a deep breath in…and out… again… and out… There’s some…wheezing, I’m hearing. And your ankles are quite swollen, as you mentioned. Pitting edema present bilaterally. Now, have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes to the weight. I’ve definitely gained a few pounds, Doctor. Maybe five or six? It’s hard to say exactly, I don’t weigh myself every day. And my appetite…well, it comes and goes. Some days I could eat a whole roast chicken, other days I just pick at my food. It’s mostly the salty things I crave, you know? Pickles, olives… things I shouldn’t be eating.
DOCTOR: Weight gain, appetite changes, salt cravings…Wheezing and edema… Right. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that’s it. And I’ve always been able to take any antibiotic the doctor prescribed. My mother always said I had a strong stomach.
DOCTOR: And what is the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure, Ms. Sadhu?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It’s a small white pill… Doctor Ramirez prescribed it, years ago now. It begins with an ‘L’…Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril. I take one every morning with my breakfast. I hope I’m remembering correctly… my memory isn't what it used to be. But I’ve been taking it faithfully, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Very well. Ms. Sadhu, based on your symptoms and what you've told me, it appears you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with heart failure. However, we need to confirm this with some blood tests and possibly a chest X-ray. I'm ordering those now. In the meantime, I advise you to severely restrict your salt intake and limit your fluid consumption. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Heart failure? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good. My husband…he had that too, didn’t he? Restrict salt and fluids, you say? I understand. But what does “severely” mean? Like, no pickles at all? And how much fluid…I drink a lot of water, you see. Is that bad? I just want to be clear, Doctor. This is a little… frightening.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sadhu, "severely" means no added salt – no pickles, no olives, no processed foods, no canned soups. Read the labels carefully. As for fluids, limit yourself to 2 liters—that’s approximately 8 glasses—per day. It’s understandable to be concerned, but we must gather more information. The tests will help us determine the best course of action. I'm also going to write you a referral to a cardiologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Do you have any questions before I proceed with the test orders?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Oh dear, that sounds…serious. Is it very bad, Doctor? And two liters…that’s not very much water, is it? I always thought drinking plenty of water was good for you. And… Will the tests hurt? I don’t like needles much. This is all happening so fast, you see. It’s a bit overwhelming. Perhaps you could explain a little more about the heart failure… what does that mean, exactly?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sadhu, I understand your anxiety, but I only have a limited amount of time. Heart failure doesn't necessarily mean your heart is stopping; it simply means it's not pumping as efficiently as it should be. This causes fluid to build up in your body, leading to symptoms like swelling and shortness of breath. The tests - a blood draw and a chest X-ray - are routine and relatively painless. The blood draw will involve a small prick, and the X-ray is non-invasive. I'm ordering these tests to determine the severity of the situation, and based on those results, the cardiologist will outline a comprehensive treatment plan. I’ve written down the fluid restriction guidelines, and the lab requisition form for the blood work. Please schedule the tests as soon as possible. Do you have any further questions, or are we finished?
PATIENT: Oh…I see. A treatment plan… that sounds…reassuring, I suppose. And no…I don’t think I have any more questions right now, Doctor. I'll try to get the tests done as soon as I can. Thank you…for explaining everything. And thank you for being patient with me. My memory…well, you understand. I suppose I should be going then. Tell your mother I said hello. Or… someone’s mother. It’s polite, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Sadhu. Have a good day. And goodbye to someone’s mother, indeed… .
