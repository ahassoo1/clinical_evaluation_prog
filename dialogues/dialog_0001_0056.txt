DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer, have a seat. Eighty-seven, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor… Pehrson, is it? Quite. Though I fail to see what my age has to do with… well, with anything. Let's get this over with, shall we? I have a great deal to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course. Look, I've got a waiting room full of people, so let’s just cut to the chase. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Really, the impudence. I was referred, you see. Workplace… difficulties. Though I assure you, I am perfectly capable. It's the… standards of the younger generation. Utterly lacking. But, fine. Stress, they called it. A ridiculous diagnosis, if you ask me. But my… ex-wife insisted. Honestly, the woman…
DOCTOR: Right, stress. Okay. And what specifically is causing this "stress"?
PATIENT: It's… the students. The sheer lack of respect for knowledge, for proper research… They rely on these… electronic devices for everything. No dedication to actual learning. And the administration panders to them, naturally. It’s… demoralizing, to say the least. Honestly, I’ve been a Library Science Teacher for… a very long time. Things weren’t always like this.
DOCTOR: Library Science… Okay. So, you're feeling stressed because of interactions with students?
PATIENT: "Stressed" is such a… common term. Let's say I find their behaviour… profoundly disappointing. And exhausting. It requires… constant correction. And they simply don’t listen. It's a waste of my time, frankly. A complete waste. I used to have such… bright students. Dedicated scholars. Now…? It's just… noise.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is impacting your… daily life?
PATIENT: Impacting? A rather dramatic word. It… requires more effort to prepare for classes, to… counteract their misguided notions. And I find myself… less inclined to engage with colleagues. Honestly, they don't understand the importance of proper cataloging systems. It's… draining. I simply wish they’d let me teach without all this… interference. Is this sufficient, Doctor? I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Sleeping? Perfectly adequate. Though I do find my mind… racing sometimes. Recalling… instances of proper methodology, superior research. It’s… a constant effort to maintain standards, you see. It’s not trouble sleeping, it's… intellectual diligence. Do you always ask such… vague questions, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Any changes in appetite?
PATIENT: I eat when I am hungry. I don’t require a detailed inventory of my dietary habits. Honestly, Doctor, this is quite unnecessary. It’s perfectly adequate. A small breakfast, a reasonable lunch, a light supper. I assure you, my health is not the issue here. It’s the… intellectual decline of the student body. That is the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any… feelings of hopelessness, or loss of interest in things you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: Hopelessness? Loss of interest? Good heavens, no! I find intellectual stimulation in maintaining standards! Correcting errors! It's… a duty, Doctor. A moral imperative. I simply have no patience for… mediocrity. Honestly, the very suggestion is… insulting. I assure you, I am perfectly capable, and perfectly engaged. Now, if you'll excuse me… is there anything you need to ask me, or shall we conclude this… charade?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Based on what you've told me… it sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of work-related stress and frustration. I'm going to recommend some… resources for coping with workplace difficulties. I'll write you a referral to a therapist. .
PATIENT: A therapist? Absolutely not! I require no… coddling. This is preposterous! I am a perfectly rational, capable individual. I have endured a great deal in my life, and I assure you, a few… ill-mannered students will not require professional intervention. This is a complete waste of time. Good day, Doctor. And frankly, I question your… judgment. .
