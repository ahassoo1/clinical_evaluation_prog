DOCTOR: Good morning, Carla. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It’s really bothering me. Not all over, really, mostly on my arms and back. It just… drives me crazy!
DOCTOR: Alright, itchy skin... mostly on your arms and back, you said. And how long has this been going on, Carla?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… maybe a month or so? It started small, just a little annoyance, but it’s gotten worse over the past week or so. It’s not like a rash, just… really, really itchy. It doesn't seem to be getting better on its own, that’s why I thought I should come in.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month, gradually worsening. And you haven’t noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really paid close attention, to be honest. I guess… warm showers seem to help for a little bit, but then it comes right back. And maybe when I'm stressed? I feel like it gets itchier when I’m worried about something. But I could be imagining that. You know, old lady things.
DOCTOR: No, that's very helpful information, Carla. Stress absolutely can play a role in skin conditions. And warm showers providing temporary relief is good to know. Now, have you been using any new soaps, lotions, detergents, or anything like that recently?
PATIENT: Oh, good! I'm glad that's helpful. Let me think… No, not really. I’ve been using the same stuff for years. I try to keep things simple, you know? I do use a new fabric softener, though. My granddaughter, she bought it for me. It's called… Lavender Breeze, I think? It smells really nice, but maybe that’s it? I hadn’t thought about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lavender Breeze fabric softener. That's a good thing to consider. Sometimes fragrances and dyes can irritate the skin. Now, besides the itch, have you noticed any redness, bumps, blisters, or any changes in the texture of your skin at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. It really is just the itch. My skin looks normal, I think. Maybe a little dry, but I always have to put lotion on. Especially in the summer with the air conditioning. I don’t see any redness or bumps, though. It's just… this constant itching! It’s so distracting, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand, Carla. Constant itching can be very distressing. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: No, nothing else really. I mean, I'm an old lady, Doctor! A few aches and pains, you know? But nothing new that I can think of. No fever, no fatigue, no weight loss… just the itching. Is this something serious? I hope it's not anything too bad.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking, Carla, and it's good you’re telling me everything. It's unlikely to be anything serious based on what you've described so far, but we need to rule some things out to be sure. Now, do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Well, not that I know of! I’ve never really had any bad reactions to anything. I eat all sorts of things, I don't have trouble with pets… I did have a little trouble with poison ivy when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. My mother always said I had tough skin.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, Carla?
PATIENT: Let me think… just my blood pressure medicine. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. I’ve been taking it for years. And sometimes I take Tylenol for aches and pains, but that’s it. Nothing regular, really. Just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, and Tylenol as needed. Now, just one more question about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was a long time ago, maybe thirty years or so? And I had pneumonia once, but I recovered just fine. Oh, and I broke my wrist when I fell last year, but that's about it. Nothing else serious, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Carla. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I'd like to take a quick look at your skin, if you're comfortable with that. Just to get a better idea of what we're dealing with. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I'm ready when you are. I just hope it’s not something too terrible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Carla. I don’t see any obvious rash, blisters, or anything alarming, which is good. Your skin is a little dry, as you mentioned, but overall it looks quite normal. I do see some very subtle scratch marks, consistent with itching. Based on everything you’ve told me, and the examination, it's possible this is a case of simple dry skin aggravated by something like the new fabric softener. However, sometimes itching can be a symptom of other underlying conditions, so I'd like to do a quick blood test just to rule those out. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: A blood test? Oh, alright, if you think it’s necessary. I don’t like needles, but I understand. Better to be safe than sorry, I suppose. It’s just… this itching is driving me crazy! I’m hoping we can figure out what’s causing it soon.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carla. And you're right, it's best to get to the bottom of this. The blood test will help us rule out things like liver problems, thyroid issues, and other potential causes of itching. It’s a routine test, and we’ll get the results back fairly quickly. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a few things you can try at home. First, stop using the Lavender Breeze fabric softener, just to see if that makes a difference. Second, use a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day, especially after showering. And third, try to avoid hot showers and baths, as they can dry out your skin. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. I can definitely stop using that fabric softener. My granddaughter won’t mind, I’m sure. And I have some lotion somewhere… I'll have to dig it out. And I’ll try to take cooler showers. I do like a hot shower, but I can manage. Will the blood test tell us for sure what’s wrong? Or might we need to do more tests after that?
DOCTOR: The blood test will help us narrow down the possibilities, Carla. It’s a good starting point. If the results are normal, it’s likely simple dry skin or an allergic reaction, and we can focus on managing the symptoms with the moisturizer and avoiding potential irritants. However, if the results are abnormal, we might need to do further testing to determine the underlying cause. But let's not worry about that right now. Let's focus on the blood test first. I’ll write you a lab order, and you can go to the lab downstairs whenever you're ready. They’re open until 5 PM today. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Downstairs, okay. That’s easy enough. You've been very helpful, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's nice to feel like someone is actually trying to figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Carla. That's my job, and I’m happy to help. I understand how frustrating it can be when you're dealing with something like this. Now, I’ll go ahead and write that lab order for you. And if you don’t hear anything back within a few days, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’ll get those results as quickly as possible. Here’s the order. Do you have any other concerns I can address before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel a little better just knowing we're looking into it. I'll head downstairs now. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You too, Carla. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And I hope you find some relief soon. Take care.
