DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Durig. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good afternoon, Doctor. Yes, well... it's my liver, I believe. Or something with my liver. It’s…yellowish. A friend mentioned something about jaundice, and that sounded right. It’s been…a bit of a worry. I’d like to get it sorted, if you don't mind. Quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Jaundice, you say. And how long have you observed this…yellowing, Ms. Durig?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long? That’s a tricky one. It feels like… a few weeks, perhaps? It’s hard to say exactly. Time… slips away, you know? I noticed it when I was getting ready for a visit with my niece… or was it my nephew? Anyway, it was when I was looking in the mirror and thought I looked… unwell. I really can’t be certain of the date, I'm afraid. It’s just… been there.
DOCTOR: A few weeks. Vague estimations are…unhelpful, Ms. Durig. Has this yellowing been constant, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: Oh, I apologize, Doctor. I truly do. It is constant, I think. Yes, I believe so. It hasn’t… faded and returned. It’s just… there. A steady… yellow. And I feel rather tired, but then again, don’t we all as we get older? I’m not sure if that’s related, of course. I just thought I should mention it. Is this taking long? I have a… a commitment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: We are attempting to ascertain the severity of your condition, Ms. Durig. Fatigue can be indicative of several underlying issues. Now, have you experienced any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain… hmm. Not exactly pain, Doctor. More of a… discomfort. A sort of ache, perhaps? It comes and goes, really. Nothing severe enough to warrant a visit to the emergency room, if that's what you're asking. It's just… a dull feeling, sometimes. And it’s often after I eat. Does that… matter? I really do wish I could remember more details. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It may or may not be relevant, Ms. Durig. What do you typically eat?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I try to eat healthily. Lots of… vegetables, you know? And… chicken, sometimes. I used to cook a lot more, but it’s just me now, and… it feels pointless to make a large meal. I do enjoy a bit of baklava now and then, if my niece brings it. And tea, of course. Lots and lots of tea. Is baklava bad? I wouldn’t want that to be the cause of all this trouble! It’s a family recipe.
DOCTOR: I doubt the baklava is solely responsible, Ms. Durig. Have you noticed any changes in your stool color?
PATIENT: Oh… stool color? That's a… rather personal question, Doctor. Well, it's been… lighter, I suppose. Not… normal. Paler than usual. But I… I don't pay much attention to such things, if I'm honest. Is that important? Perhaps I should have brought a sample? I didn’t realize… I really am not very good at this, am I? This is rather stressful.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Ms. Durig. Lighter stools, combined with jaundice and fatigue, warrants further investigation. Now, have you had any recent travel?
PATIENT: Recent travel? No, no, not at all. I haven't left the city in… oh, goodness, years. Decades, perhaps? I used to enjoy visiting family in… well, it doesn't matter now. I haven't been back in a very long time. I mostly stay home, and visit with my niece… or nephew. It's hard to keep track. No, no travel, Doctor. I can assure you of that. Is this nearly over? I have… a bridge game scheduled.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us proceed with a physical examination. Please, lie down on the table. I need to palpate your abdomen. And please refrain from mentioning your social engagements, Ms. Durig. It is… unhelpful.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A physical examination… very well. Though I must say, I’m not particularly fond of being prodded and poked. But if it helps… Please be gentle, Doctor. And do hurry, if you wouldn't mind. It’s… rather uncomfortable, you know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Slight distension. Liver feels… enlarged and firm. As expected. I will need to order some blood work to assess your liver function. And a complete metabolic panel. We need to determine the cause of this jaundice. It could be a multitude of factors.
PATIENT: Oh… that doesn’t sound good, does it? Enlarged and firm… What does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? And what sort of… factors could it be? Is it… contagious? I haven’t been feeling well lately, but I didn’t want to worry anyone. This is all very upsetting. I really wish I’d just stayed home.
DOCTOR: Let us not jump to conclusions, Ms. Durig. It could be a simple infection, or… something more chronic. We need the lab results before we can ascertain the severity. As for contagiousness, jaundice itself is not typically contagious, but the underlying cause may be. The nurse will draw your blood now. I will review the results as soon as they become available. Until then, I recommend avoiding alcohol and fatty foods. And please, refrain from self-diagnosing with information from the internet. It only exacerbates anxiety. Now, if you will excuse me, I have other patients awaiting my attention. The nurse will guide you to the lab.
PATIENT: Oh… very well. Alcohol and fatty foods… I suppose I can manage that. I do appreciate your time, Doctor. Though I must say, I’m feeling rather anxious now. And… what if it is something serious? I suppose I should go get the blood work done. Thank you, Doctor. .
