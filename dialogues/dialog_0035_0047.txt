DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Uh… well, it’s about… long-term care, I think? My daughter, she set this up. I don’t… I don’t rightly remember all the details. Something about… making sure I’m covered, if I… need things later on? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Rover. It's common to feel a little overwhelmed with these things. So, it sounds like your daughter is thinking ahead about potential future care needs, and wants to make sure everything is in place. Let's start with what you're experiencing right now. Are you having any specific health concerns or symptoms that brought you in, or is this mostly a planning appointment?
PATIENT: Mostly planning, I think. I… feel alright, mostly. A little stiff in the mornings, you know? Old age, I guess. And my memory ain’t what it used to be, but… that’s been happening for a while now. Not a sudden thing. I get… confused sometimes. But nothing major, not that I can recall. Is that what you want to know? I just… want to be sure I don’t cause my daughter too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. "Stiff in the mornings" and some memory concerns… let's explore those a little more. When you say “confused sometimes,” can you give me an example?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, like… yesterday I went to the store for milk, and… I ended up looking for tools. Completely forgot why I was there! My daughter had to remind me. It's little things like that. Sometimes I forget names, even people I’ve known a long time. Or… I’ll start a story, and then… lose my train of thought. It's frustrating, mostly for her, I think. I don't always notice it's happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Mr. Rover. Those examples are very helpful. It sounds like you’re experiencing some forgetfulness and difficulty with recall, which can be concerning. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed this memory loss getting worse over time?
PATIENT: Yeah… I think so. It… used to be just forgetting where I put things, or a name here or there. But now… it feels more frequent. Like… I worry more about forgetting important things. Like appointments, or… what day it is sometimes. My daughter says I repeat myself a lot, too. I don't always realize I'm doing it. It's hard to say for sure, Doc. Things just… feel a bit cloudier than they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any falls or changes in your balance recently?
PATIENT: Falls? Not recently, no. But… I do feel a little unsteady sometimes, especially when I stand up quickly. And… I trip over things more than I used to. Nothing major, just little stumbles. I try to be careful. My daughter worries about me falling, she’s always telling me to watch my step. I think my legs are just… weaker than they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… Doc, it's been a while since I've seen a doctor regularly. I… think I had high blood pressure, years ago. They put me on some pills for it, but I stopped taking them a long time back. I wasn’t feeling right, so I just… stopped. Probably shouldn't have, I know. And… I had a bad bout of pneumonia a few years ago, almost didn’t make it. But other than that… I can't really recall anything major. I used to be pretty healthy, worked hard all my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in the past, and a bout of pneumonia a few years ago. Do you recall what medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. It was a little white pill, I think? Doc, I’m bad with names and numbers, always have been. My daughter handles most of the medicine stuff, she keeps track of everything. I just… took what she gave me. I don’t remember the name of it, or how much I took. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Rover. We can look up your medication history if you've filled prescriptions at a local pharmacy. Do you know which pharmacy you typically use?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I go to… the one down on Main Street? The big one, with the drive-through. I think it’s called… Swanson’s? Yeah, Swanson’s Pharmacy. My daughter usually picks up my prescriptions, so she knows for sure. But I go there, pretty regularly. She’s always telling me to get my flu shot there too.
DOCTOR: Okay, Swanson's Pharmacy. Let me check their records to see what medications you've been prescribed. Okay, here we are. It looks like you were prescribed Lisinopril for high blood pressure, and you stopped refilling it about five years ago. And you've had regular flu vaccinations. Now, before we move on, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doc, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's about it. My daughter gives me one now and then. Nothing else. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and berries. I don't like taking a lot of pills. Makes me feel… sluggish. I just want to be sure I’m not forgetting anything important, for her sake.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a multivitamin occasionally, and nothing else regularly. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, that I can recall. I eat pretty much anything. My daughter always asks, but I always tell her no. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. But… I did get a bad rash once, when I was a kid, from poison ivy. But that wasn't a medicine, was it? Just a plant. I think I’m alright with everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any family members who have experienced memory loss, dementia, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one, Doc. My mother… she got… confused towards the end. My daughter says it might have been Alzheimer’s, but nobody really talked about it much back then. Just said she got old and… faded away. My father… he was always sharp as a tack, right up until the day he died. I don’t… I don't really know much about other family members. We didn't see them much. It was a long time ago. I think… maybe an uncle had some trouble remembering things, but I’m not sure. It's all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay. So your mother experienced some memory loss towards the end of her life, possibly Alzheimer’s, and maybe an uncle had similar issues. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I used to be a fisherman, out on the Bering Sea. Hard work, long hours. But I retired a few years back. Now I mostly… stay home. Watch TV, read the paper. My daughter comes over a lot, helps me out. I used to go for walks, but my legs aren't what they used to be. I don’t… really do much these days. I like to sit on the porch, watch the birds. Quiet life, I guess. I don't drink much, maybe a beer now and then. Never smoked. I try to eat healthy, like I said. Just… taking it easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a retired fisherman, mostly staying home now. That’s good. And finally, do you have any concerns about your mental health, like feelings of sadness, anxiety, or depression?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes I get a little… down. Mostly when I think about my wife. She’s been gone a long time now. And… I worry about being a burden to my daughter. She does so much for me. But… I don’t… really get sad, not for long. Just… quiet. I mostly try not to think about things too much. I guess… I’m just old, and things are changing. But no, Doc, I wouldn’t say I’m depressed or anything. Just… tired. Mostly tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rover. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. I appreciate your honesty. Based on what you've told me—the memory loss, the occasional stumbles, the history of high blood pressure, and your mother’s experience—I think it’s important to do some further investigation. It could be a number of things, and it's best to rule things out. I’d like to start with a brief physical exam, just to check your balance, reflexes, and overall health. And then, I'd like to order some blood tests to check for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other conditions that can affect memory and cognition. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah… that sounds… alright, Doc. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, and… make sure I’m not going to be a bigger trouble to my daughter. Blood tests, physical exam… sure. Just tell me what I need to do. I trust your judgment. Just… don’t make it too complicated. I get confused easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly understandable, Mr. Rover. We'll keep it as simple as possible. Let’s start with the physical exam. I’m going to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll ask you to do a few simple balance tests. Nothing to worry about, just stand up and walk a few steps. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah… that’s fine, Doc. Sounds easy enough. Just… try to be gentle. My legs are a bit shaky today. And… if I start to forget what you’re asking me to do, just… tell me again. Slow and easy is best. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not too concerning given your history. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to ask you to stand up slowly. Good. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There… that’s a few steps. It’s a bit… shaky, Doc. I don’t like walking without something to hold onto. My legs are just… weak, I guess. Is that alright? Am I doing it right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Rover, that's perfectly alright. You're doing fine. It's good you recognize you feel unsteady. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not necessarily a cause for concern at your age. Overall, your exam shows some mild balance issues and diminished reflexes, which could be related to age or other factors. But to get a clearer picture, we really need those blood tests. I’ll write you a requisition, and you can get those done at the lab down the street. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah… that sounds good, Doc. Blood tests, okay. I’ll… try to remember where the lab is. And… what I need to tell them. I’m worried I’ll forget something. Maybe my daughter can come with me? She's better at remembering things. But yeah… I’ll try. Just… write it down nice and big, if you don't mind. And tell me again what they’re looking for. Just so I know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will write everything down clearly and in large print for you. Here you go. It’s for a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a vitamin B12 level. These tests will help rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. It's a good idea if your daughter accompanies you, if you're comfortable with that. She can help you remember everything. And don't worry, the lab technicians are very helpful, and they'll guide you through the process. Once you have the results, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me, and we’ll discuss them and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah… that sounds good, Doc. Thank you. Complete blood count… thyroid… B12… I’ll try to remember. And… I’ll see if my daughter can come with me. She’s always so helpful. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doc. I feel a little… less worried now. Still a bit confused, but… less worried. What’s the best way to schedule the follow-up? Do I call the office?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rover. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. You can schedule the follow-up appointment by calling the office at 555-123-4567. Just let the receptionist know you were seen by Dr. Alzoubi and are following up on blood test results. They’ll be happy to find a time that works for you. Is there anything else I can answer for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doc… I think that’s all. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you again. I guess… I’ll go get those tests done. And… call the office to schedule the follow-up. I appreciate your patience with me. It’s… hard to remember everything these days. But… I’ll try. Thank you, Doc. Really.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Rover. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. Have a good day, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment.
