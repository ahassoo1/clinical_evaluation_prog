DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kinjerski. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been experiencing some… well, numbness in my leg. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Numbness, you say. And how long is “a little while” exactly?
PATIENT: About three weeks, I’d estimate. It started gradually, just a slight tingling, really. Now it’s… more consistent. It’s primarily in my left leg, from the thigh down to my foot. It doesn't come and go so much anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. And would you describe it as completely numb, or more of a… loss of sensation?
PATIENT: It’s not completely gone, no. It’s… diminished. Like wearing a thick sock, maybe? I can still feel things, if I concentrate, or if it’s something very strong – like very hot or very cold. But everyday sensations… they’re muted. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Muted" is a good way to put it. And has anything specific brought it on, or made it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven’t been able to pinpoint anything specific, to be honest. I do a fair amount of walking, as I travel for work sometimes, and I spend a lot of hours sitting while animating, but the numbness doesn’t seem to be directly related to either. It just… is. I can recall the weather patterns during the three weeks, if that would be helpful? It was fairly warm for most of it.
DOCTOR: The weather… interesting. While I appreciate the detail, I suspect that’s unlikely to be the primary cause. Let’s focus on your body. Besides the numbness, have you noticed any weakness in your leg?
PATIENT: Weakness… yes, actually. Thinking about it, I have noticed it’s a bit harder to lift my left leg when I’m walking, particularly stairs. It's not severe, and I haven’t tripped or anything, but it requires a little more effort than my right leg. I hadn’t consciously connected it to the numbness until you asked, but now that I think about it, they seem to go hand-in-hand.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this weakness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s fairly constant, I’d say. It's not like it vanishes entirely at any point. It’s subtle, but it’s always there, requiring a bit more conscious effort. It doesn’t get dramatically worse at any specific time of day, as far as I can tell. I can recall precise times, if you'd like? I keep a fairly detailed schedule.
DOCTOR: While I admire your meticulous record-keeping, Mr. Kinjerski, precise times aren’t necessary at this stage. We’re looking for patterns, not a minute-by-minute account. Let's move on. Have you experienced any pain alongside the numbness and weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, apologies. I sometimes… overshare details, I suppose. No, no significant pain. There’s occasionally a slight ache, a dull throb, but it’s infrequent and very mild. It’s not sharp, or debilitating, or anything like that. It’s easily dismissed, really. I can recall the precise instances when I've experienced it, if that would be of use? It's usually after prolonged sitting, I believe.
DOCTOR: Right. Prolonged sitting. We'll get to the root of this. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions – diabetes, perhaps?
PATIENT: No, sir. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I have regular check-ups with my family doctor back home in Alaska, and everything has always been… normal. I can recall the dates of my last three check-ups, if you’d like the specifics? It's November 14th, 2023, May 2nd, 2024, and February 18th, 2025. All routine physicals, no concerning findings. I do have private insurance, so I’ve never avoided seeing a doctor when necessary.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, sir, I haven’t. No surgeries of any kind. I've never broken any bones, either. I'm fairly careful, generally. I can recall specific instances where I've avoided potential injuries, if you'd like? It's a rather long list, I suppose, but I have a good memory. Mostly related to hiking and fieldwork.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kinjerski, while I appreciate your… thoroughness, we need to be efficient. Let's stick to the essentials. Family history. Any history of neurological conditions – multiple sclerosis, perhaps?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. My apologies. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, suffered from what the doctors called “peripheral neuropathy” later in life. She lived a long life, but she experienced some similar symptoms – numbness and weakness in her extremities. I can recall the specific dates of her diagnosis and treatment, if you'd find that relevant? It was approximately ten years before her passing, in 2015, I believe. I recall her doctor’s name was Dr. Anya Rostova, in Anchorage.
DOCTOR: Peripheral neuropathy. That is… pertinent. And your parents?
PATIENT: My parents are both healthy, as far as I know. My mother has some mild arthritis in her hands, but nothing debilitating. My father has no known medical conditions. He's a fisherman, very active, still works full-time. I can recall the precise dates of their last medical check-ups, if that would be useful? Both have regular appointments with Dr. Samuel Olsen in Nome. I believe their last appointments were in June of this year.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, sir, I do not smoke. Never have. I occasionally drink alcohol, socially – a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, or a beer with friends. But I wouldn’t say I drink regularly. I maintain a fairly healthy diet, mostly fish and vegetables, given my upbringing. I can recall the precise contents of my last five meals, if you’d like a detailed account? It’s mostly salmon, halibut, and locally grown berries.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, sir, I am not. I don’t take any prescription medications, or even over-the-counter drugs, unless absolutely necessary. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. I occasionally use a topical ointment for muscle soreness, but that’s it. I can recall the precise ingredients of the ointment, if you'd like a comprehensive list? It’s a blend of arnica, lavender, and chamomile, made by a local herbalist.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’m going to need to perform a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with neurological assessment.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m happy to comply. Please let me know if there’s anything specific I should be doing, or if you’d like me to adjust my position in any way. I can recall various anatomical positions, if that would be of use during the examination?
DOCTOR: Alright. Relax your legs. Now, let’s check your reflexes. …Patellar reflex is 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflex is also 2+ bilaterally. Now, can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can feel that. It feels… like a slight prickling, or vibration. Is that normal? I can recall the precise frequency and amplitude of the vibration, if that would be helpful? It’s approximately 50 Hertz, and a rather low amplitude, I believe.
DOCTOR: Now, tell me if you can feel this. …Good. Sensation is intact to light touch bilaterally. Now, close your eyes. I'm going to move your foot up and down, and you tell me which direction I'm moving it.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can feel that as well. Up… now down… now up again. I believe you’re alternating between dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. I can recall the precise angles of each movement, if that would be useful? Approximately 20 degrees dorsiflexion and 30 degrees plantarflexion, I estimate.
DOCTOR: Now, I want you to resist me as I try to move your leg. Don’t push too hard, just maintain resistance. …Knee extension 5/5 bilaterally. Knee flexion 4+/5 on the left, 5/5 on the right. Ankle dorsiflexion 4/5 on the left, 5/5 on the right. Ankle plantarflexion 5/5 bilaterally. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No significant tenderness. I can feel the pressure, of course, but it’s not painful. Perhaps a slight discomfort in the calf muscle on my left leg, but it’s very mild. I can recall the precise location and intensity of the discomfort, if that would be useful? It’s approximately three centimeters distal to the popliteal fossa, and a 2 out of 10 on the pain scale, I estimate.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, sit up. I want to observe your gait. Please walk a few steps forward, then backward, then on your heels, then on your toes.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is there anything specific you’d like me to focus on during my gait? I can recall the precise length of each stride, the angle of my feet, and the rate of my cadence, if that would be useful?
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s enough. Based on my examination, and your history, I suspect you may be experiencing early signs of peripheral neuropathy. The decreased sensation, the mild weakness, and the family history are all consistent with this diagnosis. However, to confirm this, we’ll need to run some further tests. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a nerve conduction study. The nerve conduction study will help us determine the extent of the nerve damage. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is… concerning, but I appreciate your thoroughness. A nerve conduction study… is that painful? And what are the potential causes of peripheral neuropathy, given my lifestyle? I can recall various neurological texts detailing potential etiologies, if that would be helpful? I’m primarily concerned about identifying and addressing the underlying cause. I can also recall my recent travel history, if that would be relevant?
DOCTOR: The nerve conduction study involves small electrical impulses. It’s not particularly painful, but it can be slightly uncomfortable. It’s similar to a mild muscle twitch. As for the causes… given your lifestyle, it’s less likely to be related to things like diabetes or alcoholism. However, it could be caused by a vitamin deficiency, although your diet seems relatively healthy. It can also be caused by certain autoimmune conditions, or even compression of the nerves. Less likely, but we need to rule out other possibilities. We’ll need to look at the test results before we can determine the exact cause. In the meantime, I recommend you take a multivitamin and avoid any activities that exacerbate your symptoms. I’m not ordering any imaging at this time. I’ll have the lab draw blood now, and we’ll schedule the nerve conduction study for next week. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. A multivitamin and avoiding exacerbating activities… certainly. I can recall various formulations of multivitamins, if you have a specific recommendation? And I appreciate you ruling out some of the more common causes. It’s reassuring. I also recall reading about various physical therapy modalities that may be beneficial for neuropathy. Is it too early to consider those? And could you please clarify the scheduling process for the nerve conduction study?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Kinjerski, let’s take things one step at a time. Ordering a physical therapy regimen before we have a diagnosis is premature, and frankly, a waste of your time and money. We need to identify the underlying cause first. As for the multivitamin, any standard multivitamin will do. I don't need a detailed breakdown of every formulation. The nurse will schedule the nerve conduction study for you before you leave. It will be at the imaging center downtown. They’ll contact you directly with the appointment details. Do you have any further questions, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I apologize for my… thoroughness. I simply wish to be proactive in my healthcare. I understand your recommendation to await the results of the nerve conduction study before pursuing any further interventions. I will await the nurse to schedule the appointment. No, I believe that concludes my questions at this time. Thank you for your time and expertise.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you shortly. You’ll receive a call with the lab results in a few days. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. .
