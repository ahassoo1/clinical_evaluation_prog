DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I'm Dr. Rosanova. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh. Morning to you. They tell me I gotta come. For checkin’. From the mine. No sickness, mind you. Just…checkin’. They worried 'bout the dust, I suppose. Always worryin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A check-up prompted by your work at the mine, mostly out of an abundance of caution regarding the dust. That's very responsible of them. Let me pull up your information... Delmon Bigger, 86 years old. Alright. Just to be thorough, even though you're not feeling sick, I like to get a full picture. Have you noticed any changes recently – anything at all, even if it seems small?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. What kind of changes? Old age is a change, isn't it? Everything aches a bit more than it used to, if that’s what you mean. But that’s just gettin’ old. Not the dust. I been workin’ in that mine a long time. Dust never bothered me.
DOCTOR: You're right, aches and pains can certainly come with age. And it’s good you haven’t felt directly affected by the dust. But even if you don't feel sick, some things can develop slowly. So, let’s try to be specific. Any changes in your breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? I breathe. Always have. Same as yesterday, same as last week. Maybe a little harder when I climb the stairs to my room, but I ain’t a young man anymore. That staircase is long, you know. Very long. It’s not the mine, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, stairs are a good benchmark. And you’re right to point out the effort is expected with age. Just making sure we cover everything. Have you noticed any coughing?
PATIENT: Coughing? Sometimes. A little tickle in my throat. Old man cough, you know? Happens when the air is dry. I drink water. Stops it. Not a bad cough. Not like… like those folks with the sickness.
DOCTOR: A dry cough that comes and goes… good to know. And you're right to distinguish it from a more concerning cough. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?
PATIENT: Energy? Less, of course. What sixty-year-old has the same energy as a twenty-year-old? I sleep more now. Used to be able to work all day and still dance all night. Now I sit in my chair. Everything changes.
DOCTOR: That’s very true. Energy levels do naturally change with time. Okay, let’s switch gears a little. Have you had any recent weight loss or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Maybe a little. My wife, bless her soul, she always made sure I ate enough. Since she passed… I eat. Not like before, but I eat. Food don’t taste the same, though.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Mr. Bigger. It’s understandable that your appetite might be affected. And it's common for taste to change. Okay, just a few more questions to get a complete picture. Have you been experiencing any chest pain, or any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Not a bit. Ankles… They swell a little if I sit too long. But that’s just old age again, isn’t it? Like everything else. I put my feet up. Helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, some swelling with prolonged sitting… good to know you've found a way to manage it. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor, old Dr. Abimbola, he said somethin’ about it, years ago. Gave me pills. I took ‘em for a while. Didn’t feel any different, so I stopped. Diabetes? No. Heart… Still beatin’, isn’t it? Never had any trouble with my heart. I always been strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure, medication discontinued, and no known heart problems. It’s important to get that blood pressure checked again, though. And stopping medication can be risky, so we’ll discuss that. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Let me see… when I was a boy, I broke my arm fallin’ out of a mango tree. They fixed it up. That was a long time ago, in Nigeria. Since then… no. No hospital. Just the usual colds and aches. Nothing serious. I’m a strong man, I told you.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child, no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family with conditions like heart disease, diabetes, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Lung problems… My brother, he used to smoke. A lot. Always coughin’. He got sick, a long time ago. They said it was his lungs. But nobody else. My mother, she lived to be a very old woman. Strong woman, like me. No sicknesses in her family, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of lung problems in a brother, but otherwise a healthy family history. And now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never touched the stuff. Foolishness. My wife, she always hated it. Said it smelled like burning leaves. And she was right. A good woman.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And finally, do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Sometimes. A little beer with my friends on Sundays. Just one or two. Not like those young people, always drinkin’ and causin’ trouble. Just a little somethin’ to relax. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. It won't take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Exam, eh? Always somethin'. Alright. Go ahead. But don't poke too hard. Old bones, you know. And be quick about it. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be gentle. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Not alarming, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Deep breath in… and out… Okay. Breath sounds are a little diminished in the lower lobes, but no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 148 over 88. A little elevated. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness, but I do note some mild enlargement of the liver. Overall, everything seems stable, but there are a few things we need to address. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: A little. Not much. Just… uncomfortable. Always uncomfortable there. I just thought it was old age. You said… enlargement? What does that mean? And what’s a murmur? Sounds serious.
DOCTOR: It’s good you pointed that out. Discomfort is important to note. Enlargement of the liver, also called hepatomegaly, can be caused by a number of things, sometimes it's harmless, sometimes it needs further investigation. A murmur is an extra sound your heart makes. It doesn't always mean something is wrong, but we'll want to do a few tests to rule out anything serious. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your liver function, and a chest X-ray just to get a clearer picture of your lungs. Also, an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. All this worryin’… I just wanted a simple check-up. But alright. Do what you gotta do. But can’t I just… rest? Drink some water? Maybe it’s just the heat. When will I get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bigger. It’s never fun to have a lot of tests. But these will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and help me make the best plan for your health. Resting and drinking water are excellent ideas, and we can definitely do those! The lab work should be back within a couple of business days, and the X-ray results usually come back even quicker. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as everything is in. While we wait for those results, I’m going to recommend that you reduce your salt intake, as that can help with your blood pressure. And continue to rest and drink plenty of fluids. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think I heard enough for today. Salt… less salt. Alright. Just… tell me straight if somethin’s wrong. Don’t beat around the bush. I’m an old man. I can handle it.
DOCTOR: You have my word, Mr. Bigger. I’ll always be honest and straightforward with you. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – chest pain, shortness of breath, severe abdominal pain, or significant swelling – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Thank you for coming in today. And please, take care of yourself. My nurse will be in shortly to go over the lab requisition and answer any questions you might have. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think that's all. Just… try not to worry me too much. Old man's heart, you know. Doesn't take much to get it jumpin’. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You take care as well, Mr. Bigger. And don’t hesitate to call if you need anything. .
