DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. It’s good to see you. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's these hiccups. Been going on for... oh, goodness, almost a week now. Not constantly, mind you, but they come and go, and they’re really quite bothersome. It's just… hiccups! Seems silly coming to a doctor for hiccups, but they won’t stop.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Mirriam. Persistent hiccups can be quite disruptive, and we want to figure out what’s going on. Almost a week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, almost a week. Started… let me think… Tuesday, I believe. I was having tea with Elsie, over at her place, and just… hic! …started. It was right after I laughed at something her grandson said. A perfectly normal laugh, nothing special. And then… hic! …here they are. It’s not painful, just… annoying. And it makes me look foolish! Elsie keeps offering me all sorts of remedies, but nothing’s worked.
DOCTOR: Alright, so they started Tuesday while you were visiting Elsie, and seem to have begun after a good laugh. And Elsie's tried some home remedies, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Poor Elsie, she's a fountain of old wives’ tales! She had me hold my breath, drink water upside down, even try a spoonful of sugar. She swears sugar works for everything! hic! It didn't, though. Nothing has. It's just… hic! …here they are, popping up whenever they please. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes just randomly. Do you think it could be something serious, Doctor? I’m not one to worry, but a week is a long time for hiccups, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: A week is a bit longer than usual for hiccups, Mirriam. While most hiccups are harmless and resolve on their own, persistent ones can sometimes indicate an underlying issue. Let’s explore a little bit more to see if we can find any clues. Now, besides starting after laughing with Elsie, have you noticed anything else that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I've noticed, really. I haven’t changed my diet, haven't been feeling stressed… hic!… or anything like that. I do take my medication, of course, for my blood pressure. Been on that for years. And I’ve been sleeping alright, maybe a little restless, but nothing major. Oh! Now that you mention it, I did have a rather large glass of sparkling water with lunch yesterday. Could that be it? hic! I hadn't thought of that, actually.
DOCTOR: Sparkling water is a good thing to mention, Mirriam. It could certainly be a factor. And you're taking medication for blood pressure, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, Lisinopril, ten milligrams every morning. Been on it for… oh, goodness, must be fifteen years now? Doctor Patel keeps a close eye on it. It’s usually quite stable. And no other medications, just a little vitamin D in the winter, but I stopped that a few months back. hic! Honestly, I feel perfectly fine otherwise. No pain, no shortness of breath, no nausea… just these bothersome hiccups! I’m starting to think Elsie’s grandson is cursed! chuckles lightly Though, that's silly, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is silly, but a good story! Alright, so Lisinopril ten milligrams daily, and nothing else regularly. Now, let’s just run through a quick review of your general health. Have you had any changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Appetite is perfectly normal, thank you. I enjoy my meals. Still cook for myself most days, you know. Fijian food, mostly. Plenty of root vegetables and fish. hic! Though, sometimes I don’t feel like cooking, and Elsie brings over a casserole. She makes a lovely tuna casserole. And I haven’t lost any weight, or gained any, thankfully. Still a good size, I suppose. chuckles Not as spry as I used to be, but holding my own. hic! Honestly, Doctor, I feel quite healthy for my age. It's just these… hic! …hiccups. They’re the mystery.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mirriam. You sound very healthy overall, and it’s wonderful you’re still cooking and enjoying your meals. Now, just to be thorough, have you been experiencing any difficulty swallowing, or any heartburn or indigestion lately?
PATIENT: No, no trouble swallowing at all, thank you. And no heartburn, or indigestion either. Never really had much trouble with that. I eat slowly, you see, and don't eat anything too spicy. Maybe a little chili sometimes, but nothing extreme. hic! Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like a bit of a puzzle! Everything seems normal, and yet… hic! …here they are. Elsie thinks it’s a sign of good luck. But a week of hiccups doesn’t feel very lucky! chuckles softly
DOCTOR: Well, Elsie’s perspective is always good. Alright, Mirriam, let's do a quick physical exam, just to be sure everything sounds and looks alright. Could you sit up a little straighter for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. adjusts posture slightly Straight as I can be, at my age. chuckles Please, be my guest. Do what you need to do. I'm trusting you to find the culprit behind these… hic! …pesky hiccups. Perhaps it’s just one of those things, you know? A little glitch in the system. But it’s good to get it checked out, just in case. hic!
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s listen to your lungs first. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. Another one… and exhale. pauses, listening Lungs sound clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can hear. moves to palpate the abdomen gently And now I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No tenderness at all, Doctor. Just my usual slightly… hic! …prominent tummy. chuckles softly I’ve always carried a little extra padding. Nothing unusual here. Feel free to poke around as much as you need to. It's not bothering me, just… hic! …annoying. Honestly, you’d think a week of hiccups would have worn me down more than it has! I suppose I'm tougher than I look. smiles faintly Do you need me to do anything? Breathe a certain way, maybe?
DOCTOR: No, you're doing perfectly. Capillary refill looks good. pauses, tapping lightly on the patient's chest And just a quick neurological check. Follow my finger with your eyes, if you would. And now look at your nose. Everything looks good there. pauses, then sits back slightly Blood pressure is 138/78, which is stable for you, and pulse is 72. Everything seems to be within normal limits physically, Mirriam.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, Doctor. Very reassuring. So, what do you think it could be? hic! If everything seems normal, that is. Do you think it could be something to do with my medication, perhaps? Or something I ate? Elsie keeps suggesting I drink chamomile tea, but frankly, I think she’s just grasping at straws. chuckles softly I appreciate you taking the time to look me over so thoroughly, though. It puts my mind at ease, even if you can’t find the answer to my… hic! …hiccup mystery.
DOCTOR: It is a bit of a mystery, Mirriam. Lisinopril can sometimes cause a persistent cough, but hiccups are less common. And given your overall health and the physical exam findings, it’s less likely to be something serious. It’s possible it’s a temporary irritation of the phrenic nerve, which controls the diaphragm—sometimes it just happens. Or it could be something as simple as a bit of trapped gas. Now, I'm not overly concerned, but since it's been a week, and they are bothersome, I could prescribe a medication sometimes used to help calm the hiccups. It's called Baclofen, and it's a muscle relaxant. We can start with a low dose and see if it helps. Would you be comfortable trying that?
PATIENT: Baclofen, you say? A muscle relaxant… hmm. Sounds sensible, I suppose, if it might calm the nerve down. I’m certainly willing to try it, Doctor, if you think it might help. I’d rather not go on feeling like a… hic! …human metronome! chuckles softly Is there anything I should be aware of, any side effects or anything like that? And will it interact with my Lisinopril? I don't want to start a whole new set of problems trying to fix one. looks at Doctor expectantly
DOCTOR: Good questions, Mirriam. Baclofen can sometimes cause drowsiness, dizziness, or weakness, so we'll start with a low dose—5 milligrams three times a day—and see how you tolerate it. It shouldn't interact with Lisinopril, but we'll keep an eye on your blood pressure just to be safe. I'll send the prescription to your usual pharmacy. It's important to take it as directed and let me know if you experience any side effects. We can also try some simple home remedies alongside it—sipping on ice water slowly, or practicing deep, slow breathing exercises. And if it doesn’t improve within a week, we can explore other options, perhaps a referral to a gastroenterologist. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Five milligrams three times a day… I can certainly manage that. And I’ll definitely let you know if I feel any different, or if the hiccups get worse. chuckles softly I’ll try the ice water and deep breathing too, though Elsie’s already exhausted every remedy she knows! smiles warmly I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing it as just ‘old age’. pauses Thank you. It puts my mind at ease, knowing we're doing something about my… hic! …hiccup problem. Is there anything else I should be doing, or anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: No, nothing specific to avoid at this time, Mirriam. Just continue to monitor how you're feeling and let me know if anything changes. If the hiccups become severe—meaning they interfere with your breathing or eating—please head to the emergency room immediately. But otherwise, we'll start with the Baclofen and see how it goes. I’ll also send a note to your primary care physician, Doctor Patel, just to keep her informed. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I feel much better about it all. smiles warmly I appreciate your kindness and patience. It’s nice to have a doctor who actually listens! pauses Thank you again, Doctor Iuzzolino. And hopefully, this Baclofen will finally silence my… hic! …pesky hiccups. Have a good day. And thank you again for seeing me. starts to rise from the chair
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. It was my pleasure. And I certainly hope the Baclofen works its magic! Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a wonderful day, and feel better soon. smiles warmly
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: You too, Mirriam. Goodbye.
