DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Um… well, I’m here for… a check-up, I believe? Before a… procedure. It’s all a bit hazy, truthfully. My husband… he arranged everything, and it was shortly after… well, you see, I'm widowed. I’m hoping to get… cleared for something. A surgery, I think? Perhaps you could remind me what exactly it is? I apologize for my lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Brightful. It's perfectly alright. Losing a spouse is incredibly difficult, and it's very common for things to feel a bit… unclear during times of grief. Let’s take our time and sort everything out. Okay, I see here you have an upcoming laparoscopic cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – scheduled for August 16th. Is that what your husband was referring to?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, that… that sounds right. A gallbladder removal. He did mention something about… stones, I think? And pain. It's all coming back in fragments. August 16th… yes. That’s soon. Is that… is that a major operation? I don’t mean to ask silly questions, but… truthfully, I wasn’t really involved in the details. He handled everything. I just… trusted him.
DOCTOR: No silly questions at all, Ms. Brightful. It's perfectly reasonable to want to understand what’s happening, especially when things have been… overwhelming. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a fairly common procedure. It’s considered minimally invasive – we make small incisions, use a camera and specialized instruments, and remove the gallbladder. It generally has a good recovery time compared to older, more extensive surgeries. The reason we remove the gallbladder is usually due to gallstones, which can cause pain, nausea, and other complications. You mentioned your husband said something about pain – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Minimally invasive sounds… less frightening. He did say something about sharp pains. Mostly… after eating, I think? Rich foods, especially. It wasn’t constant, just… episodes. And sometimes I felt a bit nauseous, but I just thought it was… stress. Or grief. It’s hard to separate everything at this point. He always took me to the doctor when I wasn’t feeling well, so I… I didn’t really pay attention to the specifics of why I was feeling unwell, you understand? He’d explain things to me, but… it never really stuck. I just trusted him to know what was best. Is it… is it unusual to not remember these things? I feel so foolish.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Brightful. It's perfectly understandable, especially given everything you've been through. Grief can absolutely affect your memory and concentration, and it's very common to rely on a loved one to manage these things. There’s absolutely no need to feel foolish. So, these episodes of sharp pain, primarily after eating rich foods, and occasional nausea… That sounds consistent with what we often see with gallstones. Can you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… a cramping pain, mostly. High up, on my right side, under my ribs. It would come in waves, and sometimes it would radiate to my back. Not always, but sometimes. And it wasn’t… a dull ache, it was… quite intense, actually. It would last for… I don’t know, maybe an hour or two? Then it would subside, but it would leave me feeling… shaky and weak. I usually just tried to lie down and rest. He’d give me something for it, and that would help. I… I don’t recall what it was, though. A pill, I suppose. A small, white pill. And sometimes, if it was really bad, he’d want me to go to the emergency room, but it never got that bad, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping pain in the upper right abdomen, radiating to the back, lasting an hour or two, relieved by medication… That’s very helpful. And you haven't experienced any fever, chills, or yellowing of your skin or eyes?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills… and I don’t think so, about the yellowing. I haven’t really looked, if I’m being honest. I… I suppose I should have paid more attention. He always said not to worry, that he had it all under control. I’m so sorry. I feel like I’m just rambling and not being helpful at all. It’s just… my mind feels so clouded. Is it alright if I… if I just take a moment? I feel a little overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Ms. Brightful, please, take all the time you need. It's perfectly alright. You're not rambling at all, and you're being very helpful just by sharing what you're comfortable with. Losing your husband is a significant trauma, and it’s completely understandable that your mind feels clouded right now. Let’s take a deep breath together. And if you’d like, we can pause the questions for a moment and just sit quietly for a bit. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that would be lovely, thank you. A moment of quiet… yes, please. It’s just… being here, talking about all of this… it brings it all back. The… the worry, the emergency room visits, him… taking care of everything. I… I just miss him so much. I apologize for being so emotional.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize at all, Ms. Brightful. Grief is a natural process, and it's okay to feel emotional. There's no need to hold anything back. I understand completely. We can take as much time as you need. When you’re ready, perhaps we can do a quick physical examination, just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. It’s a standard part of the evaluation for gallbladder issues, and it will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. But we can absolutely wait if you’re not comfortable with that right now. Would you like to proceed, or would you prefer to take a bit more time?
PATIENT: No… no, let’s proceed. You’re right, it’s best to just… get it done. I suppose the sooner this is over, the sooner I can… move on. Or at least, start to. A physical examination… yes, please. I’ll just… try to relax. It’s… it’s just difficult, knowing he would always be the one to… to do this.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll take things at your pace, and I’ll explain everything as we go. This will just involve listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope and gently pressing on different areas to check for tenderness. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Then we'll move onto your abdomen. Please lie back comfortably. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, can you point to where you usually feel the pain?
PATIENT: Right here. It’s usually right about… there. Sometimes it radiates to my back, like a… a sharp ache. And it feels worse after I eat something rich… or fatty. Like… like fried foods, or steak. Or… anything with a lot of cream. He always said I had a sensitive stomach. It’s… it’s hard to explain. It’s not a constant pain, it comes and goes. But when it comes, it’s… quite unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just going to gently press here and here. Let me know if you feel any tenderness or discomfort. And how about here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. That’s… that’s where it hurts. Not all the time, but… when you press there, it’s… uncomfortable. A sharp pain, almost. And it feels… a little tender. It's not excruciating, but it’s definitely not comfortable. I apologize for… for reacting. It's just… sensitive.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. Thank you for letting me know. That tenderness is consistent with what we often see with gallbladder inflammation. I'm also noting some mild guarding, which means your muscles are tensing up slightly in response to the pain. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now. They seem normal. Based on what you've told me and the physical examination, it's very likely that you have cholecystitis – inflammation of the gallbladder – likely due to gallstones. However, to confirm this, we'll need to order some blood tests and an ultrasound of your gallbladder. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests and an ultrasound… yes, please. Anything to get a definitive answer. I just… I want to know what’s going on. And if this is the problem… what are the next steps? Is surgery… unavoidable?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Blood tests will help us assess for infection and inflammation, and the ultrasound will allow us to visualize your gallbladder and look for stones. Regarding surgery, it's often the recommended treatment for symptomatic gallstones, especially if you're experiencing recurring pain. However, it's not always immediate. We'll need to review the results of the tests first. If the tests confirm gallstones and your symptoms are significant, we can discuss your options in detail, including the risks and benefits of surgery versus other potential treatments. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a liver function panel, and an abdominal ultrasound. The lab is just down the hall, and you can go whenever you’re ready. The ultrasound will be scheduled for tomorrow morning. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Blood tests and an ultrasound, then a follow-up appointment… I can do that. Tomorrow morning… yes, that works. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… patient with me. And reassuring. It’s just… everything feels so overwhelming right now. But I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Brightful. It's my pleasure. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns at all. Losing your husband is a huge loss, and it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Here's some information about gallstones that you might find helpful. And please, don't hesitate to call if you experience any worsening pain, fever, or chills. Alright, let's get those blood tests ordered, and we'll see you tomorrow. Take care of yourself, Ms. Brightful.
