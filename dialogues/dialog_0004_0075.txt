DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s this daytime sleepiness, really. I’ve been using one of those machines at night – for the sleep apnea, you know? And it helps, it really does. But I’m still finding myself awfully tired during the day. It’s just…persistent, if you follow me. It's not debilitating, but it's enough to make things… less enjoyable, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Persistent daytime sleepiness, even with CPAP use. Alright. And how long has this been going on despite using the machine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It’s been… maybe six, seven months now since I started with the machine. The first few months were wonderful – I felt like a new man! But this tiredness crept back, gradually, maybe four months ago? It hasn’t gotten worse, thankfully, but it’s not going away either. It’s… frustrating, to be honest. I was hoping the machine would be the whole answer.
DOCTOR: So, improvement initially with CPAP, then a plateau and now persistent daytime sleepiness for approximately four months. And you said it’s not getting worse, just… remaining constant?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Constant is a good word for it. It’s not like I’m falling asleep standing up or anything, Doctor. It’s more… a heavy feeling, you know? Like I haven’t quite had enough rest, even after a full night’s sleep. It makes it hard to concentrate sometimes, and I find myself… well, just not having the energy to do things I enjoy. Simple things, really. Like gardening. I used to spend hours in my garden. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I usually wake up around 7:00, 7:30. I make myself a little breakfast – usually just toast and coffee. Then I’ll read the newspaper for a bit. I used to teach – Ethnic Studies, at the community college – so I like to keep up with current events. I retired about five years ago now, though. After that, I try to get some light exercise – a walk in the park, maybe. In the afternoons, I used to volunteer at the library, but I haven’t been going as much lately… because of this tiredness, honestly. Evenings are quiet – I’ll watch a little television, read a book, and I'm usually in bed by 10:00. It's pretty… routine. Nothing too exciting these days. And, of course, the machine every night.
DOCTOR: And how would you rate your sleep quality when you are using the machine?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It's… restful, I suppose. I don’t wake up feeling short of breath, which was a problem before. And I do sleep through the night, which is a big improvement. But it's not… restorative. If that makes sense. I don’t feel refreshed when I wake up. It’s comfortable sleep, yes, but not… energizing. Sometimes I wake up with a slightly dry mouth, too. Not terrible, just… noticeable. I make sure to use the humidifier on the machine, but it doesn't always seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any snoring, even with the machine on?
PATIENT: That's a tricky one. My wife used to complain about it terribly, of course, before I started the machine. She’s… well, she's no longer with us. But even now, sometimes I think I hear a little bit of a rumble, but it's much quieter, and it might just be my imagination. It's definitely not the same as it used to be, I can tell you that. It's so faint, honestly, I can't be sure if it's actually happening. I mostly notice it when I'm first drifting off to sleep. Does that make sense? A little bit of a murmur, but nothing like the roar my wife complained about.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any other medical problems that we should discuss?
PATIENT: Let's see… I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it's well-controlled with medication. And my cholesterol is a little high, but nothing too concerning. I had a knee replacement a few years back, but it’s healing well and doesn’t bother me much anymore. Oh, and I get occasional heartburn, but I manage it with over-the-counter antacids. Nothing major, really. I try to stay active and eat a relatively healthy diet, despite my fondness for pastries. I suppose those are the main things. Nothing that keeps me up at night, aside from this tiredness, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, and if so, what are they?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think... Here, I have a list. Let's see... I take Lisinopril, for the blood pressure, 20 milligrams daily. And Simvastatin, 40 milligrams, for the cholesterol. And occasionally, as I mentioned, Tums for the heartburn. That's it, I think. Just those three. I make sure to take them regularly, Doctor. I’m pretty good about sticking to a routine.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. No food allergies, no problems with medications, nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky in that regard. My wife, on the other hand, had a terrible allergy to penicillin… but that's neither here nor there. No allergies for me, Doctor. Just this pesky tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Mr. Paske, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like your daytime sleepiness is persisting despite CPAP therapy, and we've ruled out any obvious causes like allergies or major medical issues. Before we proceed, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to assess your overall health and rule out any other potential contributors. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Absolutely. I trust your judgment. A physical exam is a good idea. I haven’t had one in a while, to be honest. So, yes, please. Let me know what you'd like me to do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please have a seat on the table, we'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Finally, I'll check your thyroid and feel your abdomen. It shouldn’t take too long. Blood pressure is 138 over 82, and pulse is 72 and regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs appreciated. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Thyroid is normal to palpation, no nodules felt. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses appreciated. Everything appears normal so far.
PATIENT: That's good to hear, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to do a thorough examination. It's reassuring to know everything seems alright. Is there anything else you’d like to check? I'm happy to cooperate. Perhaps we can discuss what might be causing this tiredness, now that you've had a chance to examine me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. Based on the physical exam, there aren’t any immediate physical findings to explain your daytime sleepiness. However, given the persistence of your symptoms despite CPAP use, I think it’s important to investigate further. There are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to your sleep study itself - perhaps there's been a change in your sleep pattern since then. It’s also possible you have another underlying sleep disorder, like restless legs syndrome or narcolepsy. And while your blood work is stable, sometimes subtle vitamin deficiencies can contribute to fatigue. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. Specifically, I want to repeat a sleep study – a home sleep apnea test would be sufficient, to start. I also want to check your iron levels, vitamin D levels, and thyroid function again, just to be certain. And finally, I’d like to order a Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire - that will help quantify your level of daytime sleepiness and rule out other sleep disorders. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that all sounds very reasonable indeed. I understand you need to rule out all possibilities. A repeat sleep study makes sense, especially if things have changed. And checking my vitamin levels seems a good idea, too. I'm happy to do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this. The questionnaire sounds fine as well. So, a repeat sleep study at home, blood work for vitamins and thyroid, and the Epworth questionnaire… Is there anything else I need to do, or prepare for? And approximately how long will it take to get the results? I'm eager to find some answers, if that's alright to say.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll send the orders to the lab electronically. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood work. As for the home sleep apnea test, our sleep technician will call you within the next few business days to arrange a delivery and explain how to use the equipment. It's a fairly simple process – you'll wear a monitor overnight, and we’ll receive the results automatically. The results for the blood work typically come back within a week, and the sleep study results usually take about two weeks to process. Once I have those results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend practicing good sleep hygiene – maintaining a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed. It might not solve the problem entirely, but it can help improve your sleep quality. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That sounds like a very comprehensive plan, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. No, I don't think I have any questions at the moment. Good sleep hygiene, I can definitely work on that. I used to be very strict about my routine, but I’ve let it slip a bit lately. I’ll make an effort to get back on track. So, just to be clear, I should expect a call from the sleep technician within a few business days to arrange the home sleep test, and the lab will contact me about the blood work… And I’ll try to improve my sleep hygiene in the meantime. That sounds right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. You’ll receive calls from both the sleep technician and the lab. And remember, if you experience any significant changes in your symptoms – such as excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty breathing, or chest pain – please contact the office immediately. I'm confident we can get to the bottom of this, Mr. Paske. It may take some time and investigation, but we’ll work together to find a solution that helps you feel rested and energetic again. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. I truly appreciate your time and attention, and I feel much more hopeful now that we have a plan in place. Thank you again for everything. I’ll await the calls from the lab and the sleep technician, and I’ll do my best to improve my sleep hygiene. I look forward to our follow-up appointment.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
