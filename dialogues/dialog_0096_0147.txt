DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Raghunathan, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Burlingham. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve noticed a lump… a mass, I suppose… in my lower abdomen. It’s been a little concerning, so my wife suggested I come get it checked out.
DOCTOR: A lump, you say. Hmm. And how long exactly have you been noticing this lump?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been probably around three to four weeks now. At first, I didn’t think much of it, just figured it was something temporary. But it hasn't gone away, and if anything, it feels… a little bigger now.
DOCTOR: "A little bigger," right. And can you describe it to me?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… firm, not really soft. About the size of a plum, I’d say. It doesn’t really hurt, unless I press on it pretty hard. It's located… well, right in the middle, a bit below my belly button. It’s on the left side, I believe. Though, to be honest, I’m not very good at pinpointing things on myself.
DOCTOR: "Not very good at pinpointing things…" Well, we'll have a look ourselves shortly, Mr. Raghunathan. Now, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me see… not really, no. No pain, like I said, no fever or anything like that. My bowel movements seem normal, and my appetite is fine. I haven’t lost any weight that I’m aware of. Honestly, if it wasn't for the lump being there, I wouldn’t even know something was wrong.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you had any issues with, shall we say, digestive upset in the past?
PATIENT: Digestive upset… sometimes, yes. I get a bit of bloating now and then, but nothing serious. And occasionally, some… discomfort, if I eat something that doesn’t agree with me. But nothing consistent, and it always passes. I wouldn't say I've had any major digestive problems, if that makes sense. Is that what you’re asking about?
DOCTOR: It might be relevant, Mr. Raghunathan. Let's move on. Any family history of… these sorts of things?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… my mother had some issues with her stomach when she was older, but I don't recall the specifics. It was a long time ago. No one that I know of had anything like… a lump, though. My father was healthy as a horse until the very end, and my siblings are all doing well, as far as I know. It’s not something we’ve really discussed much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I don’t really take anything regularly. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if needed, but that’s it. I try to stay healthy, eat well, get some exercise… mostly just walking, but it’s something.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My wife always jokes I’m too resilient. Is that all the questions, Doctor? I’m happy to answer whatever you need to know. Perhaps we can get to examining this lump now?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Raghunathan. Let's have a look. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to palpate your abdomen, just to get a better feel for things. Let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I’ll just… lie down here, then. Just let me know if you need me to adjust my position or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, is this area tender?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, that’s… a little bit tender, actually. Not painful, exactly, but definitely sensitive. It’s right around here. Does that tell you anything?
DOCTOR: Hmm. It’s firm, as you said, and roughly the size of a plum. Doesn't seem to be mobile. Bowel sounds are present, though a little sluggish. I’m going to listen again, and this time I want you to take a deep breath in and hold it.
PATIENT: Okay, holding my breath… Is everything alright? It feels like you’re listening very closely… is that normal?
DOCTOR: It’s… difficult to say definitively at this point, Mr. Raghunathan. It could be a number of things. A lipoma, perhaps. Though, the fact that it’s not particularly mobile is… concerning. We’ll need to order some imaging. A CT scan will give us a better look. Don't worry too much. It’s best to rule things out, and that's what we're doing.
PATIENT: A CT scan… alright. That sounds… thorough. What exactly does that involve? And is it… painful? I’ve never had one before. And… what if it is something serious? I suppose that’s a silly question, but… it’s hard not to worry, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s not a silly question, Mr. Raghunathan. Though, frankly, you’re jumping ahead. The CT scan itself is painless. You’ll lie on a table and a machine will take a series of X-rays. You may need a contrast dye injected into your vein, which can cause a warm sensation, but it’s usually well-tolerated. As for what if it is something serious… we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I’m not going to speculate. We need to see the results first. I'll write you a referral to the radiology department. They will schedule the scan, and we’ll review the results as soon as they’re available. Try not to dwell on it, Mr. Raghunathan. Worrying won't change anything.
PATIENT: Okay… a referral to radiology. I understand. Contrast dye… I’ll keep that in mind. I suppose you’re right, worrying won't help. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any restrictions after the scan? Or… should I change anything about my diet or activity levels?
DOCTOR: No, there are no specific restrictions. Just drink plenty of water before the scan to help with the contrast dye. And… try to relax, Mr. Raghunathan. I've written detailed instructions on the referral form. The radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. And I’ll expect to hear from you once you’ve had the scan done, so we can discuss the results. Do you have any further questions at this moment?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything… for now. Thank you, Doctor Burlingham. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I’ll schedule the scan as soon as I can and let you know as soon as I have the results. I hope it’s nothing too serious. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll see.
