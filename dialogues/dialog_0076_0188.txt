DOCTOR: Right, well, let’s get this over with. So, Mr. Secondi, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. It’s… my pee. It’s orange. I noticed it yesterday, and… still today. It’s a little scary.
DOCTOR: Orange urine, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… not bright orange, but… you know, kinda the color of… carrot juice, maybe? I don’t… I don’t drink much carrot juice, though. I mostly drink water.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Right. And you're sure it’s not something you ate?
PATIENT: I think so. My wife, she cooked… tagine, yesterday. Lamb tagine. Maybe something in that? I ate a lot of it, it was good. But I’ve had tagine before, and my pee wasn’t orange then.
DOCTOR: Well, lamb tagine… Interesting. And besides the color, any pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not at all. It just… looks wrong, you know? I worry sometimes about things like kidneys. My uncle, he had… problems with his kidneys. That’s why I came. I don’t feel sick, though. Just… orange pee.
DOCTOR: Alright, look. It's probably nothing. Likely just a temporary thing. But… we should check a few things. Let’s do a quick urine sample, and I’ll order some basic blood work. Just to be safe, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that sounds good. A urine sample… where do I do that? Is there a… a room for that? And the blood work, is it much? I have insurance, private insurance.
DOCTOR: Down that hall, first door on the left. There's a little room, instructions inside. As for the blood work… don’t worry about it. Your insurance will cover it. We'll get it all sorted. Just… go do the sample. It’s a standard procedure. Don't make a mess.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I will try not to make a mess. First door on the left…right.
DOCTOR: Honestly, people and their…colors. Just get it over with.
PATIENT: .
