DOCTOR: Hi Arthur, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Aye, good to meet ye too, Doctor. Well, it's this mornin' sickness, really. Bit daft, isn't it, at my age? But it's been happenin' for a few weeks now, and it's gettin' a wee bit worrisome. Especially with me heart, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Okay, “morning sickness” – and you’re right to mention your heart, we’ll definitely keep that in mind. Just to clarify, when you say a few weeks, can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Aye, let's see... started maybe the first week o' July, so... around four, five weeks now. It's not every mornin', mind ye. More like three or four times a week. And it's not… violent, if ye catch me drift. Just feelin' queasy, and then… well, ye know. It passes after a bit, usually with a bit o' toast. But it's enough to put me off me breakfast, and I’m a man who likes his breakfast.
DOCTOR: Right, so about four to five weeks of nausea, occurring three or four times a week, and relieved somewhat with toast. And it’s impacting your appetite. Okay. Now, have you noticed anything else happening at the same time?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right. Impactin' me appetite, aye. Now, let me think… well, I’ve been a wee bit more breathless than usual, I suppose. Not when I'm restin', but if I'm walkin' up the hill to the shops, I need to pause for a breather more often than I used to. And me ankles… they’ve been a bit swollen at the end o' the day. I just put it down to the heat, to be honest, it’s been a warm summer. But maybe… maybe it's somethin' more?
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased breathlessness with exertion and some ankle swelling. Good that you’re noticing these things. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any known medical conditions, besides what you’ve already mentioned?
PATIENT: Aye, well, the heart failure, o' course. Diagnosed about five years ago now. I see Dr. MacLeod for that, regular check-ups and all. He's a good man. I also had a touch o' pneumonia last winter, but that cleared up with antibiotics. Other than that... not much. I've always been a fairly healthy lad, all things considered. Bit o' arthritis in me knees, but who doesn't get that at my age? I haven't had any surgeries or been in the hospital for anything else in years.
DOCTOR: Right, heart failure diagnosed five years ago, managed by Dr. MacLeod, and pneumonia last winter. Arthritis in the knees. No surgeries. And are you currently taking any medications for your heart failure or anything else?
PATIENT: Aye, I am. Let me see... I'm on Ramipril, 5 milligrams twice a day. And Furosemide, 40 milligrams every mornin'. And Digoxin, 125 micrograms once a day. I take a wee bit o' paracetamol for me knees when they're botherin' me, but that's it, really. I keep a list in me wallet, just in case. I can show ye if ye like.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you to be so prepared! No, the list is fine, thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, no. Never had a reaction to anythin'. I can eat pretty much anythin' without worryin'. I've had a few scrapes and bumps over the years, and never had a problem with bandages or anythin' like that either. I think I'd know if I had an allergy, wouldn't I? It's not like it would be a secret.
DOCTOR: You’re right, you likely would. Okay, last few questions about your lifestyle before we do a quick exam. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in me life, Doctor. Me mother smoked, and I saw what it did to her. No, thank ye very much. Always been a bit o' a fresh air man, me. I enjoy a wee dram o' whisky now and then, but that's about it. And I try to walk every day, when the weather allows. Helps keep me goin', ye ken?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. So, no smoking, occasional whisky, and regular walking. Okay. Now, before we move on to an examination, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Aye, happy to. Me father had high blood pressure, and he passed away from a stroke when he was in his seventies. Me mother, as I said, smoked all her life and had a bad cough for years before she passed. She had emphysema, the doctor said. Me brother is still alive, thankfully. He's a bit older than me, and he's got diabetes, but other than that, he's fairly healthy. No heart problems in the family, as far as I know. And no history of cancer, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure and stroke in your father, emphysema in your mother, and diabetes in your brother. No known heart problems or cancer in the family. Right. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination if you don't mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and have a look at your ankles. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. Just let me know if ye need me to do anythin'. I'm a fairly easy patient, I promise. I've had a few check-ups in me time. Don't be shy now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Arthur. Deep breath in… and out… again… good. Okay, I’m hearing a slight crackling sound in your lungs, particularly on the lower right side. Now, I'll check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 160 over 95. And your pulse is regular, but a little fast at 88 beats per minute. And I do see some swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. I’m also noticing some pitting edema when I press on them.
PATIENT: Aye, that cracklin' doesn't sound too good, does it? And me blood pressure's always been a wee bit high, to be honest. Dr. MacLeod's been keepin' an eye on it. Me ankles swellin' up is just somethin' I've put down to the heat, but I suppose ye know best. What does all this mean, Doctor? Is it somethin' serious? I'm gettin' a wee bit worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Arthur. It's good that Dr. MacLeod is aware of your blood pressure. The crackling in your lungs, combined with the ankle swelling and your report of breathlessness, is concerning for fluid overload, likely related to your heart failure. The “morning sickness” symptoms are unusual for someone your age, and given your heart condition, we need to investigate that further to rule out anything serious. I want to order a couple of tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’d like to do a blood test to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a marker called BNP, which can help assess the severity of your heart failure. I also want to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to see if there’s any fluid buildup in your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Tests are always a good idea, I suppose. Better to be safe than sorry. BNP… is that somethin' to do with me heart? And the chest X-ray will show if there’s fluid, ye say? Right. Yes, go ahead with all o’ that. I trust yer judgement. The sooner we know somethin', the better. I’m just hopin’ it’s not too serious. What happens after ye get the results? Will ye phone me? Or do I need to come back again?
DOCTOR: Good. The BNP test is related to your heart – it's a hormone released when the heart is under strain. The chest X-ray will help us visualize any fluid buildup in your lungs, which can confirm the fluid overload we suspect. I’ll order those tests now. The lab should be able to get the blood work done today, and the X-ray can be scheduled for tomorrow morning. Once I have the results – and that should be by tomorrow afternoon – I’ll phone you directly to discuss them. Depending on the results, we may need to adjust your medication dosages, or consider other treatment options. It’s also important to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds good, Doctor. Phone me tomorrow… I appreciate that. Adjustin' the medication… is that somethin' I should be worried about? Will it make me feel worse before it gets better? And… well, you mentioned ruling out other causes. What other causes could there be for… this? I'm just tryin' to get me head around it all, ye ken? I'm not one for worryin', but… it’s a bit disconcertin', findin’ out somethin's not right.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel disconcerted, Arthur. And it’s good that you’re asking questions. Adjusting your medication doesn’t necessarily mean it will make you feel worse, but sometimes it takes a little while to find the right balance. We’ll start slowly and monitor your symptoms closely. As for other causes, there are a few things we need to rule out. Since you've mentioned nausea, we need to consider possibilities like a stomach infection, or something affecting your kidneys. Less likely, but we have to consider them. And sometimes, other medical conditions can mimic the symptoms of heart failure, so it’s important to get a full picture. Right now, we’re focusing on determining if this is related to your heart failure, or something else entirely. The tests will help us do that. Don’t try to worry too much before we have the results. We’ll take things one step at a time. Do you have any other questions at this moment?
PATIENT: Aye, that makes sense, Doctor. Stomach infection… aye, I suppose that's possible. I haven't eaten anythin' dodgy, but ye never know. And kidneys… I haven't noticed anythin' different there, but maybe I should be lookin' for somethin'? I'm gettin' a wee bit confused now with all the possibilities. No, I think that's all for now. I'll just try to relax and wait for yer phone call tomorrow. Thank ye for explainin' things so clearly, Doctor. And for bein' so patient with an old man like me. It's reassuring to know ye're takin' it seriously. Just let me know if there's anythin' I should be doin' in the meantime. Anythin' at all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arthur. It’s my job to be patient, and I’m glad I could reassure you. For now, there's nothing specific you need to do. Just continue to monitor your symptoms, and if anything changes significantly – if your breathlessness gets much worse, or if you develop any new symptoms – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic, even before tomorrow. Here’s the clinic number. We’re here if you need us. And I’ll be in touch tomorrow with the results. In the meantime, try to rest and take it easy. Thank you for coming in today, Arthur. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Aye, thank ye, Doctor. I will. I appreciate yer kindness.
