DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Eaddy, you say? Well, it’s this… this going to the bathroom business. It's just… too much of it, you know? Seems like I’m always running back and forth. It’s a nuisance, really. My wife keeps giving me looks.
DOCTOR: I see. A frequent need to urinate. And has this been a sudden change, Mr. Segretto, or has it developed gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I suppose. Though, honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s been… a while now. Maybe a few months? It’s hard to say exactly. Things just… slowly get worse, you know? Not a sudden thing, no. Definitely not sudden.
DOCTOR: A few months, alright. And would you describe it as a complete loss of control – incontinence, perhaps – or simply a very strong and frequent urge to go?
PATIENT: Incontinence? No, no, nothing like that. I can hold it, mostly. It’s just… I have to go so often! Like, right after I’ve been. And sometimes before I’m even finished with what I’m doing. It’s… irritating, to put it mildly. I don't just leak, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: So, frequency and urgency, without a complete loss of bladder control. And are you experiencing any pain or burning with urination, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Burning? Nope. Nothing like that. It's just… the constant need. It’s more of a… well, a bother, really. Makes it hard to get things done, you know? Especially with the garden. Can’t be running back and forth to the bathroom all day when you got tomatoes to stake.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes? Like what kind of changes? It looks… yellow, I suppose. Like it usually does. I haven’t been looking at it that closely, if you want to know the truth. I just… go. Not much time for inspecting things, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand. Perhaps I can ask this way: have you noticed any blood in your urine, or has it become unusually dark or cloudy?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Definitely no blood. That would be… alarming. And dark or cloudy… I don’t think so. It looks like… pee. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a doctor. I just know when I need to go. And I need to go a lot. Is that all there is to it?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Mr. Segretto. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve listening to your abdomen and a simple neurological assessment. And I’d also like to order a urinalysis and a basic metabolic panel. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Neurological…? Listen to my… abdomen? Now hold on a minute. What exactly are you looking for? I don’t like the sound of this. I just wanted to know why I’m going to the bathroom every five minutes, not… poked and prodded. Is there something wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, it is standard procedure to conduct a physical examination and laboratory tests when evaluating a new symptom. It helps us rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to your frequent urination. It is not necessarily indicative of a serious problem, but it is prudent to investigate. The neurological assessment is a very simple check of your reflexes and sensation. It's to ensure there isn’t any nerve damage affecting your bladder control. The urinalysis will check for infection, and the blood work will give us an overview of your kidney function. It's quite routine, I assure you. Are you declining the examination and tests, or shall we proceed?
PATIENT: Hmph. Routine, you say? Well, I don’t much like doctors poking around. But… my wife will have my hide if I don't get this sorted. She’s been on at me for weeks about getting it checked. Fine. Do your… poking. But be gentle, you hear? And don't take too long. I’ve got tomatoes to stake, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table. I will begin with listening to your abdomen. Take a deep breath for me, Mr. Segretto...and exhale. Now another. No immediate abnormalities detected. Now, I will check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Reflexes are within normal limits. Next, I will need a urine sample. I have a collection cup here. Do you require assistance?
PATIENT: Assistance? No, no assistance needed. I can manage. Though… where is the bathroom? It’s not exactly close, is it? And hurry, please. This is… awkward.
DOCTOR: Just through that door, Mr. Segretto. Take your time. I will be right here when you return.
PATIENT: 
DOCTOR: There. Done. Now what?
PATIENT: Alright, thank you. Now, we’ll send this off to the lab. It should take a couple of days to get the results. In the meantime, can you tell me a little bit about your fluid intake? What do you typically drink in a day? And roughly how much? Don’t tell me you drink a gallon of tea.
DOCTOR: A gallon of tea…?
PATIENT: No, not a gallon! Goodness no. I drink… coffee, mostly. A few cups in the morning. And water, when I remember. Maybe… four, five cups of coffee a day? And a couple glasses of water. It varies. Depends on how hot it is. And sometimes a little juice with supper. Not much, though. My wife tries to get me to drink more water. She’s always saying I need to stay hydrated.
DOCTOR: Four to five cups of coffee, a couple glasses of water, and some juice. Coffee, as you know, is a diuretic, meaning it can increase urination. We will take that into consideration when we review the lab results. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmmm. Not that I know of. I haven't taken much in my life. A little something for my arthritis now and then, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. I can’t even remember what it was called. My wife handles all that. She keeps a list, I'm sure. But off the top of my head? No, no allergies. I don’t react to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any family history of kidney disease or bladder problems?
PATIENT: Kidney disease… Bladder problems… Hmmm. My mother… she had something with her kidneys when she was older. Had to go to the hospital a few times. But that was a long time ago. And my brother, on my father’s side, he had trouble… holding his water when he got old, I think. But other than that… not that I recall. We weren’t a family that talked much about… those things.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Segretto. I have all the information I need for now. We will await the lab results. Once we have those, we can discuss a more definitive course of action. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to drink fluids, but perhaps limit your caffeine intake slightly. If your symptoms worsen significantly—if you experience pain, fever, or blood in your urine—please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Limit my coffee… That’s the hardest part. But alright. No, I don’t think so. Just… tell me when you have the results. And I hope it's nothing serious. I’ve got tomatoes to stake, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. We will contact you as soon as the results are available. Have a good day.
