DOCTOR: Hi Aron, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um... my chest hurts. Not all the time, but sometimes. It’s… in my breast. It’s been happening for a little bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. That definitely warrants checking things out. "A little bit now"—can you give me a sense of how long that’s been?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe like, two, three weeks? It’s hard to say exactly. It comes and goes. Not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, two or three weeks of intermittent chest pain. And it's specifically in your breast, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. Just… in my chest. Like, where my… you know. Where a woman’s… breast is. It’s on this side.
DOCTOR: Okay, left chest. And is it a sharp pain, a dull ache, a burning sensation… anything else I should know about how it feels?
PATIENT: It’s… more like a ache. Not sharp. More like… sore. Like after you… work hard. But I haven’t been working that hard. It’s just… there sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, similar to soreness after exertion, even though you haven’t been doing strenuous activity. Does anything seem to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Not really. I don’t think so. It just… happens. Sometimes when I’m sitting. Sometimes when I’m… doing nothing. I haven't noticed anything that makes it stop faster.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it seems fairly consistent in being unpredictable. Have you noticed any swelling, redness, or changes to the skin in that area?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. Looks the same. I checked… a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And have you felt any pain in your arm, jaw, neck, or back at all along with this chest ache?
PATIENT: No. Just my chest. Sometimes it feels… a little heavy, but mostly just sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the chest, feeling heavy at times along with the soreness. Now, have you had any other symptoms at all – like shortness of breath, a cough, fever, or unexpected weight loss?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. Everything else feels normal. I… I eat okay. Sleep okay. Nothing changed.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I haven't been to the doctor in a long time, to be honest. Just… little things. Never anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior diagnoses. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’m pretty healthy, usually. I work hard, you know? Roofing. But this… this is worrying me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Roofing is demanding work – that's good to know. Do you have any family history of heart problems, cancer, or anything else significant?
PATIENT: Um… my father… he had high blood pressure. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had… something with her stomach. I don't know what it was exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of high blood pressure and some sort of stomach issue on your mother’s side. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just water. And… sometimes coffee. I don’t take pills or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to anything – medications, food, pollen, anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I can eat anything. I haven’t ever had a… bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that information, Aron. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'd like to palpate your chest and lymph nodes to check for any abnormalities. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm not feeling any obvious lumps or swelling in your chest or lymph nodes, and the palpation doesn't seem to elicit any significant pain. However, there is some mild tenderness when I press on the area where you described the ache. Your skin looks normal, no redness or rash.
PATIENT: Okay. That’s… good to know, I guess? What does that mean? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It's good that I don't feel any obvious abnormalities, but the tenderness is something we need to investigate further. Given your age, your occupation, and the intermittent nature of the pain, several things could be causing this. It could be a musculoskeletal issue - a strained muscle in your chest wall, perhaps. However, because you're male, and while it's less common, we need to rule out other possibilities, including gynecomastia, which is enlargement of breast tissue, and, to be thorough, more serious concerns. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work, including a complete blood count and hormone levels. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood work? Okay. That sounds… okay. I don’t really understand what you said about… the other thing. But if you think it’s important, then yes. I just want to know what's wrong. How much will that cost?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll get those ordered. The blood work will give us information about your overall health and hormone levels, and the X-ray will help us visualize your lungs and chest wall. Regarding the cost… because you're uninsured, the cost can vary. The blood work will likely be around $100 - $200, and the X-ray around $150 - $300. We can see if the lab offers any discounts for cash-pay patients, and I'll see if there are any lower-cost imaging centers nearby. We can also discuss payment options if needed. In the meantime, I want to reassure you that we're taking a cautious approach to rule out anything serious. I don’t want you to worry unnecessarily, but it's always best to be thorough. I’ll have my assistant draw the blood and schedule the X-ray for you right away. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: $200… that's a lot. I didn’t expect it to be so much. I don’t know… Is there anything else we can do before… the expensive tests? Maybe just… watch it for a while? I can try to rest more.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Aron. It's definitely not ideal, and I apologize for the financial burden. While resting is a good idea, and I encourage you to do so, "watching and waiting" carries some risk, and I wouldn't recommend it without having some baseline information. Given the location of the pain, and while it's rare in men, we need to rule out potentially more serious conditions. I can explore some options to help reduce the cost. I can write a prescription for pain relief medication to help manage the discomfort while we wait for the results. We can also look into free or reduced-cost clinics in the area, though there may be a waitlist. However, I strongly recommend proceeding with the blood work and X-ray to get a clear diagnosis and ensure your health. Perhaps we can stage the tests – prioritize the blood work first, which is less expensive, and then assess whether the X-ray is necessary based on those results?
PATIENT: Okay… the blood work first, that sounds better. Maybe… maybe that will be enough. And pain relief would be good. It doesn't hurt all the time, but when it does… it’s not nice. Can you write something for that? I don’t know what to ask for.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll start with the blood work. I'll write a prescription for Ibuprofen 600mg. It’s an over-the-counter pain reliever that can help reduce inflammation and manage the pain. Take two tablets with food every six to eight hours as needed. If that doesn't provide enough relief, we can discuss other options. I’ll also give you a lab slip for the blood work, along with instructions on how to prepare. You'll need to fast for at least eight hours before the test. My assistant will schedule a follow-up appointment for you once the results are available, typically in a few days. We'll discuss the findings then and determine the next steps. Do you have any questions about the medication or the blood work instructions?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s okay. Fast for eight hours… I can do that. Ibuprofen… okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aron. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if the pain becomes significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms – like shortness of breath, fever, or unexpected weight loss – please don’t hesitate to contact us immediately. My assistant will be with you shortly to schedule the blood work and finalize the paperwork. Take care, and I'll see you soon.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. Bye.
