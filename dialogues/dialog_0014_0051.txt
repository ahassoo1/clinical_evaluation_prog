DOCTOR: Hello, Mrs. Nini. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about my blood. My… someone suggested I find out what type it is. For… reasons. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I think it's for a… a record of some kind? Something about if… if anything were to happen. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Right. A record… for… emergency purposes. Yes, I suppose that makes sense. It's not usually something people come in specifically for, but it's not harmful to know. So, you’d like to determine your blood type. Have you ever had blood work done before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. I… I’ve had blood taken, certainly. Back in Spain, of course, and… later, here. But I don't recall why. Maybe for check-ups? Or… when I broke my wrist, years and years ago. But I certainly don’t remember what they said about my blood. I wouldn’t know the first thing about it, dear. Is it… important to know before we do it?
DOCTOR: It's not critical, no. Though it's helpful information to have on file. Certain medical conditions, or… if you were ever to need a transfusion, it would be good to have readily available. Do you have any family history of… blood disorders?
PATIENT: Blood disorders… oh my. That’s… a very specific question. Let me think. My husband, bless his soul, he was a healthy man. Very strong. My sister… she had… something with her iron, I think. Always tired. But… a disorder? I don’t know if it was that serious. We didn’t talk much about illnesses, you see. It wasn’t really our way. I'm afraid I can’t be much help there, dear. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. Just trying to cover all the bases. And you said your sister had… low iron?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Low iron. She was always pale, and… easily winded. She’d take… pills, I believe. Little red pills. Nothing major, from what I remember. She lived a long life, so it couldn't have been too bad. Now, you were saying about me… what will happen when you take the blood? It doesn't hurt, does it? I've always been a bit squeamish.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard blood draw, Mrs. Nini. A quick pinch. You might feel a little sting, but it’s usually over very quickly. We’ll send it to the lab, and it should be back within a couple of days. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, a quick pinch, you say? That's… reassuring. No, not really. Just a little something for my joints, sometimes. The arthritis, you know? It flares up now and then. It’s… a small, white pill. I think it’s called… Meloxicam? Or something like that. I get it from the pharmacy down the street. Honestly, I leave most of that to my neighbor, she helps me with things now. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Meloxicam. Yes, that can interact with some blood tests, though it’s unlikely to be significant here. And you have no allergies to any medications or… anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. Shellfish maybe, a bit of an upset stomach if I eat too much, but nothing serious. No reactions to any medicines. I remember my mother always said I had a strong constitution! Now… about the blood test itself. Will it take long? I have a little bridge game with the ladies this afternoon, and I wouldn’t want to be late. It's Mrs. Henderson's birthday, you see.
DOCTOR: It won't take long at all, Mrs. Nini. Perhaps fifteen minutes, start to finish. We’ll just need a small sample. Let's get started then, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, fifteen minutes! That’s… perfectly alright then. Thank goodness. Yes, let's get on with it. The sooner it's done, the better, eh? And thank you for being so patient with my… rambling. My mind doesn't work like it used to. Lead the way, dear.
DOCTOR: Right this way. The phlebotomist, Maria, will draw the blood. She’s very good, very gentle. Just try to relax, and it will be over before you know it.
PATIENT: Oh, good. A gentle one, you say? That’s a relief. Maria, was it? Alright then. I do hope it doesn’t make me too weak. I promised Mrs. Henderson I'd bring the sherry. It's her favorite.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Nini, Maria is all set for you. She’ll explain the process. She’s just getting everything prepared now. Try to sit comfortably. We’ll have the results back as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you begin?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, dear. Thank you for being so kind. Just… try not to take too much blood, alright? I'm a bit of an old lady, you see. And… tell Maria I appreciate her gentleness. Now, let’s get this over with, eh? I'm ready when she is.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll leave you in Maria’s capable hands then. Just relax, and she’ll take good care of you. I'll be back to discuss the results when they are available.
PATIENT: .
