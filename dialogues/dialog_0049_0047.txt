DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s about… long-term care, I think. My… someone told me I needed to get checked out for it. It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. My wife… she used to handle things like this. I just… kinda show up when I’m told to now.
DOCTOR: Right. Long-term care. That's… broad. And your wife typically manages your medical appointments, you say?
PATIENT: Yep. She did everything. Bills, appointments… everything. It’s been… a while since she passed. A good while. I… I don't really keep track of dates anymore, if that makes sense. Just kinda… do what needs doin' when it feels right, or someone tells me to.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, let’s try to be as systematic as possible, then. To clarify, when someone suggested a “check out for long-term care,” did they mention what specifically they were concerned about?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Just that I should look into it. Something about… getting older, I think? And makin' sure I’m covered if… if I need help someday. That’s all I really remember. It was a nice lady from the insurance company, I think. Private insurance, my wife set that up too. She was real smart about things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no specific symptoms, just a general recommendation for a long-term care assessment. Let’s start with a basic review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any significant past medical problems – things you’ve been treated for previously, like heart issues, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Significant… hmm. That’s a tough one. I worked on the boats for a long time, hauling stuff. Lots of heavy lifting. Back trouble now and then, but I never really saw a doctor for it. Just rubbed it with some stuff and kept goin’. I had… something with my lungs once, real bad cough. That was a long time ago, though. They gave me some medicine. I think it worked. Honestly, I don't remember much else. It all feels… blurry.
DOCTOR: A history of back pain from heavy lifting and a previous lung infection. And you don't recall the specific diagnosis for the lung infection?
PATIENT: Nope. Just a real bad cough. They said it was somethin' I caught. I was coughin' up a storm, felt awful. Spent a week or two in bed, then it cleared up. No one ever said what kind of cough it was, or what caused it. Just… a cough. And my back...it aches sometimes, especially when the weather changes. Not bad enough to see a doctor though, not usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries, hospitalizations other than that cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No surgeries, not that I remember. I broke my arm once, when I was a kid, fallin’ out of a tree. But that was… a long time ago. Went to the doctor, they put it in a cast. That's about it, I think. No hospital stays… besides the cough, maybe. I don't really recall bein' in the hospital. Just sick at home.
DOCTOR: Very well. And your family?
PATIENT: Well… my wife, like I said, she passed. A few years back. We didn't have any kids. Just us. My parents… they’re gone too. Long gone. Had a brother, but we lost touch a long time ago. Haven’t seen him since… well, a long time. It's mostly just me now.
DOCTOR: Right. Any significant medical problems in your family that you're aware of?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I don't really know. My mom… she had trouble with her heart, I think. But she never really talked about it much. And my dad… he was a strong man, worked hard his whole life. I don't think he ever got sick. Honestly, we didn’t talk a lot about health stuff. Just… tough it out, you know? That's what we were taught.
DOCTOR: Alright. And currently, are you experiencing any symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get tired easier than I used to, I guess. But that's just gettin' older, right? My back aches sometimes, like I said. And I forget things… easy. Like what I was gonna say a minute ago. But I'm mostly okay. I can still get around, still do most things. I just… slow down a bit, that's all.
DOCTOR: Right. So, fatigue, occasional back pain, and some memory issues. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just… tell me if somethin' doesn't feel right. I'm not good with all the medical talk, though. Keep it simple, okay?
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's begin. Please sit up straight and take a deep breath for me. Heart sounds… regular rate, but slightly diminished. Lungs… some mild wheezing on auscultation, bilateral. Not alarming, but worth noting. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated. Reflexes are… normal, but slightly diminished. Motor strength is… adequate. Overall, your neurological function appears intact. We'll need some bloodwork to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Wheezing… that sounds bad, doesn’t it? Is that from the cough I had a long time ago? I just… thought it was old age. And bloodwork? What are you lookin' for? Is somethin' wrong? I'm startin' to get worried now.
DOCTOR: Wheezing can be caused by many things, Mr. Rover. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem. As for the bloodwork, we’re simply looking for baseline levels—cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function—to rule out anything obvious. It’s standard procedure. We’ll also check a complete blood count to look for signs of inflammation or infection. No need to be alarmed yet. I’ll order the lab tests now. It will take a few days to get the results. We can discuss them when they come back.
PATIENT: Okay… baseline levels, you said? And no need to worry yet. That's good. But… what if somethin’ is wrong? What if it’s serious? My wife… she always knew what to do. I feel kinda lost without her.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, it’s perfectly natural to feel anxious in situations like this. We are being proactive, assessing your overall health. If anything concerning is detected, we will discuss it thoroughly and develop a plan. For now, let's focus on getting these lab results. And please, try not to anticipate the worst. It rarely helps. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are available.
PATIENT: Okay… a follow-up appointment. Right. I guess I’ll just… wait then. Wait for the results. And… try not to worry. Easier said than done, I reckon. Just… let me know if you need anything. Or if I need to bring anything with me to the next appointment.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab requisition will list any specific instructions if needed. Otherwise, simply come as you are. I'll see you then, Mr. Rover. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. … bye. .
