DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Arbin. Well, it’s about my eyes, really. They've been really sensitive to light lately. It's gotten worse over the past few months, and it's making things… difficult. It's hard to explain, but even on cloudy days, it feels too bright.
DOCTOR: Sensitivity to light, you say. And it’s been progressively worsening over the last few months. Difficult in what way, Arbin?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, mostly just uncomfortable. Like, squinting a lot. It gives me headaches, too, sometimes. And it makes it hard to even look at my phone for too long, which is… not ideal. I work as a dental assistant, so I'm around bright lights all day. It’s getting tough to manage, honestly.
DOCTOR: A dental assistant, you say. Constant exposure to bright lights… certainly could be a factor. Headaches along with the light sensitivity. Do you experience any blurry vision, double vision, or halos around lights, Arbin?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not blurry or double vision. And no halos either. It’s just… the brightness. Like my eyes can’t adjust properly, even when they should be able to. It’s a weird feeling. I don’t know if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Arbin. Though, frankly, it doesn't narrow down the possibilities much. Let’s move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any other changes in your vision – spots, floaters, or any loss of peripheral vision?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just the brightness. And… … maybe a little dryness, sometimes? Not always, but occasionally my eyes feel a bit gritty, especially at the end of the day. It’s not major, though. I usually just blink it away. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Grittiness, alright. Everything is potentially important, Arbin. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, infections, or injuries to your eyes or head?
PATIENT: No, not that I can think of. No illnesses, no injuries… … oh! Wait. Last year, I had a really bad cold, a proper flu. Knocked me out for a week. But that was months ago, and it wasn't eye-related, just… everything ached. Does that count?
DOCTOR: A flu last year. We'll keep that in mind. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, autoimmune diseases, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I lost my wife a few years back, and she always handled the medical stuff. I haven't really had a proper check-up since then, to be honest. I’m on Medicare, so I go when I need to, but… nothing major. No diabetes, no high blood pressure… I don’t think so, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… … That's a tough one. My wife's family, I knew them pretty well, but her side wasn’t really… medical. My own family… I grew up in Ghana, and I haven't been back in years. I lost contact with a lot of them. I think my grandmother had something with her eyes when she was older, but I don’t know what. It wasn't anything serious, I don't think. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Arbin. These things happen. Now, do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… occasionally, ibuprofen for headaches. But not regularly. Maybe once or twice a month, if the headache is bad. And sometimes, a multivitamin. Just a basic one, you know? Nothing special. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen occasionally, multivitamin. It all matters. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I've always been pretty lucky in that regard. Though, I do sneeze a lot in the spring, but I think that's just the pollen.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick examination of your eyes, if that's alright with you. I'll check your visual acuity, your pupils, and the overall health of your eyes. It shouldn't take long. Do you have your glasses with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. And yes, I do. Here they are. Let me know if you need anything else. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, if you'll just look straight ahead, please. I'm going to start with your visual acuity. Can you read the smallest line on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Okay, I'll do my best. … Um… is that an 'E'? And then… a 'V'?… Oh, and… a 'Z'? It’s getting a bit blurry after that, Doctor. I think that's about as far as I can go.
DOCTOR: Visual acuity… 20/30 in both eyes. Not terrible, but certainly not optimal. Now, let's check your pupils. Look straight ahead, and I'm going to shine a light in each eye. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No obvious abnormalities there. Now, I'm going to check the movement of your eyes. Follow my finger with your eyes, but don’t move your head. Good, good. Eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Do you feel any pain when I press gently on your eyelids?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain at all. It feels… normal. Just a bit of pressure, that’s all. Is something wrong? You seem to be thinking hard.
DOCTOR: It's just… your symptoms are a bit vague, Arbin. And the exam isn't revealing anything immediately concerning. However, given your complaints of light sensitivity and headaches, and the fact that it's impacting your work, I'd like to order a couple of tests just to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds sensible. I’d rather be safe than sorry. What kind of tests are we talking about? And… will they be expensive? I’m on Medicare, so I worry about costs sometimes.
DOCTOR: We'll start with a comprehensive dilated eye exam to get a better look at the back of your eye, and a visual field test to check your peripheral vision. As for cost, Medicare should cover a significant portion of it, especially given your symptoms. I’ll have the staff check your specific coverage and provide you with an estimate before we proceed. It’s unlikely to be a substantial out-of-pocket expense, but we'll confirm. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding prolonged exposure to bright lights and using artificial tears to keep your eyes lubricated. We’ll schedule these tests for next week. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this properly, and for checking about the costs with Medicare. Avoiding bright lights and the artificial tears… I can definitely do that. Next week is fine for the tests. Thank you again, Doctor Paulino.
DOCTOR: Very well. The staff will be in touch to schedule those tests for you. If your symptoms worsen significantly – severe pain, sudden vision loss, double vision – please go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we’ll see you next week. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough. I’ll just wait to hear from the staff about scheduling the tests. Thank you again for your time and attention. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Good. You're dismissed, Mr. Komarov. Have a good day.
