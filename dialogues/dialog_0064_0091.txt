DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Is good to meet you as well. Well, lately I been drinking a lot more water than usual. And I feel hungry all the time, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just...don't seem right, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. That doesn’t sound quite right at all. Increased thirst and hunger, even after eating… alright. Can you tell me a little more about how much more water you’re drinking?
PATIENT: Well, before, I used to drink maybe two, three glasses of water a day. Now? I feel like I have to refill my jug at least four, five times. Maybe more! And is not like I’m doing any heavy work either. Just the usual housework and tending to the garden. Is just...constant thirst. I does try to pace myself, but is hard, Doctor. Is really hard.
DOCTOR: Four or five times… that is a significant increase. And you mentioned it’s been happening even with regular meals… Okay. Has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me see. Not really, Doctor. My husband, Earl, he’s been the same. We does go to church every Sunday. I haven’t been feeling more tired than usual, and I ain’t been losing weight. Maybe a little bit more trips to the bathroom, but I thought that was just from the water, you know? Is hard to say. Everything else feel normal, more or less.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for sharing that. So, no significant weight loss, energy levels seem consistent, and the increased bathroom trips you attribute to the water intake… that’s helpful. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? Hmm… let me think. Earl does always complain I need new glasses, he say my eyesight gettin' worse every year! But no, Doctor, I don’t think anything different happen with my vision. Is still blurry, same as always. I does strain to read the newspaper, but that’s nothing new. I been needin' stronger glasses for a while now, I just haven’t get around to it yet. Is expensive, you know?
DOCTOR: <stage>I nod understandingly, making another note. I remember vaguely something about blurry vision being a potential symptom… but what was it connected to?
PATIENT: Alright, good to know. And how about any sores or cuts that are taking a long time to heal? Or any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet? Is just to cover all the bases, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Just covering all the bases. No, I haven’t noticed anything like that. My hands are a little achy sometimes from the gardening, but that’s just the usual wear and tear. No slow-healing sores or numbness, thankfully. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I does have a little high blood pressure, the nurse told me a few years back at the clinic. She give me some pills to take, but I don’t always remember. Earl does remind me, but sometimes I forget. Apart from that, nothin’ much. I ain’t been to the hospital for anything serious in a long time. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat my fruits and vegetables, mostly. Is the high blood pressure could be makin' me thirsty, you think?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure can sometimes contribute to increased thirst, yes. And it’s good you’re trying to stay healthy with your diet. The fact that you're not always remembering your medication is something we need to address. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. I never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat anything, and I never had no problems with any of the pills the doctor give me before. Earl always say I have a strong stomach, he say I could eat anything! I ain’t never had no rashes or swelling or nothin’ like that. I just forget to take them sometimes, that’s all. I does get distracted easy, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. No allergies. Now, just one more question about your history. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. No, Doctor, I never had no surgeries. Nothin' like that. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long time ago, but that was in Trinidad. I don’t really remember it much, just remember bein’ sick for a while after. But no other surgeries, nothin’ serious. I always been lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological assessment. Just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just tell me if you need me to do anything special. I ain't never been to the doctor much, so I don't know all the proper ways.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No need to worry, just relax. Your blood pressure is a little high today, as expected. Your heart sounds are a bit quiet, but regular. Lungs sound clear. Your reflexes and motor function are normal. Now, I'm going to check your skin turgor… …and your skin seems a little dry, and the elasticity isn’t quite what I’d like to see. That could be contributing to the thirst. Overall, everything seems stable, but the elevated blood pressure and dry skin are points of concern. Now, would you mind if I take a quick blood sugar test?
PATIENT: A blood sugar test? Is that to see if I have… you know… the sugar sickness? Earl's cousin, she have that. If you think is necessary, Doctor, go ahead. I trust your judgement. But is it serious? Is that what you think is wrong with me?
DOCTOR: It's just a precaution, Bianca. It's good to rule things out. Yes, it’s to check for diabetes, or what you call “sugar sickness,” but it doesn't mean you have it. Many things can cause increased thirst, and we need to investigate. Okay… the result is 210 mg/dL. That is elevated. This result is higher than normal. It’s not a definitive diagnosis, but it warrants further investigation. We need to do a more comprehensive blood test to confirm this, and potentially an A1c test to get a better picture of your average blood sugar levels over the past few months. This suggests you might have diabetes, but we need to be certain. Would you be willing to get those tests done?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear… Earl's cousin, she really sick with that. She has to take injections… Is that what I have? Is that why I’m so thirsty all the time? What does this mean, Doctor? What do I need to do? I don't want injections!
DOCTOR: Now, please don't panic, Bianca. It's important to stay calm. This is not a definitive diagnosis yet, and even if it is diabetes, there are many ways to manage it. We'll take things one step at a time. First, we need those blood tests to confirm if you have diabetes and how severe it is. Then, depending on the results, we can discuss treatment options. These might include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, oral medication, or, in some cases, injections. But we won't make any decisions until we have all the information. For now, I want you to try to drink water in moderation. Avoid sugary drinks like juice and soda. And I'll give you a referral to a specialist, an endocrinologist, who can provide more specialized care. They will be able to answer all your questions and help you develop a treatment plan that's right for you. Would you like me to write down the referral information?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. Write down the information. And tell me… is this my fault? Did I do something wrong? I always try to eat healthy, I really do. Is it because I forget to take my blood pressure pills sometimes? I don't want to be sick, Doctor. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: No, Bianca, it's not your fault. Diabetes is a complex condition with many contributing factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and age. It's not something you did wrong. And forgetting your blood pressure pills might contribute to the problem, but it's not the sole cause. Here’s the information for Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s an excellent endocrinologist. She’ll explain everything in detail and help you manage your condition. We’ll work together to get you feeling better. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a glucose meter so you can monitor your blood sugar levels at home. It's important to track your numbers so we can see how they respond to treatment. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A glucose meter…so I have to poke my finger all the time? Oh dear. Is this going to be a lot of work, Doctor? I ain’t so good with all this new technology. Earl always say I’m too old to learn new tricks! And…what about my blood pressure? Should I still be taking those pills? I don’t want to take more pills if I’m already going to be poking my finger every day. Is this going to ruin my life, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It will take some getting used to, I understand. The glucose meter is small, and it’s not as painful as it sounds. It’s just a quick prick of the finger, a few times a day. We can go over how to use it together, and I can give you a handout with clear instructions. And Earl is wrong, you are absolutely capable of learning new things. Regarding your blood pressure pills, yes, continue taking them as prescribed for now. It’s important to keep your blood pressure under control, especially with the possibility of diabetes. We may need to adjust the dosage later, depending on your blood sugar levels and the results of your tests, but for now, don’t stop taking them. And no, this will not ruin your life, Bianca. It’s a challenge, yes, but it’s a manageable one. Many people live full and happy lives with diabetes. We’ll work together to create a plan that fits your lifestyle. We’ll focus on diet, exercise, and medication, and we’ll monitor your progress closely. And I’m here to support you every step of the way. Do you want me to write down some resources for diabetes education and support groups?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. Write down those resources. Anything to help. I feel so overwhelmed right now. And...what about my garden? I love tending to my flowers. Will I still be able to do that? I don't want to have to give up the things I enjoy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, you can still enjoy your garden! There’s no reason you need to give up the things you love. We just need to be mindful of your blood sugar levels, especially after any physical activity. Gardening is a great form of exercise, actually! It gets you moving and spending time outdoors. We can discuss how to manage your blood sugar levels before, during, and after gardening. Perhaps you can take a short break and have a small snack if you feel lightheaded or weak. It’s all about finding a balance and making healthy choices. I’ll also give you some information on foods that are good for people with diabetes. We can work together to create a meal plan that fits your taste and lifestyle. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all for now. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. Thank you for not laughing at me when I said I was too old to learn new tricks. And thank you for telling me I can still enjoy my garden. That means a lot. I’ll make an appointment to see Dr. Sharma, and I’ll try to remember to take my blood pressure pills. And I’ll try… I’ll try to learn how to use that poke-y thing. Thank you, Doctor. Really. I hope you have a good day.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Bianca. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, you are not alone in this. Have a good day as well, Bianca.
