DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Alcorta, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Delano Alcorta. Though, I must say, I find these waiting rooms… less than ideal for a man of my standing. Not nearly enough comfortable seating, and the magazines are terribly dated.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. We're a rural clinic, Mr. Alcorta, not a spa. Let's focus on why you're here today. What brings you in?
PATIENT: It's… difficult to explain. It's not a sudden thing, you understand. More of a… gradual fading. Things aren't as crisp as they used to be. I find myself squinting more, especially when reading. And the colors… they seem a bit muted, honestly. It’s rather inconvenient. I used to be able to spot a perfectly ripe peach from twenty paces. Now? It’s a guessing game.
DOCTOR: Squinting, colors… right. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… It's been… well, a while. Perhaps six months? Maybe longer. Time tends to blur when one is… preoccupied. It wasn’t terribly noticeable at first, just a slight strain after a long day. But it’s definitely worsened in the last few months. I dismissed it initially, thought it was just fatigue. One gets tired, you know, managing… people. It’s exhausting work.
DOCTOR: Managing people... Right. And is this affecting anything specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Well, yes. Driving, for one. Night driving is… unsettling. I find myself relying heavily on the other vehicles' lights. And reading, of course. I enjoy a good historical text, but the fine print is becoming quite the ordeal. I’ve had to resort to larger fonts, and even then, it’s… straining. It impacts my ability to properly review employee files, to be frank. Details are important in my line of work, and blurry vision doesn’t exactly inspire confidence.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Hmm. Let me consider. I wouldn't say symptoms, precisely. More like… annoyances. Sometimes, when I look at something bright, I see… spots. Fleeting, you understand. Not constant. And occasionally, a sort of… shimmering around the edges of things. Nothing debilitating, mind you. Just… peculiar. It doesn’t hurt, if that’s what you're asking. I simply find it… disconcerting. It makes focusing even more difficult. Honestly, it feels rather… undignified. A man should have sharp vision. It's a matter of principle.
DOCTOR: Spots, shimmering... Alright. Past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Not much to report, truthfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. A broken arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree, naturally. And a bout of the flu a few years back. Beyond that, I’ve been remarkably healthy. Good genes, I suppose. And I always took pride in maintaining a sensible diet and getting adequate rest, though admittedly, that’s become more challenging lately. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, no… troublesome family ailments to speak of. It’s just… this vision. Quite perplexing, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not to my knowledge. I've never had a reaction to anything. Dust, pollen, animals… I've always been rather resilient, I believe. My grandmother, bless her soul, swore by a daily dose of apple cider vinegar for everything, and I suspect it instilled some measure of immunity in me. I’ve never carried an EpiPen, never had to avoid certain foods… it's simply not been an issue. I am, however, rather sensitive to… incompetence. But I suppose that's more of a… character flaw than a medical condition.
DOCTOR: Right. Medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No regular medications. Nothing at all. I believe in letting the body heal itself, you see. A little rest, a sensible diet, and a positive outlook… that’s all one needs, generally. I occasionally take an over-the-counter pain reliever for a headache, but that's about it. I avoid pharmaceuticals whenever possible. All those side effects… simply dreadful. I find a cup of chamomile tea is often just as effective, and considerably more pleasant. I prefer natural remedies, if you understand. Less… intrusive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just take a quick look. Please, have a seat. I'd like to check your vision and look at your eyes. Don’t expect miracles, though. I’m a general practitioner, not an ophthalmologist.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, I am somewhat skeptical. A “quick look” rarely suffices for matters of this complexity. Nevertheless, I shall comply. I trust the chair is… supportive? I have a rather sensitive back, you see.
DOCTOR: It's a chair. Sit. Okay, read the smallest line you can on this chart… with each eye separately. Don’t strain yourself. And try to focus.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I suspect this lighting is rather poor. It doesn’t exactly facilitate optimal vision. Let me see… E… H… P… R… V… No, I cannot make out the smaller letters. They are… quite blurry, unfortunately. Perhaps if the chart were closer? No… it's simply a matter of diminished acuity, I suspect. A rather disappointing result, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Alright. And now with the other eye. Try to focus. Worse. Significantly worse. Okay. Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation… though slightly sluggish. And the fundus… a bit of mild drusen, but nothing alarming at this stage. You’ve got some age-related macular degeneration starting. It’s common. And your cataracts are developing. It’s not an emergency.
PATIENT: Macular… degeneration? Cataracts? Good heavens. That sounds… rather ominous, doesn't it? And "common," you say? I assure you, Doctor, I’ve always considered myself to be… above average. This is… unsettling. Is this something that will progress rapidly? Will I soon be unable to read at all? And what, precisely, can be done about it? I trust there are options beyond simply… accepting diminished vision. This is a matter of principle, you understand. A man must be able to see clearly.
DOCTOR: It progresses at different rates in different people. It’s not a sudden thing. And yes, there are options. Glasses can help for now. There are also injections that can slow the progression of the macular degeneration, but those require regular visits to a specialist. And eventually, you'd likely need cataract surgery. I'll give you a referral to an ophthalmologist. They can assess it more thoroughly and discuss the best course of treatment for you. They'll do more testing, probably some imaging. In the meantime, make sure you've got good lighting when you read. And avoid driving at night.
PATIENT: Injections… cataract surgery… It all sounds rather… invasive. And regular visits to a specialist? My time is valuable, Doctor. Though I suppose it’s unavoidable. Very well. A referral, you say? I trust this ophthalmologist is… reputable? I wouldn't want to waste my time with someone lacking… expertise. And good lighting and avoiding night driving… I suspected as much. It’s hardly a revolutionary diagnosis, is it? I suppose it’s best to address these matters promptly, though I confess, I find the entire situation… disheartening. Thank you for your time, Doctor. Though I’m not entirely certain I’ve received a particularly… optimistic prognosis.
DOCTOR: Here. Dr. Evelyn Reed. She's good. And frankly, there’s not much to be optimistic about with age-related vision loss. It happens. Anything else?
PATIENT: "Happens," you say? A rather… dismissive attitude, wouldn’t you agree? One would hope for a more… proactive approach. Though I suppose that’s simply not the standard these days. No, Doctor, I believe that is all. Though I must say, I find this consultation has left me… somewhat deflated. And please, do ensure the waiting room receives a much-needed update. The magazines are positively prehistoric.
DOCTOR: .
