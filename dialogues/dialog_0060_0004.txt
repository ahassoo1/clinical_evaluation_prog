DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I'm Dr. Noordin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Noordin. Nice to meet you. Just in for my shots, like the nurse said. Routine stuff, I think? I don’t really keep track of when I’m due for things, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “routine” can mean different things to different people. And frankly, relying on someone else to keep track of your health isn’t ideal. We should establish a proper schedule, but first, let’s clarify which shots the nurse mentioned. Do you recall if she said anything specific – tetanus booster, flu shot, pneumonia vaccine… anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm, she mostly just said it was time for some updates, you know? I don't really remember her listing anything specific. I'm not good with remembering names of diseases, I just know I need to stay healthy for my grandkids! Is there a list somewhere? Maybe I can see what they recommend for someone my age?
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a schedule. It's… complicated. And honestly, a lot of people don't bother to keep up with it. Here’s the CDC’s recommended adult immunization schedule. You’re 53, so… let’s see. It appears you're due for a Tdap booster if you haven’t had one in ten years, and an annual flu shot, naturally. And given your age, we should discuss the pneumococcal vaccine – there are two types, PC13 and PPSV20. Honestly, it’s a bit much to go through right now. Have you had a tetanus shot within the last ten years, do you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that is a lot! Ten years… let me think. I had one… maybe when my oldest grandchild was born? He's… eight now. So, probably not recently enough. I honestly don't remember. And I've definitely not had any of those other ones. What do those even do? I just know I want to be able to keep up with the kids, you know? Is the pneumococcal one important?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's what I'm here for. Let's be clear: relying on memory isn't a strategy. Tdap protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – whooping cough. Pertussis is particularly dangerous for infants. You don't want to be the cause of that, do you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Definitely don’t want to give anything to babies. My daughter would kill me. So, that Tdap one sounds important. And the pneumococcal one… is that for babies too? I’m getting a little confused with all the names. Is it something I need to worry about, or just something that's good to have? I don't mind getting a shot if it's important, but if it’s just… extra, I'm a little worried about side effects. I don't bounce back as quickly as I used to.
DOCTOR: Honestly, the level of… concern over “extra” protection is a bit much. The pneumococcal vaccine is for you. It protects against pneumonia, meningitis, and bloodstream infections – all potentially life-threatening. And frankly, those infections are far more worrisome than a little soreness at the injection site. It's especially important as you get older, as your immune system weakens. It doesn’t prevent everything, naturally, but it significantly reduces your risk. Look, your weight is a little low for your height, and while I'm not going to lecture you on that, your immune system isn’t as robust as it should be. The pneumococcal vaccine is… sensible. Do you have any allergies to vaccines, or any serious reactions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, my! Okay, okay. Sensible sounds good. You’re right, I probably should be thinking about me for once. And my weight… well, my daughter worries about that too. I just don't have much of an appetite, I guess. As for allergies… not that I know of. I had all my shots as a kid, I think. Nothing bad ever happened. My grandma always said I was a tough little cookie. Hmm… no, I don’t think I’ve ever reacted to a shot before. But it’s been a long time. I really don’t remember.
DOCTOR: Right. "Tough little cookie" isn’t a medical history, Ms. Fornes. We need to be accurate. Very well. Given your age, lack of recent boosters, and the… general state of things, we’ll proceed with both the Tdap and the PPSV20 pneumococcal vaccine today. We'll administer them in separate arms. If you'll just have a seat, we can get this over with. And afterwards, I’d like to discuss a basic multivitamin, given your weight. Don’t want you getting run down. Roll up your sleeves, please.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Sorry for being difficult. It’s just… shots aren’t my favorite. But you’re right, I need to do what’s best. Separate arms, good. That sounds… less bad. And a multivitamin… alright. As long as it doesn’t taste awful. Is it going to hurt a lot? I really don’t have a high pain tolerance anymore. And do I need a booster shot for these shots later? This is getting complicated again…
DOCTOR: "Complicated" is relative, Ms. Fornes. It will be a mild sting, nothing you haven’t handled before. And yes, Tdap requires a booster every ten years. PPSV20… generally one dose is sufficient, but we’ll reassess in a year. There. Done. Keep those bandages on for at least fifteen minutes. You might feel a little soreness, perhaps a mild fever. Over-the-counter pain relievers should suffice. I'll write you a prescription for a basic multivitamin, and schedule a follow-up appointment for next year to discuss boosters. Do you have any questions, or are we finished here?
