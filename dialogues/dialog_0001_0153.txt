DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Let’s get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Right. Well, it’s… a check-up, I suppose. For… the show. They need me to be cleared to… well, to do the show. It’s a formality, really. I’ve been doing this sort of thing for… a long time. Honestly, I can’t quite recall which show right now. A lot of them blur together after a while, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. A "show." And you need me to clear you. Look, I appreciate you coming in, but "a long time" doesn’t really tell me anything. Is there anything specific you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. No, not really. I mean, aches and pains, you know? Old age creeping in. But nothing… alarming. I mostly just stand around, take tickets, show people to their seats. Not exactly strenuous work. I think I’m alright. Honestly, I feel pretty good for my age. But they insist on this… clearance. Do you need me to… walk on a treadmill or something? I’d rather not, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, look. I need a little more than "aches and pains" to go on here. Let's start with this: have you noticed any changes in your breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? Changes… well, I suppose it gets a little shorter when I climb the stairs. Not much, though. The theater has a lot of stairs, you see. And I… I don’t bounce back as quickly as I used to. Is that what you mean? It’s not a big deal, really. It just… takes a moment.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain… There was a little twinge a few months back, maybe? It didn't last long. Just a sharp feeling, then gone. I thought it was just… indigestion. I had a spicy lunch that day. I didn’t bother anyone about it. Seemed to go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's listen to your heart and lungs, just to be sure. Breathe deeply for me, Mr. Krahn. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and there's some slight wheezing in your lungs. Did you ever smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, goodness. A long time ago, yes. When I was younger. Not much, though. A few cigarettes here and there. It was… fashionable then, you see. But I stopped, oh, decades ago. Must be… forty years or more. It doesn’t affect me anymore, surely?
DOCTOR: Alright. And any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My wife… my ex-wife… she said I snored. Terribly, apparently. And I had my gallbladder out, ages ago. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Oh! I had a bad knee once, playing basketball when I was young, but it healed. Mostly. It aches sometimes, when it’s cold. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I haven’t taken much in the way of medicine in… well, a very long time. A little pain reliever for aches and pains, occasionally. Nothing serious. I’m generally quite healthy, you see. Or I was, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, look. Based on what you've told me – and frankly, it's hard to get a clear picture of anything – I'm going to recommend you see a cardiologist for a full evaluation. Your breathing, the chest pain, the smoking history… it warrants a closer look. I can't clear you for this "show" without knowing more. I’ll write you a referral.
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Oh, dear. That sounds… complicated. And expensive. Is it really necessary? I just need to stand around and take tickets, you see. It’s not exactly a demanding job. But… alright. If you insist. But please, make it quick. I have… things to do. And please tell me where I can find a good one.
DOCTOR: There are several cardiologists listed here. I recommend Dr. Evelyn Reed. She’s… thorough. And yes, it is necessary. You're 69, with a history of smoking and reported chest pain. It’s not something to take lightly. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see.
PATIENT: .
