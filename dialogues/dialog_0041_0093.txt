DOCTOR: Hi Chanz, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Pol... Polczynski, is it? Yeah, well, it's about getting a good night's rest, really. And feeling... less like an old man getting out of chairs, you know? My wife… she always said I needed to look after myself better. It's been a while since… well, never mind. Just sleep and feeling a bit more… capable, I suppose. I don't really do fitness, if that's what you're getting at.
DOCTOR: Polczynski, yes, that's right. Okay, sleep and feeling less stiff... I understand. It's good you're thinking about this now. When did you start noticing these issues with sleep and feeling stiff, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Hmm. That's a good question. Honestly, time sort of… blurs. It's been… a while, definitely after… everything. Probably, oh, six months maybe? A year? I really couldn’t say. It just sort of crept up on me, you know? I used to be able to just… drop off. Now I’m tossing and turning, thinking about… things. And then my back aches when I get up. It’s not bad bad, just… annoying. I fix pianos for a living, so I'm bent over a lot. Maybe that’s it?
DOCTOR: Okay, six to twelve months… that's helpful. So, it's gradually gotten worse. And you fix pianos – a lot of bending, which could certainly contribute to the back discomfort. Do you notice the back pain at any other times, or just when you get up in the morning or after working?
PATIENT: Mostly mornings, yeah. And after a long day at the workshop. Sometimes, if I've been really concentrating on a tricky bit of restoration, it'll just… be there. It's not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, you know? Like I've been carrying a sack of potatoes around all day. Honestly, I’ve always just… put up with it. My wife… she kept telling me to see someone. She was always right about these things. I suppose I should have listened sooner. It's just… doctors, you know? Always poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. We'll take things at your pace, and I’ll only ask what's necessary. We'll definitely try to figure out what's going on with your back. Now, about the sleep… can you describe what happens when you try to sleep?
PATIENT: Right. Well, I lie down, usually. I try to relax. But my mind just... races. Thinking about… old clients, tricky repairs, bills, things I should have said… that sort of thing. Then I'll toss and turn, trying to find a comfortable position. It's not like I'm stressed, exactly. Just… restless. Sometimes I'll get up and have a cup of tea, then try again. It’s not every night, but it’s happening more and more. And when I do finally get to sleep, I don’t feel particularly rested when I wake up. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Chanz. Racing thoughts, difficulty getting comfortable, not feeling rested even after sleep… that all points towards some level of sleep disturbance. Have you tried anything specifically to help you sleep?
PATIENT: Tried anything? Hmm. My wife used to make me chamomile tea. That sometimes helped, I suppose. But, well… she’s not here anymore to do that. I did buy one of those… white noise machines, you know? The one that plays the sound of rain. Didn’t really do much, to be honest. Mostly just annoyed me. I don’t really take anything, no pills or anything like that. Never been much for medication, if I can avoid it. I just sort of… suffer through it, I suppose. Is that the right answer?
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly honest answer, Chanz. And it's good you tried the chamomile and the white noise machine. It sounds like those weren’t particularly helpful. And it’s understandable you’d prefer to avoid medication if possible. Okay. Let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all?
PATIENT: Hmm. Medical history… Not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, measles, mumps, that sort of thing. Nothing major. I broke my arm once when I was a teenager, falling out of a tree. But that healed fine. The only thing… and it wasn’t really a diagnosis, more of a… observation… the doctor once said my blood pressure was a little high. But he didn’t say it was anything to worry about. Just told me to watch my salt intake. Honestly, I can’t even remember when that was. A long time ago. Does that help? I don't go to doctors unless absolutely necessary, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, childhood illnesses, a broken arm, and a past observation of slightly elevated blood pressure. That’s helpful. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had any surgeries. Not a fan of being cut open, you see. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. A bit stiff in the mornings, a bit restless at night… but nothing that required a doctor’s attention, at least not until now, I suppose. My wife… she always said I was stubborn. Maybe she was right about that too. She would have made me go to the doctor years ago if she could.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've been quite resilient. Okay, and what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a tricky one. My father… he had some heart trouble later in life, I think. But he wasn’t really one for talking about his health. My mother… she lived to a good age, but I don't recall any specific illnesses. She mostly just… faded away, you know? Old age, I suppose. I have a brother, but we haven’t spoken in years. He lives… somewhere in America, I think. I don’t really know much about his health either. Honestly, we weren’t a very close family. Does any of that help? It's not exactly a wealth of information, is it?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Chanz. It’s helpful to know what you do recall. So, heart trouble in your father, and you haven’t had much contact with your brother. Okay. Let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Right. Lifestyle. No, no smoking. Never been much of a smoker. My wife hated it. I used to drink… a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. But I haven’t really had the appetite for it since… well, you know. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested. I prefer a quiet evening with a good book, if I can manage it. Honestly, my life is pretty… uneventful. Just me and my pianos. It's not a wild existence, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. Quiet lifestyle. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had any bad reactions to anything, as far as I can remember. My wife used to make me take vitamin C during the winter, but that wasn't an allergy thing, just her being… cautious. Honestly, I’m a fairly robust individual. I don’t usually have any trouble with anything. Unless you count dust, perhaps. Working with pianos, you get a lot of dust. But that's just a nuisance, not an allergy. Is that everything? I feel like I've been rambling on for ages.
DOCTOR: No, you haven't been rambling at all, Chanz. That's actually very helpful information. So, no known allergies. Okay, that completes the history part. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and check your back for any tenderness. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Right. A physical exam. Well, I suppose so. It's not ideal, but I understand. As long as it's quick, you said? I've never been comfortable with doctors poking and prodding, but I suppose it's necessary. Just… be gentle, alright? And tell me if you find anything… concerning. I don’t like surprises. Where do you want me to start?
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible, and I'll explain everything as I go. I promise no surprises. First, could you please take a deep breath in… and out. Just breathe normally. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. It's not dramatically high, but something we’ll want to monitor. Now, let’s check your back. Could you bend forward slightly and touch your toes, if you're able?
PATIENT: Oof. That's not as easy as it used to be. There we go. It’s a bit stiff, you know? It's not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache, like I said. There. Does that help you? It’s worse on the left side, I think. It’s been like this for ages, honestly. I just… live with it. It’s part of the job, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling some muscle tightness on the left side, and a bit of tenderness when I press here. No signs of any acute injury. It doesn't seem to be radiating down your leg, which is good. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength seems good as well. Everything else seems within normal limits. So, to summarize, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you have some muscle tightness and tenderness in your lower back. Now, I think it would be helpful to run a few basic blood tests to rule out anything else that might be contributing to your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Right. Blood tests. Well, I suppose so. As long as it’s not too extensive. I don’t particularly enjoy needles, you see. But if it helps to figure things out, then I’ll do it. What sort of tests are we talking about? Just to be clear. I’d like to know what you’re looking for, if you don’t mind. And how long will it take to get the results? I’ve got pianos to fix, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll just do a standard Complete Blood Count to check for any signs of inflammation or infection, a basic Metabolic Panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar levels, and a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test to rule out any thyroid issues. It’s just a routine panel, nothing too extensive. The blood draw itself should only take a few minutes, and the results usually come back within a couple of days. The phlebotomist will be right in to take your blood. While we're waiting for the results, let's talk about some things you can do to help manage your symptoms at home. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Right. CBC, Metabolic Panel, TSH… sounds complicated. If you say it’s necessary, then alright. A few days, you said? That's not too bad. And yes, alright, let's talk about what I can do at home. I suppose I should be doing something besides just complaining. What sort of things are you thinking? I'm not particularly athletic, you know. I'm a piano repairer, not a marathon runner.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No marathon running required! For your back, gentle stretching and low-impact exercises like walking can be very helpful. Avoiding prolonged sitting and lifting heavy objects is also important. We can discuss some specific stretches that might be beneficial. For your sleep, establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed can make a big difference. And for your blood pressure, reducing your sodium intake and managing stress are key. I'll also give you a handout with some more detailed information on all of these topics. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Right. Stretching, walking, regular sleep schedule… avoid caffeine… Manage stress… that’s the tricky one. I don't really have stress. I fix pianos, you know? It’s a quiet life. But alright, I can try. A handout, you said? That would be helpful. I’m not very good at remembering things, as you’ve probably noticed. So, stretching, walking, less salt, more sleep… and try not to worry too much. Is that the gist of it? I suppose it's not a bad starting point. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll sit here and try to remember everything you’ve told me. It’s a bit overwhelming, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Stretching, walking, less salt, more sleep. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I understand it's a lot to take in. We’ll also discuss the results of your blood tests when they come back, and we can adjust the plan accordingly. For now, let's just focus on making small, gradual changes. I'll have the phlebotomist come in shortly to draw your blood. Is there anything else I can help you with before they arrive?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Small, gradual changes… yes, that sounds manageable. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, Doctor. It’s… a relief to finally be doing something about it, I suppose. And thank you for not making me feel like an idiot for not knowing all of this. Alright, bring on the phlebotomist. Let’s get this over with. I’ve got pianos to fix, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chanz. It was my pleasure. And don’t worry, you’re not an idiot at all. It's my job to explain these things. I’ll let the phlebotomist know you’re ready. Take care, and I’ll see you when your results are back.
