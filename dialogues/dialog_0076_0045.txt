DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe, let’s get right to it. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Doctor Rucco, right? Yes, the flushing. It’s been… happening more. My face gets very red. Like… tomato red, you know? And warm. It’s not painful, just… noticeable. Especially when I’m talking. It started maybe a month ago, I think. August 2nd, 2025, today… yes, about a month.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. Flushing… right. And it's associated with talking?
PATIENT: Yes. Mostly when I talk. Sometimes if I’m…thinking hard, too. Not always, but often. It’s… embarrassing. I used to be able to speak without… turning into a beet. Not a big beet, but… you understand. It’s not like a fever flush, no cold. Just…red.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, many things can cause redness. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this…facial coloration?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No fever, like I said. No… cough. My heart feels okay, I think. Sometimes… a little bit sweaty, but that’s just from the heat, probably. We've had some warm days, yes? I eat normally, I think. Not much change there. I sleep okay, most nights. Nothing… jumping out at me, really. Just the red face. It’s mostly the face. Oh! And sometimes… a little bit of headache, but that happens sometimes anyway. Not a bad headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant systemic symptoms. Sweating… headache… those are vague. Any family history of… skin conditions, or anything like this?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she had high blood pressure. Not skin problems, though. My father… he was very healthy, I think. Lived to be eighty-five. No redness problems that I know of. My sister… she has some… allergies, but nothing like this. No one in my family… turns red when they talk! It’s very strange. I’m the only one, I think.
DOCTOR: Allergies...right. And you're taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. Not for anything. I try to stay healthy. Just… tea, sometimes. And water, of course. I don’t… like taking pills. Never have. I prefer to let my body… sort things out on its own, if it can. I haven’t needed anything regular for… a long time. Nothing at all, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a look at your face and neck. Nothing extensive, we're short on time.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… alright. Whatever you think is best. My heart… I think it’s okay. But you know better. I’m ready when you are. Just… let me know if I need to… breathe deep or anything like that. I sometimes forget.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated – 140/90. And I can see the redness you’re describing – it’s diffuse, mostly concentrated on your cheeks and forehead. No obvious rash or lesions. I’m going to palpate your neck… feeling for any swelling. No palpable lymph nodes. It could be rosacea, but it’s atypical without the typical bumps. It could be related to your blood pressure, or… something else entirely. We'd need more testing to be certain.
PATIENT: Testing? What kind of testing, Doctor? I don’t have… insurance, you see. I didn’t want to… bother you with that right away. Is it… serious? The red face, I mean. It just feels… embarrassing. What will the testing show? Will it be expensive? I’m a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Withycombe, without insurance, extensive testing is… not ideal. We could do some basic bloodwork to rule out anything systemic. But frankly, this sounds like it could be a dermatological issue. I’m not a skin specialist. I recommend you see a dermatologist. They can give you a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. I’m not going to subject you to unnecessary testing if it’s going to be a financial burden. It’s unlikely to be serious, but it's best to get it checked. I’ll write you a referral. Do you have any preference for a dermatologist?
PATIENT: A referral… that sounds… sensible. No, I don’t have a preference. I just… want it to stop. The red face, I mean. And I don’t want it to be… something bad. Can you just write down a name, Doctor? Anyone close by? And… how much does a visit to a dermatologist usually cost, do you know? Roughly? I need to… plan. It’s just… money is tight.
DOCTOR: Alright. There's Dr. Anya Sharma, she's about ten minutes from here. As for cost… it varies. A basic consultation can be anywhere from $150 to $300 without insurance. Further tests, if needed, will be extra. I can’t give you a precise figure, unfortunately. Here's the referral slip with her contact information. I suggest you call her office and ask about their fees before scheduling an appointment. And I would suggest you monitor your blood pressure at home. You can get a home monitor fairly cheaply. Keep a log and bring it with you to your dermatology appointment. Any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay. $150 to $300… I will… try to save. Dr. Sharma, you said? Ten minutes… good. I can do that. A blood pressure monitor… yes, maybe that’s a good idea. I’m… grateful for your help, Doctor. It’s… reassuring to have a plan. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… thank you. I will call Dr. Sharma tomorrow. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, get that blood pressure checked. And don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day, Mr. Withycombe. .
