DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. It’s… my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a little while now. I don’t really… keep track of those things. Just hurts when I swallow. Can we hurry this up, please? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: A sore throat, alright. “A little while now” isn’t terribly specific, but we’ll work with it. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: More…? What more is there to say? It hurts. Like… something’s scratchy. And… swollen, I think. Honestly, I just want something to make it stop hurting. I don't understand why I need to explain everything so much. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Well, we need some information to figure out what's causing the pain and how to best treat it. "Scratchy" and "swollen" are helpful, but can you rate the pain on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain you've ever felt?
PATIENT: One to ten? Really? I don’t… do numbers. It’s uncomfortable. More than a little, less than… a lot. Somewhere in the middle, I guess. Why do you need a number? Is that going to make it better? I just want a pill. A strong one.
DOCTOR: Alright. No need to get frustrated. The number just helps me gauge the severity. Have you had a fever, any chills, cough, or runny nose along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but I don’t bother with thermometers. And no, no cough, no sniffles. Just the throat. Honestly, I haven’t been feeling well generally, but I don’t think that’s connected. It’s probably just… old age. Can we please get to the medicine? I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand you're busy, Ms. Ottaviani. But "not feeling well generally" is relevant. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific…? Oh, just tired. Achy. Like… everything hurts a little bit all the time. It’s just how I feel. It’s not new. I've always been like this. I don’t need to list every ache and pain I’ve ever had. I don't see how any of this matters for my throat. Just give me something for the pain, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any difficulty breathing or swallowing, aside from the pain?
PATIENT: Difficulty…? No. I eat just fine. I drink just fine. It hurts when I swallow, but I can still swallow. What kind of question is that? Are you suggesting I can’t even eat? This is ridiculous. I've lived a long life, I know what I can and can't do. Just… the throat hurts. Can we be done now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. Let’s take a quick look at your throat. Please open wide and say “Ah.” I'm going to use a light.
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It hurts, you know. Everything hurts. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your throat is a little red, some swelling. It doesn't look severely infected at this point. But given your description of generally not feeling well, and the fact that this has been going on for a while, I’d like to do a quick strep test, just to rule that out. It’s a simple swab, shouldn't take more than a moment. And I'm going to check your temperature.
PATIENT: A swab? Absolutely not. I don’t like things in my mouth. And a thermometer? Really? I told you, I don't bother with those things. Look, I’m a grown woman. I know what's wrong with me. I just need something for the pain. A strong painkiller. Is that too much to ask? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, I understand you’re uncomfortable, but it’s important to rule out possible causes before prescribing medication. Giving you a painkiller without knowing why your throat hurts could mask a more serious problem. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Serious problem? Don't be ridiculous. I've lived a long life, I know my body. And no, I don’t know of any allergies. I take what people give me. I don’t bother with labels. Honestly, you are wasting my time. I'm starting to think I should have just stayed home and suffered. Just… give me something for the pain. Please. Before I lose my patience completely.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. Given your refusal of any testing and your insistence on medication, I am going to prescribe you ibuprofen 600mg three times a day with food. However, I strongly advise you to monitor your symptoms. If your pain worsens, you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or any other concerning symptoms, you must seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Ibuprofen. Fine. Just get me out of here. I’m wasting my entire day. Honestly. Some doctors just want to hear themselves talk… .
