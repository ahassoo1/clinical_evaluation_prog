DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. I am here today to get cleared for a new place to live – a senior living facility. My daughter thought it was time, and well… she is usually right. I want to make sure I am fit enough to move in and not cause anyone trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand. A pre-placement evaluation, then. That's perfectly reasonable. It's good of your daughter to be proactive. Alright, Mr. Tkac, let's start with a little bit about why they require this evaluation. Do you know what specific aspects of your health they're concerned about, or what they need me to assess?
PATIENT: Hmm, that is a good question, Doctor. I believe they wanted to know about my… strength, mostly. And my memory, I suppose. It’s been a little… wandering, lately. Nothing serious, just forgetting where I put my glasses, or what I had for breakfast. Things like that. They also mentioned something about making sure I didn’t fall easily, as I have a bit of a tremor in my hands. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Strength, cognitive function, and fall risk – all very important considerations for a transition like this. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I had a bit of trouble with my heart a long time ago. They said it was… enlarged, I think. I had some tests and took some pills for a while, but it seems to have settled down. The doctor back home said I didn’t need to worry too much about it anymore, though I still get a bit winded sometimes. Apart from that, just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. And my hands shake a little, as I mentioned. Is there anything specific you are looking for?
DOCTOR: Just trying to get a full picture, Mr. Tkac. The enlarged heart is important to know. Do you recall the name of the condition, if you happen to remember?
PATIENT: Oh dear… names have never been my strong suit. I remember the doctor saying something about… cardi-something. Cardi-omyopathy, maybe? It sounds right, but I am not certain. It was many years ago now, and I was quite worried at the time, so I wasn’t listening too closely to all the fancy words. I do recall it affected how well my heart pumped, that much I remember.
DOCTOR: Cardiomyopathy is a good possibility. Alright. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… yes, I had my appendix removed when I was a young man. And… oh, yes, a few operations on my knees, many years later. Bad knees, you see. From years of… well, from life, I suppose. Nothing major, just to fix them up a bit. They don’t bother me too much anymore, but I can tell when it’s going to rain. They ache something fierce then.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy and bilateral knee surgeries. Do you recall when those knee surgeries were performed, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The first one was… oh, goodness. Probably around… 1985, I would say. And the second one… a few years later. Maybe 1992 or 1993. It was before my wife passed, certainly. She was a great help with my recovery, always making sure I did my exercises. Good woman. I apologize, Doctor. I get carried away sometimes.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Tkac. Family history is relevant. Was there any family history of heart disease, dementia, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That is a difficult question, Doctor. My family… well, they didn’t talk much about illness, if I’m honest. We were Lakota, you see, and there was a bit of shame associated with weakness, or sickness. My mother… she passed when I was young. I believe she had a bit of trouble remembering things towards the end, but they didn’t call it anything. And my father was a strong man, very strong, but he died young from… a sickness of the blood, I think. Not heart trouble, certainly. I am not certain about other relatives, as we didn't see them often. We were a wandering people, you see, and kept to ourselves mostly.
DOCTOR: I see. Alright. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, vitamins, or over-the-counter supplements?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, I have a list here, thankfully. My daughter insisted on it. Let me see… I take Lisinopril, for my blood pressure. And something for my… cholesterol, I believe. Atorvastatin, that’s it. And a baby aspirin every day, to thin the blood. Apart from that, just a multivitamin, and sometimes I take something for my aching joints, when they bother me particularly. It’s called… glucosamine, I think.
DOCTOR: And do you experience any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, not that I know of. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I have a bit of a sensitive stomach sometimes, but that’s just from eating too much, I suppose. And my skin gets a bit itchy in the winter, but that’s just the cold, dry air. Nothing serious, Doctor. No rashes, or trouble breathing, or anything like that. I am fairly certain I have no allergies.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Tkac, let's do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and assess your strength and balance. Can you stand for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am not as nimble as I once was, but I can stand, yes. Just take it easy with me, alright? Old bones creak a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. I’m hearing a slight murmur, which we’ll need to keep an eye on. Your lungs sound reasonably clear. Now, let's check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. Not as strong as they used to be, I am afraid. The tremor makes it a bit difficult to grip properly. But I am squeezing as hard as I can. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Strength is a little diminished, particularly in the lower extremities. And you do exhibit some unsteadiness. Now, let's quickly check your reflexes. Reflexes are a bit sluggish. It appears there is some mild balance impairment, and diminished strength. Finally, let’s just do a quick cognitive assessment… Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… Hmm. It is… August. That much I know. And the… the second. Yes, the second of August. 2025, is it? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, August 2nd, 2025. Alright. And can you spell “world” for me, backwards?
PATIENT: “World”… hmm. Let me think… D… L… R… O… W… That is it, right? D-L-R-O-W. Is that correct, Doctor? It’s been a long time since I had to spell backwards. My daughter used to make me do it with her, for practice. She was a very clever girl.
DOCTOR: That is… almost correct. It’s W-O-R-L-D. Look, Mr. Tkac, based on this brief examination, there are some concerns. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated. You have mild weakness, a slight tremor, some balance impairment, and some difficulty with cognitive recall. It appears your memory is a bit diminished. While not dramatic, these issues could pose a challenge in a senior living facility. We need to investigate further. I recommend a full neurological evaluation, and a cardiology work-up to assess the murmur. Additionally, a comprehensive blood panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I will also refer you to a physical therapist for a more detailed assessment of your balance and gait. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. That is… a lot. So, you are saying I am not quite ready for the facility yet? That is…disappointing. But I suppose it is better to know the truth, than to… fall and cause trouble. A neurological evaluation… and a cardiology work-up… and a physical therapist… It sounds like a busy time ahead. My daughter will be relieved to hear you are being so thorough. What do I need to do first? Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Alright. I will write you referrals to Dr. Ramirez, a neurologist at City General Hospital, and Dr. Chen, a cardiologist, also at City General. I will also give you a prescription for a referral to Active Life Physical Therapy. My office will schedule the appointments for you. In the meantime, avoid any strenuous activity, and ensure someone is with you when you’re moving around. I also recommend you continue taking your medications as prescribed. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. You have explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience with me. I will talk to my daughter and we will get the appointments scheduled as soon as possible. Thank you again for your time and your help. I think I will go home now and rest. It has been a long morning.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Tkac. I will have my nurse provide you with the referral paperwork and instructions. Take care, and follow up with my office as directed. .
