DOCTOR: Hi Jase, nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Amussen, nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I guess. It’s been… not great. I’ve had diarrhea for a while now, and it just won’t stop. Honestly, I don’t even remember exactly when it started, just that it’s been a good bit of time.
DOCTOR: Okay, diarrhea for a while now… I understand. When you say "a while," could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, that's the hard part. Maybe… a month? Or longer? It's all kind of blurring together, to be honest. I'm really bad with dates. It feels like it's been going on and off, but mostly on lately. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. So, mostly on for the past month or so, with it happening intermittently before that. Okay. And can you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to describe it… it’s pretty watery, definitely. And… frequent. I'm going to the bathroom a lot. Sometimes it's just a little bit, sometimes it's… not. And it’s… uncomfortable, obviously. I don't think there's anything… weird in it, like blood or anything, but I’m not really looking, you know? I just… deal with it. Sorry, that’s probably gross.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Jase. It's good you're describing things as you experience them. No blood is good to know. Has there been any cramping or pain with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely cramping. It’s mostly in my lower stomach, and it comes and goes with… well, with everything else. It’s not horrible pain, but it’s enough to make me feel pretty miserable. It feels like… pressure, sometimes. And it makes me really tired, honestly. I just want to lie down a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping in the lower stomach that comes and goes with the diarrhea and feeling tired. I understand. Have you noticed any fever, nausea, or vomiting along with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever that I’ve noticed. And no vomiting, thankfully. I get a little bit queasy sometimes, like I might be sick, but it never actually happens. Just… a bit off. And I haven’t lost my appetite, if that matters. I’m still eating pretty normally, I think. Though, I haven't been feeling like cooking much. My husband’s been doing most of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or vomiting, occasional nausea, and appetite is okay. That's good. Now, let’s talk about other things. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. We went to visit my in-laws in… oh, what was it… February? But that was ages ago. And we didn't go anywhere exotic. Just a couple of hours drive. Nothing since then, definitely. We haven’t had time, really. I mostly just go to work and come home.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent travel. And have you eaten anything unusual or new lately?
PATIENT: That’s a tough one… not that I can think of. I eat pretty much the same things all the time. My husband tried to get me to try some new curry last week, but I didn’t really like it, so I didn’t have much. Nothing else springs to mind. I’m a pretty picky eater, to be honest. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. Okay, so no new foods, no recent travel… Let’s go through some basic medical questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of. I haven’t had any reactions to anything, as far as I remember. I’m not really one for taking pills, so I don’t have much experience with medications, anyway. I get a bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s it. Just a runny nose and stuff. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies other than seasonal hay fever. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Like I said, I try to avoid pills if I can. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but that’s it. And I haven’t taken anything for my hay fever this year, it hasn’t been too bad. Honestly, I don’t even think I have any vitamins or anything like that in the house. My husband is usually the one who handles all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications or supplements. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… I had a really bad stomach bug when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And I had my appendix out when I was 16, but other than that… not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, I think. My doctor always said I was a "textbook case" or something. But now this… I don't know. It's weird. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. So, a childhood stomach bug and appendectomy at 16, otherwise generally healthy. And have you ever had any surgeries besides your appendectomy?
PATIENT: No, just the appendectomy. Definitely nothing else. And… oh! I broke my arm when I was little, but that wasn’t a surgery, just a cast. Nothing major. I’m really not a surgical person, if that makes sense. I get nervous just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Jase. No other surgeries. Let’s talk about your family… Does anyone in your family have a history of digestive problems, like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Um… my mother has a really sensitive stomach, I think. She gets a lot of heartburn and indigestion, but I don’t know if it’s anything serious. And my aunt… I think she had something with her intestines a few years ago, but I don’t really remember the details. My husband says his grandfather had something similar to… Crohn’s disease, maybe? But he’s not very good with medical terms, so I’m not sure. Is that helpful? It feels like there’s a lot of stomach trouble in my family, but no one really talks about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, some family history of digestive issues – your mother with sensitive stomach, aunt with intestinal issue, and husband’s grandfather possibly with Crohn’s disease. And finally, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, definitely not. I don't smoke, and I hardly ever drink. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's it. And I've never touched drugs in my life. My husband doesn't drink much either, so it's not really a thing in our house. We're pretty boring, to be honest. Mostly just work and relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no drug use. That's good to know. Alright, Jase, thank you for all that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check things out. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I’m a bit nervous, but I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. No problem at all, I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just lie back on the exam table, and try to relax. Okay… bowel sounds are present in all quadrants, though slightly hyperactive. That's not necessarily a cause for concern with diarrhea. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen, feeling for any tenderness or masses. Just let me know if anything feels painful. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah… a little bit. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Right around here, maybe a little bit lower. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not terrible, but it’s definitely not comfortable. Like a pressure, almost. It feels a bit better when you’re not pressing, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen, more pronounced with pressure. No masses are felt. Now I'm going to check for any rebound tenderness. This just means I'm going to press gently, then quickly release the pressure. Let me know if that causes any pain. Does that hurt any more when I release the pressure?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah! That’s… a little bit worse when you let go. It's not horrible, but I definitely feel it. Like a quick, sharp twinge. It’s not something I usually feel, just when you do that. It's… unsettling. Sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful. It's hard to describe.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Jase. It's good you're telling me what you're feeling. Okay, slight rebound tenderness. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs just to get a baseline. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 120/80, pulse is 80. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Okay, Jase, that gives me a little more information. Based on your history and the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing acute gastroenteritis, which is essentially an inflammation of the stomach and intestines. It's very common, often caused by a virus or bacteria. The tenderness and rebound tenderness suggest some inflammation in your lower abdomen.
PATIENT: Okay… gastroenteritis. That sounds… not good. Is it serious? And what does that even mean? I’m a bit worried now. Will I need… tests? Or medicine? I just want it to stop, honestly. It’s really tiring dealing with this all the time.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re worried, Jase. Gastroenteritis is rarely serious and often resolves on its own within a few days to a week. It means your stomach and intestines are irritated, causing diarrhea, cramping, and other symptoms. Based on your symptoms and the exam, I don’t think extensive testing is necessary at this time. However, given the tenderness, I do want to rule out anything more serious. I'd like to order a stool sample test, just to check for any bacterial infections or parasites. It's a simple test, you just collect a small sample at home and bring it back to the clinic. For now, the most important thing is to stay hydrated. Drink plenty of fluids – water, broth, electrolyte solutions. Avoid dairy, greasy foods, and sugary drinks. A bland diet – like toast, rice, bananas – is best. And get plenty of rest. I'm also going to prescribe an anti-diarrheal medication, loperamide, to help control the symptoms. It’s available over-the-counter, but I’ll send a prescription to your pharmacy to make it easier. It should help slow things down and give your stomach a chance to recover. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Like I said before, I haven’t had any reactions to anything. Okay, so a stool sample and some medicine. That sounds… manageable. I can definitely do that. Will the medicine make me… sleepy? I need to be able to go to work, you know. And what if it doesn’t work? I’m really worried it’ll just keep going and going. It’s already been so long. And should I be worried about… catching something from my husband? He's been fine, thankfully, but I don’t want to get him sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Loperamide doesn't usually cause significant drowsiness, but everyone reacts differently, so be cautious when driving or operating machinery. If you feel excessively tired, avoid those activities. If the medication doesn’t improve your symptoms within 48 hours, or if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, please contact the clinic immediately. We'll reassess the situation and consider further testing if needed. As for your husband, gastroenteritis is often contagious, so it’s important to practice good hygiene. Wash your hands thoroughly after using the restroom and before preparing food. Avoid sharing utensils, towels, and other personal items. If he starts to experience symptoms, he should contact the clinic as well. Here’s the lab requisition form for the stool sample and the prescription for the loperamide. I’ll also give you a handout with detailed instructions on managing gastroenteritis at home. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… a lot of information. I think I’ve got it, but I’m a bit overwhelmed. Handwashing and avoiding sharing things… got it. I’ll make sure to tell my husband. Um… I guess my only other question is… is this something I should be worried about happening again? Like, is this a sign of something more serious that I need to get checked out regularly? I just don’t want this to keep coming back. It’s really disruptive, and I’m getting tired of feeling sick all the time. And sorry if I’m asking silly questions, I just don’t know much about this stuff.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly valid question, Jase, and not silly at all. Most cases of acute gastroenteritis are isolated incidents and don’t recur. However, if you experience frequent episodes of diarrhea, or if they’re accompanied by other symptoms like weight loss, abdominal pain, or bloating, it could be a sign of an underlying condition like irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease . In your case, given that this is the first time you've experienced this, I wouldn't be overly concerned at this point. But if the symptoms persist for more than a few weeks, or if they keep coming back, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me, and we can discuss further testing and potential treatment options. For now, focus on staying hydrated, following the dietary recommendations, and getting plenty of rest. And don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Dr. Amussen. You’ve been really helpful, and you’ve explained everything really clearly. I feel a lot better now, even though I’m still a bit worried. I’ll definitely follow your instructions and contact you if anything changes. Thank you again. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could help. Remember, it’s always best to err on the side of caution, so don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Get some rest, and I hope you feel better soon. You have a good day too. Stop by the front desk on your way out to schedule a follow-up if needed.
PATIENT: .
