DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. I'm Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it's the cigarettes. I've been...indulging for a very long time, and I think it’s time I tried to put a stop to it. It’s become rather a nuisance, and I worry about my health, naturally.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Knoch. It’s very wise of you to address this now. It’s never too late to improve your health. And you're right to be concerned about the impact of long-term smoking. To get a better understanding of things, could you tell me a little more about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Where shall I begin? I started, oh, goodness, around the age of fifteen, back in Lithuania. It was…common, you see. Everyone smoked. A pack a day was nothing unusual. I continued when I came to this country, and…well, it just stuck. For the last twenty years, perhaps a little less than a pack a day, usually. Though on weekends…sometimes a bit more, if I'm being truthful. I prefer the unfiltered kind, if that makes any difference.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful information, thank you. So, roughly… about 50 pack-years of smoking history?
PATIENT: Fifty pack-years…is that a great deal, Doctor? I confess, I don’t follow these calculations. I simply know I’ve smoked a lot, for a long time. Is that…bad? And what is a pack-year, exactly? Perhaps you could explain it to me? I like to understand these things properly.
DOCTOR: Of course. A pack-year is calculated by multiplying the number of packs of cigarettes you smoke per day by the number of years you've smoked. So, one pack a day for 20 years equals 20 pack-years. Fifty pack-years is considered a significant history, and does increase your risk for certain health problems. Now, have you tried to quit before, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Several times, actually. Mostly, I would try to…will myself to stop. A cold turkey approach, you might say. It lasts…a day, perhaps two. Then the cravings become unbearable, and I find myself reaching for a cigarette again. I tried those patches once, a few years back, but they made me quite unwell, gave me a terrible rash. And my neighbor, Mrs. Olsen, swore by chewing gum, but it didn’t work for me at all. I've also attempted to reduce the number I smoke each day, slowly, but that didn't yield much success either. It's...a difficult habit to break, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: It certainly is a difficult habit, Mr. Knoch, and you've tried several reasonable approaches. It sounds like you've already identified that cold turkey and the patches haven't been effective for you. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, nothing serious, thankfully. My knees ache a bit, especially in the cold weather, but the doctor says it's just old age and wear and tear. I have a touch of high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication, a small pill I take each morning. And…I occasionally have a bit of indigestion, but nothing that keeps me up at night. Otherwise, I’m reasonably healthy for my age, I believe. I do try to walk every day, when the weather permits. A short stroll, nothing strenuous.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure, if you recall the name?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s a small white pill. Oh dear, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I believe it starts with an ‘A’… Amlodipine, perhaps? Yes, I think that’s it. Amlodipine, five milligrams, once a day. I get it refilled regularly at the pharmacy down the street. They’re very good there, always reminding me when I need a new prescription. I hope I am correct.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Amlodipine is correct. Thank you for that information. Now, before we discuss options for quitting, I’d like to ask a few questions about your overall health. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, persistent cough, or chest pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. A little breathless after a particularly long walk, perhaps, but nothing more than one would expect for a man of my age. No persistent cough, thankfully. And no chest pain at all, not even during exertion. I do occasionally feel a bit of…a tightness in my chest, but I usually attribute that to indigestion. I find a cup of chamomile tea helps with that. I must say, I’ve been quite fortunate in that regard, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Knoch. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your throat. This will help me assess your overall health and determine the best course of action for quitting smoking. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please proceed. I understand it’s all part of the process. I am ready when you are. I confess, I am a little nervous, but I suppose that is to be expected. I am determined to rid myself of this habit, and I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knoch. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Please breathe deeply through your mouth as I listen. Your heart sounds regular, a slight murmur, but that is common for your age. Lungs sound slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally, but no wheezes or crackles detected. Blood pressure is 140/90, slightly elevated, but consistent with your reported medication use. Throat appears normal, no redness or swelling. Your oxygen saturation is 96% on room air, which is good. Given your smoking history, these findings are within acceptable range, but we should aim to improve your lung function and blood pressure.
PATIENT: That's reassuring to hear, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. I was rather worried about my lungs, given how long I've smoked. So, 140/90 is not too bad, then? Is that something we can address with medication adjustments, perhaps? I'm quite willing to follow your recommendations. I trust your judgment implicitly. And what about the cigarettes? What options do we have?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you're proactive about your health, Mr. Knoch. 140/90 is slightly above the recommended target, ideally we'd like to see it below 130/80. We can discuss potentially adjusting your Amlodipine dosage or adding a second medication, if needed. But let's focus on the smoking first, as that is likely contributing to your blood pressure as well. There are several options for quitting. We could consider nicotine replacement therapy – patches, gum, lozenges – though you've already tried the patches. There are also prescription medications, like bupropion or varenicline, that can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. These do have potential side effects, so we'd need to discuss those carefully. Another option is behavioral counseling, which can provide support and strategies for overcoming your habit. We also have resources for support groups here at the clinic. What sounds most appealing to you?
PATIENT: Hmm. The patches, as I said, did not agree with me. And the thought of more medication…well, I prefer to avoid it if possible. Behavioral counseling…that sounds rather sensible, actually. Perhaps talking things through with someone might help. Do you have someone here at the clinic who specializes in that sort of thing? And what would that involve, exactly? Would it be…a lot of talking about my past? I am not a great fan of dredging up old memories, if I am honest. A support group…well, that sounds a bit intimidating, to be frank. I’m a rather private person.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Knoch. We do have a wonderful counselor, Sarah Chen, who specializes in smoking cessation. She has a very gentle approach and doesn’t push anyone to discuss things they're uncomfortable with. It's primarily focused on developing coping mechanisms for cravings and identifying triggers that lead to smoking. It's less about dwelling on the past and more about building a plan for the future. The sessions are one-on-one, in a private and confidential setting. Sarah has availability next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:00 PM…yes, that would be perfectly acceptable. That gives me a few days to…prepare myself, I suppose. And what about cost? Is this covered by insurance? Though, as I mentioned, I don’t actually have insurance, unfortunately. I’ve been meaning to get some, but…well, it’s a complicated story. Is it expensive?
DOCTOR: Let me check on the cost for you. Alright, Mr. Knoch, the sessions with Sarah are $125 per hour. Because you are uninsured, we do offer a sliding scale fee based on income. Given your situation, I believe you would qualify for a reduced rate of $75 per session. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: $75…yes, that is quite reasonable, actually. I can certainly afford that. And that includes her time and…expertise, I presume? Very well, then. Let’s book an appointment for next Tuesday at 2:00 PM, please. I suppose I should bring some identification, and perhaps a list of the medications I am currently taking? I want to be as prepared as possible. This is… a significant step for me, you know.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, please bring your identification and a list of your medications. And it is a significant step, Mr. Knoch, and I commend you for taking it. Here is a confirmation of your appointment with Sarah Chen next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. It also includes her contact information if you need to reschedule or have any questions beforehand. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have been most helpful, and I am very grateful for your patience and understanding. I feel… a little more optimistic, actually. Thank you again. I shall see you next Tuesday, then. I appreciate your time. .
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Mr. Knoch. I am confident that you can successfully quit smoking. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your appointment. Have a good day.
