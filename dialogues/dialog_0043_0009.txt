DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Alcorta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Though, frankly, I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for this…trouble with my sight. It’s becoming quite bothersome, really. I suppose you’ll want the details, then. It’s just…difficult to explain precisely.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. Please, take your time. It's perfectly alright if it's difficult to explain. We'll work through it together. When did you first notice this trouble with your sight?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a fair question. Honestly, I’m not one for dwelling on dates. It was…sometime this spring, I believe. Perhaps March? No, no, it was after the dogwoods bloomed, so…April, then. Yes, April sounds right. It started subtly, a bit of…blurriness, I suppose. I initially dismissed it as fatigue, working long hours, you understand. It’s not every day you find someone reliable these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. Fatigue can certainly affect vision. And it’s good you’re addressing it now. So, this blurriness started in April, and you initially thought it was due to working long hours. Has it been gradually worsening since then, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, definitely gradually. Not some dramatic overnight change, thank goodness. Though, “gradually” is relative, isn’t it? It’s reached a point where I find myself…hesitating when driving, which is quite unacceptable. And reading reports…well, let's just say I've been delegating more tasks than usual. It’s a nuisance, really. Delegating. It’s just not the same when one has to constantly verify the work. People simply don’t possess the same attention to detail these days.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Alcorta. Hesitation while driving and difficulty with reading are definitely things we need to investigate. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the blurriness in more detail?
PATIENT: Detail…yes. Well, it’s not a uniform blur, if that makes any sense. It’s…patchy. As if looking through…smudged glass, perhaps? And it seems to be worse in low light. Evenings are particularly difficult. And…oh, this is rather embarrassing to admit, but sometimes things appear…faded. Not completely colorless, but…washed out. Like an old photograph. It’s most disconcerting, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Alcorta. Patchy blurriness, worse in low light, and a fading of colors…that gives us a good starting point. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the vision changes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me consider. Other symptoms…well, there’s been a bit of…eye strain, naturally. Staring at reports all day isn’t conducive to comfort, you understand. And…occasionally, a slight headache behind the eyes. Nothing debilitating, mind you, but…present. I also seem to be…more sensitive to glare. Bright sunlight, headlights at night…quite bothersome. Though, I attribute much of that to the quality of modern lighting, frankly. Everything is so…harsh these days.
DOCTOR: I see. Eye strain, occasional headaches, and increased sensitivity to glare. Thank you for sharing those details, Mr. Alcorta. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical history… a rather lengthy topic, I’m afraid. I was, unfortunately, afflicted with a rather persistent bout of bronchitis several years ago, but that has long since resolved. Other than that…nothing of significant note. I've always prided myself on my robust health, good genes, you understand. My mother lived to be ninety-two, and my father…well, he was quite a vigorous man until…a rather unfortunate incident with a tractor. But, to answer your question directly, no, no significant medical conditions. I do not take any regular medications. Though I wouldn’t trust those pharmaceuticals anyway. Filled with who knows what.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about medications, Mr. Alcorta. It’s good to be informed. And it's positive you have no known chronic medical conditions. Have you ever had any eye surgeries or injuries?
PATIENT: No, none whatsoever. My eyes have always been… quite delicate, actually. I was cautioned as a child against strenuous activities, anything that might risk injury. And I’ve always been exceedingly careful. I did, once, have a rather unfortunate encounter with a rogue pine needle, but that hardly qualifies as an injury. A minor irritation, quickly resolved with a bit of warm water. No surgeries, no trauma. Simply…a predisposition to carefulness, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any instances of vision problems – such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts – in your family?
PATIENT: Family history…another lengthy topic. My maternal grandmother, I believe, suffered from cataracts in her later years, though she was a rather…eccentric woman, so one can’t be certain of the details. My father’s side…well, they weren’t particularly forthcoming with medical information. A rather stoic bunch, you understand. I believe my uncle mentioned something about…weakness in the eyes, perhaps? But it was during a rather boisterous holiday gathering, so the details are…murky, at best. Let’s just say there’s no strong history of vision problems, if that’s any consolation. Mostly just vague recollections and unsubstantiated claims.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Alcorta. Vague recollections are better than nothing. And it’s good to know there isn’t a strong family history. Finally, let's briefly discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… a straightforward topic, thankfully. I do not smoke. Never have. A rather barbaric habit, in my opinion. And I partake in alcohol…very occasionally. A glass of sherry with dinner, perhaps, on special occasions. Moderation is key, you understand. I believe a good constitution is best maintained through sensible habits. I also enjoy a brisk walk in the garden each morning, weather permitting, of course. Fresh air and sunlight are essential for maintaining one’s vitality.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you for sharing all of that information, Mr. Alcorta. Now, I’d like to perform a brief eye exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: An exam…yes, of course. Though I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of instruments near my eyes. But, if it’s necessary, I suppose I can endure it. Just…please be gentle. And explain everything as you go along. I dislike surprises, you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your apprehension. I will be as gentle as possible and explain each step as I go along. First, I’m going to check your visual acuity – that’s just a measure of how well you can see at different distances. I'll have you read letters on a chart. Could you please look at the chart and read the smallest line of letters you can see?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I suspect my vision isn't quite as sharp as it once was. Let's see… E…F…P…T…Oh dear. This is rather small. Is that a V? Or a J? It’s…difficult to discern. Perhaps I should stand a bit closer.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Alcorta. I'm noting your visual acuity is 20/30 in your right eye and 20/40 in your left eye at distance. That indicates some mild vision impairment. Now, let’s check your peripheral vision. I’m going to ask you to focus on this point, and I'll gently present objects in your side vision. Just tell me when you see something.
PATIENT: Peripheral vision…hmm. I've always been rather…aware of my surroundings. Proceed when you're ready, Doctor. Though I must confess, this is rather unsettling. It feels…exposed. Like being watched.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Alcorta. Your peripheral vision appears intact in both eyes. Now, I’m going to examine your pupils and the front of your eyes with a light and a magnifying instrument. It’s important to look closely at your corneas, irises, and lenses. This may be a little uncomfortable, but I'll be as gentle as possible. Just try to relax and look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Oh dear…that is rather bright. You’re quite right, Doctor, it is a little uncomfortable. It feels…invasive. Though I suppose it’s necessary. Just…please be quick. And tell me if you see anything…concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Alcorta. Your pupils are equal in size and react normally to light. I’m noting some mild lens opacities in both eyes, which is consistent with age-related changes. There’s no evidence of inflammation or other abnormalities. Now, I’m going to perform a simple test to check the pressure inside your eyes. This is called tonometry. It involves a quick puff of air into your eyes. It won’t hurt, but it might feel a little strange. Just relax and keep your eyes open.
PATIENT: A puff of air…oh dear. I’ve always been rather sensitive to…sudden changes in pressure. Just…be quick, Doctor. And warn me before you…activate the instrument. This is most unpleasant. Is it over yet?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Alcorta, that’s all done. Your eye pressure is slightly elevated in both eyes, measuring 22 mmHg in the right eye and 24 mmHg in the left eye. Normal pressure is typically between 10 and 21 mmHg. Based on these findings, Mr. Alcorta, it appears you have some early signs of glaucoma. Now, this doesn’t necessarily mean you have glaucoma, but it does warrant further investigation. We need to rule out other possible causes for the elevated pressure and monitor your condition closely. Would you like me to explain what glaucoma is and what the next steps might be?
PATIENT: Glaucoma? Glaucoma…is that…serious? My mother…she had a cousin, I believe, who…lost her sight. Is that what you’re saying? Losing one’s sight…it’s an appalling thought. Yes, Doctor. Please…explain. What are the next steps? And is there…anything that can be done?
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, it’s understandable to be concerned, and I want to assure you we’re going to take this one step at a time. Glaucoma is a condition that damages the optic nerve, often due to increased pressure inside the eye. It can lead to vision loss if left untreated, but it’s often manageable with treatment. The first step is to perform a visual field test. This test maps out your peripheral vision and can help us determine if there’s any existing damage to your optic nerve. We’ll also do an optical coherence tomography, or OCT scan, which is a detailed imaging of your optic nerve and retinal layers. These tests will give us a clearer picture of your condition. If the tests confirm glaucoma, there are several treatment options available, including eye drops, laser treatment, or surgery. The goal of treatment is to lower your eye pressure and prevent further damage to your optic nerve. We'll start with the visual field test and OCT scan. I’ll have my assistant schedule those for you. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Visual field test…OCT scan…more tests. It seems I’m destined to spend my days in medical facilities. Eye drops, laser treatment, surgery…the thought is…unsettling. Are these treatments…painful? And what are the…side effects? I’ve heard dreadful stories about medications, you understand. And…what if the treatments don't work? Will I inevitably…lose my sight?
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your anxieties, and it's perfectly reasonable to ask those questions. Let’s address them one by one. The visual field test is a non-invasive test that takes about 30-60 minutes. You’ll simply look into a machine and indicate when you see lights in your peripheral vision. It's not painful at all. As for treatments, eye drops are the most common initial treatment. They can cause mild side effects like stinging or redness, but these are usually temporary. We’ll start with the lowest effective dose and monitor you closely for any side effects. Laser treatment and surgery are typically reserved for cases that don't respond to eye drops. They are more involved, but advancements in technology have made them much safer and more comfortable than they used to be. Now, regarding your concern about inevitable vision loss… it’s important to remember that early detection and treatment can significantly slow or even prevent vision loss. Glaucoma is a progressive condition, but with regular monitoring and appropriate treatment, most people can maintain good vision for a lifetime. We’ll work closely together to manage your condition and minimize your risk. I want to assure you we’ll do everything we can to help you maintain your vision. My assistant will schedule the visual field test and OCT scan, and we’ll discuss the results in detail at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: I suppose…no. Not at this moment. Very well. Schedule the tests, then. Though I must confess, I’m not looking forward to it. Perhaps…a referral to a second opinion? Just to be certain, you understand. I believe in thoroughness, and…a different perspective might be…reassuring. It’s simply…a significant diagnosis, and…I wish to be certain we’re exploring all possible avenues.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, that is an excellent idea. I absolutely support you seeking a second opinion. It’s always wise to be thorough, and I want you to feel completely comfortable with your care. I can certainly provide you with a referral to a glaucoma specialist. Dr. Eleanor Vance is an excellent ophthalmologist who specializes in glaucoma treatment. She’s highly respected in the field and has a reputation for providing compassionate care. I’ll have my assistant prepare a referral for you. In the meantime, we can proceed with the visual field test and OCT scan, so we have a baseline to share with Dr. Vance. We'll schedule those for you, and once we have the results, you can schedule an appointment with her. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Dr. Vance…yes, that sounds…acceptable. Proceed with the tests, then. Though I must confess, I’m still rather anxious about the whole situation. Perhaps…a detailed explanation of the test procedures? Just so I know what to expect, you understand. I dislike surprises, and…knowing what to expect might alleviate some of my anxiety. A pamphlet, perhaps? Or a video? Anything that might prepare me for…the ordeal.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your anxiety, and I’m happy to provide you with detailed information about the test procedures. For the visual field test, you’ll be seated in front of a machine that looks a bit like a large bowl. You’ll be asked to focus your gaze on a central point, and lights will flash randomly in your peripheral vision. You’ll need to press a button whenever you see a light. The test takes about 30-60 minutes, and it's not painful at all. You might find it a little tedious, but it’s important to stay focused and press the button accurately. The optical coherence tomography, or OCT scan, is a non-invasive imaging test that takes detailed pictures of your optic nerve and retinal layers. You’ll be seated in front of a machine, and a gentle beam of light will be shone into your eyes. It’s similar to getting your eyes checked, but it’s more detailed. It takes just a few minutes, and it’s not painful at all. My assistant will provide you with pamphlets explaining both tests in detail, and she can also direct you to videos online that demonstrate the procedures. We want you to feel as comfortable and prepared as possible. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No…I believe that covers it, for the moment. Very well. Schedule the tests, then. And…thank you, Doctor. For your patience, and…your explanations. Perhaps…a glass of water? I suddenly feel rather…parched. It’s been…a rather stressful afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Alcorta. Absolutely. Sarah, could you please bring Mr. Alcorta a glass of water?
PATIENT: Thank you, Sarah. I appreciate your assistance. Perhaps…a quiet room? Once the tests are completed, of course. Just to…collect my thoughts. It’s been…a rather unsettling experience. I believe I've reached my limit of medical facilities, for the day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. We absolutely have a quiet room available for you to relax in after the tests. My assistant will ensure you have access to it. We want you to feel as comfortable as possible. We've covered a lot today, and I understand this has been unsettling. Please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Now, let’s get those tests scheduled for you. Sarah will handle all the details. And remember, Mr. Alcorta, we’ll work through this together. .
