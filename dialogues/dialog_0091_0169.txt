DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It's a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, pleasure’s all yours, I suppose. It’s… well, my face and legs are puffin’ up. Been happenin’ for a bit now, though I can’t rightly say how long. Things just… blur these days, ya know? Not like it’s botherin' me too much, but my daughter, bless her heart, she kept on at me to come see someone. Said I was lookin’ like a balloon. Women, always fussin’.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that your daughter encouraged you to come in. We want to get to the bottom of this. When you say “puffing up,” can you describe that a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? Hmm. Well, it’s not like a sudden thing, not all at once. More like… slow. My cheeks get kinda rounder, ya know? And my ankles… they get thick. I used to be able to see the bones in my feet, but not so much anymore. It’s mostly when I’ve been on ‘em all day, I reckon. I do a fair bit of standin’ at work, solderin’ and such. Not like I’m runnin’ marathons or anything, but it’s work. And it’s… well, it feels kinda tight, sometimes. Like my boots are a size too small, but they ain’t.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Miner. It sounds like the swelling is gradual and worsens with standing, which is helpful information. And you mentioned this has been happening for some time. Would you say weeks, months, or longer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Months, I suppose. Maybe… six months? Could be longer, honestly. Like I said, time kinda… slips. It wasn’t bad enough to bother me right away, just a little… puffiness. Then it started gettin’ noticeable, and my daughter, she really started naggin’. She worries too much, that one. Always has. But she means well, I’ll give her that. Can’t remember exactly when it started, though. I ain't one for keepin' track of dates.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for these things to develop gradually, and it's good your daughter is looking out for you. Since it’s been happening for at least six months, and you mention it's associated with standing, let's explore this a little further. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me think. Not really. No pain, not unless I’ve really been on my feet all day, then my ankles get a little achy, but it’s nothin’ a good sit-down can’t fix. No shortness of breath, no dizziness… I sleep alright. Appetite’s good, maybe a little too good, if you ask my daughter. She keeps tellin' me to watch my salt, but… well, I like a bit of salt on my food. Can't help it. No, nothin' else really. Just the puffiness, mostly. And the naggin'. Though, I suppose that's a symptom in itself.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of that, Mr. Miner. It's helpful to know what isn’t bothering you as well. No pain, no shortness of breath, good sleep and appetite – that's all good information. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… now, the doctor did mention somethin’ about that a few years back. I think it was when I went for a check-up. Told me to watch my salt, funnily enough. But I don't take any pills for it, nothin’ like that. Never got around to it, to be honest. Didn’t seem to bother me much. Diabetes? No, never. And heart problems… no, never been told nothin’ about my heart. I used to be pretty active, ya know? Used to do a bit of fishin', walkin’ in the woods... not so much these days. Gets harder as ya get older. But I never had any trouble with my heart, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Miner. So, a history of being told you have high blood pressure, but not currently medicated for it, and no known history of diabetes or heart problems. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! I had my appendix out when I was a boy, maybe ten or eleven. That was a long time ago. And… no, nothin' else. Never been in the hospital, not unless you count when my daughter had her babies. I sat with her, ya know? Held her hand. But that don't count, does it? Just waitin’ around, really. So, just the appendix, I reckon. A long, long time ago. Didn't bother me none. Just a little sore for a bit.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Just an appendectomy in childhood. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, or children – who have medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my father, he had a bad heart. Kept him pretty slow in his old age. And my mother, she had… well, she was always complainin' about her legs. Swollen ankles, mostly. Like me, I suppose. And my sister, she’s got somethin’ with her kidneys, I think. Always goin’ to the doctor. My daughter, she's healthy as a horse. Always tellin' me to be healthy, though. But yeah, heart trouble with my father, swollen legs with my mother, and somethin' with my sister’s kidneys. That about covers it. Though, folks didn’t talk about these things much when I was growin’ up. Just toughed it out, mostly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Miner. That’s helpful to know. A family history of heart disease, leg swelling, and kidney problems. And finally, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and I saw what it did to him. No, thank you. Drink… well, I used to have a beer or two with my dinner sometimes. Not much anymore. Not much of a taste for it these days. And recreational drugs? What do you take me for? No, never. Just a simple man, really. Fishin', a bit of solderin', a quiet life. No, no smokin', no drinkin', and certainly no… those things. Though, my daughter might disagree about the quiet part. She says I watch too much television.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Miner. That’s good to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol, and no drug use. And it sounds like you have a fairly relaxed lifestyle, besides the television, as your daughter points out. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’ they’ve given me. I had a bit of a rash once, years ago, after I brushed up against some poison ivy in the woods. But that wasn’t a medicine, was it? Just a plant. No, never been allergic to anythin’ a doctor’s given me. Though, my daughter says I’m allergic to exercise. She’s a funny one, that girl. But no, no known allergies. Just the poison ivy, maybe. But that don't count, does it?
DOCTOR: No, poison ivy doesn't count. So, no known medication or environmental allergies. Alright, Mr. Miner, with your permission, I'd like to perform a physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your legs and feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, go ahead. Do what ya gotta do. I ain’t afraid of a little exam. Though, I warn ya, my ankles are a bit… tender. Just from bein' on 'em all day, I suppose. But go ahead, doc. Whatever ya need to do. Just try not to poke too hard. And if ya hear any funny noises comin' from my chest, don’t worry. Probably just my old bones creakin'.
DOCTOR: I will be as gentle as possible, Mr. Miner. And don't worry about any creaking – that’s perfectly normal. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: There ya go. Not much muscle there, I’m afraid. Been doin' more solderin' than liftin’ these days. Though, I used to be pretty strong, ya know? Used to chop wood for the winter. But those days are long gone. Go ahead, doc. Do what ya need.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner. Just relax your arm, and take a few deep breaths. [I listen intently for a few moments] Your blood pressure is 158 over 92. That's a little elevated. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I can hear a slight murmur. It’s not alarming at this point, but it’s something we’ll need to monitor. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackling. Now, let’s take a look at your legs and feet. I notice significant swelling in both ankles, and your skin is a bit tight. Are you experiencing any pain when I touch your ankles?
PATIENT: Ooh, there's a bit there, yeah. Not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. It's been worse at the end of the day, like I said. Been standin' on 'em for hours, solderin' and such. It's just… tender. And a bit tight. Feels like my boots are shrinkin', even though they ain’t. Right ankle's not quite as bad, but it's gettin' there. It feels a bit… stiff, too. Like I haven't been movin' it enough. Which, to be honest, I haven’t. Been sittin’ more and more these days. Old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner. I'm not detecting any significant tenderness in your feet, and your pulses are present, though slightly weaker than I’d like. The stiffness and swelling, combined with the elevated blood pressure and family history, is concerning. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam findings, I’m concerned about a few possibilities, including peripheral edema related to hypertension, venous insufficiency, or even early signs of heart failure. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some lab tests, including a Complete Blood Count , a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel , a kidney function test, and a BNP level to assess your heart function. I also recommend an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. Would you be able to provide a urine sample for me?
PATIENT: Labs, huh? Always somethin', ain’t it? Urine sample… yeah, I suppose I can manage that. Never been a fan of givin’ up fluids, but… if ya think it’s necessary. CBC, CMP, kidney function… all these fancy names. What exactly are we lookin’ for? And this BNP level… is that somethin' serious? I ain't keen on hearin' about heart failure, if ya don't mind. I just thought my legs were puffin' up a bit. Don’t go makin' a mountain out of a molehill, doc. But yeah, I can give ya a sample. Just point me to the… facilities.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Miner, and I assure you, I’m not trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. These tests are simply to gather more information and rule out any serious underlying causes for your symptoms. The CBC will check for any signs of infection or anemia, the CMP will assess your kidney and liver function, and the kidney function test will specifically look at how well your kidneys are working. The BNP level is a blood test that can help detect early signs of heart failure, but it's just one piece of the puzzle. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. There's a collection cup and instructions inside. Once you've collected the sample, you can just leave it on the counter, and the nurse will take it from there. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. While we are waiting for the results, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible and limiting your salt intake. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Elevate my legs, huh? That sounds… manageable. And less salt… well, I suppose I can try. My daughter will be pleased. She’s always naggin' me about the salt. Alright, I’ll go and… contribute a sample. Just point me in the right direction. And try not to keep me waitin’ too long for these results, doc. I ain't gettin' any younger, ya know? .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Miner. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. We’ll do our best to expedite the results and will contact you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe swelling. .
