DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kelder. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you’re with Medicare, and the clinic is… suburban, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right, Doctor. Medicare is what I have, and…well, it is a nice area here, isn't it? Seems like a good place. Though, to be honest, everything kind of looks the same to me these days. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. We all experience changes as we get older. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well…it’s my stomach. It’s been… unsettled. I don't feel hungry much anymore, and when I do eat, I get full so quickly. It's just...not right. And I've been feeling a bit queasy a lot, too. Not sick, exactly, just…off. It’s been going on for a little while now, I think. Hard to say how long, though. Time slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. A change in appetite and some nausea. And you say this has been ongoing for some time, though the exact duration is difficult to recall?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s not… sudden. It didn’t just start yesterday. More like…it crept up on me. Like a slow fog rolling in. And it's… frustrating. I used to enjoy my food so much. I loved cooking, but now… the thought of it doesn't appeal as much. Everything just feels… heavy.
DOCTOR: A gradual onset is useful information. And the loss of enjoyment in eating… that's pertinent. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the nausea and reduced appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now, what else… Well, I've been feeling more tired than usual, I suppose. Just… worn out. And sometimes my stomach… it just aches. Not a sharp pain, more like a dull… pressure. Oh! And I’ve lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t actually weighed myself recently. My granddaughter usually does that when she visits.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, a dull abdominal ache, and unintentional weight loss. I see. And how would you describe your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's... a personal question, isn’t it? Well... they're... regular, I guess. But not like they used to be. More... infrequent. And they’re... smaller. Shall I say that? Smaller. Not… substantial. It’s another thing that’s just… changed. I don't really know what else to tell you. It's all a bit… muddled.
DOCTOR: Infrequent and smaller bowel movements. Alright. Now, have you experienced any blood in your stool, or any changes in its color?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not that I’ve seen. No blood. Everything… looks normal, color-wise. At least, as normal as things get. I always try not to look too closely, to be honest. It’s… unpleasant. But no, I haven’t noticed anything unusual like that. I really don’t think so. Is that… a worry? I get nervous asking about these things.
DOCTOR: No blood is good. Now, let’s move on. Do you have any significant past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one. I’ve lived a long time, Doctor. I had my gallbladder out years and years ago. And… I had a touch of pneumonia when I was younger. And…well, I was diagnosed with cancer a little while back. It's in my… I can't quite remember which part. My granddaughter told me, but I've been… distracted. It’s being treated, though. I see the oncologist regularly. That’s why I'm here, I think. It must be something related to that. Is that right?
DOCTOR: A history of gallbladder removal, pneumonia, and…cancer. Yes, please clarify the type of cancer and where it is located, if possible. Do you recall the stage of the cancer when it was diagnosed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you're asking things I really can’t remember. It was… in my stomach, I think? Or maybe it was close to it? It was the oncologist who explained it all. It was…Stage… Two? Or was it Three? I honestly don’t know. They gave me a lot of information, and I was so upset, I couldn't keep it all straight. My granddaughter, Sarah, she knows. She comes with me to most of the appointments. She can tell you all the details. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. My memory is just… failing me.
DOCTOR: Very well. We can certainly review your oncology records. Do you take any medications currently, besides those prescribed by your oncologist?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. Aside from what the cancer doctor gives me… I take a little something for my blood pressure. It’s… a small white pill. And sometimes I take something for aches and pains. Mostly just ibuprofen, when my joints are bothering me. And…that’s it, I think. I used to take something for sleep, but the cancer doctor said it wasn’t a good idea anymore. Something about interacting with the other medicines. I try to avoid taking too much, if I can. I don't like feeling… foggy.
DOCTOR: Alright, medication for blood pressure, occasional ibuprofen, and previously took a sleep aid. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to be stung by a bee when I was a little girl, but that didn’t seem too bad, just a bit of swelling. Nothing serious. My granddaughter always asks me if I have any allergies, but I always tell her no. I don’t think I do. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I don’t really care for okra. But that’s not an allergy, is it? Just a preference.
DOCTOR: No, okra is a preference. Alright. Now, before we proceed, let’s take a quick look at your abdomen. Just a simple physical examination, to help determine the next steps. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds sensible. I hope I'm not too much trouble, Doctor. Getting older is… not easy, you know. Everything takes a little longer these days. There we go. Is this comfortable enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Kelder, just breathe normally. I'm just listening to your abdomen now. …And now, I’m gently pressing on your stomach. Do you feel any particular pain or discomfort in any specific area?
PATIENT: Ooh… there. That’s a little tender. Not a sharp pain, but… a dull ache. Like a heavy pressure. It's been there for a little while now, like I said. Not constant, it comes and goes, but… that spot feels…off. Everything else feels… okay, I suppose. Just a bit… sensitive there. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the upper left quadrant noted. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Abdomen otherwise soft and non-distended. Bowel sounds normoactive. We'll need to review your oncology records to determine the best course of action. Given your history of cancer and these recent symptoms, further investigation is warranted. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel. We will also need to obtain a recent CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood work and a scan… yes. I trust your judgment. It's good to know you're taking this seriously. It just worries me, you know? The cancer… I don’t want it to…come back. Or get worse. But I appreciate you looking into it. So, yes, please do whatever you think is necessary. Will Sarah need to come with me for the scan? She's very good at asking questions, and I sometimes forget what the technicians say.
DOCTOR: Yes, it would be beneficial for your granddaughter to accompany you to the scan. She can certainly assist with remembering the details. I’ll have my assistant schedule the necessary tests and provide you with the appropriate paperwork. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat a balanced diet, as tolerated. If your nausea worsens, or you experience any new symptoms such as fever, vomiting, or significant abdominal pain, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mrs. Kelder?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing my concerns. It's reassuring to know someone is taking care of me. I'm just… tired. I think I’ll just rest now, if you don’t mind. And thank you again. Sarah will help me with the appointments and paperwork. She’s a good girl, my Sarah. Is it alright if I just sit up slowly?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Kelder. Take your time. I'll have the assistant come in to help you sit up, and provide you with the necessary information. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your next appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this. .
PATIENT: .
