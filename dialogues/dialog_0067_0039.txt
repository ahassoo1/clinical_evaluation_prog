DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Said something about my cholesterol being a bit high. Hyper… something. I don’t really understand all that medical talk, to be honest. Thought I’d better come get it checked out, you know? Just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Of course, that’s very wise of you to come in. It's always best to get things checked out. Hyperlipidemia – that’s the word you’re referring to – simply means high cholesterol. We’ll definitely take a look at those results and figure out what’s going on. First, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you been feeling alright generally?
PATIENT: Generally alright… hmm. Well, I’m 88, Doctor, so things creak a bit more each day, if you know what I mean! But no major complaints, really. I get a little tired easier than I used to, but that’s probably just age. Appetite’s okay, sleep’s okay… nothing out of the ordinary, I suppose. I’ve been a bit more careful with what I eat lately, though, now that I know about this cholesterol business. Mostly just trying to avoid too much fried food and things like that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, and perfectly reasonable at 88! It's wonderful that you're being proactive about your diet. And yes, a little fatigue is common with age, but it’s good to be aware of it. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… My wife, bless her heart, she always kept track of all that. Passed away five years ago now. I had a touch of arthritis in my knees for a long time, but that’s been pretty manageable with some over-the-counter stuff. And… I think I had pneumonia once, many years ago. Nothing major, thankfully. No diabetes, no high blood pressure that I know of… Doctor, I really relied on my wife for all that. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. I’m usually pretty good with remembering dates and details, but medical things… not so much.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bohnett. It's very common to rely on a spouse for those details, and it’s understandable that it’s harder to recall things now. Don’t worry about it at all. We can work through this. Did you ever have any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Yes, I did! Years and years ago, when I was working… oh, must have been in the early seventies. I had my appendix taken out. And… let me think… oh, yes! I had a cataract removed from my left eye about ten years ago. That was a good thing, vision’s been much better since then. Aside from those two, nothing else comes to mind. Small things, really. Nothing serious, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix and cataract removal. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, or anything else that you're aware of?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother… she lived to be 92, which is pretty good, but she had some trouble with her heart towards the end. I think it was… congestive heart failure, maybe? My father, he passed away relatively young, in his sixties, from a stroke. And my sister… she had breast cancer, about twenty years ago. She's doing alright now, thankfully, but she had to go through a lot. Other than that, I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history. We weren’t really a family that talked about those things much, you know? Mostly just Swedes, keeping to themselves.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Bohnett. A family history of heart disease and stroke is important, and the breast cancer is good to be aware of as well. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, at 88, it's not too exciting! I live alone now, in the same house my wife and I bought when we were first married. I mostly keep to myself, reading and watching the news. I used to be very active – I was a carpenter for many years, so I did a lot of physical work. But these days, I don't do much lifting or heavy work. I take a short walk around the block most days, weather permitting, and I try to keep the garden tidy. I used to smoke, years ago, but I quit about thirty years ago. And I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week. Does that give you a good picture?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. A previous smoking history is important, and it’s good to hear you’re active and enjoy gardening. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication, and I can eat pretty much anything. My wife used to make a wonderful Swedish stew, with all sorts of things in it, and I always enjoyed that. No, allergies aren't really a problem for me. I'm pretty lucky in that regard, I think. Never had much trouble with hay fever or anything like that either.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Bohnett. Alright, let's talk about any medications you're currently taking. Do you take anything regularly – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I take a small dose of aspirin every day, just to help keep things moving, you know? And I take a calcium supplement for my bones, Doctor recommended it a few years ago. Aside from those two, nothing else. I used to take something for my arthritis, but I stopped taking that a while back. It didn’t seem to be doing much good, and I didn’t like taking so many pills. Just the aspirin and the calcium, that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, aspirin and calcium. Good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a baseline and see how things are looking. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I haven’t had a proper check-up in a while, so it’s probably a good idea. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit back and relax on the examination table, that would be great. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. We'll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, but I can hear a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, but there's a little bit of diminished breath sounds in the bases. Ears are clear, and your throat looks fine. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness. Pulses are a little weak in your ankles, but present. Alright, everything seems generally okay, but we’ll want to discuss that slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur. I’d like to order some blood work, including a full lipid panel to get a better understanding of your cholesterol levels, and a complete blood count. We should also do an EKG to look at your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood work and an EKG… whatever you think is best. I trust your professional opinion. I’d like to know what’s going on, of course, so any information you can give me, I’d appreciate it. The elevated blood pressure… is that something serious? I used to worry a bit about my heart, my father you know… but I try not to dwell on it. So, blood work and an EKG, you said? Where do we go from there?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking questions, Mr. Bohnett. Elevated blood pressure isn’t necessarily serious right now, but it’s something we need to monitor and manage. Left untreated, it can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke, which is why we’re doing the work-up. The EKG will give us a better picture of your heart's electrical activity. The blood work and EKG will take a few days to come back. Once I have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. We’ll also talk about lifestyle modifications – diet, exercise, stress management – that can help lower your blood pressure and improve your overall health. In the meantime, please continue to take your aspirin as prescribed and try to maintain a healthy diet and regular exercise routine, even if it’s just a short walk each day. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that all makes sense, Doctor. Blood work, EKG, follow-up appointment, healthy diet… I can manage that. And I will continue with the aspirin. It’s good to know you’re keeping an eye on things. You know, I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease knowing what’s going on and what we’re doing to address it. I sometimes worry about bothering the doctors with my old-age ailments, but you’ve been very kind and patient. So, thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. That's what I'm here for. And please, never hesitate to ask questions or express your concerns. It’s important to me that you feel comfortable and informed about your health. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood for the lab work and schedule your EKG. Do you have any transportation concerns, or do you drive yourself?
PATIENT: No, thank you, I drive myself. Still got a good license, thankfully! I live not too far from here, so it’s no trouble at all. The nurse will come in shortly, you said? Excellent. I’ll just sit here and wait then. Thank you again for everything, Doctor. I feel much better now, knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or weakness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Have a good day, Mr. Bohnett.
PATIENT: .
