DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… the flushing. I get very red, you see. Mostly in my face, but sometimes my chest too. It comes and goes. Been happening for… oh, maybe three months now? It’s not painful, just… warm. And embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Hmm, flushing, you say. Three months, alright. And it’s primarily facial, but can extend to the chest. Not painful, just a warming sensation. Can you describe when it happens?
PATIENT: When? That’s… a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Not after exercise, I know that. And not when I’m… upset. Sometimes when I eat. Spicy food, maybe? But not always. Yesterday it happened… just sitting and watching the news. I had a cup of tea. That's all. It just… started.
DOCTOR: So, not consistently linked to exertion, emotional state, or even specific foods, though spicy foods may be a trigger. And it occurred spontaneously while you were relaxing with tea yesterday. Are there any other symptoms that accompany the flushing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes my heart feels… fast. Not racing, exactly. Just… aware of it. And maybe a little bit sweaty. Not a lot, just… a little damp. And… oh! My hands get tingly sometimes, when it happens. Like pins and needles, but not bad. It goes away with the redness.
DOCTOR: So, palpitations – an awareness of your heartbeat – occasional mild diaphoresis, and tingling in your hands concurrent with the flushing. Have you noticed any dizziness or lightheadedness with these episodes?
PATIENT: Dizzy… no, not really. Lightheaded, maybe once or twice. But it didn’t last long. Just when I stood up quickly. I thought it was just getting old, you know? I get up too fast sometimes and things… swim a little. But not with the flushing, not always. It happens other times too.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional orthostatic symptoms unrelated to the flushing itself. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Doctor said I was very healthy, last time I saw him. That was… oh, five years ago maybe? Just a check-up. I take a little something for my arthritis, in my hands. Makes them stiff sometimes. But that's it. And I had the flu shot, every year. That’s important, you know. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Arthritis in your hands, treated with medication. And annual influenza vaccinations. Good. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. I get my son to pick it up for me, usually. He handles all that. Let me think… it’s a little white pill. Small. I can show you the bottle, if that helps? I have it at home. I don’t remember the name at all. Doctor gave it to me, and I just… take it. It helps with the pain, though. That’s the important thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, we can try to get the name later. It’s important to know what you're taking. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. And… no hospital stays. Just… a bad cold when I was a boy. But that was a long time ago. My wife… she had her gallbladder out, many years ago. But I haven’t been inside a hospital for anything myself. I try to stay out of them, if I can. It smells funny, you know? And it makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: My… my wife’s mother had diabetes. She got very sick, many years ago. And my brother… he had heart problems. He smoked too much, I think. He had a… a procedure, I think. Not surgery, but something with tubes. He passed away five years ago. My father… he lived a long time. Very healthy. Never sick a day in his life, almost. That's all I can really remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Diabetes in your mother-in-law, and cardiovascular issues in your brother. Otherwise, a relatively healthy family history. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. My wife… she didn't like smoking. I never started. I drink a little tea, that's all. Sometimes a small glass of wine with dinner, but not every day. And I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables. I like cooking, you know? It helps me relax. And I walk every morning, if the weather is good. Not far, just around the block. It keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker, occasional alcohol consumption, healthy diet, and regular, moderate exercise. Good habits. Are you experiencing any significant stress in your life currently?
PATIENT: Stress? Well… my wife passed away last year. So… yes. It's… quiet now. Very quiet. I miss her a lot. I have my son, he visits when he can, but he has a family of his own. It’s just… different. I try to keep busy, but sometimes… it feels lonely. Is that what you mean by stress? It’s not work, you see. It’s… everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Withycombe, that is exactly what I mean. The loss of your wife is a significant stressor, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling this way. Alright. Now, just to be thorough, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. I can eat anything. My wife… she was allergic to cats. But I’m fine. I can be around anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I think I’m very lucky, you know? Always been healthy. Except for my hands, but that's just the arthritis. And the flushing, of course. But I don't think that's an allergy. It just… happens. Is that okay? I hope I’m not forgetting anything. I try to remember, but my mind… sometimes wanders.
DOCTOR: No, you're not forgetting anything, Mr. Withycombe. And you're doing very well. No known allergies. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and just take a look at your hands. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you, Doctor. I just want to know what's going on with the flushing. It worries me a little, you know? Not because it hurts, but because it's… new. And I like knowing things. If you could tell me what's happening, I would be very grateful. Do I need to undress? Or just… sit here?
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to undress. Just sit comfortably. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope, and take a quick look at your hands. It won't take long. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, pulse is 88 beats per minute, regular. Hands exhibit mild tenderness and limited range of motion in the metacarpophalangeal joints, consistent with arthritis. No acute inflammation or skin changes noted. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but otherwise, the exam is largely unremarkable. Your arthritis appears to be well-controlled.
PATIENT: Slightly elevated, you say? Is that bad? I don't usually worry about numbers, just how I feel. And my hands… well, they've always been a little stiff. So, what about the flushing? Do you have any idea what could be causing it? It’s just… unsettling, you know? Like a hot flash, but I’m not a woman. It just comes and goes. And I don't understand why.
DOCTOR: The slightly elevated blood pressure is something we'll want to monitor, but it's not necessarily an immediate cause for alarm. We can discuss lifestyle modifications and potentially medication if it doesn't improve. As for the flushing, it's a bit more complex. Given your description, the lack of associated fever or other systemic symptoms, and the absence of any clear triggers, several possibilities come to mind. It could be related to vasomotor instability – essentially, fluctuations in the blood vessels – which can be more common with age or stress. It’s also possible it's a benign idiopathic flushing – meaning we don't know the exact cause, but it's not necessarily harmful. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. Given the onset of new symptoms, I'd like to order some basic blood work to check your thyroid function, rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions, and assess your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, that sounds sensible. If it helps to find out what's going on, I'm happy to do it. Thyroid… is that something serious? I don't think I’ve ever had that checked before. And inflammatory… is that like arthritis? I just want to know what's happening, Doctor. I don't like being in the dark. And thank you for listening. It's… comforting to talk about it. My wife… she always knew what to do. So, what do I need to do for the blood work? Do I need to fast? Or can I eat something beforehand?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel lost without your wife. And you’re very welcome; I’m glad you feel comfortable discussing it. Thyroid issues can be serious, but they’re also very treatable. The blood work will simply help us determine if your thyroid is functioning normally. For the blood work, you will need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can still drink water. We'll get a requisition form for you, and you can take it to the lab at the clinic. They’ll draw a small sample of blood, and the results should be back within a few days. In the meantime, I would like you to keep a diary of your flushing episodes – noting when they occur, what you were doing beforehand, and any other symptoms you experience. This will help us identify any potential triggers. While we await the results, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. It's unlikely, but it’s always best to err on the side of caution.
PATIENT: Chest pain… that's worrying. But I understand. It's good to be careful. A diary… yes, I can do that. I have a little notebook I use for my grocery list. I can write it down there. Flushing… what exactly should I write? Everything? Even if it’s just when I’m sitting and watching the news? And what if it doesn't go away? What if the blood work doesn't show anything? I don't want to be left wondering forever. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. It’s… reassuring to have someone listen.
DOCTOR: Yes, please write down everything – even if it seems insignificant. The timing, what you were doing, what you ate, any associated symptoms, and how long it lasted. The more information, the better. As for what if the blood work is normal, that simply means we need to consider other possibilities. There are some less common conditions that can cause flushing, and we may need to explore those further. We could consider a referral to a dermatologist or a cardiologist, depending on the results and your symptoms. We won't leave you wondering forever, Mr. Withycombe. We’ll work through this step by step. For now, let’s focus on keeping the diary and getting the blood work done. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s the requisition form, and the clinic number is on the bottom. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. And kind. I’ll start the diary tonight. And I'll try not to worry too much. It’s just… unsettling, you know? Something new. Thank you again. And… good day to you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. And you take care. Remember, if anything changes or worsens, don't hesitate to call. Have a good day.
