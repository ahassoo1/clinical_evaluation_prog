DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kalinski. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and…yellow. Like, my skin and eyes are yellowing. It started a few days ago, and I think it might be connected to some fava beans I ate. I had a big plate of them, and then…well, this started happening. I’m a little worried about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Haggar. Yellowing of the skin and eyes – what we call jaundice – can certainly be alarming. And the connection to the fava beans is a very important piece of information. It sounds like you might be experiencing something related to a condition called favism, though we need to explore that further. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the fatigue you're feeling?
PATIENT: Okay, “favism”… I haven’t heard of that before. The tiredness… it's not just feeling a little sleepy. It’s like all my energy is gone. Even simple things, like walking up the stairs, leave me completely winded. And I've been getting headaches too, a dull ache mostly, but persistent. It’s hard to concentrate on anything, really. It feels like…a weight on me, all the time.
DOCTOR: I see. That sounds quite debilitating, Ms. Haggar. The combination of fatigue, headaches, and difficulty concentrating is concerning. It’s good you’re able to articulate these symptoms so clearly. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and jaundice?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been a little short of breath sometimes, even when I'm resting. Not like, gasping for air, but definitely more aware of my breathing than usual. And my stomach… it’s been a bit upset. Some nausea, and maybe a little bit of cramping, but not severe. Oh, and my urine has been really dark, almost brown. Is that…normal?
DOCTOR: Dark urine is certainly something we need to investigate further, Ms. Haggar. And the shortness of breath, along with the nausea and cramping, are important details. It sounds like we're building a more complete picture. To help me understand your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, I don’t have a lot of medical problems, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, and I broke my wrist a few years ago, but that’s about it. I haven't been diagnosed with anything chronic, like diabetes or heart disease. I don't take any regular medications, except for the occasional pain reliever for headaches. And I'm allergic to penicillin, if that's important.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Haggar. No chronic conditions and only the occasional pain reliever are good starting points. And the penicillin allergy is very important—thank you for mentioning that. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like liver problems, blood disorders, or anemia?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… My mother had some… problems with her gallbladder when she was older, I think. She had to have it removed. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he was always… weak. He was often tired, and the doctors said something about his blood, but I was young and didn't really understand. I think it was some kind of anemia, but I'm not sure what kind. No one else that I know of has had any major health issues, really. Mostly just the usual things – heart problems with age, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. History of gallbladder issues in your mother and potential anemia in your grandfather are both relevant pieces of information. We’ll keep those in mind. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I work as a receptionist at a doctor's office, ironically enough. So I'm on my feet a lot, but it's not particularly strenuous work. I live alone, in an apartment. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly vegetables and lean protein. I don't really have any hobbies, to be honest. Just…trying to get by, mostly. I do walk a bit, when the weather is nice.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Haggar. A relatively healthy lifestyle is certainly a positive. Now, just to be thorough, can you recall how much of the fava beans you consumed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was a pretty big plateful, to be honest. It was a friend’s garden, and she had a huge harvest. I probably ate… at least a cup and a half, maybe two cups of cooked fava beans. I didn't think anything of it at the time. I’ve eaten fava beans before, but not a huge amount, and never had this reaction. Is that too much? Is there a limit?
DOCTOR: That quantity could be significant, Ms. Haggar, especially if you have a predisposition to favism. Favism is caused by a genetic deficiency of an enzyme called G6PD. It's more common in certain populations, and consuming fava beans can trigger a hemolytic crisis – meaning your red blood cells break down prematurely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a physical exam, and then order some lab tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. A physical exam and tests… whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on and feel better. I'm a little worried, to be honest, but I trust your judgment. Should I… stop eating fava beans completely, just in case?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Haggar, and a wise precaution. Yes, I would recommend avoiding fava beans entirely for now, until we have a better understanding of what's going on. Alright, let’s begin with the physical exam. Could you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you need. I'm ready when you are. Just…try to be gentle, okay? I'm not a big fan of doctors' visits, to be honest. It always makes me a little anxious.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Haggar. I will be as gentle as possible. I understand your anxiety—many people feel the same way. We'll take things slowly. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale… Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your abdomen. Does this cause any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: It's a little tender, yes. Not sharp pain, but…uncomfortable. Especially on the right side, like where my gallbladder is, I think. It's not awful, but I definitely feel it. It's been a bit sore like that for a few days, actually, but I just thought it was indigestion. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: That tenderness in the right upper quadrant is noted, Ms. Haggar. Given your history and symptoms, it's certainly something we need to investigate further. It could be related to your gallbladder, as you suspected, or potentially other issues. Now, I'm going to check your sclera – the whites of your eyes. Yes… as I suspected, there's a noticeable yellowing – jaundice. It’s present in both eyes. Your skin also appears slightly jaundiced. Based on the physical exam, I'm noting the tenderness in your right upper quadrant and the visible jaundice in your sclera and skin. To confirm my suspicions and determine the underlying cause, I'd like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us assess your liver function, red blood cell count, and G6PD levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Blood tests… that sounds… necessary. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and how to fix it. G6PD levels… is that the thing with the fava beans? Is that what's causing all this? I hope it’s not something serious.
DOCTOR: Yes, G6PD levels will help us determine if you have a deficiency in that enzyme, which is the underlying cause of favism. The fava beans could very well be the trigger, given your recent consumption and the onset of your symptoms. However, we need to confirm that with the blood tests. The tests will also help us rule out other potential causes of your jaundice and liver inflammation. We’ll be checking your liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and complete blood count to get a comprehensive picture. I’m ordering a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, liver function tests, and a G6PD enzyme assay. The phlebotomist will come in shortly to draw the samples. It typically takes a few hours for the results to come back. In the meantime, are you experiencing any other symptoms I haven’t asked about – fever, chills, dark stools, or abdominal pain that’s getting worse?
PATIENT: No fever or chills, thankfully. My stools are… normal, I think. Maybe a little lighter in color than usual, but I haven't paid much attention, to be honest. And the abdominal pain… it's not getting worse, exactly, but it's definitely still there. A dull ache, mostly. It comes and goes. It's just… uncomfortable. And I do feel a little nauseous still, but I haven’t actually been sick. Is that a bad sign? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Lighter stools and persistent nausea are both things we’ll want to monitor closely, Ms. Haggar. They can sometimes indicate issues with the liver or bile ducts. However, at this point, it’s important not to jump to conclusions—we need the blood test results to get a clearer picture. The fact that the pain hasn't worsened is a good sign, but it's still something we'll keep a close eye on. I’d like you to remain NPO – that means nothing by mouth – until we have the blood test results. This will help avoid any further stress on your liver. We’ll also monitor your urine output. The phlebotomist should be here shortly to draw the blood. After that, I’ll have them check your vital signs again. I will review the results as soon as they become available and discuss them with you in detail, along with a plan of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. No food or drink… I can do that. And wait for the blood test results… Yes, alright. I just… I hope it's not anything too serious, Doctor. I feel a little scared, to be honest. Will I have to stay in the hospital?
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Ms. Haggar, and it’s perfectly natural to feel anxious in this situation. I want to assure you that we’re taking all the necessary steps to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide you with the best possible care. At this point, it’s too early to say whether you’ll need to be hospitalized. It will depend entirely on the blood test results. If your liver enzymes are significantly elevated or if you have other concerning findings, we may need to admit you for further evaluation and treatment. However, it’s also possible that you’ll be able to go home with instructions and follow-up care. Let’s focus on getting the blood tests done first. We’ll have a better understanding of the situation once we have the results. I'll explain everything to you in detail, and we'll make a plan together. Do you have any questions for me at this time, before the phlebotomist arrives?
PATIENT: Um… just… what exactly is favism? What happens if it is that? Will I have to…change my diet forever? And is it…contagious? I feel silly asking so many questions, but I'm just really worried. I just want to understand what's going on and what to expect.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ms. Haggar, and you shouldn’t feel silly at all. It’s important to be informed. Favism is a genetic condition caused by a deficiency in an enzyme called G6PD. This enzyme helps protect red blood cells from damage. When someone with G6PD deficiency eats certain foods – like fava beans – or is exposed to certain medications or chemicals, their red blood cells can break down prematurely, leading to hemolytic anemia. The symptoms can range from mild fatigue and jaundice – like you’re experiencing – to more severe complications like shortness of breath, abdominal pain, and even kidney failure in rare cases. If it is favism, you would need to avoid fava beans and certain medications for life. However, it’s not contagious – you can’t spread it to anyone. And many people with G6PD deficiency live completely normal lives simply by avoiding triggers. The good news is, it’s manageable. And we won’t know for sure until we have the blood test results. Let's focus on getting those done first, and then we can discuss a plan of action if necessary. Here comes the phlebotomist now. She'll explain the procedure to you. I’ll be right outside if you need anything.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. I’m ready when you are. I'm a little scared of needles, but I'll be okay.
DOCTOR: .
