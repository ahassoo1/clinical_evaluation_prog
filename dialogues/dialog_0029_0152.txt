DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Geho. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, the nurse told me it was about my cholesterol. They said it was a little high on the blood test. I don't really understand what that means, exactly. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Okay. High cholesterol, yes. It's something we see fairly often. Let’s take a look at those numbers… It can be something to address, but it doesn’t automatically mean it’s an emergency. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Sure. I think I’m pretty healthy, honestly. I work as an aerospace engineer, so I’m usually sitting at a desk, but I try to walk when I can. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a little wine sometimes, maybe a glass with dinner a couple of times a week. I’ve never had any big illnesses, just the usual colds. I have Medicare, so I get checked up regularly. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Desk work can make it harder to stay active, but it sounds like you're making an effort. And the moderate wine consumption is fine. Okay. Have you ever been told you have high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, never. Doctors always check, and it's always been good. I get a full panel done every year with Medicare, so they’d have caught it if I did, right? I worry a little, I guess, because my father… he had some heart trouble when he was older, but I don’t know exactly what it was. Just… heart trouble.
DOCTOR: Right, a yearly panel is excellent. That’s good preventative care. Okay, family history is important. “Heart trouble” is a little vague, unfortunately. Do you know if he had a heart attack, or maybe heart failure, or something else?
PATIENT: Hmm... I wish I did. My mother mostly handled the doctor stuff, and she's… she passed away a few years ago. I remember him being tired a lot, and he had to take some pills, but I never asked exactly what was wrong. I was young, I suppose, and didn't think much about it. He had some surgery, I think, but I don't remember what kind. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. Is knowing that important?
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Ms. Geho, you’re not a medical professional. It's understandable. Knowing about family history is important, but we can still work with what you do know. Okay. Have you had any surgeries yourself?
PATIENT: Just my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That was… oh, goodness, ages ago. And I had a wisdom tooth pulled, but that doesn't really count, does it? Nothing major, I promise. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise. I mostly just get the yearly checkups and try to eat reasonably well. Does the surgery matter even if it was a long time ago?
DOCTOR: No, those surgeries don't sound like they’ll be relevant here. Okay, so no major medical problems, no diabetes, no high blood pressure... Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs or over-the-counter medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a multivitamin every day, and sometimes I take ibuprofen if I have a headache, but that's it. Really, that’s it. I try to avoid taking pills if I can help it. I believe in letting my body do its own healing, if you know what I mean. Is that… silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all. Many people feel the same way. Okay, and do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things growing up – my mother made me try everything! And I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine, as far as I can remember. I think I would know if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I? Does that include things like latex or anything like that? I don’t go to the dentist very often…
DOCTOR: Yes, that includes things like latex. Good. So, no known allergies. Alright, Ms. Geho. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. I don't mind at all. I’m a pretty good patient, I think. Just let me know if anything feels… strange? I’m a little nervous about the high cholesterol, even though you said it wasn’t an emergency. It’s just… it worries me, you know? My father…
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. We’ll take things slowly. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs that I can detect. Lungs are clear as well. Now I’m just going to check your blood pressure. 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. And your pulse is 72 and regular. Okay. Now, just to complete the exam, I'm going to feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. My reflexes aren’t great, I’m warning you. I was never very athletic. More of a reader, myself. I hope everything is okay. Is my blood pressure really high? You seem to be writing a lot…
DOCTOR: No tenderness here, everything feels normal. Now, let's check your reflexes. Yes, they're a bit slower than average, but nothing concerning. It's not unexpected if you haven't been very physically active. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, yes, but it’s not a crisis situation. And the slower reflexes are likely just due to your activity level. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, we have a few things to consider. The high cholesterol reading, the slightly elevated blood pressure, and the family history. Do you mind if I briefly review your full lab results again?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go ahead. I just want to know what we need to do to get things back to normal. I’m willing to do whatever it takes, really. I just don’t want to end up like my father. I’m a little scared, to be honest. Is it going to involve a lot of pills? Because I really don’t like taking pills…
DOCTOR: Okay. So, your total cholesterol is 245. Your LDL – that’s the “bad” cholesterol – is 160. Your HDL – the “good” cholesterol – is 40. And your triglycerides are 150. Those numbers… they are higher than we’d like to see. We need to get these numbers down. The first step is lifestyle modifications. That means diet and exercise. I'd like you to start a heart-healthy diet – lower saturated fats, more fruits and vegetables, whole grains. And try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. As for pills… we’re not there yet. I’d like to see if we can lower your cholesterol with lifestyle changes first. We'll recheck your levels in three months. If they haven’t come down enough, then we can discuss medication options. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that sounds manageable, I think. Diet and exercise. I can definitely try that. I really don’t want to take pills, so I’ll do my best. Do you have any recommendations for… like, what kind of exercise? I’m not a runner, obviously. And I’m terrible at cooking. Are there any… books or websites you recommend for heart-healthy recipes? I’m willing to learn, I promise. I just… I need a little guidance.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s exactly the attitude we need. For exercise, anything that gets your heart rate up is good. Walking is a great start. Swimming, cycling, even gardening – whatever you enjoy. We want to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. As for recipes, the American Heart Association website has a ton of great resources. There are also some good cookbooks – “The Eat-Clean Diet” and “The 30-Minute Mediterranean Diet Cookbook” are popular choices. I can print out a handout with some helpful websites and resources for you. We'll also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to recheck your cholesterol levels and see how you're doing with the lifestyle changes. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds wonderful. A handout would be very helpful, thank you. And yes, three months sounds good. I’ll start walking every day, and I’ll look up those websites. I really appreciate you not immediately jumping to pills. I feel a little better now, knowing that I have some control over this. Is there anything else I should be doing? Like, are there certain foods I should absolutely avoid? Or things I should be checking on food labels?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here’s a handout with some helpful websites and resources. As for foods to avoid, you want to limit saturated and trans fats. Those are found in red meat, processed foods, fried foods, and some dairy products. You also want to watch your cholesterol intake, but that’s less important than reducing saturated and trans fats. When reading food labels, pay attention to the serving size and the total fat content. Look for foods that are low in saturated and trans fats, and high in fiber. And avoid foods with partially hydrogenated oils – that’s a sign of trans fats. Most importantly, listen to your body. If you're feeling tired or short of breath, slow down. And if you have any concerns, don't hesitate to call my office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, and for not making me feel panicked. I feel like I have a plan now, and I’m willing to give it my best shot. I appreciate you taking the time. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Geho. It was my pleasure. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. And I’m here to support you every step of the way. We’ll see you in three months. Have a good day, and please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. Goodbye.
