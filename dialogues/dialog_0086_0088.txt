DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… this ringing in my ears. It’s been bugging me for a while now.
DOCTOR: "Bugging you," you say. Right. And how long exactly is “a while”?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe three, four weeks now? It comes and goes, but it’s definitely not going away completely. It’s just… annoying, you know? Especially when it’s quiet.
DOCTOR: "Annoying" doesn't really tell me much, Mr. Dhanoa. Is it a constant ringing, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: It definitely fluctuates. Some days it’s barely noticeable, just a little… whoosh in my ear. Other days it’s like… a high-pitched whine, really loud. Makes it hard to concentrate.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly my right ear, I think. Sometimes it feels like it's jumping between both, but yeah, definitely worse on the right side. Is that… normal? I don't even know if I should be worrying about this.
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a relative term, Mr. Dhanoa. It could be something simple – wax buildup, a minor infection. But we need to rule things out. Have you noticed any dizziness, hearing loss, or fullness in your ear along with the ringing?
PATIENT: No dizziness, thankfully. And I don't think my hearing's gotten worse, but… I haven't really been paying attention, to be honest. No fullness either. Just… the ringing. It’s just frustrating. I used to work a lot of overtime at the restaurant, maybe it’s from that?
DOCTOR: A restaurant, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, I’m a waiter. Been doing it for years. It gets pretty loud sometimes, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. Music, people shouting… it’s a lot. I figured it might be something to do with that, but I didn’t want to just assume.
DOCTOR: Well, noise exposure is certainly a possibility. But we can’t rule out other causes without a proper examination. I'm going to take a look at your ears, check your hearing briefly, and then we can talk about next steps. Do you have any allergies to ear drops or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Ear drops are fine. Let’s just get it over with, yeah? I have another shift starting pretty soon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax and try to stay still. This won’t take long. Your ear canals look clear, thankfully. No visible wax buildup or signs of infection. Now, I’m going to do a quick hearing screening. It’s just a series of tones, you’ll tell me when you hear them.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Right. I’m going to start with your right ear. I'll play a series of tones at different pitches and volumes. Raise your hand only when you hear a sound. Try to be as accurate as possible. Don't anticipate it. Just let me know when you hear something. Okay, that’s enough for a preliminary screening. Seems like there's some mild hearing loss in the higher frequencies in your right ear. It’s not severe, but it's consistent with noise exposure.
PATIENT: So… that’s bad, right? I knew I should have worn earplugs more often. What does this mean? Do I need… surgery or something?
DOCTOR: "Bad" is a strong word, Mr. Dhanoa. It’s not ideal, but it’s also not necessarily a cause for panic. We’re not talking about needing surgery. However, ignoring it isn’t an option either. The hearing loss is mild right now, but it can worsen over time with continued noise exposure. The ringing – the tinnitus – is likely related to the hearing loss. Sometimes it goes hand-in-hand. First, I strongly recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible. Wear earplugs or earmuffs when you’re at work, or consider finding a less noisy position. We can also discuss some strategies to manage the tinnitus. There are apps and sound therapy techniques that can help. Do you want to discuss that?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Apps and sound therapy sounds… better than surgery. What kind of apps are we talking about? And is there anything else I should be doing? Like, will taking vitamins help or something?
DOCTOR: Vitamins aren't a magic cure, Mr. Dhanoa. There's no scientific evidence to support taking vitamins for tinnitus. But a healthy lifestyle is always a good idea, of course. As for the apps, there are several options. “Relax Melodies” and “Tinnitus Retraining Therapy” are popular ones. They play soothing sounds and white noise to mask the ringing and help you habituate to it. It takes time and consistency. And it’s not a cure, but it can significantly improve your quality of life. I’m going to refer you to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing test and tinnitus evaluation. They can provide personalized recommendations and explore other treatment options if needed. Would you like me to schedule that for you now?
PATIENT: Yeah, please. That would be great. Just… get it done. I just want this ringing to stop. And is there anything I can do right now? Like, while I'm waiting for the appointment?
DOCTOR: Right now?
PATIENT: Yeah. Like, tonight, at work… Is there anything? A trick or something? To make it less annoying?
DOCTOR: Avoid loud noises as much as possible. If you absolutely must be in a noisy environment, wear earplugs. And try to focus on something else. Distraction can be surprisingly effective. If that doesn’t work, well, that's what the audiologist is for. I'm scheduling the appointment now. One moment. Okay, you're scheduled with Dr. Evans for next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. They’ll contact you to confirm. Do you have any other questions for me, Mr. Dhanoa?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just… Tuesday. Okay. Thanks, Doctor. I guess I’ll see you… maybe not, then. Thanks again. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Goodbye, Mr. Dhanoa. And please, protect your hearing. .
