DOCTOR: Bula and welcome to the clinic, Mr. Skarbek. I'm Dr. Kimm. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It's a pleasure to meet you too, Doctor. Well, it's about getting some shots. My grandson… he’s wanting to come visit from overseas, and I believe he needs certain vaccinations for his visa. I’m a bit confused about what’s required, to be honest. I want to make sure we do everything right.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly understandable. It can definitely be confusing keeping track of all the vaccination requirements. So, your grandson is coming to visit from overseas and you want to make sure he’s up-to-date on his shots for visa purposes, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s exactly right. He’s coming from… let me see… Poland. He was born there, and he’s lived there his whole life. I just want to be certain he has everything he needs to come here without any trouble. And that I’m doing everything right on my end, you understand? It’s been a long time since I’ve dealt with anything like this.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. It’s good you're thinking ahead and wanting to be prepared. Knowing he’s from Poland is helpful. Let's start with a few questions to get a better picture of his vaccination history, if you don’t mind. Do you happen to have any records of his vaccinations with you?
PATIENT: I… I thought I did. My daughter sent me some papers a while back… but I seem to have misplaced them. I’m so sorry. I thought I had everything organized. He might have some records there with his mother, but getting those sent over would take some time. Is that alright? Will that be a problem?
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Mr. Skarbek. These things happen. We can definitely work with this. Since we don’t have the records right now, we’ll have to consider what vaccinations are generally recommended for someone his age, coming from Poland, and potentially what the visa requirements might be. Do you know roughly how old your grandson is?
PATIENT: He turned 22 just last month. Twenty-two years old, yes. He’s a strong young man, works as a carpenter, very responsible. He’s never had any serious illnesses, as far as I know. He's a healthy boy. But… these shots, I worry about them. I’ve heard stories…
DOCTOR: That's good to know he's 22 and generally healthy. It's perfectly normal to be a little worried about vaccinations - it's good you're thinking about his wellbeing. We’ll make sure we discuss everything thoroughly. Okay, so a 22-year-old coming from Poland… generally, we want to ensure he's up-to-date on routine vaccinations, and then consider any travel-specific recommendations. Have you already looked into what vaccinations are specifically required for a visa, or should we start with a general assessment?
PATIENT: I haven’t, no. I… I started looking online, but it was all very confusing, lots of medical terms I didn’t understand. That’s why I came to you, Doctor. I figured you’d know what’s needed. Perhaps you could tell me what you recommend, and then we can see if that matches what the visa people require? Would that work?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, that’s exactly what we'll do. Let's start with what I recommend. For a 22-year-old, we generally want to make sure he's current on his Tdap , MMR , and varicella vaccines. We’ll also want to discuss influenza and COVID-19 vaccination. Depending on his activities and any previous exposures, we might consider other options as well. Before we get too far, have you or he ever had these vaccines before?
PATIENT: That’s… a lot of letters. I'm afraid I don't recall those names. He was vaccinated as a child, of course, in Poland. But I don't have any record of which shots he had. I suppose they have different names over there? He didn’t get sick with any of those things – measles, chickenpox, nothing like that. But knowing what he had specifically… I wish I knew. Is it possible to find out somehow, even without records?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable that you don’t recall all those names – there are a lot of them! And yes, sometimes the names can be different in other countries. It's great he didn't get sick with those illnesses. Without records, it's tricky, but we can do a blood test to check his immunity to some of those diseases - measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. It won't tell us everything, but it will give us a good starting point. If the blood test shows he's immune, then we don't need to vaccinate him against those. If it shows he's not immune, then we'll need to give him the vaccine. Would you be comfortable with getting a blood test done today?
PATIENT: A blood test… yes, I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t hurt too much. I’m not a fan of needles, you see. But if it’s the best way to know what he needs, then yes, I’ll do it. And is it expensive? My insurance… it’s not the best, sometimes it doesn't cover everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. A lot of people aren't fans of needles! It’s a quick pinch, and we'll be as gentle as possible. Let me check what your insurance covers for blood tests. Okay, it looks like your insurance does cover the blood test for these titers, with a copay of $45. We can proceed with that today if you’d like. It will give us a much clearer picture of what vaccinations he needs. Would you like me to draw the blood now, or would you prefer to think about it?
PATIENT: $45… that’s alright. Yes, let’s do it. The sooner we know, the better. I’d rather get it over with than worry about it. Where do we… I suppose you’ll need a vein? Oh dear. Just be quick, please. And gentle, like you said. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Skarbek. Let's get this done quickly and gently. If you could just roll up your sleeve, please. I'll clean the area first and then find a good vein. It will only take a few minutes. Just relax, and try to take some deep breaths. We’ll get this over with quickly.
PATIENT: Alright… deep breaths… I haven’t had blood taken in years. I always get a bit lightheaded. Just… tell me when it’s almost over, will you? And thank you again for being so patient with an old man like me. I appreciate it. I always worry about these things.
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Mr. Skarbek. Absolutely no problem at all. It's perfectly normal to feel a little anxious. I'll let you know every step of the way. And I'll make sure you're comfortable throughout the process. Just a quick pinch now… and we’ll be done in a minute. Almost there… a little pressure… and done! All finished. Just hold pressure on this gauze for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. You might feel a little soreness later, but that should go away on its own. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, that wasn’t so bad… a little pinch, just like you said. I think I’m alright. A little shaky, maybe, but that’s just me. Thank you, Doctor. You were very gentle. Now, we wait for the results? How long will that take? Will I have to come back here again? I hope not. I don’t like hospitals, or clinics, much. It reminds me of… well, never mind. Just tell me what happens next.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. I'm glad it wasn't too bad. It's perfectly normal to feel a little shaky afterwards. The lab usually takes about 3-5 business days to get the results back. I can either give you a call when they're ready, or you can check the online patient portal if you have an account. Once I have the results, we'll discuss them and determine which vaccinations your grandson needs. If he does need vaccinations, we can schedule an appointment here at the clinic. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes, depending on how many shots he needs. Do you have a preferred method for me to contact you with the results?
PATIENT: A phone call would be best, yes. I'm not very good with computers, and my daughter handles most of my online things. The number is 555-123-4567. And thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old man like me. I really appreciate it. It’s good to know someone is looking out for my grandson’s wellbeing. He’s all I have left, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. I’m happy to help in any way I can. And please, don't apologize for anything. It's perfectly natural to be concerned about your grandson's health. I've noted your phone number as 555-123-4567. I will call you as soon as the results are available, usually within 3-5 business days. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. We're here to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You've been wonderful, Doctor. Truly. I’ll just wait for your call, then. Thank you again for everything. I’ll be seeing you, hopefully. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and I'll be in touch soon. Don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up. Have a good day as well.
