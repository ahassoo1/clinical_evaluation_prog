DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be honest, it’s a bit…difficult to explain. I’ve noticed some swelling, and I was hoping you could take a look. I don’t really recall exactly when it started, or how it began, truthfully. It just…is.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. It can be hard to pinpoint sometimes. “Just is” is a perfectly valid starting point. Let's try to narrow it down a bit. Where exactly are you noticing the swelling?
PATIENT: It’s…around here, mostly. My face, and my neck, I think. It’s hard to say for sure. It doesn’t hurt, not really, but it feels…full. Perhaps a bit uncomfortable, but not painful. Is that making any sense? I apologize for being so vague. My memory… isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You're not being vague at all, Jahaad. It's helpful to know it’s not painful, just a feeling of fullness and discomfort. And it’s perfectly okay if recalling the exact timeline is difficult. Let's focus on the present. Has the swelling been getting worse, staying the same, or better over the past few weeks?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I believe…it’s been staying about the same, if I had to guess. Maybe slightly worse on particularly warm days, but not dramatically so. It’s hard to say for certain, I really wish I could be more precise. I haven’t noticed it going down, at least.
DOCTOR: Alright, staying about the same with perhaps a slight increase on warmer days. Good to know. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…let me think. No, not that I’m aware of. No difficulty breathing, no changes in my voice, no pain… I haven’t noticed anything else particularly unusual. I do get tired easily, but I always have, so I don’t know if that’s related. It’s just…a general fatigue, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. General fatigue can be caused by many things. Let's move on to a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else a doctor has told you about in the past?
PATIENT: That’s…a difficult question. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly for a while now. I don't believe I have anything major, but my memory is so patchy… I do recall something about allergies when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. Nothing recently, to my knowledge. Is there a way to check, perhaps? I feel rather lost trying to recall everything.
DOCTOR: Of course. We can certainly check. We have your records here, and I can pull up any previous diagnoses or allergies. Just give me one moment. While I’m looking, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins and supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… I don’t take anything regularly. Perhaps an occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing prescribed. No vitamins or supplements either. I try to eat a healthy diet, so I haven’t felt the need, generally. It’s mostly just…water. I drink a lot of water. And occasionally, tea. Is that helpful information? I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly helpful, Jahaad. Knowing what you aren’t taking is just as important. Okay, according to your records, you were seen briefly for allergic rhinitis as a child, and there's a note of a mild seasonal allergy to grass pollen. Otherwise, your history is surprisingly sparse. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family… that's…difficult. I wasn’t very close to my extended family, and I don’t recall anyone having any major illnesses. My mother passed away when I was young, and I don't have much information about her health history. My father…he was generally healthy, as far as I know. I’m truly sorry, but I’m afraid I can’t provide much information on that front. It's frustrating, I know. I wish I could be more help. Is it alright if we perhaps focus on what’s happening now, rather than trying to reconstruct the past?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Focusing on the present is a very sensible approach, given the circumstances. Alright, let’s do that. I'd like to examine your neck and face now, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve me gently feeling around to check for any abnormalities. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jahaad, I'm just going to feel for any swelling or tenderness in your neck. Can you tell me if any of this feels particularly tender or uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. That one… that feels a little…sensitive. Not painful, exactly, but definitely not comfortable. It feels…full, I suppose. A bit like a small lump, but not hard, if that makes sense. Is that concerning?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. It does feel slightly enlarged and a bit softer than the surrounding tissue. I'm also going to check your thyroid now. This might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't be painful. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Do you feel any tenderness or bumps in your throat?
PATIENT: It feels…normal, I think. Perhaps a little pressure, but no pain. No bumps that I can detect. It doesn't feel different than usual, truthfully. Is everything alright? It's just… a bit unnerving, having someone feel around my neck like this. I apologize for being anxious.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Jahaad. It’s normal to feel a bit anxious during an examination. And everything is alright, we’re just gathering information. Now, let’s take a look at your face. Do you notice any differences in the swelling on either side of your face?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s difficult to say. I think… perhaps the left side is slightly more swollen than the right, but it’s very subtle. Honestly, it’s hard to tell. It's a rather diffuse swelling, you understand? Not a distinct bump or area of redness. It's more of a general fullness. It’s difficult to be certain. I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: You’re not being unhelpful at all. It's helpful to know it’s subtle and diffuse. Alright, Jahaad, based on the examination, I'm noting some mild, diffuse swelling of your face, with slight asymmetry, and a tender, enlarged lymph node on the right side of your neck. Given your fatigue and the fact that you don’t recall a specific cause for the swelling, I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying infection or inflammatory condition. These tests will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it helps to get to the bottom of things, then yes, please. I trust your judgment. Blood tests, then. What exactly will these tests be looking for? And where will I go to have them done?
DOCTOR: Good. We’ll be checking a complete blood count to look for signs of infection or inflammation, as well as your thyroid function since the thyroid can sometimes cause swelling and fatigue. We’ll also check your inflammatory markers, like ESR and CRP, to see if there’s any inflammation present. You can go to Quest Diagnostics, there’s a location just a few blocks from here on Elm Street. I’ll print out a requisition form for you with the exact tests listed and the address. It’s a walk-in clinic, no appointment needed. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Quest Diagnostics on Elm Street… I think so, I vaguely recall seeing it. A requisition form… yes, that would be very helpful. Thank you. No, I don't believe I have any questions at the moment. Just… how long will it take to get the results back? And what happens after that? Will I need to schedule another appointment?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. The results typically take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once they’re available, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. We’ll review the results together, discuss what they mean, and decide on the next steps, which might involve further testing or a referral to a specialist, depending on what we find. Here's the form. It has all the necessary information. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms—like difficulty breathing, fever, or significant pain—please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: 3-5 business days… alright. Contact the clinic for any new symptoms… I will remember that. No, I believe that covers everything. Thank you so much for your time and attention, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. It’s… reassuring to have a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jahaad. I'm glad I could help. And you're right – having a plan is always a good first step. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon. .
