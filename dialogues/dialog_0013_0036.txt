DOCTOR: Hi Kiwane, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. I am here for… the check-up before the insurance starts, yes? A physical, you call it. It is… required.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-insurance physical – absolutely. We can definitely get that done for you. So, just to confirm, you're Kiwane Barban, 28 years old… and this is a routine physical required to activate your Medicare coverage?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Routine. For the… the papers. I do not know much about it, to be honest. They just said I needed this Doctor to… look at me. Is that right?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We’ll take care of everything. It is mostly paperwork, but we want to make sure we have a good baseline of your health, just in case. So, let's start with some questions about your general health. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Generally well… yes. I work. I eat. I sleep. I do not… complain much. What kind of questions? I hope they are not too personal.
DOCTOR: Not too personal, I promise. Just things that help us get a good picture of your health. Okay, let's start with this: have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries… I cut my hand once, at the factory. A small cut. They put a bandage on it. And… I had a fever when I was a boy. A bad one. But that was… long ago. I do not remember much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, a hand injury and a childhood fever. Good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. I have been fortunate. I avoid the hospital if I can. Too many… germs, yes? And the waiting. I do not have time for waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Waiting rooms aren't ideal. Alright, let's talk about your family. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: My family… my father had… problems with his stomach. Always complaining. But he did not go to the doctor much either. My mother… she had many children. That is all I know. They did not talk about illnesses. It was not… polite.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some stomach issues with your father, and not much known about your mother's health history. That's alright, we work with what we have. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I work at the food processing plant. Long hours. I eat when I can. Mostly rice and… some meat. I sleep. I do not… drink alcohol or smoke. I do not have time for such things. It is a simple life.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very full life, Kiwane. That’s good to hear about the alcohol and smoking – those are both important for your health. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no. I do not think so. I have eaten many things in my life. Some I like more than others, but nothing… makes me sick. I have a strong stomach, I believe.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Okay, so we've covered a lot of the background information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, looking in your ears, nose, and throat – the usual things. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable. As long as it is quick. I have things to do later. And… please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let's check your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 128 over 78, which is good. Your pulse is 72, and your temperature is normal. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Everything sounds good so far.
PATIENT: Good. That is… good to hear. So, I am finished now?
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Kiwane. Just one last thing – I’d like to check your height and weight, just for the record. You're 188 centimeters tall and 90 kilograms. That gives you a BMI of… 25.5. That’s considered overweight, but we can discuss that later if you’d like. Now, I have all the information I need for the pre-insurance physical. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Overweight? I work hard. What does that mean? And… will this affect my insurance?
DOCTOR: It just means your Body Mass Index is a bit higher than the recommended range. It's a number calculated from your height and weight, and it can be an indicator of body fat. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, Kiwane. Lots of people are in that range. We can discuss healthy eating and exercise if you're interested, but it's not something to worry about right now. As for your insurance, this information shouldn’t affect your coverage. This physical is just to establish a baseline for your health before the insurance starts. They’re mostly interested in knowing your current health status. However, I would recommend you double-check with your insurance provider just to be certain. I'm going to print out a summary of today’s visit for you. It will include all the information we discussed, as well as my notes from the physical exam. Would you like me to also print out some information on healthy eating and exercise options?
PATIENT: Healthy eating… No, thank you. Just the summary. I understand. Is that everything? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's everything for today. Here's your summary. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions later on. I’ll also make a note to schedule a follow-up appointment in about six months, just to check in and see how you're doing. But that's just a recommendation. It's up to you. It was a pleasure meeting you, Kiwane. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Yes. Thank you, Doctor. .
