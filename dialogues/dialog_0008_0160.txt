DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I'm Dr. Cumper. Welcome to the clinic. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s about this tiredness. It’s just…getting worse. And it’s silly, really, but I’ve been…eating dirt. Not like a whole shovel full, don’t get me wrong. But little bits. Clay, mostly. I don't know why I'm doing it, but it feels…necessary. Is that even a thing? I just want to know what's wrong with me and get it fixed, quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay. That is something we need to explore. The tiredness, and… the dirt. Just to clarify, how long have you been experiencing this increasing tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. It’s been…gradual. Probably… six months, maybe longer? It started as just needing an extra nap here and there. Now? I could sleep all day and still feel exhausted. And the dirt… that’s been maybe three months. I know it sounds ridiculous. My daughter keeps telling me I need to stop, that it’s not healthy. She worries too much, that one. But it feels good, you know? A sort of…calming. Is this taking too long? I have errands.
DOCTOR: No, no, this is fine. We want to get to the bottom of this, and that takes time. So, three months of what feels like a calming sensation from eating clay, and six months of increasing tiredness. Can you describe the tiredness more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? Ugh. It’s not just sleepy. It’s…heavy. Like my limbs are filled with lead. Getting out of a chair takes effort. Walking feels like wading through molasses. And it doesn’t go away with rest. I can sleep eight hours and still feel like I haven’t slept at all. It’s…debilitating, frankly. And then I get this craving, this need for the clay. It’s… unsettling. Honestly, it's just getting worse, and I'm tired of it. Are we getting anywhere? I really don't have time for a lot of back and forth.
DOCTOR: Okay, “heavy limbs”, feeling like you’re wading through molasses even after sleep. That gives me a better picture. And the craving for clay is important. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think... My appetite’s been off. Not much hunger, to be honest. And… oh, this is embarrassing, but I've been constipated. Terribly constipated. It's just... unpleasant. And I seem to bruise easier than I used to. Little bumps, little scratches…they turn into these awful purple marks. I don’t know what’s going on. Honestly, I just want a solution. This is taking forever.
DOCTOR: Okay, loss of appetite, constipation, and easier bruising. Those are all important pieces. Now, I’m going to ask some more general questions, just to get a broader picture. Have you had any recent infections – a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: Infections? No, nothing major. I had a little sniffle back in… February, maybe? But it was just a cold. Barely worth mentioning. I generally stay quite healthy, thank you very much. I eat a good diet, mostly. Though, admittedly, my appetite has been poor lately. This isn't helping my errands, you know. I've got things to do. Are you writing all this down? I hope you're not going to send me on a wild goose chase.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm writing everything down. And I understand you'd like to get this resolved quickly. Just a few more questions. Have you had any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I've lost weight. Not intentionally, mind you. I just haven’t been feeling hungry, so I haven't been eating much. My clothes are a bit looser, actually. Probably… five, maybe ten pounds? I haven't weighed myself precisely. I don’t really like scales. It's just… noticeable. This is taking far too long. Are we done soon? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Okay, unintentional weight loss. Now, have you noticed any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly. It’s more… achy. All over, really. Like I have a mild flu, but without the fever. It's just… a general discomfort. Nothing sharp, nothing specific. It’s… annoying, if that makes sense. Honestly, this is all quite tiresome. And frankly, I'm starting to feel a bit…lightheaded. I really think we should be closer to a solution by now.
DOCTOR: Okay, generalized aches and a bit of lightheadedness. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. No, not really. I had a bit of trouble with my gallbladder years ago, had it removed in… 1988, I believe. And I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox. But nothing chronic, no. I’ve always been quite healthy, as I said. My mother lived to be 95, so I suspect I have good genes. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite unwell. Are we getting anywhere? This is really frustrating. I need to be getting home.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removed in 1988, otherwise generally healthy. Now, any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: No, none. I refuse to take medications if I can avoid it. They just cause more problems than they solve, in my opinion. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. And frankly, I haven't needed any medications. Until now, apparently. This is taking an awful long time. Are you sure you're not going to just give me something for the tiredness? A vitamin, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I’m not fond of okra, but that's a matter of taste, not allergy. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite faint. This is really rather unsettling. Are we nearly done? I really need to lie down. I don’t understand why this is taking so long. What are you even thinking about?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you have any family members with chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. My father had… high blood pressure, I think. And my aunt… she had some sort of trouble with her heart, years ago. But that’s about it, really. Most of my family lived long, healthy lives. Honestly, I feel absolutely dreadful. I'm starting to get a headache, too. This is ridiculous! Are you seriously going to make me wait longer? I have a luncheon to attend, you know! This is wasting my time!
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of hypertension and heart trouble. Now, one last thing before I conduct a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! Heavens no! I find those things utterly distasteful. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life, and I have a very small glass of sherry with my dinner on occasion. That’s it! Sherry, mind you, not some strong liquor. Honestly, this is insulting. Are you seriously questioning my lifestyle? I’m a respectable woman! This whole thing has been a complete waste of my time. Now, are you going to do something, or are we just going to sit here and talk all day? I feel like I’m going to collapse.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hardenburgh. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the length of time this is taking. However, it’s important to gather as much information as possible to determine the cause of your symptoms. Based on what you've told me – the tiredness, the clay eating, the loss of appetite, weight loss, constipation, easier bruising, and the sherry – there are a few possibilities we need to explore. Before we talk about those, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and a few neurological checks. It will only take a few minutes. Can we proceed with that?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And be gentle. I bruise easily, remember? Honestly, I still think this is unnecessary. I just want something for the tiredness. Is that too much to ask? But yes, alright. Get on with it. But if it's uncomfortable, I'm leaving. Immediately. I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart rate is a bit slow, but the rhythm is regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Are you experiencing any pain here?
PATIENT: A little bit. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It’s always been a bit tender, to be honest. My mother had trouble with her digestion, you know. And this is cold! Are you going to put my clothes back on soon? This is really rather undignified. Hurry up, please. I'm starting to feel quite faint again. Honestly, this is ridiculous. Just tell me what’s wrong with me and give me something to make me feel better. It can't be that hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noticing some mild tenderness throughout your abdomen, particularly in the lower quadrants. Your spleen feels slightly enlarged. Now, I'm going to check your neurological reflexes. Can you please extend your arms in front of you?
PATIENT: Honestly, this is all very unsettling. Enlarged spleen? What does that even mean? Is it serious? And what about the tiredness? Are you going to tell me what’s causing that, or are you just going to poke and prod me all day? I'm starting to feel very anxious. This luncheon is very important, you know. It's a charity event. I simply must be at my best. Just get on with it, please. Hurry up. And be gentle!
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are a little bit slow. Now, I’m going to check your skin for any signs of paleness or jaundice. Your skin appears slightly pale, but I don’t see any signs of jaundice. Based on the physical exam findings – the slow heart rate, enlarged spleen, mild tenderness in your abdomen, slightly pale skin, and diminished reflexes – combined with your symptoms, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. We need to run some blood tests to investigate further. These tests will help us check for anemia, iron deficiency, vitamin deficiencies, and rule out other potential causes of your tiredness and clay eating. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests. Of course. More waiting. More poking and prodding. Honestly, this is just dreadful. But… I suppose if you think it’s necessary. But I want results quickly. And I want to know what's causing the tiredness. And I want something to make me feel better. Soon. And can I at least sit up now? This examination table is terribly uncomfortable. And what about my luncheon? Will I be able to make it? Honestly, this is just a complete disaster. Just get the blood tests done, quickly, and tell me what's wrong with me. I'm starting to feel very faint again. Hurry up!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. I understand your frustration. I'll order the blood tests immediately. The lab technician will draw a few vials of blood. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Once the results are back – usually within 24-48 hours – we can discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a low-dose iron supplement to address the potential for iron deficiency. It's important to note that this is just a precaution, and we need the blood tests to confirm the diagnosis. This prescription is for 30 milligrams of ferrous sulfate, to be taken once daily with food. Be aware that iron supplements can cause constipation, so drink plenty of fluids and consider a stool softener if needed. As for your luncheon, I can’t guarantee you’ll be able to attend, as we need to evaluate the blood test results first. However, I’ll do everything I can to expedite the process. In the meantime, please rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid strenuous activity. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Constipation? Of course. Just what I need. More problems. And you’re telling me I might miss my luncheon? This is simply unacceptable! It’s for a very important cause, you know. Honestly, this whole experience has been dreadful. Iron supplement, constipation, missing my luncheon... Is this all there is to it? No explanation? No reassurance? Just more problems? Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything at all? What could be causing all of this? And what are the chances I’ll be able to make it to my luncheon? Be honest with me, please. And don't tell me to rest. I'm quite capable of deciding when I need to rest, thank you very much. Just tell me what’s going on. And what I can expect. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. I understand your anxiety, and I apologize for not being able to provide a definitive diagnosis at this point. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam findings, several possibilities need to be ruled out. One possibility is iron deficiency anemia, which can cause tiredness, clay eating – a condition called pica – and pale skin. Another possibility is a vitamin deficiency, such as B12 or folate. These deficiencies can also cause similar symptoms. Less common, but still a possibility, is a problem with your spleen. The enlargement could be due to various factors, including infection or a blood disorder. The blood tests will help us determine the underlying cause of the enlargement and rule out any serious problems. Regarding your luncheon, I can’t guarantee you’ll be able to attend until we have the blood test results. However, if the results are normal, and your symptoms are mild, you may be able to go. If the results are abnormal, we’ll need to discuss further treatment options and determine whether it’s safe for you to attend. I understand this is frustrating, and I apologize for not being able to provide more definitive answers at this point. However, I assure you, I'm doing everything I can to get to the bottom of this and help you feel better. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Blood disorders… enlargement… This sounds serious. Very serious. And you're telling me you don't know what's causing all of this? That's simply unacceptable. I've never had any problems like this before. I've always been healthy, as I’ve told you. What kind of treatment are we talking about if it is something serious? And what are the chances of… you know… a bad outcome? Be honest with me, please. I need to know what I'm facing. I can't handle more uncertainty. And I still want to know if I can make it to my luncheon. This is important, you know. Very important. Just tell me everything. Quickly. Before I faint.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that I’m not trying to alarm you. It’s important to remember that these are just possibilities at this point, and we need the blood test results to confirm any diagnosis. If it is a blood disorder, the treatment options will vary depending on the specific type of disorder. Some blood disorders can be managed with medication, while others may require more intensive treatment, such as a blood transfusion or bone marrow transplant. The chances of a bad outcome also vary depending on the specific disorder and the stage of diagnosis. In most cases, blood disorders can be effectively managed with proper treatment. Regarding your luncheon, I’m hesitant to say definitively whether you’ll be able to attend until we have the blood test results. However, if the results are normal, and your symptoms are mild, you should be able to go. If the results are abnormal, we’ll need to discuss further treatment options and determine whether it’s safe for you to attend. I understand this is a lot to take in, and I apologize for not being able to provide more definitive answers at this point. However, I assure you, I'm doing everything I can to get to the bottom of this and help you feel better. I will call you as soon as the blood test results are available, and we can discuss them in detail. In the meantime, please rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid strenuous activity. Do you have any questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Bone marrow transplant… you said bone marrow transplant. That sounds… terrifying. And I’m supposed to rest? How can I rest when I’m facing something like that? This is just dreadful. Absolutely dreadful. Can you… can you at least tell me what the chances are of it being something serious? Give me a number. A percentage. Just tell me how likely it is. I need to know. I can't handle more uncertainty. And what about the luncheon? Is there any chance at all I'll be able to go? Be honest with me. Just tell me everything. Quickly. Before I faint. Honestly, this is just too much.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I understand your need for certainty, and I apologize for not being able to provide a definitive answer. It's difficult to give you a precise percentage without the blood test results. However, based on your symptoms, the chances of it being a serious condition, such as a blood disorder requiring a bone marrow transplant, are relatively low. I estimate the chances of it being a serious condition requiring intensive treatment are less than 10%. The most likely explanation is iron deficiency anemia or a vitamin deficiency, which are easily treatable with supplements. However, it’s important to rule out any other potential causes with the blood tests. Regarding your luncheon, if the blood test results are normal, and your symptoms are mild, there is a good chance you'll be able to go. However, if the results are abnormal, we’ll need to discuss further treatment options and determine whether it’s safe for you to attend. I understand this is a lot to take in, and I apologize for not being able to provide more definitive answers at this point. However, I assure you, I'm doing everything I can to get to the bottom of this and help you feel better. I will call you as soon as the blood test results are available, and we can discuss them in detail. In the meantime, please rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid strenuous activity. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Less than 10%… that's… something, I suppose. But still… it could happen. And what if it does happen? What then? And what about the clay eating? Is that going to cause any problems? And my luncheon… I simply must be at my best for that event. It’s for a very important cause, you know. Can you at least promise me you'll do everything you can to make sure I'm okay? And that you'll call me as soon as the results are available? Promise me. And that you’ll help me figure out a way to get to my luncheon, even if I’m not feeling 100%? Just promise me. Honestly, this is just too much. I’m starting to feel very faint again. I think I’m going to collapse.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I absolutely promise you that I will do everything I can to make sure you're okay. I will call you as soon as the blood test results are available, and we will discuss them in detail. And I will help you figure out a way to get to your luncheon, even if you're not feeling 100%. I understand how important this event is to you, and I will do everything in my power to help you attend. I understand you're feeling faint, and I want to make sure you're comfortable. Perhaps you should sit down for a few minutes and take a few deep breaths. And I’ll have a nurse come in and check your blood pressure. Remember, the chances of a serious condition are relatively low, and we are taking all the necessary steps to get to the bottom of this. I am here to support you every step of the way. Now, let's take a deep breath together. And let's focus on getting you feeling better.
