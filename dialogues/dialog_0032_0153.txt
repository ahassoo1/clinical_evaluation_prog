DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I am Dr. Pipkorn. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Right… well, it’s… something about a check-up. For… work, I think? They said I needed a physical. It’s… for the theater, maybe? Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. Lots of ushering, you know. Standing around. It all blurs together after a while. Is that what this is for? Just to make sure I’m still… able?
DOCTOR: A physical for work, you say. Yes, that is quite common. And ushering, standing for long periods… that can certainly take a toll. It’s good you’re being proactive about this. To clarify, Mr. Krahn, is this a new requirement from your employer, or have you had physicals previously?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. I really don’t recall. Probably had some before, but when? Years ago, I suppose. It feels new, though. They just… sent me over here. A form, I think. Lots of boxes to check. It’s all a bit of a haze, to be honest. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. Is this going to take long? I have… things.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Krahn. We can work through this. It is quite common for details to be unclear. Don’t apologize. Let's start with what you do remember. You mentioned a form. Do you happen to recall anything specific about why they requested this physical?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It had something to do with… performances. Actors, I believe. They needed to make sure everyone was… fit enough? Safe, maybe? I take tickets sometimes, and I’ve seen a few people stumble getting to their seats. Maybe it’s for that? It’s just… a lot of standing, a lot of faces. Everything runs together. Is it warm in here, or is it just me?
DOCTOR: Yes, ensuring the safety of both performers and patrons is important. We'll certainly assess your overall health and fitness. Now, Mr. Krahn, let’s move beyond the reason for the physical and focus on you. Do you have any current medical problems – anything at all that’s bothering you presently?
PATIENT: Oh… well. My knees, sometimes. A little achey, after a long shift. Nothing terrible, just… old age, I suppose. And my back… gets stiff if I stand too long without moving. It’s probably just from years of… well, years. Nothing a good rest doesn’t fix. I don’t really go to the doctor, if I can avoid it. Mostly just… ignore things until they go away. Which, usually, they do.
DOCTOR: I see. While it’s admirable you’ve managed thus far, ignoring problems isn’t always the best course of action. It’s better to address things proactively, before they become more serious. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions – such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking things… I really don't remember. I… I think not? I’ve never had anything serious. A few colds, maybe. The flu, once. Nothing that required a doctor, really. My mother… she had some trouble with her heart, I think. But I don't think I inherited anything. I’m pretty sure. It was a long time ago, though. A very long time. Things get… lost. Is this going to involve needles? Because I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: We will address the possibility of needles later, Mr. Krahn. It’s important to have a complete medical history first. Let’s focus on your family history. Besides your mother’s heart trouble, were there any other significant medical conditions that ran in your family – such as cancer, stroke, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Oh… family history. Right. My father… he was a strong man. Worked very hard. I don’t think he ever got sick. He… he died in his sleep, I think. Old age, probably. My sister… she had trouble with her stomach, I recall. Some sort of… ailment. Nothing I really understood. Everyone dies, doesn’t it? It’s hard to remember specifics, with so many years gone by. This is… a lot to think about. Are we almost done?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. Alcohol… maybe a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. Nothing regular. And drugs? Absolutely not. I’m a… a respectable man. I wouldn’t… I don’t even know anyone who… No, I don’t do any of that. This is a bit insulting, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. Not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me, pretty much. Never had a reaction. Maybe a little sniffle sometimes during pollen season, but that’s just… the weather, isn’t it? I don't take many medications, either. Just… over-the-counter stuff for headaches, occasionally. I think. It’s hard to keep track. Are we still doing this? I feel a bit… lightheaded.
DOCTOR: You mentioned over-the-counter medications for headaches. Can you tell me specifically what you take, and how often?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Little white pills. You get them at the drugstore. For headaches. I take them when my head hurts. Maybe… two or three times a week? Sometimes more, if it’s a bad one. I don’t know the name, I just… ask for something for a headache. I don't really pay attention to names, Doctor. They all look the same to me. Is this going to be a long process? I have a shift later… and I don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll need to assess your range of motion and reflexes. It won’t be extensive, but it will give me a better understanding of your overall health. Can you please sit up on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh… an examination. Right. This table is… cold. And hard. Alright, go ahead. But please be gentle. My back… isn’t what it used to be. And could you hurry, if possible? I really don't like being on this table. It makes me feel… vulnerable. Is this going to hurt?
DOCTOR: This will be quick, Mr. Krahn. Just relax. Blood pressure is elevated at 150/90. Pulse is regular but slightly fast at 88. Heart sounds are normal, though slightly muffled. Lung sounds are clear, but slightly diminished. Respiration is a bit shallow. Now, if you could please extend your arms… I’ll check your range of motion.
PATIENT: Oh… elevated, you say? That’s… not good, is it? I get a little nervous at the doctor, maybe that’s why. My shoulders are a bit stiff. Years of… standing around, you know. Holding tickets. It’s not surprising, really. And… what does “diminished” mean? Is something broken? Please be careful, Doctor. I need these arms. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Range of motion is limited in both shoulders, with mild discomfort upon extension. Reflexes are slightly delayed in both upper extremities. Now, if you could please bend at the waist and touch your toes... I need to assess your back flexibility. Your back flexibility is also limited, with noticeable discomfort. It seems you have some stiffness and restricted movement in multiple joints. Based on this brief examination, and your medical history, I recommend we order some blood work and possibly an X-ray of your shoulders and back to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… blood work and an X-ray? That sounds… unpleasant. And expensive, I imagine. I don’t have… insurance, you see. I really just came in for a quick check-up. To make sure I’m still fit enough for work. I don’t want to bother with… all this. Is it really necessary? Maybe… maybe I can just try stretching more? Or taking some pain relievers? I have a shift tomorrow, you know. And I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, while I understand your concerns about cost and inconvenience, it’s my professional responsibility to ensure you receive appropriate medical care. Your elevated blood pressure, limited range of motion, and diminished lung sounds are concerning. Stretching and pain relievers may provide temporary relief, but they won’t address the underlying cause of your symptoms. To be frank, ignoring these issues could lead to more serious complications down the line. I can write you a prescription for a stronger pain reliever to manage your discomfort, but I strongly advise you to have the blood work and X-ray done. I can also provide you with information on local resources that offer financial assistance for medical expenses. We can discuss a payment plan with the lab and radiology center, if necessary. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh… A payment plan… that sounds… complicated. And I really don’t like hospitals. Or labs. Or… anything medical, really. Alright. Alright, fine. But just the blood work. No X-rays. I can’t… I can’t deal with the X-rays right now. And… could you write the prescription for the strongest pain reliever you’ve got? Just… to get me through the shift. And… please hurry. I have to get back to work. Is that okay? Can we just do that? The blood work and the prescription?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Krahn. We will proceed with the blood work and I will write you a prescription for a strong pain reliever. However, I must advise you that this is a temporary solution, and I strongly recommend you reconsider the X-ray at a later date. Here is the prescription. I will also provide you with a lab requisition form for the blood work. The lab is located at [Provides address and phone number of local lab]. They require a valid form of identification. I strongly encourage you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the blood work results. I also recommend you consider a referral to a physical therapist to address your limited range of motion. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you. No, I don’t think so. Just… where do I go to get this done? And how long will it take? I have a shift… Will the pain reliever make me drowsy? I need to be alert. And… is there anything else I should be worried about? I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: The lab is located at [Repeats address of local lab]. The blood work should take approximately 30-45 minutes. As for the pain reliever, it may cause some drowsiness, so be cautious if operating machinery or driving. I’ve provided you with a list of potential side effects on the prescription. If you experience any concerning symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe dizziness, seek immediate medical attention. Please, Mr. Krahn, take care of yourself. And seriously consider the follow-up appointment and physical therapy.
