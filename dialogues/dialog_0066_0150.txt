DOCTOR: Hi Angelle, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, finally. It took long enough to get an appointment out here. Look, Doctor, I’m 51, divorced, and frankly, I want to have a baby. Without… complications. I don’t have time for nonsense. Is that even possible?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a very reasonable question, and certainly something we can discuss. It's great you're thinking ahead and planning. It is possible to get pregnant at 51, though it does come with some increased risks. Before we talk about possibilities, let's get a better understanding of your overall health. First, have you been trying to conceive already, or is this more of an exploratory conversation?
PATIENT: Exploratory. Absolutely exploratory. I haven’t… actively tried. I thought I'd talk to someone sensible first. I’m not about to waste time with… well, you know. And frankly, I’m a bit insulted you even asked if I’ve been “trying.” Do I look like the type to just haphazardly start a pregnancy?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask those questions first. My apologies – that was a clumsy question. It's good you’re being proactive. Let’s focus on getting you the information you need. To start, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I broke my arm once falling off a… never mind. More recently, I had a hysterectomy about fifteen years ago. That’s probably relevant, isn’t it? And I have Medicare, if that matters. Everything else? I’m perfectly healthy, thank you very much. I cycle every day, for goodness sake.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. The hysterectomy is very relevant – it changes things considerably. And that’s wonderful that you’re so active with cycling! That’s excellent for your overall health. Just to clarify, was the hysterectomy complete – meaning did it include removal of the ovaries as well?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, complete. Everything. That’s why I’m here! Honestly, I find this line of questioning… insulting. You're a doctor, you should be able to figure out the implications of a complete hysterectomy. Are you even listening?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to call me out on that. I apologize again. You are correct; a complete hysterectomy does significantly impact the possibility of carrying a pregnancy. It’s frustrating to have to ask what seem like obvious questions, and I shouldn’t have put you in that position. My intention was to get a full picture, but I clearly didn't explain that well. Given the complete hysterectomy, carrying a biological child isn’t possible. However, there are options for growing your family, such as adoption or using a gestational carrier with an egg donor. Would you like to discuss those possibilities, or is there anything else you had in mind when you scheduled this appointment?
PATIENT: Gestational carrier? Egg donor? Honestly. That’s… ridiculous. I didn't come here to discuss other people's wombs or… donating eggs. I want a baby. My baby. Is there anything you can do to… reverse things? Some kind of… advanced surgery? Implants? I’ve read things online, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your hope, and it's good you’re researching. You're right to ask about all possibilities. Unfortunately, reversing a complete hysterectomy is not currently possible. The organs are removed, and there’s no way to restore them to their original function. While there is ongoing research in uterine transplantation, it is still considered experimental and carries significant risks. It's not a widely available or recommended option. Regarding implants, there are currently no implants that can restore uterine function. I want to be honest with you; there's no medical procedure that can allow you to carry a biological child after a complete hysterectomy. I realize this isn’t the answer you hoped for. Would you be open to discussing adoption or using a gestational carrier in more detail?
PATIENT: So you're telling me, after all this time, after getting an appointment with a doctor, that I've wasted my time? That’s… frankly, appalling. I came here for medical advice, not a lecture on… limitations. I think I've heard enough.
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize that I couldn't provide you with the answer you were hoping for, Angelle. I understand your frustration, and I regret that I wasted your time. I want to reiterate that I’m happy to discuss other family-building options if you’re interested, but I respect your decision if you’d prefer to explore other avenues. Here's a list of resources for adoption agencies and gestational carrier services in your area. Thank you for coming in today. If you change your mind, or have further questions, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. .
