DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, frankly, I haven't the time for this. Sudden vision loss, sudden hearing loss. It’s… disruptive. I'm a very busy woman, you understand. A surgeon. Pediatric, but still. I expect a swift diagnosis and a swift solution.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Julie, and I assure you I’ll do my best to be efficient. Sudden changes in vision and hearing are certainly concerning, and we want to get to the bottom of this. To start, could you tell me a little more about the vision loss?
PATIENT: Oh, it just… went blurry. Like looking through a dirty window, only it's my window. And then not at all. It comes and goes, mostly goes, thankfully. It's not as if I have time to be blind, Doctor. When did it start? Honestly, I couldn’t tell you. A few days ago, perhaps? It all feels like a blur, to be frank. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Ms. Julie. It sounds quite disruptive, and it's understandable you want to get this resolved quickly. The fact that it comes and goes is helpful information. Just to clarify, when you say it "goes," does your vision return to completely normal, or is it still somewhat blurry even when it improves?
PATIENT: Normal, Doctor, mostly. It’s not as if I’m permanently incapacitated. Just… dimmed. Like an old photograph, you understand? And then it sharpens. Though not always completely. Honestly, I haven’t the patience to measure the degree of blurriness. I have patients waiting. Are we getting anywhere with this? I really must be going soon.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are, Ms. Julie. Your description is very helpful. "Dimmed" and then "sharpens" – that gives me a better understanding. Now, let's talk about the hearing loss. Is that also coming and going, and if so, how would you describe it?
PATIENT: Much the same, Doctor. It fades in and out. One moment I can hear perfectly well, the next… muffled. Like being underwater. Though I haven’t been underwater in years. It’s terribly inconvenient, you understand. I need to hear what my staff are saying. And the children… well, it’s important. Though, frankly, some of them are quite shrill. Are you writing all of this down? I hope so, because I’m not repeating myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am documenting everything, Ms. Julie. "Comes and goes, like being underwater" – very helpful. Both the vision and hearing fluctuating like this is important information. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the vision and hearing changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. No. Not that I recall. Perhaps a slight headache, now and then. But I’m a surgeon, Doctor. I always have a slight headache. Stress, you understand. It’s a very demanding profession. No dizziness, no weakness, no… anything else of note. Really. I’m a very healthy woman, despite everything. Honestly, I suspect it’s just… a temporary blip. A virus, perhaps? I haven’t got time for a full workup. Is this going to require blood tests? I truly haven’t the time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Ms. Julie, and I’ll certainly keep that in mind. However, because of the sudden onset of both vision and hearing loss, even with the fluctuations, it’s important to rule out several possibilities. A virus is certainly one possibility, but others need to be considered. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? Diabetes? High blood pressure? I maintain a very strict diet, and I exercise regularly when I have the time. Though, admittedly, the operating room doesn't lend itself to a brisk walk. And as for cholesterol… utterly preposterous. I'm a surgeon, not a… well, not someone who would have those problems. I assure you, my medical history is perfectly… unremarkable. Are we nearing the end of this interrogation? I have a waiting room full of anxious parents.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Ms. Julie. It's good to know you maintain a healthy lifestyle. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Well, yes, of course. I'm a surgeon! Numerous operations, naturally. And a few hospital stays… Appendicitis when I was a child, I believe. And a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years ago. Beyond that… nothing of consequence. Honestly, Doctor, I spend most of my time in the hospital, performing surgeries. I hardly need to be admitted to one. Are you quite finished? I really must be going. This is wasting precious time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Thank you for that information. Now, can you tell me about any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, Doctor, my family is… complicated. My mother had some sort of… nerve condition, I believe. Something to do with her hands. And my father… well, he was a very private man. I don’t recall any other significant illnesses. They weren’t particularly forthcoming about such things. Frankly, I'm not a family history expert. I'm a surgeon, not a genealogist! Are we done yet? I truly haven't the patience for this. I have a backlog of patients waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Julie. Thank you for sharing that. Given your concerns about time, and the nature of your symptoms, I’d like to do a quick neurological exam to assess your vision, hearing, and reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A neurological exam? Really, Doctor? Must we? I assure you, my reflexes are perfectly adequate for performing delicate surgery. And my vision is… was… fine. But… I suppose if it will expedite matters. Just please be quick. I haven’t got all day. And please, don’t poke me too much. I have important hands to preserve. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. It will be quick and non-invasive. Just a few simple tests. First, let’s check your vision. Could you please follow my finger as I move it in front of your eyes?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is rather rudimentary. I examine eyes for a living. But very well. Here. There. Is that sufficient? I trust you aren’t expecting me to read the eye chart? I haven't the time for such trivialities. Get on with it, please. My patients are waiting. And I’m starting to feel rather… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to check your peripheral vision. Please focus on my nose, and let me know when you can see my finger as I bring it into your side vision. Can you see my finger on this side?
PATIENT: Vaguely. Is it waving? Honestly, Doctor, the lighting in here isn’t very good. And my eyes are rather tired. I’ve been in surgery all morning. Is this necessary? I can assure you, my peripheral vision is perfectly adequate for navigating an operating room. I need to see instruments, not… fingers. Hurry up, please. This is becoming quite tedious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s just take a quick look at your ears. This will help me rule out any immediate causes for the hearing loss. Do you have any pain or discomfort with this?
PATIENT: A bit. It's… cold. And intrusive. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not accustomed to having things poked in my ears. I perform the poking, I don't receive it. Is there something wrong? You're frowning. Is my ear canal obstructed? I really must be going. This is quite unsettling. I have a reputation to maintain, and I can't afford to have my ears… examined.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Julie, your ear canals appear clear. There’s no visible obstruction or signs of infection. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes quickly. Please sit back and relax. I’m going to lightly tap your knees with this small hammer. Do you feel any pain or discomfort with that?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor! What was that for? It startled me! And yes, a bit of discomfort, naturally. You're assaulting me with a hammer! Honestly, this is preposterous. I perform delicate surgeries, I don’t receive blunt force trauma. Are you quite finished? I'm starting to feel rather… violated. I demand an explanation. And a swift conclusion to this… ordeal. I have patients waiting, you understand. Important patients. And I haven't the time for this… indignity.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your frustration and apologize if the examination has been uncomfortable. My intention is simply to gather information to understand the cause of your symptoms. The quick neurological exam is a standard procedure to assess nerve function. Given your aversion to the examination, and the sudden onset of both symptoms, I'm concerned about the possibility of a more serious underlying cause. While your reflexes appear intact, the fluctuating nature of your vision and hearing, combined with your reported headache, warrants further investigation. I recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out any neurological issues. Would you be open to scheduling that?
PATIENT: An MRI? Absolutely not. I haven't the time for such… extravagance. And I certainly don't want to be confined in a metal tube. It sounds utterly claustrophobic. No, Doctor, I refuse. I suspect this is a temporary viral infection. A bit of rest, perhaps a mild sedative, and I'll be perfectly fine. I'm a surgeon, not a fragile patient. I don't need an MRI. I need to get back to my practice. My patients need me. Honestly, this has been a complete waste of my time. Are you absolutely certain you can't simply prescribe me something? A strong antibiotic, perhaps? And send me on my way? I have a waiting room full of anxious parents. This is utterly unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your reluctance, and I respect your decision. However, I must advise against self-treating without a proper diagnosis. An antibiotic will not be effective against a neurological cause, and could even be harmful. The fluctuating nature of your symptoms, and the sudden onset, are concerning enough to warrant further investigation. Given your strong aversion to an MRI, and while I still strongly recommend it, I can offer an alternative. I can refer you to a neurologist for a more in-depth examination and assessment. They may be able to order other tests, such as blood work, and provide a more definitive diagnosis. Would you be open to a referral to a neurologist?
PATIENT: A neurologist… Hmph. Fine. But I expect a swift appointment. And I want someone who understands the value of my time. I haven’t got all day to sit around waiting for tests and opinions. And I want a written report sent to my office immediately. No delays. I’m a busy woman, Doctor. I simply haven’t got the time for this… drawn-out process. Just give me the referral. And please, no unnecessary tests. I’m a surgeon, not a medical curiosity. Get on with it, please. I have a waiting room full of anxious parents. This is utterly unacceptable. And frankly, I’m starting to feel rather… faint.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. Here is the referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly respected neurologist in the area. I’ve included a detailed summary of your symptoms and concerns, and noted your preference for a swift appointment. Her office will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. I will also send a copy of this report to your office immediately. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or you experience any new symptoms, such as dizziness, weakness, or severe headache, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just get me out of here. This has been a complete waste of my time. I trust Dr. Sharma understands the value of my profession. And I expect a prompt response. Honestly, this has been utterly… exhausting. I need a lie-down. Good day, Doctor. And please, do not contact me unless absolutely necessary. I have a waiting room full of anxious parents.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Julie. I wish you all the best and a speedy recovery. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
