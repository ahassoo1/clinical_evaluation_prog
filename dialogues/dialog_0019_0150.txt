DOCTOR: Good morning, Angelle. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have all day. I want to have a baby. A healthy baby. I’m… not getting any younger, you know. I want to make sure everything is… working properly before I even try. Is that so difficult to understand?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. That’s a very sensible approach, Angelle. Planning ahead is always good. So, you’re hoping to get pregnant, and you’d like a check-up to make sure everything is in order before you start trying?
PATIENT: Precisely. I don’t want any… surprises. I’ve heard horror stories. And frankly, I don’t have the time for complications. My ex… well, let’s just say I don’t want a repeat of that situation. So, what tests are we talking about? Let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, well, we’ll want to get a good history first, just to get a clear picture of your overall health. Then we can discuss some basic tests… blood work to check your hormone levels, make sure you're immune to certain things, and a general physical exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A history? Really? Do you need my life story? I’m 51, divorced, and I repair bicycles. What more do you need to know? Fine. Ask your questions. But make it quick. And please, no overly personal inquiries. I assure you, my bicycle repair skills are not relevant to my reproductive health.
DOCTOR: You’re right to call me out on that, Angelle. Bicycle repair is likely not relevant. I just want to get a sense of your overall medical background, if you’ve had any significant illnesses or surgeries, that sort of thing. Perhaps we can start with past medical history?
PATIENT: Fine. No major illnesses. Broken wrist when I was a teenager – bicycle accident, naturally. Appendectomy when I was… oh, I don't know, thirty-something. That’s it. I eat reasonably well, I don’t smoke, and I definitely don’t drink excessively. Happy now? Can we move on to the actual tests? I'm starting to lose patience.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good to know, thank you. And good habits are always a plus. Alright, let’s talk about family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? My mother obsessed about everything. High blood pressure, arthritis… the usual old-lady ailments. My father… he died of a heart attack. That's about all I remember. Honestly, I wasn’t very close to either of them. Is this really going to help determine if I can have a baby? It feels like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: It's alright if you don't have a lot of detail, Angelle. Knowing about a history of heart conditions or high blood pressure can be relevant, just to give us a broader picture. Now, have you had any previous surgeries besides the appendectomy?
PATIENT: Let me think… No. Just the appendix. I had a wisdom tooth removed, but that’s hardly a surgery, is it? It was a dentist, not a… a proper doctor. Honestly, you're asking remarkably trivial questions. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just filling out paperwork for the sake of it?
DOCTOR: We’re getting there, Angelle. It’s just important to have a complete picture. Alright, how about allergies?
PATIENT: Dust. A little bit. And cats. But I avoid cats. It's not like I'm going to have a severe allergic reaction, I just… sneeze a bit. Is that what we're doing now? Listing every minor inconvenience I've ever experienced? Honestly. Can we please get to the blood tests? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, dust and cats – noted. And yes, we can move on to the blood tests. Before we do, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. Old age, you know. And sometimes ibuprofen for… aches and pains. Bicycle repair isn't exactly gentle on the body. That’s it. Nothing else. Please, let’s just get this over with. I have a repair scheduled for 2 PM. A very important bicycle.
DOCTOR: Alright, a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Good. So, to summarize, no major illnesses, broken wrist and appendectomy in the past, family history of high blood pressure and heart attack, dust and cat allergies, and a multivitamin and ibuprofen occasionally. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick, Doctor. I haven't got all day. And please, no unnecessary poking and prodding. Just the essentials. I need to get back to work. A perfectly good bicycle is waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Angelle. Just a quick check of your blood pressure, heart rate, and a listen to your lungs and heart. Then we’ll do a basic abdominal exam. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Hurry it up, Doctor. I have a schedule to keep. This bicycle isn't going to repair itself. And if you find anything wrong, please just tell me straight. I don't have time for beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relaxing your arm… good. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. We can keep an eye on it. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, just lie down on the exam table, and I'll do a quick abdominal exam.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. I have a very important customer. And this table is… uncomfortable. Are you sure you're a proper doctor? This is all very… inefficient.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a quick check… no tenderness… everything feels normal. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Now, just sit back up. Everything seems alright so far, Angelle. We will need to draw some blood to check your hormone levels and make sure you’re immune to common infections. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests. Finally. Just get it done. I don’t like needles, but I suppose it’s necessary. But no unnecessary poking and prodding! And tell the lab technician to be quick about it. I have a bicycle waiting. Honestly, the inefficiency of this whole process is… astounding.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Angelle. We’ll get you in and out as quickly as possible. I'll write the lab order now, and I'll let the lab technician know you're not a fan of needles. They're very good at what they do. And we'll get the results back as soon as possible. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just do the tests. And hurry. My bicycle isn’t going to repair itself. This whole experience has been… less than satisfactory. Frankly, I expected better. Now, where is this lab technician? Time is money, Doctor. Time is money. .
DOCTOR: Alright, the lab is just down the hall, room 3. I'll have someone come get you when they’re ready. And please, don't hesitate to let me know if you have any concerns. .
