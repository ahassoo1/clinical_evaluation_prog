DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm one of the internal medicine physicians here. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… It’s… the pee. Yes, the pee. It’s hard to get it out, you know? Not like… painful, just… stuck. It’s been a few weeks, I think. Maybe longer? Old age, I suppose!
DOCTOR: I understand. Difficulty with urination can be concerning, but we'll figure out what's going on. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Or maybe a month? Time… it all blurs together, you know? I just know it’s getting harder. My husband, he notices too. He says I take a long time in the bathroom.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright if you’re unsure of the exact timeframe. We can work with what you remember. And it’s good that your husband has noticed; that’s helpful. Could you describe a little more about what it feels like when you try to urinate?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I push, you know? Like you normally do. But it doesn’t… go. Not right away. I have to… wait. And sometimes it just… dribbles. It’s not a strong stream like it used to be. And I feel like there’s still some left in there, even after I’m done. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Stoffregen. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty starting your stream, a weaker stream, and a feeling of incomplete emptying. To help me understand a little better, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain, dear. Not at all. Just… frustrating. It’s not comfortable, but it doesn’t hurt. It's just… a struggle. And I have to go more often now, it seems. Especially at night. Waking up my poor husband!
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain or burning, just increased frequency and difficulty, particularly at night. That's helpful information. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes or any problems with your kidneys or bladder?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I’ve been to doctors a lot over the years, you know. Old age again! I had… something with my blood pressure, I think. They gave me pills for it. And… I worked at the hospital for a long time, taking care of people. Psychiatric, mostly. I don’t think I ever had anything wrong with me, really. Just the usual aches and pains. I can't recall anything special about my kidneys or bladder, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of blood pressure being managed with medication, and a long history of working in psychiatric care. That's good to know. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure pills, or any supplements or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. The blood pressure pills, yes. A little white one, I think. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it flares up. It's a yellow one. I get them from the drugstore. That's all I can think of right now, dear. My husband helps me keep track of things.
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure medication and something for arthritis as needed. Thank you for letting me know. Now, I’d like to ask about any allergies you might have, to medications, foods, or anything else.
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I eat most things. I used to love shellfish, but I haven’t had it in years. My husband says it’s too risky. I don't recall ever having a bad reaction to any medicine. I’ve had a lot of shots over the years, working at the hospital and all, but no problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, Ms. Stoffregen, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a gentle exam of your pelvic area. This will help me to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well… I suppose so. I haven’t had one in a while. I’m a bit… sensitive, you know? Old age, again! But if you think it’s necessary… yes, alright. Just be gentle, dear.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll take things at your pace. I'm listening to your abdomen now. I don't hear anything concerning at this point. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or masses. Does this cause you any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no pain dear. Just… feels a bit strange, you know? Like a poking feeling. Not uncomfortable, just… different. Everything feels a bit… loose, I suppose. Old age!
DOCTOR: I understand. That's not unusual. Now, I’m going to perform a gentle pelvic exam. This will allow me to assess your pelvic muscles and look for any abnormalities. I'll be using a lubricated speculum and a gloved finger. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. Okay, Ms. Stoffregen, that completes the physical exam. I did not notice any significant abnormalities, but I did feel some mild weakening of your pelvic floor muscles. This is common with age and can contribute to the difficulty you're experiencing with urination.
PATIENT: Oh… weakening of muscles, you say? Well, that doesn’t surprise me! Everything’s getting weak these days! So… what does that mean, dear? What are we going to do about it? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Ms. Stoffregen, but it's definitely something we want to address to improve your quality of life. The weakening of your pelvic floor muscles can make it harder to start and stop urination, and can also lead to a feeling of incomplete emptying, which is what you've been describing. Based on your symptoms and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing urinary retention due to pelvic floor weakness. To confirm this, and to rule out any other potential causes, I’d like to order a urinalysis – that's a simple urine test to check for infection – and a post-void residual volume test. This test measures how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… tests. Alright, dear. If that’s what you think is best. I trust your judgment. A urine test and… the other one. What does that one involve? Do I have to… you know… go in a jar?
DOCTOR: Yes, the urinalysis will require a urine sample, which you'll provide in a jar. It's a very simple process, and we have private facilities for you. The post-void residual volume test is also straightforward. After you urinate, a small ultrasound device is used to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder. It’s non-invasive and doesn't cause any discomfort. We'll get those tests ordered right away. In the meantime, I recommend practicing pelvic floor exercises – also known as Kegel exercises – to help strengthen those muscles. I can give you a handout with instructions, and we can discuss them further. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Oh, exercises… I suppose I can try. I used to do a lot of gardening, that must have helped my muscles! Yes, dear, the handout would be lovely. Anything to help, you know? And… what about the pee test? How long will that take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab usually gets the urinalysis results back within 24-48 hours. The post-void residual volume test is performed here in the office, so we'll have those results immediately after the test. Once we have both sets of results, we can discuss the best course of treatment for you. In the meantime, it's important to stay hydrated, but avoid drinking large amounts of fluids right before bedtime to minimize nighttime trips to the bathroom. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I think that’s all for now, dear. You’ve explained everything so clearly. Thank you for being so patient with an old woman like me! I suppose I’ll go and… you know… do the pee test now? And then start trying these exercises. My husband will be happy I’m doing something about it!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. It was my pleasure. And you are not “just” an old woman – you’re a valued patient, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. Yes, please head to the restroom to provide the urine sample. The nurse will be right with you to perform the post-void residual volume test. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don't hesitate to ask. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon. .
