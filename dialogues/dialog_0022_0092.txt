DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Tosca, huh? Sounds…foreign. Anyways, I’m here 'cause I can’t…breathe right. Feels like sandpaper in my throat all the time, and my eyes feel like they’re gonna fall outta my head from being so dry. It’s been gettin’ worse, you know? Not sure why though. Old age, probably. Everything falls apart when you get old.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out, even if it is potentially just something related to age. "Tosca" is Ukrainian, yes – my family is from there. Now, sandpaper in your throat and dry eyes... how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Hmm… lemme think. A couple months, maybe? It started slow, just a little tickle, then BAM. Dry as a bone. Hard to say, really. I don’t keep track of these things. I used to work with… traffic lights. Didn’t need to remember dates then. Just make sure the red ones worked. Important job, you know? People gettin’ hurt and all. But yeah, a few months. Maybe longer. What difference does it make? It’s happening now.
DOCTOR: It makes a difference in helping me figure out what might be going on, Mr. Guilds. We want to rule out anything serious. So, a couple of months… has anything specifically made it worse – certain times of day, being indoors versus outdoors, specific activities?
PATIENT: Specific activities? Well, bein’ inside with the air conditionin’ on makes it worse. Dries everything right up! Always have to have a glass of water nearby. And…dust. Dust makes it bad, too. Used to clean the traffic lights, ya know? Lots of dust up there. Not a glamorous job, let me tell ya. But what's makin’ it worse… honestly? Just gettin' older. Everything's worse when you get older! I don't understand why I need to tell you all this. You're the doctor! You figure it out.
DOCTOR: You're right to a degree, Mr. Guilds, and I will figure it out. But the more information you give me, the easier it is to narrow down the possibilities. So, it sounds like air conditioning and dust exacerbate the problem. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the dry throat and eyes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… I get tired, easy. Real easy. Used to be able to work all day on a ladder, no problem. Now? I need a nap after a couple hours. And…sometimes, when I lie down, I gotta sit up 'cause I feel like… somethin's stuck in my throat. Not like chokin', just… uncomfortable. And my mouth feels all… sticky, even when I drink water. It doesn't stay wet, ya know? It’s annoying. Is that a symptom? Or just old age? Honestly, everything feels wrong these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, feeling like something is stuck in your throat when lying down, and a persistent dry mouth despite drinking fluids. Those are helpful things to know. Do you happen to have any nasal congestion, post-nasal drip, or a cough?
PATIENT: Nasal... what now? Sometimes my nose feels a little…stuffed up, yeah. Especially in the mornin’. And I do clear my throat a lot. Always have. My wife used to complain about it, God rest her soul. But it's not a cough. Just…clearin’ it. And I don't think I got… drips. No, no drips. Just a stuffy nose, sometimes. And clearin’ my throat. Always clearin’ my throat. Is this gettin’ anywhere? I feel like I'm tellin’ you my whole life story!
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Mr. Guilds. It is helpful to get the full picture. Okay, so occasional nasal congestion and frequent throat clearing. Now, let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else you’re being treated for?
PATIENT: Medical history… Well, I got Medicare, if that counts. Doc always told me I had a little bit of… somethin’ with the pressure. High somethin’. Always forgot the name. Gave me pills, though. Blue ones. Took ‘em for a while. Then I stopped. Didn't feel like I needed 'em anymore. And my knees are bad. Real bad. Arthritis, I think it's called. That's about it. Nothing fancy. Just old age, mostly. I don’t go to the doctor much. Waste of time, if you ask me. They just tell you to take more pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hypertension, potentially not currently managed, and arthritis. Let me just check something here... It looks like you were diagnosed with hypertension about ten years ago, and prescribed a medication, but it hasn't been refilled in several years. Any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. Never had any allergies. Maybe a little sniffle when the flowers bloom, but that's it. Can’t remember ever bein’ allergic to anything serious. No, no allergies. Just old age, like I said. And…dust. Dust bothers me. Does that count? But that’s not an allergy. It’s just…annoyin’. And don't go givin' me any of those fancy pills. I don't like pills. Make me feel worse. Just tell me what's wrong and let me get outta here, alright? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. No problem. Based on what you’ve told me, and reviewing your chart, your symptoms – dry throat, dry eyes, fatigue, post-nasal drip, and history of hypertension – suggest a few possibilities. One thing that comes to mind is Sjogren’s syndrome, which is an autoimmune condition that causes dryness of the eyes and mouth. It can also cause fatigue. Another possibility could be simply medication side effects, even from old medications, or just chronic dehydration. The fact that your symptoms are worse with air conditioning and dust is also noteworthy. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to listen to your lungs and check your mouth and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Auto…what now? Sounds complicated. And more pills, probably. Listen to my lungs? What's wrong with my lungs? I'm breathin’, aren't I? This is ridiculous. I came in here for a dry throat, not a whole body check-up. I don't need a "brief physical exam". I need somethin' to moisten my throat. Maybe a lozenge? Look, Doc, I appreciate you tryin' and all, but I'm an old man. I've lived a long life. I don’t need fancy diagnoses and complicated treatments. Just tell me it’s old age, give me a glass of water, and let me go home. Honestly. This whole thing is a waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I understand your frustration. I'm not trying to overwhelm you. I simply want to rule out anything serious. A quick listen to your lungs and a look in your throat takes only a moment, and could help me determine the best course of action. If everything sounds clear and your throat looks normal, then we can absolutely agree it's likely just related to age and dryness. We can discuss simple remedies, like hydration and a humidifier. I promise I won’t prescribe anything unless absolutely necessary. Would you at least allow me to do those two quick checks?
