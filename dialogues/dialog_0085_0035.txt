DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Lahn. It's lovely to meet you too. Oh, goodness, it's these hiccups. Been going on for… well, it feels like forever, honestly. Not painful, just… annoying! They come and go, but they’ve been pretty persistent the last couple of days.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent hiccups can be very bothersome. “Feels like forever” is helpful information – can you give me a rough estimate of how long they’ve been going on, maybe a few days, a week, longer?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started maybe last Tuesday? So, about a week, I suppose. But like I said, they weren’t constant at first. Just little bursts here and there. It's really since Wednesday they’ve been… well, a real nuisance. I tried drinking water upside down, like everyone says, but that didn’t do a thing!
DOCTOR: That’s a common remedy, yes, and it’s good you tried it. Drinking water upside down doesn’t always work, unfortunately. Okay, so about a week, becoming more persistent since Wednesday. And you said they aren't painful, just annoying. Are they interfering with anything – eating, sleeping, daily activities?
PATIENT: Well, eating is a bit tricky. Sometimes one comes on when I’m trying to swallow, and that’s… unpleasant. Not dangerous, just startling! And sleeping… oh, dear. They wake me up now and then. I wouldn’t say it’s terrible, but it’s definitely not helping me get a good night’s rest. I’m a bit tired, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. Interrupting eating and sleep is definitely bothersome. Alright. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, or anything that makes them worse or better?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… let me think. I don’t think anything specifically triggers them, not that I've noticed. I was having a bit of a chat with my daughter on the phone yesterday, and they started up then, but I chat with her all the time. And nothing seems to make them stop, really. Sometimes they just… go away on their own. I did have a rather large glass of fizzy lemonade the day before they started, now that I think about it. Could that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Mirriam. Fizzy drinks can sometimes contribute to hiccups. Okay, let’s talk a little bit more generally. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… no, not really. I’ve been feeling a bit… gassy, perhaps? But I’ve always been a bit prone to that, to be honest. Nothing out of the ordinary. No chest pain, no trouble breathing, no heartburn… everything else feels pretty normal. Oh! Except maybe a little bit of fatigue, like I mentioned with the sleep. But I just put that down to getting older, you know?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. Fatigue is good to mention, and it's perfectly reasonable to attribute some of that to age, but we should still consider it. Now, let's go over a little bit of your medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. I had my gallbladder out years and years ago, must be… oh, goodness, thirty years now? And I have a touch of arthritis in my knees, but it's well-managed with some cream and gentle exercise. Otherwise… no, not really. I used to be a very active swimmer, but I haven't been in the water for a while. My doctor always said I had a strong heart, thankfully. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fish and vegetables.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, and arthritis in the knees, well-managed. That’s good to know. And a history of being a strong heart is excellent. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let's see… just a little bit of paracetamol sometimes for the arthritis, when it flares up. And a multivitamin, just a general one, you know, to keep me going. Oh, and I take a little bit of fish oil for my joints, too. That's about it, really. Nothing fancy. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Paracetamol as needed, multivitamin, and fish oil. And you're careful about medication, which is sensible. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of! I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard. I’ve had a few mosquito bites, of course, but that’s about it. My daughter always asks me if I’m allergic to anything before I try a new food, bless her heart. She’s very cautious. But no, I can’t think of anything I’m allergic to.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No known allergies. Alright, Mirriam, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and just feel your abdomen. Nothing major, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything sounds clear in your lungs. Your heart rate is regular and there are no murmurs. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness or masses. I do notice a bit of mild fullness, but that could be related to the gas you mentioned. I’m also noting your blood pressure and temperature. Blood pressure is 138/82, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like your hiccups are likely benign – meaning not caused by anything serious. Given the timing, the fizzy drink might have contributed, and the mild fullness in your abdomen could be related to gas. However, because they’ve been persistent for a week, I would like to order a basic blood test just to rule out anything else. It’ll check your electrolytes and kidney function, just as a precaution.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A blood test is no trouble at all. I’m glad you’re being thorough. I don't want to be a bother, but it is rather annoying having these hiccups all the time. So, if you think it’s worth checking, I’m happy to. Will I need to fast for the test? And where do I go to have that done?
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Mirriam. It’s my job to investigate these things. And yes, I do recommend a fasting blood test. That means nothing to eat or drink – not even water – for about 8-12 hours before the test. We’ll give you a specific time window. You can go to the lab just down the hall, room 203. The lab technician will give you instructions on how to prepare. I'll write you a requisition form now. In the meantime, I’ll also recommend continuing to avoid fizzy drinks and large meals. If the hiccups worsen significantly—meaning they become very frequent, painful, or interfere with your breathing—please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all very clear, Doctor. Fast for 8-12 hours, go to room 203, avoid fizzy drinks and big meals… and come back if they get really bad. I can manage all of that. Thank you so much for taking the time to listen and for being so thorough. It puts my mind at ease knowing you’re taking it seriously. Now, where is this requisition form? I'm ready to go get this blood test done.
DOCTOR: Here you go. It has all the details on it. And you're very welcome, Mirriam. I'm glad I could help. Just take this to the lab, and they’ll take care of it from there. They’ll let me know the results as soon as they’re available, usually within a day or two. I'll give you a call as soon as I have them, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, try to relax and don’t worry too much. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s a card with the clinic number. And again, thank you for coming in today. .
PATIENT: That's very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you for everything. I will definitely call if I have any questions. And I will try to relax, though that’s easier said than done with these hiccups! Have a lovely day, Doctor Lahn. And thank you again.
