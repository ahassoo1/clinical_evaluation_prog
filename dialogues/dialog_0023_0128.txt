DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good morning to you too. Hmm… what does bring me in… it’s my joints, I think. They just… ache a bit in the mornings. And feel stiff, you know? It’s not… terrible, but it’s annoying. I don't really remember when it started, to be honest. It's just… been happening.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Joint aches, mornings, stiffness…” Can you be a bit more specific about which joints are bothering you, Ms. Voner?
PATIENT: Oh… which ones… My hands, mostly. And my knees, I guess. They’re not always bad, just when I first get up. It’s like… they need to be oiled or something. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: “Hands and knees, morning stiffness… requiring ‘oiling’…” And how long does this stiffness typically last when you first get up?
PATIENT: Oh… how long… Not very long, I don’t think. Maybe… half an hour? Sometimes less? I usually have a cup of coffee and move around, and it gets better. I don’t sit still for long, if that helps. It’s not a bad pain, just… uncomfortable. I don't really keep track of time, to be honest. It's just… how it feels.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, morning stiffness in the hands and knees, resolving within half an hour, improved with movement and caffeine… Have you noticed any swelling or redness in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmmm… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. My hands are a little… puffy sometimes, but I just figured that was… age? I don’t really know. And no redness, not that I remember. I don’t really look at my hands that closely, you know? Sorry, I'm not much help. It’s just a bit of ache, really.
DOCTOR: Ms. Voner, do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmmm… let me see. I get tired easily, maybe? But everyone does, right? And… oh! My back sometimes aches, but I think that's from bending over with the little ones at work. I don't know... nothing major. I haven't been feeling sick, or anything like that. Just… old. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue, back pain attributed to work. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever or chills…? No, not that I know of. I don’t usually take my temperature. And weight loss… Well, I haven’t been trying to lose weight, if that’s what you mean. Maybe a little? But I haven’t really been keeping track. It’s hard to say. I eat okay, I think. I love to cook for the kids at work! Does that count? I don’t really feel sick, if that makes sense. Just… tired.
DOCTOR: And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical… Oh dear. That's… a hard one. I’ve been to doctors before, of course, but I don't really remember what they said. My husband… he used to take care of all that. It was a long time ago. I think I had… the usual things? A cold now and then? Nothing serious. I don’t have any big illnesses, I don't think. I really don’t know, Doctor. Sorry. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Hmm… I think I had my tonsils out when I was little? That's all I can really remember. And… maybe my appendix? But that was so long ago. I don't really recall being in the hospital for anything else. Just… the usual things. A little sick sometimes. Nothing major. It was a long, long time ago, Doctor. I haven’t been feeling well enough to be in the hospital recently, thank goodness!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history…? Oh… that’s tricky. My mother… she had arthritis, I think. In her hands, mostly. And my father… he had heart trouble, I believe. But that was a long time ago. And I had… a sister, but she passed away when she was young. I don't really remember what she was sick with. It’s all a bit… blurry, Doctor. Everyone gets something, I suppose. It's hard to keep track, especially when you get older.
DOCTOR: Ms. Voner, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, not really. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache. A little white pill. I don’t remember the name. And… sometimes I take a vitamin, but I’m out of it right now. Nothing regularly, you know? I don’t like taking a lot of pills. I prefer to just… rest when I’m not feeling well. I'm not much of a medication person, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmmm… not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. Sometimes I get a little itchy, but that's probably just the dust. Or the cats at work. I don't really think I'm allergic to anything. I eat everything, you know? I love to cook, and you need all sorts of ingredients for that! I don't think I have any serious allergies, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's perform a quick physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your joints.
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Lie down, you say…? Alright. It’s been a while since I did this… Is it going to hurt? I’m a bit creaky, you know.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't hurt, Ms. Voner. I’m just going to feel around your joints and check your range of motion. First, let's start with your hands. Can you make a fist for me?
PATIENT: Oh… that's a little tender. There we go… It’s a bit stiff, you know? It feels… crunchy. Is that normal? I don't usually do this, so it feels strange.
DOCTOR: There's mild tenderness to palpation in the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints bilaterally. Range of motion is slightly limited, with crepitus noted. No visible swelling or redness. Now, can you open and close your hands for me, as quickly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a bit uncomfortable. It feels… tight. Like I haven't used them in a while. I’m afraid I’m not very flexible, Doctor. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s examine your knees now. Please bend your knees one at a time. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Oh… that's a bit uncomfortable. Not terrible, but… it's not smooth, you know? It feels a bit… rough. It’s the same on this side. It’s not sharp pain, just… a bit of ache. I used to be able to bend these much easier. Is it arthritis, Doctor?
DOCTOR: There's mild tenderness to palpation of both knees. Range of motion is slightly limited, with crepitus noted. No visible swelling or effusion. Alright. Based on the physical exam, you have tenderness and limited range of motion in several joints, accompanied by crepitus. It's difficult to determine the exact cause without further investigation. We’ll need to consider some blood tests to rule out other possibilities. We’ll also need to get some x-rays to get a clearer picture of the joints. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and x-rays…? Oh dear. Is it… something serious, Doctor? I don’t like needles, and I haven’t had an x-ray in years. Is it arthritis, like I thought? What does that even mean? I just want my hands and knees to stop aching, you know? Is it going to hurt a lot? I'm a bit scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Ms. Voner, try not to worry. Blood tests and x-rays will simply help us understand what's going on. They don't necessarily mean it's something serious. Arthritis is a possibility, but there are many different types, and not all of them are severe. The blood tests will help us rule out other conditions, like infections or autoimmune diseases. And the x-rays will show us if there's any damage to the joints. The blood test will involve a small needle prick, and the x-ray is painless. It's a quick procedure. We'll get the results back in a few days, and then we can discuss the best course of action. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. So… it’s not definitely arthritis, then? And the needle prick… how big of a needle? I really don't like needles. And how long will it take to get the results? I have to go back to work soon, and I don’t want to be away for too long. And… will it hurt afterwards? I’m just… a little worried, you know? Will I feel sick afterwards?
DOCTOR: Ms. Voner, I understand your concerns. The needle is quite small, about the size of a pinprick. It's a quick procedure, and most people don't even feel it. There may be a slight pinch, but it's very brief. As for feeling sick afterwards, it’s rare. Some people experience a little soreness at the injection site, but that usually goes away within a day or two. The blood test will take about 15-20 minutes, and the x-ray will only take a few minutes. It will take a few days to get the results back, perhaps 3-5 business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they're available. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye…? Oh dear. I don’t think so. I've never had any dye before, as far as I remember. I don't really know what it is. Is it something they put in your veins? I'm a bit afraid of things going in my veins. Does that make sense? I just want to get this over with, but I'm a little scared, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner. We won't be using any contrast dye for your x-rays today. It's not necessary for the type of images we need. I'll have my nurse draw some blood for the tests. She will explain the procedure to you in detail. We'll then take the x-rays, and you'll be finished. Do you have any questions about the tests before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Just… will it take long? And… will it hurt afterwards? I really don't want to be in pain. And… what if it is arthritis? What happens then? Will I… will I be able to keep working? I really need to keep working, you know?
DOCTOR: Ms. Voner, let’s take things one step at a time. The blood draw and x-rays will take approximately 30 minutes in total. You may experience some minor soreness at the injection site after the blood draw, but it should subside within a day or two. As for arthritis, there are many different types, and the treatment options vary depending on the specific diagnosis. Some types can be managed with medication and physical therapy, allowing you to continue working. However, it's too early to say anything definitively until we have the test results. Right now, let’s focus on getting the tests done. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’ll take good care of you. Do you have any other concerns before she arrives?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… please tell her to be gentle? I really don't like needles. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. I’m just a little scared, you know? I haven’t felt this anxious in a long time.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll let her know to be gentle. I’ll leave you to it then. The nurse will be in shortly. If you need anything, don't hesitate to call.
PATIENT: .
