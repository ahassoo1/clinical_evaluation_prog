DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It’s been happening for a little while now. Not a lot at a time, but… it feels like there's always some left in there, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Trouble completely emptying your bladder, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Completely. It’s… uncomfortable. And sometimes, after I try and try, it just… drips a little bit for a while afterwards. It’s more of a bother than anything, but it's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how long exactly has this “little while” been?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… maybe three, four months ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little slower. But it’s gotten worse over the last month or so, I’d say. It's hard to keep track, truthfully. Time just… slips away, you know? Especially now… without my wife.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said it’s gotten worse over the last month. Can you describe how it’s changed?
PATIENT: Well… I have to go to the bathroom more often, for one. Even when I don't feel like I really need to. And… it takes longer. I have to sit there and… push a little bit more to get everything out. And like I said, the dripping afterwards happens more now too. It used to be just once in a while, but now it's most times.
DOCTOR: Are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain or burning. It doesn’t hurt. That’s why I waited so long to come in. It's just… frustrating, and a little embarrassing. It doesn’t feel right, you know? But no pain. Definitely no pain.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you noticing any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the… water? Well… I haven't really been looking, Doctor. I just go. I haven’t noticed any blood or anything like that. It looks… normal, I guess. As normal as water looks. I’m sorry, I don't know if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Hilber. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I had my prostate checked a few years back. They said it was… a little big, but nothing to worry about at the time. And I have a little bit of trouble with my blood pressure, but I take a pill for that every day. Other than that… I was always pretty healthy. Before… before my wife passed.
DOCTOR: Alright, so enlarged prostate a few years ago, and you’re currently taking medication for high blood pressure. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Names… I’m terrible with names. Let me see… It’s a little white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. I could… I could try to find the bottle later, if you like? I don't want to tell you the wrong thing. It starts with an 'A', I think. But I’m really not sure. Sorry, Doctor. It's hard to keep everything straight.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Hilber. Don't worry about it. We can look it up. Now, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. My wife always said I was lucky that way. She used to say I could eat anything. I think I’m just allergic to being alone now. But that’s not a medical allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Right. No known drug allergies. And do you smoke, or drink alcohol, Mr. Hilber?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t smoke. Never have. My wife… she didn’t like it. And I don't drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but that’s it. Not much of a drinker, never was. Not since… well, it's been a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I want to get this figured out. I trust your judgment. Just… tell me if anything is going to be… uncomfortable. I’m not a young man anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll start with your abdomen, then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll need to do a digital rectal exam to check your prostate. It will be a bit uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Please let me know if you experience any pain. If you could lie down on the table, please.
PATIENT: Oh. A… a rectal exam? I see. Yes. Right. I… I wasn't expecting that. But… if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes. Let's get it done. Just… please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. Just relax as much as you can. I'm going to apply some lubricant, and then gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. It will allow me to assess the size and consistency of your prostate. I will let you know what I'm feeling as I go. So, how long have you lived in this area?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Right. Rural Alaska, Doctor. All my life, pretty much. My family’s been here for generations. It’s… a good life, but it’s quiet. Very quiet, now. Used to be livelier, with my wife. We did a lot of fishing, a lot of hunting. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Hmm… Okay. I’m feeling some enlargement here, as we discussed. The texture feels… slightly firm, but no distinct nodules that are immediately concerning. There doesn’t seem to be any tenderness to the touch. Your rectal walls feel normal. Okay, that's all for now. We’ll get these results to the lab, and I’d like to order a urine sample as well, just to rule out any infection.
PATIENT: Oh. Good. That wasn't… terrible. Thank you, Doctor. A urine sample, you say? Yes, I can do that. Where would I… give that to you? I just hope it's nothing serious. It's hard enough dealing with all this alone.
DOCTOR: There’s a bathroom just over there. There are sterile cups inside. Just collect a mid-stream sample – that means you start urinating, then collect the sample mid-stream. And please try not to touch the inside of the cup. While we wait for the results, and given your history, it’s possible this is benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH – an enlarged prostate. It’s common as men get older. But we need to rule out other things first. We'll discuss treatment options if that’s the case. For now, try not to worry. We’re doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: BPH… That sounds… complicated. An enlarged prostate… that’s what you thought it might be? Yes, I can collect a sample. A mid-stream sample, you said. Right. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining things to me. It’s… reassuring to know what we’re looking at. Hopefully, it is just that. I’ll be right back.
