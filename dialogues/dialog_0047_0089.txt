DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, my… it’s lovely to meet you. Well, it’s… this pain. It’s been coming and going, lower down, you see. Quite severe when it does come. I believe it has something to do with… the lupus? I was diagnosed years ago, though truthfully, the details are a little… hazy now. It's been a while.
DOCTOR: Lupus, right. And you say this pain is lower down… can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yes. Specific. It’s… down here, in my belly. Not exactly high up, more… around my lower parts. It feels… crampy, sometimes. And other times, it’s more of a deep ache. It’s difficult to explain, I’m afraid. It comes and goes in waves, you see. Not constant, thankfully. Do you… understand?
DOCTOR: Waves, alright. And how long have you been experiencing these waves of pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky question. It feels like… weeks, perhaps? Months? Time… it does seem to slip away. I noticed it getting worse recently, though. That's what prompted me to finally make an appointment. I've been trying to manage it myself for a bit, you understand. With… things. But it's become more frequent, and a little more intense. I just want to be sure it’s nothing… serious.
DOCTOR: "Things," alright. And when you say "more intense," can you give me an idea of a pain scale, one to ten?
PATIENT: Oh, a scale! Yes. Well, when it's mild, it's perhaps a… two or three. Just a dull ache, really. But when it flares up… It can get to be a seven or eight, I suppose. It makes it difficult to… move, you see. And I do have a rather low tolerance for discomfort, I must admit. It’s not constant at that level, thankfully, just… when it comes. Do you… need more detail? I'm not very good at explaining these things, I fear.
DOCTOR: A seven or eight. Alright. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, um… symptoms. Let me think. Well, I’ve been rather tired lately, more than usual. And I've had some… digestive troubles, you see. A bit of bloating, and… irregular bowel movements. Nothing terribly dramatic, but noticeable. And… I seem to be bruising rather easily, more than I used to. That's… a little worrying, I suppose. But I tend to be a bit clumsy, so it’s hard to say. Do you… want me to keep going?
DOCTOR: Tiredness, digestive issues, easy bruising… Let’s talk about your lupus for a moment. Do you recall which organs were affected when you were originally diagnosed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That was… quite some time ago. The details are… fuzzy, I’m afraid. I remember the doctor saying it was affecting my… joints, mostly. And something about my kidneys? Perhaps my skin, too. But I honestly don’t recall the specifics. I was quite young, you see, and… overwhelmed. I’ve been under a specialist’s care for years, but they moved away a while back and… I haven't been as diligent about follow-ups as I should be, I confess. It’s all a bit… muddled, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for your lupus, or any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh yes, medications. Let me see… I have a list somewhere… ah, here we are. I’m taking… hydroxychloroquine, that’s for the lupus, I believe. And… a low dose of aspirin, for… general health. And occasionally, ibuprofen when my joints are particularly troublesome. That's about it, I think. Though I did try a new arthritis cream last week, but it didn’t seem to help much. Do you… need the exact dosages? I have them written down somewhere else, probably.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen occasionally… and you said easy bruising?
PATIENT: Oh yes, the bruising. It’s not terribly severe, usually just little marks like this. But it happens more frequently than it used to. And… it takes longer for them to heal, I think. And the ibuprofen… well, it’s just when my joints flare up. I try not to take it often, you see. I know it’s not ideal, with… everything. Is that… a problem? Is that why you're asking?
DOCTOR: It can be. We need to rule a few things out. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. A physical exam… Yes, that sounds… sensible. I just hope I'm not too… awkward. It's been a while since I've had one. Do you… need me to remove anything?
DOCTOR: No, that won’t be necessary. Just lie flat on your back, and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and gently press on your abdomen. Just tell me if anything feels particularly tender.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Flat on my back… Yes. Just let me know if you need me to move… or do anything. I'll try to be very still. This is… quite cold, isn’t it? But I suppose that’s to be expected. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Where does it hurt the most?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. It's… here. Lower down, on the right side. Not too bad at first, but… it’s definitely more tender there. A little bit… sharp, perhaps? Not a constant pain, but… it's noticeable. Right about here. Is that… normal? It does seem a little different than usual, this time. It's a little hard to explain… it’s not just cramps, it’s more of a… focused pain. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: A little tenderness on the right, alright. And anything on this side?
PATIENT: Oh, um… On this side… it’s not as bad. A little bit uncomfortable, perhaps, but not the same sharp pain. More of a dull ache, if anything. It’s… harder to pinpoint, really. It’s just… generally uncomfortable down there. It’s all a bit… muddled, I’m afraid. Do you… want me to be more specific? I’m not very good at describing these things, you see. It’s just… a general feeling of unease.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history of lupus, the tenderness on the right side, and the easy bruising… I'm going to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an inflammatory marker. I also want to rule out anything more serious. I'm going to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast. It’s important to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh… a CT scan? Contrast dye… let me think. I don’t think so, but it’s been quite some time since I’ve had one. I believe I had one years ago, with… no ill effects, but my memory… it’s not what it used to be. I might be allergic to shellfish, though. Is that… relevant? I haven't eaten shellfish in years, to be safe. Is the CT scan… necessary? It sounds… rather involved. And I do worry about radiation, you see. Is there… another way?
DOCTOR: Shellfish allergy is important, yes. We’ll use a non-iodinated contrast if necessary. And the radiation exposure is minimal, and the benefit of ruling out more serious conditions outweighs the risk in this case, given your symptoms and history. I understand your concerns, but we need to investigate this thoroughly. I’m also going to need a urine sample. Can you please collect one before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A urine sample… yes, I can do that. And the non-iodinated contrast… that’s… reassuring, at least. I do trust your judgment, Doctor. It’s just… a lot to take in, you see. A CT scan, blood work… it all sounds rather serious. Will the blood work and CT scan take long? I have a… an appointment next week that I wouldn't want to miss. It's just… a social gathering, but… When can I expect the results?
DOCTOR: The lab work should be back within 24 to 48 hours. The CT scan… it depends on their scheduling, but I'll have the radiology department contact you directly to schedule an appointment. I'll also have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they're available. We’ll need to schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results, to discuss them in detail. I’m going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever in the meantime – naproxen 500mg twice daily. Try to take it with food. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, chills, or vomiting, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh… naproxen… alright. Emergency room… yes, I understand. I… I don't think I do, actually. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Though… perhaps one question. What exactly are you… looking for? With the CT scan and the blood work? Is there anything specific you’re concerned about? I know you said you're ruling things out, but… it would put my mind at ease to know a little more. If you don’t mind, of course. It's probably a silly question.
DOCTOR: It’s not a silly question at all. Given your symptoms, we need to rule out a few possibilities. I want to check for any inflammation in your abdomen, assess your kidneys and liver, and look for any signs of infection or blockage. In someone with a lupus history, we also need to consider the possibility of serositis - inflammation of the lining of the abdomen. And, though it's less likely, we have to rule out appendicitis or any other acute abdominal issue. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and look for any signs of infection or inflammation. The CT scan gives us a more detailed picture. It’s a precautionary measure, Ms. Glymph. We're just being thorough. Do you feel any better understanding that?
