DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaxston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… headaches, mostly. Really bad ones. They come and go, and when they do come… well, I get really sweaty and my heart races a bit. It's… hard to explain exactly when they started, honestly. It feels like it's been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches. And you mentioned they're accompanied by sweating and a racing heart. That's helpful to know. When you say "a while," could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… hmm. Maybe… six months? Or was it closer to a year? It's… blurry, to be honest. They weren't constant at first, just now and then. But they’ve been happening more often lately, I guess. I don't really keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to not keep precise track. More frequent recently is good information. Can you describe the headaches themselves?
PATIENT: Right, the headaches… They're… throbbing, mostly. Usually on both sides of my head, but sometimes just one side. Feels like a really tight band squeezing, if that makes sense? And bright lights… they really bother me when I have one. Everything just feels… worse, you know? It's hard to describe. Definitely not a dull ache. More… intense.
DOCTOR: Okay, throbbing, both sides – sometimes one side – tight band sensation, worsened by bright lights, and you’d describe them as intense. Do you notice anything that triggers them, or seems to make them worse besides the lights?
PATIENT: Triggers… Not really, not that I've noticed. I mean, sometimes they just… happen. Stress, maybe? Work's been a bit hectic lately, but honestly, work's always hectic. I drink coffee, but I've always drunk coffee, and that hasn't changed. I haven't been eating anything different, or sleeping any less… I think. It’s all a bit of a blur, like I said. I really can't pinpoint anything specific.
DOCTOR: Alright, no clear triggers identified. Stress is a possibility, but that’s not new for you. Let's talk about other symptoms. Besides the headache, sweating, and racing heart, have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances – like seeing spots or flashing lights – dizziness, or any weakness or numbness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Nausea… sometimes, yeah. Not like throwing-up nausea, just… feeling queasy. And… I think I’ve been a little dizzy a couple of times when one of these headaches hits. Like, when I stand up too fast. Visual disturbances… no, I don't think so. Nothing like seeing spots or anything. Weakness or numbness… definitely not. Just… generally feeling awful when the headache’s on. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, nausea and dizziness with the headaches, but no visual changes or weakness. Have you had headaches like this before, or is this a new type of headache for you?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I used to get headaches, yeah. But they weren’t… like this. These ones are… much worse. More intense, and with the sweating and heart racing. The old ones were just… a dull ache, I could usually just take a couple of painkillers and they’d go away. These… I can’t just ignore them. They really knock me out. It feels different, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, a change in your headache pattern. That's important to note. Now, let's go through some general health questions. Do you have any past medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven’t really been to the doctor much, to be honest. Just the usual check-ups when I was a kid. Nothing major ever came up. My divorce was… stressful, but not exactly a medical condition, right? I don’t take any regular medications. And no allergies that I’m aware of. I haven’t been in hospital for anything. Is that… enough? I'm not sure what you need to know.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Jaxston. It's helpful to know you haven't had any significant medical history. And no, your divorce isn't a medical condition, although I understand it was stressful. Let’s move on to family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have a history of migraines, high blood pressure, heart disease, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: My… dad had high blood pressure, I think. He was always a bit grumpy, so he went to the doctor a lot. My mum… she had headaches sometimes, but not like these. Just normal headaches. And my granddad… he had something with his heart, I think. It was a long time ago, I don't really remember the details. We weren't very close. No one else, not that I’m aware of. My sister's pretty healthy, as far as I know. We don’t really talk much. Does that help? I'm trying my best to remember, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. A family history of high blood pressure and a possible heart condition. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No smoking. I used to drink… a bit. But not much anymore. Maybe a couple of beers a month, if that. And definitely no drugs. Never been my thing. I work pretty long hours, so I don’t really have much time for anything like that, to be honest. Mostly just… work and sleep. And trying to avoid these headaches, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your reflexes and coordination. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just… try not to take too long, if that's alright. I’ve got work later. But yeah, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Please relax your arm. Alright, your blood pressure is 145/90, and your pulse is 88. Your reflexes are normal, and your cranial nerves appear intact. Your coordination is also good. I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I'm palpating your neck now to check for any tenderness or enlarged lymph nodes. No tenderness or enlarged lymph nodes noted. Everything feels within normal limits. Based on what you've told me and the findings of the exam, the headaches you're experiencing, along with the sweating, racing heart, and nausea, could indicate a few possibilities, including tension headaches, cluster headaches, or potentially migraines. Given your blood pressure reading is slightly elevated, we also need to rule out secondary causes. Do you have any sensitivities to light or sound currently?
PATIENT: Light… yeah, actually. It is bothering me a bit today. Brighter than usual, maybe? And… sound too, I suppose. Not like screaming, but loud noises definitely aren’t helping. I usually don't notice things like that, to be honest. It's probably just the headache. The whole thing is… pretty awful, really. What does "secondary causes" mean? I don’t want anything… serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensitivity to light and sound supports the possibility of a migraine. “Secondary causes” refers to headaches that are caused by another underlying medical condition – something besides a primary headache disorder like tension headache or migraine. It could be anything from sinus infection to, rarely, something more serious like a brain tumor. However, given your age, symptoms and the physical exam findings, it’s much more likely this is a primary headache. To be thorough, I recommend a few tests. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for infection, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test to check your thyroid function. We'll also order an EKG to check your heart rhythm, just to be safe given your slightly elevated blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A brain tumor…? Oh. Right. Okay. Tests… yeah, okay. Tests are good. That… sounds sensible. A CBC, BMP, TSH… and an EKG. Yeah, whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… try not to take too long to get the results, if that’s alright? I really need to know what's going on. And… what happens if it is something serious? I don't want to freak out, but… I need to be prepared.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jaxston, and it’s good that you’re asking these questions. The chance of a brain tumor is very low, but we need to rule it out to give you peace of mind. The tests are relatively simple and will give us a lot of information. If the tests did reveal something serious, we would discuss the results in detail and refer you to a specialist – a neurologist or neurosurgeon – for further evaluation and treatment. We would go through all your options and make a plan together. But, again, it’s very unlikely that’s what’s going on. For now, let's focus on getting the tests done. I'll write you a requisition for the lab and the EKG. The lab should be able to draw your blood today, and you can schedule the EKG at your convenience. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a treatment plan. In the meantime, I can recommend some over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help manage your headache symptoms. Would you like a prescription for those?
PATIENT: Okay. Right. Ibuprofen or naproxen… yeah, that would be good. Anything to help. A prescription… that sounds sensible. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything, and… for not dismissing it. It's… a relief, honestly. I'll get the tests done as soon as I can. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment when I have the results. I… I think that's everything for now? I'm just a bit overwhelmed, to be honest.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaxston. It’s my job to listen and help you figure things out. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. I’ll write you the prescription for ibuprofen. It's important to follow the dosage instructions carefully. And please, don't hesitate to call the clinic if your symptoms worsen or if you develop any new symptoms while waiting for the test results. Here’s the requisition for the lab and the prescription. I’ll also give you a handout with information about headaches and migraine, including when to seek immediate medical attention. I’m confident we’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care of yourself, Jaxston, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. .
