DOCTOR: Good morning, Chelise. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a little high. Hyper… something? They called it hyperlipidemia. It’s a bit of a mouthful. I just wanted to get it checked out, you know, make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, hyperlipidemia – that just means you have higher than optimal cholesterol levels. It’s very common, and good that you're getting it checked out. We can definitely take a look at that. To start, can you tell me a little bit more about how you found out about this?
PATIENT: Well, I had my yearly check-up with my primary care doctor, Dr. Van Derlyn, back in June. Routine blood work, you know? She said everything looked fine, but then I got this letter a couple of weeks ago saying my numbers weren’t quite right. She just said to follow up with someone about it… and my insurance suggested coming here. It was all a bit fast, honestly. I don't usually have trouble with my health, so it was a bit of a surprise.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So Dr. Van Derlyn noticed something in June, and then this letter came as a follow-up. It’s good you’re proactive about this, Chelise. I see you’ve had a recent check-up, which is excellent. Do you happen to have a copy of the lab results with you, or do you remember what specific numbers were high?
PATIENT: Let me see… yes, here it is. The letter has some numbers on it. Okay, it says my total cholesterol is 240. And… LDL is 160. HDL is 45, and triglycerides are 180. I don't really know what all that means, to be honest. Just that they weren’t where they should be. I can read numbers just fine, but interpreting them? That’s another story.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Yes, those numbers do indicate elevated cholesterol. Your total cholesterol is above the optimal range, and your LDL – that's the "bad" cholesterol – is also high. Your HDL is a little on the lower side, but not critically low. And your triglycerides are borderline elevated. To get a better understanding of what’s going on and determine the best course of action, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your lifestyle and health history. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Ask away. I'll do my best to answer. I’m a pretty open book, Doctor. I’m usually very healthy, but maybe I’ve let things slide a little bit lately. I'm just hoping it's not too serious.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Chelise. And it's great you’re aware of any recent changes. Let's start with your diet. Can you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… a typical day. Well, for breakfast I usually have oatmeal with some fruit… blueberries, usually. And a little bit of honey. Lunch is often a sandwich… turkey or ham on whole wheat bread. Sometimes I have a salad with grilled chicken. And dinner… well, that varies. I try to cook at home most nights. I like fish, so I have that maybe two or three times a week. Sometimes pasta… or chicken and vegetables. I do enjoy a little bit of cheese with my meals, if I’m being honest. And… I have a sweet tooth. I like a small piece of chocolate after dinner. Nothing huge, but… yeah. I'm not a big soda drinker, though. Mostly water or tea.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a fairly healthy diet overall, Chelise. The oatmeal, fruit, and fish are excellent. A little bit of chocolate is perfectly fine. It’s good you’re not a soda drinker. Now, what about exercise?
PATIENT: That’s… where things get a bit tricky. I used to walk a lot. I live near the park, so I'd walk there most days. But… I’ve been a bit busy with work lately. And the weather hasn't been the best. So… I haven't been as active as I should be. Maybe… twice a week, if I’m lucky. It’s not a long walk, just around the neighborhood. I really need to get back into a better routine, I know. It's just hard sometimes, you know? After a long day, it's easy to just relax.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. Life gets in the way, and it’s easy to let things slide. Twice a week is a start, but ideally, we'd aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had high cholesterol, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My father… he had high blood pressure. He took medication for it for many years. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had a stroke about ten years ago. I don’t know if it was related to cholesterol, though. No one else that I know of… not that I’m aware of, anyway. We don’t talk about health much in my family. It's a bit of a taboo subject. So, I don’t have a lot of information. But my father’s high blood pressure… that’s the only thing I’m sure of.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Your father's high blood pressure and your aunt’s stroke are relevant. Even without a detailed family history, we can still work with this information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or any medical conditions other than what we've already discussed?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. And no other medical conditions. Just the occasional headache, but nothing serious. I'm generally a very healthy person, Doctor. I really haven't had much trouble with my health until this cholesterol thing came up. I'm a bit worried, to be honest. It's just… not something I've ever dealt with before. I prefer to avoid medication if possible, you know? I like to keep things natural, if I can. But I'm willing to do whatever is best for my health.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Chelise. It’s good you're generally healthy and prefer a natural approach. Avoiding medication when possible is a reasonable goal. Let's see what we can do. Before we discuss potential treatment options, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I’m not a fan of doctor’s visits, but I trust your judgment. I've heard good things about you from a friend, Mrs. De Vries. She said you’re very thorough and take good care of your patients. So, I’m in good hands, I hope.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that's very kind of Mrs. De Vries to say. I appreciate that. I always aim to provide the best possible care. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Can you please sit back and relax, and keep your arm still?
PATIENT: Okay, I’m ready. This is always the part I dread. My blood pressure always goes up when I'm at the doctor's office! It's the white coat syndrome, I think. I get a little bit anxious, even though I know I shouldn't.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 140/90. As you suspected, it’s likely the white coat effect. We'll keep that in mind. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No unusual sounds detected. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. Everything sounds normal, which is good. Based on your history, lifestyle, and the exam, it seems we’re dealing with elevated cholesterol and borderline elevated triglycerides. Your blood pressure is a little high, but likely due to anxiety.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… reassuring. Well, as much as I can be reassured with high cholesterol numbers, anyway. So, what does this all mean, Doctor? What are my options? Do I need medication? I’m really hoping we can try some lifestyle changes first. I’m willing to work hard, I just need a plan. And… maybe something to help with the anxiety. It’s not usually this bad, but this whole thing is a bit stressful.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Chelise. And yes, let’s focus on lifestyle changes first. Medication isn’t necessarily the first step, especially since you’re motivated to make changes. Your elevated cholesterol increases your risk of heart disease and stroke, but it’s not an immediate crisis. Lifestyle changes can significantly lower your numbers and reduce that risk. Here’s what I recommend: Diet: Focus on a heart-healthy diet low in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium. Increase your intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein , and healthy fats like olive oil. Reduce red meat, processed foods, and sugary drinks. Exercise: Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Walking, swimming, cycling – anything that gets your heart rate up. Weight Management: If you’re overweight, losing even a small amount of weight can help lower your cholesterol. Stress Management: Since you mentioned anxiety, incorporating stress-reducing techniques like deep breathing exercises, yoga, or meditation can be helpful. We can start with these changes and recheck your cholesterol levels in three months. If your numbers haven’t improved sufficiently, we can discuss medication options at that time. To help with the anxiety, I can provide some resources for stress management techniques or, if it continues to be a problem, we can consider a referral to a therapist. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very reasonable. It’s a lot, but it’s doable. I can definitely focus on the diet and exercise. I enjoy cooking, so I think I can manage the heart-healthy eating. And I do like walking, so I’ll try to get back into a regular routine. The stress management is a good idea too. I do tend to worry a lot. Would it be helpful if I kept a food diary and exercise log? I’m a bit of an organized person, so maybe that would keep me on track. And… what kind of resources do you have for stress management? Anything online? I prefer to do things at my own pace.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Chelise. Being organized is a huge advantage. Yes, a food diary and exercise log are a fantastic idea. They can help you track your progress and identify areas for improvement. I have some templates I can print out for you, or there are many apps available for smartphones that can help with that too. For stress management, I have a few brochures on relaxation techniques. And yes, there are some excellent online resources. The American Heart Association website has some good articles and videos on stress management and mindfulness. The website is heart.org. There are also several free guided meditation apps available, like Headspace and Calm. I also want to address your blood pressure. While it was elevated at the visit, it's likely due to anxiety. However, it's still important to monitor it at home. I can provide you with a blood pressure cuff and instructions on how to use it. Keep a log of your readings and bring it with you to your next appointment. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment for three months from today, August 2, 2025. That will give you time to implement these changes and see how they affect your cholesterol levels. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, three months from today sounds perfect. August 2nd. I’ll mark it in my calendar right away. And yes, a blood pressure cuff would be great. I feel better knowing I can monitor it at home. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I still feel a bit overwhelmed, but I feel like I have a plan now. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I’ll definitely keep the food diary and exercise log, and I’ll check out those online resources. And I’ll monitor my blood pressure. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any foods I should absolutely avoid? Or any exercises I should steer clear of? I just want to make sure I'm doing everything right.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chelise. I’m glad I could help. You’re already on the right track by being proactive and motivated. As for foods to avoid, focus on limiting saturated and trans fats, which are found in red meat, processed foods, fried foods, and some dairy products. Read food labels carefully and choose lean protein sources like fish, poultry , and beans. Sugary drinks and excessive alcohol should also be limited. As for exercise, start slowly and gradually increase your intensity and duration. If you have any underlying health conditions, it’s always a good idea to check with me before starting a new exercise program. But generally, walking, swimming, cycling, and yoga are all excellent choices. Listen to your body and stop if you experience any pain or discomfort. I’ll also give you a handout summarizing these recommendations. It includes a list of heart-healthy foods, exercise tips, and stress management techniques. Do you have any other questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been so helpful, Doctor. I really appreciate your patience and thoroughness. I guess I should get going. I have a grocery list to make! And I need to find some apps for my phone. Thank you again for everything. I’ll see you in three months. .
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Chelise. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in three months. Have a good day! .
