DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. I… well, I want to know more about where my people come from. My family, that is. I hear you can do tests with… with spit, to find out? I want to know about my ancestors.
DOCTOR: That's a really interesting question, Mr. Scobie. It’s wonderful you’re interested in learning about your family history. What you’re referring to are genetic ancestry tests – often done with a saliva sample, yes. They can give you an idea of your ethnic origins and trace your ancestors' movements over time. However, those tests are generally focused on broader populations, and might not have a lot of specific data about Marshallese ancestry, unfortunately. They’re more geared towards European, African, and Asian ancestries. It’s something we can discuss, and I can explain what the tests involve and their limitations. But before we go down that road, could you tell me a little more about why you're interested in this now?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… not good. I thought it would be easy. My grandson, he’s always asking about it. He’s in school, learning about different places. He wants to know where we come from, not just that we're from the Marshall Islands. I'm old, Doctor. I don’t have much time left, maybe. I want to tell him something… real, before I go. Something more than just stories. Stories get changed, you know? I just want to know for sure. Is there anything you can do? Even a little bit?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Scobie. It’s incredibly meaningful to want to leave that kind of legacy for your grandson. And you're right, stories do change over time. It’s admirable you want to give him something concrete. Let's see… While direct ancestry testing might be limited for Marshallese populations as we discussed, there are other avenues we could explore. We could start by documenting your family's oral history in as much detail as possible. I can help guide that process, asking specific questions to capture important details. We can also look into any existing genealogical records from the Marshall Islands, though those can be difficult to access. Before we do that, though, I want to make sure there aren't any other health concerns bringing you in today. Sometimes, feeling a sense of urgency about family history can come up when we're thinking about our overall well-being. Are you experiencing any new symptoms or have any changes in your health that prompted this visit?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I’m… old, like I said. My bones ache a bit, but that’s just getting old. I’ve been to the clinic for check-ups, you know, Medicare pays for it. Everything is… okay. It’s just this. Knowing about my family. The stories… My grandmother, she told me stories about coming to the Islands, long ago. She spoke a different language, before. I don't remember much of it. I just want to give my grandson something more than just "long ago." Something he can see. Is writing down the stories going to help? Will that really be enough?
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear that your check-ups have been going well, and that Medicare is keeping you covered. And you’re right to ask if writing down stories will be enough—it’s a valid concern. It might not be the same as a genetic test, but a detailed family history, meticulously documented, can be incredibly powerful. It preserves your memories, your grandmother's stories, and the cultural context that might otherwise be lost. We can record dates, locations, important events, even traditional practices or beliefs. And that record can become a family heirloom, something your grandson can cherish and pass down for generations. We can also explore resources online that might offer some broader information about Marshallese history and culture, which could supplement your family's story. Before we start on that, though, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. I see. I don’t have much history, Doctor. I was a fisherman, mostly. Worked hard, ate fish. Lived on Majuro. No… big problems. I had the flu once, a long time ago. The doctor gave me some medicine. That's it, really. I make wood things now. Little boats, little houses. My hands aren't what they used to be. I used to be strong. What kind of questions do you want to ask about my family? I can try to remember. It’s been a long time. My mother, she died when I was young. I don't remember much about her either. Just… her face. And her singing.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. It's understandable that memories fade with time. And you've lived a full life, working hard and creating beautiful things. Let’s focus on what you do remember. Don’t worry about details you can’t recall. We’ll start with your grandparents, if that’s alright. Do you know anything about where they came from within the Marshall Islands?
PATIENT: Hmm. My grandmother… she came from Ailinglaplaplap, I think. That's a long way from Majuro. She always spoke about the ocean there, and the birds. She said it was very different from Majuro. My grandfather… I don’t remember. He died when I was very small. My mother never spoke much about him. She was sad, my mother. I remember her crying sometimes, when she thought no one was looking. She sang songs, but they were sad songs. Is it okay if I just tell you things as I remember them? I don’t know dates, or… important things like that. Just what I feel, and what I remember.
DOCTOR: That's absolutely perfect, Mr. Scobie. Please, tell me whatever comes to mind. Feelings and memories are far more important than dates at this point. It's wonderful you remember your grandmother's connection to Ailinglaplaplap. That's a good starting point. Do you recall anything about her life on Ailinglaplaplap?
PATIENT: She… she liked to weave. Mats and baskets. Very beautiful. She said the people there lived close to the ocean. They fished and grew coconuts. She said the ocean was their garden. She didn't like Majuro much. Too crowded, she said. Too many people. She missed the quiet of Ailinglaplaplap. I remember her telling stories about… about the stars. She said the stars told stories too. She knew all the names of the stars, and what they meant. I tried to learn them, but I couldn't remember them all. She said the stars were our ancestors. That's… that's why they were so important.
DOCTOR: That's a beautiful story, Mr. Scobie. And a very poignant one. The connection to the stars as ancestors… that’s a powerful tradition. It sounds like your grandmother deeply valued her heritage. Do you know if she passed on any of that knowledge to your mother?
PATIENT: I think so. My mother… she sang the same songs. But she didn't weave like her mother. She didn't talk much about the stars. She seemed… sad, mostly. She worked hard, taking care of me. She didn't want me to be a fisherman, like my father. She wanted me to… to have an easier life. She sent me to school, but I didn't like it much. I wanted to be with the ocean. Like my grandmother. She used to tell me stories about… about the spirits. She said the spirits lived in the ocean, and in the trees. She said we had to be respectful of the spirits. Or they would be angry. I think she was trying to teach me something. But I was just a boy. I didn't understand much.
DOCTOR: That sounds like your mother was trying to pass on important cultural teachings, even if she couldn’t fully articulate them. It’s common for traditions to become less explicit across generations, especially after significant life changes. Did she have any specific practices related to respecting the spirits?
PATIENT: She… she would leave little gifts for the spirits. Fish, or coconuts. She would say a prayer, before she left the gifts. I didn’t understand the words, but I knew it was important. She would also… she would avoid certain places, at certain times. She said those places were sacred, and we shouldn't disturb the spirits. She always… always told me to listen to the ocean. She said the ocean would tell me everything I needed to know. I listened to the ocean, like she told me. And the ocean… the ocean told me stories. Stories about my ancestors. But I can't remember the stories now. They’re gone. Like… like smoke.
DOCTOR: That's a beautiful way to describe it, Mr. Scobie. It sounds like your mother had a deep connection to the spiritual world, and she instilled that reverence in you. Leaving offerings and respecting sacred spaces… those are powerful traditions. Even if you can’t recall the specific stories, the fact that the ocean did communicate with you is significant. It sounds like it was a vital part of your upbringing. Now, shifting gears slightly, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. Just fish. I eat a lot of fish. My grandson, he brings me pills sometimes. He says they’re good for me. But I don’t take them. I don’t need them. I have the ocean. And… and the memories. They're fading, but they're still there. I… I'm getting tired. It’s been a long time talking. Is it okay if we stop here for today? Maybe we can talk again next week? If you think it’s… helpful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Scobie. You've shared a great deal today, and it’s perfectly alright to stop when you’re tired. You've given me a wonderful glimpse into your family history and your connection to the Marshall Islands. I think we can certainly continue this conversation next week if you'd like. We can explore some online resources about Marshallese culture, and perhaps discuss documenting your memories in more detail. I’ll also make a note to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs before you leave today, just as part of a routine check-up. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Thank you. The check-up is good. I… I don’t want to bother you too much. I know you’re busy. Just… thank you for listening. It’s good to talk about it. Maybe… maybe my grandson will understand now. Why I love the ocean. And why my grandmother loved the stars.
DOCTOR: It’s no bother at all, Mr. Scobie. I’m happy I could listen. And I’m confident your grandson will understand. Sharing these stories is incredibly important, and you’ve already taken a wonderful first step. Let's get that blood pressure checked, and then we can chat a little more about setting up a follow-up appointment. .
