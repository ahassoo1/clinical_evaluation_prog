DOCTOR: Right, well?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have all day. It’s… well, it's blood. Coming from, you know, down there. Started a couple days ago. Not a little, either. Enough to worry me, anyway. And frankly, I’ve had better ways to spend a Saturday.
DOCTOR: Blood, you say. Alright. And how old are you, sir?
PATIENT: Fifty-one. Brad Gentz. And before you ask, yes, it is a recent development. Like I said, a couple of days. Not exactly something you ignore, is it? Though, honestly, with the state of healthcare these days… you gotta wonder if they even care anymore.
DOCTOR: Gentz… yes. Fifty-one. And you said a couple of days... is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I… well, when I use the restroom. But sometimes just… appears. It's not like a fountain, thankfully, but it’s enough to stain my underwear. And the smell… let's just say it’s not pleasant. Honestly, I've seen cleaner things coming out of the crematorium. Don't tell anyone I said that.
DOCTOR: Right. And any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain, exactly. More… discomfort. Like a cramping, sort of. Nothing I can't handle, I’ve dealt with worse, believe me. Though it does make me… hesitant, if you catch my drift. Not exactly a pleasant experience all around. Look, is this going to take long? I had a perfectly good Yemeni stew planned for lunch.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What is this, a kindergarten class? Look, it’s… darker than usual. And, yes, a little… looser. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, I shouldn’t have to explain everything. I came in here because there's blood coming out of me, not because I wanted to give you a detailed report on my… movements. Is this normal for this clinic? This level of… inquiry?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I need information to determine what's going on. Darker, looser… any fever, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Nausea, a little, but that could be anything. The smell, mostly. Honestly, makes me queasy. Vomiting, no. Look, I run a crematorium, alright? I deal with unpleasantness all day. A little stomach upset isn't going to bother me. But the blood, that’s different. That’s what’s worrying me. And frankly, I'm starting to worry about this process more than the actual problem. Are you going to do something, or just keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a quick look, shall we?
PATIENT: Look, I'm not entirely comfortable with that. I just got here! And, honestly, with all due respect… I haven't exactly been prepared for an examination. Is there a nurse or… someone else who could assist? I'd really prefer not to have… well, you know. This is all a bit much. And quite frankly, a little undignified.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I can’t properly assess the situation without an examination. It’s a necessary part of determining the cause of the bleeding. If you’d prefer, I can refer you elsewhere, but that will likely involve a wait and further delay. Is that what you want?
PATIENT: Look, fine. Fine! But it's going to be quick, alright? Very quick. And you won't be staring. I've… I've had enough poking and prodding for one day, thank you very much. And no unnecessary commentary. I don't need a lecture on… well, anything. Just tell me what's wrong. And hurry it up. That stew isn't going to cook itself.
DOCTOR: Right. Please lie down on the examination table, facing up. And try to relax, if you can. We'll keep it brief.
PATIENT: Relax? Easy for you to say. I'm about to be… examined. By a complete stranger. This is… this is just ridiculous. And cold. This table is awfully cold. Get it over with, alright? The sooner this is done, the sooner I can go home and eat my stew. And honestly, I'm starting to regret coming here at all.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is some blood on my glove. And the prostate feels… slightly enlarged. No obvious masses. Alright. That’s all I need for now. Now, please get dressed.
PATIENT: Enlarged? Enlarged what? Is that bad? And what does blood on your glove mean? Don’t just say things without explaining them! Honestly, I feel like I'm at a carnival, being poked and prodded with no one telling me what’s going on. Is it serious? Am I… dying? Just tell me something. Anything. And then let me go home. I need to go home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, an enlarged prostate is common in men your age. The blood is concerning, but it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. It could be a number of things: a hemorrhoid, a minor infection, or… something else. I recommend a Prostate-Specific Antigen blood test and a stool test to check for blood. I'm also going to order a complete blood count. It's best to rule things out. Given your insurance situation, I can refer you to the clinic lab for a reduced cost. Do you agree?
PATIENT: Reduced cost? How reduced? Because I'm not paying a fortune for a bunch of tests just to be told it's 'something else'. And what's this 'PSA' thing? Sounds complicated. Honestly, I just want a straight answer. Is it going to require surgery? Chemotherapy? Because if it is, I'm walking out of here right now. I’ve seen enough… unpleasantness. And frankly, I don’t have the energy for a fight with insurance companies. Just tell me what I'm looking at. In plain English. And the cost. Before I agree to anything. That stew is getting cold, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, a PSA test is a blood test that measures a protein produced by the prostate gland. It can help detect prostate cancer, but it can also be elevated for other reasons. It’s not definitive. The stool test will look for microscopic blood, which can indicate bleeding in the digestive tract. The cost at the clinic lab is $75 for both. I’m not saying you have cancer. I’m saying we need more information. Right now, it's far too early to talk about surgery or chemotherapy. Let's get the tests done, and then we'll discuss a plan. It’s a simple procedure. Do you agree to the tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Seventy-five dollars. As long as it’s just seventy-five dollars. And you promise not to start talking about… things… until we have the results. No scary words. No vague threats. Just numbers. And then a straight answer. If that's possible. Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming here. This is all a bit much. Alright, let's get it over with. Where do I go? And how long will it take? I have a stew waiting.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. Tell them I sent you. It should be quick – about fifteen minutes. The results will take 3-5 business days. Here's a lab requisition form. Once you have the results, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me. Next!
PATIENT: Fifteen minutes… three to five business days… Honestly. This whole thing is ridiculous. A waste of a perfectly good Saturday. .
