DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… well, it's my ears, I think. They just don’t seem to be workin' like they used to. Everything’s a bit muffled, you see? Not terribly bad, but enough to bother me. I can't rightly recall when it started, though. Years, I suppose. Maybe?
DOCTOR: Years, you say?
PATIENT: Well, not exactly years. More like… a long time. I used to work in a shoe factory, you know. Lots of noise. Clatterin' and bangin' all day long. Could be somethin' to do with that. I don't really know, though. My memory ain't what it used to be. It's just… quiet things are hard to hear now. Like birds singin'. Or folks talkin' softly.
DOCTOR: Right. Shoe factory. Noise exposure. And difficulty hearing softer sounds. Do you have any ringing in your ears, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Now that you mention it… sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. It's a faint sort of ringin', like a… a tiny bell way off in the distance. Hard to describe, really. It comes and goes. Is that… bad? I don't pay it much mind usually.
DOCTOR: It can be, Mr. Schneer. It’s often associated with noise exposure. Now, besides the muffled hearing and the occasional ringing, are you experiencing any dizziness, pain in your ears, or any discharge?
PATIENT: Dizziness… no, not really. I get a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, but that's just gettin' old, I reckon. No pain, thankfully. And no… discharge. Just the quietness, mostly. And the little ringin' now and then. It doesn't bother me too much, but it's… well, it's gettin' harder to hear my stories, you see? I like listenin’ to the old radio programs. It’s harder now to pick up the words.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think now. Oh, just somethin' for my water pills, the doctor gave me. Helps with… well, helps with the swellin', I think. Can't recall the name, though. Little white ones. I take one every mornin' with my breakfast. That’s all I take, I’m pretty sure. I don’t take a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to any medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat just about anything. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes with spicy food, but that's not an allergy, is it? No, I'm pretty sure I don't have any allergies. My mother always said I had a strong stomach.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like you're likely experiencing age-related hearing loss, possibly exacerbated by your previous noise exposure in the shoe factory. We’ll need to do a quick hearing test to get a better idea of the extent of the loss. Do you mind if I take a look in your ears as well?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s best. A hearing test, you say? I suppose I can do that. And lookin' in my ears… alright, go ahead. I haven’t had anyone look in there in ages. Hope I haven't got too much wax build-up!
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll start with the hearing test. Then I'll just take a quick look inside your ears with an otoscope. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. It’ll just help us rule out any blockages or infections. If you could just sit here, and I’ll explain everything as we go.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. I’ll sit right here. Just tell me what to do, Doctor. I’m not very good with fancy machines, but I’ll do my best. Lead the way, and tell me when to push the button, okay?
DOCTOR: Very good. I’m going to play a series of tones at different frequencies and volumes in each ear. When you hear a tone, I want you to press this button. It doesn’t matter how faint the tone is, if you hear anything at all, press the button. I’ll start with your right ear. We’ll do each frequency three times. Try to remain as still as possible during the test. Okay, here we go…
PATIENT: Alright, I'll try my best. A little bit quiet, that one... I heard something, I think. Very faint. Is that right? Hope I’m not makin’ a fuss for nothin’. These old ears ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Mr. Schneer. You’re doing great. It’s very helpful to know even the faintest tones you can detect. Alright, here we go again…
PATIENT: Yes, I heard that one. Definitely heard that one. Still a little quiet, though. Like someone talkin' through a wall, you know? Is this gonna take long, Doctor? I'm startin' to feel a little bit tired.
DOCTOR: Almost finished with the right ear, Mr. Schneer. Just a few more tones. It doesn’t usually take too long. Now, we’ll move on to the left ear. Same instructions: press the button whenever you hear anything at all. Okay, here we go…
PATIENT: Alright, left ear it is. This one’s a bit… harder to hear, I think. Did you say somethin', Doctor? I wasn't sure if I heard a tone or not. These ears… they’re playin’ tricks on me, I reckon. Maybe I just need a good cleanin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s enough for now. We’ll stop here. Based on the hearing test, you have what we call sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. It’s the most common type of hearing loss, and as you suspected, it can be caused by age and noise exposure. It means there’s some damage to the tiny hair cells inside your inner ear. It's not something we can fix, unfortunately, but there are things we can do to help.
PATIENT: Oh. Not fix, you say? Well… that’s not good. I figured as much, really. Old age catches up to ya, I suppose. So… what can we do? I still want to hear my radio programs, you know? And talk to folks without askin’ them to repeat themselves all the time. Is there a machine or somethin’? A little tiny one I can wear in my ear?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schneer, you’re right to ask about hearing aids. They’re the most common and effective way to manage hearing loss. They amplify sounds, making them easier to hear. There are many different styles available, from small, discreet ones that fit inside the ear canal to larger, more powerful ones that sit behind the ear. We can arrange a referral to an audiologist who can perform a more detailed assessment and recommend the best option for you. They’ll also fit and program the hearing aid to your specific needs. It won't restore your hearing to normal, but it will significantly improve your ability to communicate and enjoy sounds again. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: An audiologist, you say? Well, that sounds… sensible. A specialist, then. I’m happy to see someone who knows what they’re doin’. How much do these… what did you call ‘em? Hearing aids… how much do they cost? I’m on a fixed income, you see. Medicare covers somethin’, doesn’t it? I got Medicare, part A and part B. And… what if they don't work? I don’t want to spend a lot of money on somethin’ that just sits in a drawer.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid question, Mr. Schneer. Hearing aids can be expensive, unfortunately. The cost varies depending on the style and technology, but they typically range from a few thousand dollars per pair. Medicare, unfortunately, does not typically cover the cost of hearing aids themselves. It may cover the cost of an audiological exam to determine the extent of your hearing loss, but the aids themselves are usually considered a supplemental benefit. However, some audiology practices offer financing plans, and there are also some financial assistance programs available, depending on your income and needs. I can provide you with a list of local audiologists and information on some of these programs. Most practices also offer a trial period, usually around 30 days, so you can try the hearing aids and see if they’re a good fit before committing to a purchase. If they don’t work for you, you can usually return them for a full refund. Would you like me to prepare that list for you?
PATIENT: Oh, a trial period, you say? That's good. Very good. That takes some of the worry away, at least. Yes, please. A list of the local places. And the… the financial help, too. That would be very kind of you, Doctor. I don't want to be a burden, but these old ears are important to me, you know? I like listenin' to the ball games on the radio, and hearin' my grandkids' voices. So, yes, the list would be wonderful. Thank you kindly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. I understand perfectly. Here you are. This list includes contact information for several audiology practices in the area, as well as links to some organizations that may be able to help with the cost of hearing aids. Before you go, are there any other questions I can answer for you today?
