DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggard. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Mande. It’s nice to meet you too. Well… it’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and…yellow, for a few days now. It started after I ate some fava beans. I didn’t think much of it at first, but it’s not going away.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mande. It’s good to meet you as well. Tired and yellow… that is a bit unusual. And it started after eating fava beans, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I had them with dinner a few days ago, and then the next day I just felt…off. Really weak, and my skin started looking kind of yellow. Not bright yellow, but definitely noticeable, you know? I thought maybe it was just something I ate, but then it didn't get better.
DOCTOR: I understand. And you’ve noticed this yellowing primarily in your skin?
PATIENT: Yes, mainly my skin. And… my eyes, I think. It’s hard to tell for sure, but my daughter pointed it out. She said the whites of my eyes looked a little yellow too. I don't feel sick, exactly, just very, very tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and yellowing of the skin and eyes after consuming fava beans… that does raise a few possibilities. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or dark urine since you ate the fava beans?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No vomiting, no. And I don’t think I’ve had any abdominal pain. My urine… I haven’t really paid attention, to be honest. I don’t usually notice the color of my urine. Is that…important?
DOCTOR: It can be, Mande. Dark urine can sometimes be a sign of liver or gallbladder issues. Don’t worry, we’re just gathering information. Have you had any fever, chills, or any changes in your bowel movements—lighter colored stools, perhaps?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And… no, my bowel movements seem normal. Regular, you know? Nothing lighter colored that I’ve noticed. I really haven’t been paying close attention to… well, to anything like that usually. This is all a bit worrying, honestly. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mande. It's good you came in to get this checked out. Based on what you’ve told me – the tiredness, the yellowing of your skin and eyes after eating fava beans – a possibility that comes to mind is G6PD deficiency. It’s a genetic condition that can cause a reaction to certain foods, including fava beans, leading to these symptoms. To help me rule this in or out, and to investigate other potential causes, I'd like to perform a physical exam and order some blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: G6PD deficiency? I’ve never heard of that. Is it… serious? And blood tests are fine, yes. Whatever you think is best to figure out what’s going on. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: G6PD deficiency isn't usually serious if it’s diagnosed and managed properly, Mande. It means your body doesn’t have enough of an enzyme called G6PD, which protects your red blood cells. When you're exposed to triggers like fava beans, certain medications, or infections, it can cause your red blood cells to break down prematurely, leading to symptoms like fatigue and jaundice – that's the yellowing of the skin and eyes. Alright. Let’s start with a physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take a closer look at your skin and eyes. If you could please lie down on the table, that would be great.
PATIENT: Okay, that makes a little sense. I'm glad it's not usually serious if we know about it. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mande. Okay, take a nice, deep breath in… and exhale. Good. Again… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness. That feels… normal. Just a little pressure, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’m checking the sclera – that’s the white part of your eyes – and I do see some mild yellowing, as you mentioned. Your skin also has a slightly yellowish tint. There’s no visible rash or lesions. Your mouth looks clear. Alright, Mande. Physical exam findings are consistent with mild jaundice. Now, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I’m going to order some blood tests. These will include a complete blood count , a liver function panel , a bilirubin level, and a G6PD enzyme assay. Do you have any allergies to any medications or contrast dyes?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had any reactions to anything before. And… what exactly is a bilirubin level? Is that what’s causing the yellowing?
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the allergies, Mande. And that's a very good question. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment produced when red blood cells break down. Normally, your liver processes and removes bilirubin from your body. When your liver isn’t functioning properly, or when there’s a large amount of red blood cell breakdown – like what can happen with G6PD deficiency – bilirubin can build up in your blood, causing jaundice – that yellowing of the skin and eyes. The blood tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on with your liver and your red blood cells. I'll also order a G6PD enzyme assay to specifically check the levels of that enzyme in your blood. The lab will need a sample of your blood, which we can draw here in the clinic. It's a quick process. After the results come back – usually within 24 to 48 hours – we'll discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions about the blood tests or anything else we’ve discussed so far?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. So, the tests will tell us if my liver is okay, and if that G6PD thing is the problem? And if it is the G6PD thing, what happens then? Can it be treated?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct, Mande. The tests will help us assess your liver function and determine if a G6PD deficiency is the cause of your symptoms. If it is a G6PD deficiency, there's no cure, but it’s very manageable. The main treatment involves avoiding triggers that can cause red blood cell breakdown, like fava beans, certain medications—we'll give you a list of those to avoid—and infections. We'll also monitor your blood counts regularly. In some cases, if the deficiency is severe, a blood transfusion might be necessary, but that’s not usually the case. The most important thing is to know your diagnosis so you can take appropriate precautions and prevent future episodes. For now, let's focus on getting the test results back. I’ll have the lab technician come in and draw your blood. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that all makes sense. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Yes, let's get the blood drawn. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mande. I'm glad I could help. And I understand your desire to feel better—that’s what we’re here for. "Could someone please come in to draw blood from room two?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I'll just wait here then.
DOCTOR: Great. A lab technician will be with you shortly. While you wait, I’ll quickly document our conversation in your electronic health record.
