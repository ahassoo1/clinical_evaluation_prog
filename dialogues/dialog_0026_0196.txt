DOCTOR: Good morning, Janie. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, to start us off, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… chronic… fatigue, I think they said? Honestly, it all feels a bit fuzzy. I just feel… tired. Really tired. All the time. Is that what this is about? I don't really remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Yes, fatigue is certainly a common concern. It is frustrating when it’s hard to pinpoint the cause, and even more so when remembering details is difficult. Don't worry about that part at all. Okay, "really tired, all the time..." Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like just a normal tired after a long day. It’s… deeper. Like there’s no amount of sleep that helps. And it’s been going on… oh, goodness, months, I think? Maybe longer. It makes everything hard. Even getting out of bed. I used to be so much more… active. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds incredibly draining, and it’s perfectly valid to have trouble articulating it. Months, you said?
PATIENT: Yes… months. Since… well, after my husband passed, I think. Everything kind of blurred together after that, to be honest. I don’t remember exactly when it started, just that it’s… always there now. It's just… a constant weight.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. Grief can manifest in so many ways, and fatigue is certainly one of them. It’s not unusual for it to linger. To help me understand what’s going on now, beyond the grief, can you describe what your typical day looks like?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Well… typical. Um… I wake up, usually pretty early, even though I’m exhausted. I try to make some coffee. Then… I mostly just sit. Watch TV. Sometimes I’ll try to do a little housework, but I get… winded. Really easily. And then… more sitting. It’s just… not much. My neighbor brings me groceries sometimes, bless her heart. I used to love gardening, but I haven't been able to do that in… a long time.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Janie. It sounds as though this fatigue is significantly impacting your daily life. Aside from the fatigue and feeling winded, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes…? Let me think. Um… sometimes my muscles ache. Not all the time, but frequently. And… my memory is terrible, as you can probably tell. I forget things constantly. Little things. Where I put my keys, what I had for breakfast… things like that. And… I feel… sort of… down. Not always sad, but just… empty. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense, Janie. Muscle aches, memory issues, and feeling down… those can all be connected. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… That was my husband’s department, usually. Let me think… I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And… arthritis, I think? In my hands. Not severe, just a little achey sometimes. And… high blood pressure, maybe? The doctor put me on a pill for it, but I can't really remember. Honestly, it all blurs together.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, arthritis in the hands, and potentially high blood pressure. Do you happen to know the name of the medication you were taking for your blood pressure, or roughly when you were prescribed it?
PATIENT: No, I really don’t. I… I think it was a small white pill? Does that help? Honestly, I just let my husband handle all the medication stuff. He was very organized. I just took what he gave me. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Janie. It’s very common for people to rely on a partner for managing medications, and it’s not your fault you don’t remember the specifics. We can look into it further. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements that you do remember?
PATIENT: Um… Let me think. Just… a multivitamin, I think? I take one with breakfast. And… sometimes, if my arthritis is really bothering me, I’ll take ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind. Nothing else, I don’t think. I really try to avoid taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Not that I know of. My husband always asked me about that when I went to the doctor, and I always told him no. I’ve never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you have any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history. That's a tough one. My mother… she had heart trouble, I think? She passed away when I was young. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. And… my sister had some kind of… autoimmune thing? Something with her joints. But I don't really remember the details. It was a long time ago. Honestly, I don’t know much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, thank you. History of heart trouble in your mother, diabetes in your father, and an autoimmune condition in your sister. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and a quick look at your joints. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Yes, I suppose so. As long as it doesn't take too long. I… I get a little anxious with doctors, to be honest. But if you think it’s necessary… go ahead.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll take it slow, and I’ll explain everything as we go. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s a little elevated, which isn’t unexpected given your history. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, but with slightly diminished breath sounds in the bases. Some mild tenderness to palpation in the wrists and finger joints, consistent with possible arthritis. No visible swelling or deformity noted. Okay, that’s all for the quick physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found in the exam, I think it’s important to do some blood work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Blood work. Is that going to be… painful?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It’s just a simple blood draw. A small needle will be used to take a sample from your arm. There might be a brief pinch, but it’s usually very quick and most people tolerate it well. The blood work will help us check for things like anemia, thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, inflammation, and potentially rule out other causes for your fatigue. We'll also check your blood sugar to get a better baseline. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… they won’t lose too much blood, will they? I always get a little… faint.
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not. They only take a small amount of blood – a few vials at most. And we'll have you sit or lie down afterwards to make sure you're feeling okay. The phlebotomist is very experienced and will take extra care with you, especially knowing you sometimes feel faint. We'll make sure you’re comfortable the entire time. I'll write an order for the blood work now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw it. After the results come back, we can discuss them in detail and come up with a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. That… that sounds good. As long as I don't have to wait too long for the results. I just want to feel… better.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Janie. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible – usually within a few business days. In the meantime, please try to get as much rest as you can, and drink plenty of fluids. I’m going to write a few notes and then the nurse will be in shortly. Do you have any questions for me before I do that?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janie. It’s my pleasure. Remember, we’ll get to the bottom of this. Just focus on taking care of yourself in the meantime. I’ll have the nurse come in now to draw your blood.
PATIENT: .
