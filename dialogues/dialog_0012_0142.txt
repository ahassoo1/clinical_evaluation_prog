DOCTOR: Hi Jaxston, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Right, well… it’s my head, mostly. I’ve been getting these… bad headaches. Really bad ones. And I get all sweaty when they come on, and my heart races, you know? It’s… unsettling. I don’t really remember exactly when they started, to be honest. It feels like it’s been a while though.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches with sweating and a racing heart… that definitely sounds unsettling, and we want to figure out what's going on. When you say "a while," can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… rough estimate… gosh. Maybe… six months? Or has it been longer? Time kinda… blurs, you know? Definitely not just a couple of weeks, though. It feels like it's been happening on and off for… a good chunk of time. I wish I was better at keeping track. They don't happen every day, thankfully.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, it's common to not remember exact timelines. “A good chunk of time” is helpful. So, these headaches have been happening on and off for at least six months. Can you describe what the headaches feel like?
PATIENT: Right, okay. Um… they're not like a normal headache, if that makes sense? It’s not just… a dull ache. It’s more… throbbing? Really intense throbbing, usually on both sides of my head. And it feels like pressure, too, like something’s squeezing my skull. Sometimes it feels like it’s right behind my eyes. It makes me really sensitive to light, and sound gets… really loud. It’s hard to explain, really. They just… hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, throbbing on both sides, pressure, sensitivity to light and sound… that’s helpful. It does sound more than a typical tension headache. And you said sweating and a racing heart come on with the headache?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. They all kinda happen at once, or pretty close together. The headache starts, and then I get really clammy and sweaty, and my heart just… pounds. It’s kinda scary, to be honest. It doesn’t last forever, but it’s not pleasant. It usually goes away after a few hours, I think. I’ve just been trying to sleep it off mostly. Not the best plan, probably.
DOCTOR: No, sleeping it off isn’t a bad instinct, but we definitely want to figure out what’s causing this. A few hours is good to know. Do you notice anything that seems to trigger these headaches?
PATIENT: Trigger… hmm. That’s a good question. I honestly haven't noticed anything specific. It doesn't seem to be connected to stress, or what I’m eating, or… anything. It just kinda happens randomly. Which is frustrating, you know? I can’t avoid it if I don’t know what causes it. I’ve tried keeping a little notepad, but I just… forget to write in it half the time. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it can be tough to track things when you're not feeling well. Random onset makes it harder, definitely. Okay, so headaches, throbbing, both sides of the head, sensitivity to light and sound, with sweating and racing heart, lasting a few hours, and no obvious triggers that you've noticed. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with these headaches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Um… sometimes I feel a bit… nauseous when I have one, but I haven't actually been sick. And I think… maybe a little dizzy? Not like spinning-room dizzy, just… off-balance. It’s hard to describe. No fever, though, I don't think. And definitely no vision changes or anything like that. I'm pretty sure. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly. Sorry again, I'm not the best at remembering details.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, you're doing fine. Nausea and dizziness along with the headaches is good to know. Okay. Before we do a quick physical exam, let's go through some basic health questions. Have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Medical problems… uh… I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. And… I had tonsillitis a couple of times, but that was ages ago. Nothing major, really. I haven’t really been to the doctor much, to be honest. I generally just… tough it out. I got divorced a couple of years back, if that counts as a problem, but that was… emotional, not physical. I don’t know if that’s what you meant. I’m really not sure.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And yes, I meant medical problems. Emotional stress can absolutely contribute to physical symptoms, so thanks for sharing that. No past surgeries then, just the broken arm as a kid?
PATIENT: No surgeries, just the arm. It was a bad fall when I was about eight, I think. They just put a cast on it. Healed up okay. I don’t remember much else. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit… fuzzy just thinking about all this. It’s bringing back… things. Not good things. Sorry. Should I just… stop? I’m probably not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Jaxston. It’s perfectly okay to feel a bit overwhelmed thinking about things, especially if it's bringing up difficult memories. We can definitely slow down or stop if you need to. We're just trying to figure out what’s going on with these headaches. Before we go further, would you mind if I ask about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… uh… okay. My dad had high blood pressure, I think. And… my mum had migraines, really bad ones, when she was younger. They used to knock her out for a day or two. I don’t know much else, to be honest. We weren't very close. She… she’s passed away now. And I don’t really talk to my dad much. Sorry, I'm not much help on that front either. It's all a bit… distant.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, you’re providing what you can, and that’s perfectly okay. Migraines in the family is relevant, thank you for sharing that. Now, what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… uh… I work, I guess. Production work, pretty physical job. Mostly lifting and… things. I don't drink much, maybe a beer or two on the weekends. And… I don't smoke. Divorced, like I said. I don’t really… see many people. It's mostly just me, to be honest. I live alone. I… I don't really have any hobbies. Sorry, I'm not very exciting. I’m really not sure what you need to know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Jaxston. Just trying to get a complete picture. And honestly, a physical job can be helpful to know. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not that I know of. I haven't taken much medication in the past. I had a reaction to some bug spray when I was a kid, but that was… a rash. Nothing serious. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I generally just… avoid taking anything if I can. I’m not a fan. Does that make sense? I'm really not good with medical stuff. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. No known allergies, and you prefer to avoid medication when possible. That’s good information to have. Okay, Jaxston, thanks for answering all my questions. Now I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That’s fine. I guess. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, if that's alright? I’m not great with… hospitals and doctors and things. It brings back… things. Sorry. I really don’t want to make a fuss. Just… please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as quick and gentle as possible, Jaxston. I'll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you're uncomfortable. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. And I'll take a quick look in your ears, eyes, and throat. Okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Yeah, that sounds… okay. Blood pressure first, right? Just… try to be quick, if you can? It makes me a bit anxious, you know? Not your fault, just… things. Sorry. I’ll try to relax. I really will. Just… let me know when you’re about to do something, okay? It'll help.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will absolutely let you know before I do anything. This might feel a little tight for a moment, but it won't hurt. Just breathe normally. Okay, here we go… … 138 over 82. Not bad. Pulse is 78, regular. And temperature is 98.6, normal. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Can you take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breaths. Right. Is that alright? I'm trying. Just… let me know if anything feels wrong. Sorry, I’m probably making this harder than it needs to be. It's just… things. You know? I shouldn’t be like this. It's just… everything feels a bit… fuzzy. And… I’m getting a headache. Not a bad one yet, but… it's starting. Just… please be quick.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jaxston. It’s okay to be anxious, and you're not making anything harder. You're doing great. I'm just listening for anything unusual. Heart sounds are normal, regular rate and rhythm. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. I can see you're starting to feel a headache coming on. We’ll keep things quick. Now, I'm just going to quickly check your ears and throat with a light. Open your mouth and say "Ahhh" for me.
PATIENT: “Ahhh…” Yeah, it’s starting to build. Not too bad yet, but… it's definitely there. I think I’m getting a bit dizzy again too. Just… please be quick. Sorry, I’m really not trying to be difficult. It's just… everything feels… overwhelming. Fuzzy. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything looks normal in your throat and ears. No signs of infection. I can see you're starting to feel unwell, and that's my concern. It’s alright, we'll stop here for now. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, you're experiencing headaches with symptoms like sweating, racing heart, nausea, and dizziness, and they're not necessarily triggered by anything specific. Given your history of migraines in the family, and the intensity of the symptoms, I think it would be wise to get some further testing done to rule out any underlying causes. Would you be comfortable with a CT scan of your brain?
PATIENT: A CT scan…? No. No, I… I don’t think so. I really don’t like hospitals or… scans or… things. It brings back… really bad things. I… I’m okay, honestly. It's just a headache. My mum had migraines, right? Maybe it’s just that. I can… I can try to sleep it off. I really don't want a scan. Please. I just want to go home. Just… please. I'm really not good with… all this. Sorry. I'm probably making a mess of everything. It's just… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Jaxston, it sounds like this is bringing up a lot of difficult feelings for you, and I completely understand your reluctance. I want to respect your wishes, and I wouldn’t push you into doing anything you're not comfortable with. However, I also have a responsibility to make sure we rule out any serious causes for your headaches, especially given the intensity of your symptoms. A CT scan would help us do that. If you're absolutely opposed to a CT scan, we can consider other options, like an MRI. It’s a bit more detailed but takes longer and can be more expensive. We could also start with some blood tests to check for any infections or other underlying conditions. Would you be more comfortable with blood tests first?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yeah. Yeah, I think I could do blood tests. It’s… less scary. It’s just… I don’t like being stuck in hospitals and… machines and things. It… it brings back really bad memories. I… I don’t want to talk about it, if that’s okay. But… blood tests sound… manageable. It's just… please, no scans. Please. Just… blood tests. If that's alright? I really appreciate you… understanding. Sorry. I'm probably making this harder than it needs to be. It's just… everything feels so overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jaxston. I completely understand, and you’re not making anything harder at all. Your comfort and well-being are my priority. No scans, we’ll start with blood tests. I’ll order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. These tests will help us check for any infections, underlying medical conditions, and thyroid problems that could be contributing to your headaches. The phlebotomist can draw the blood right here in the clinic. It will take just a few minutes. Then, we’ll send the samples to the lab, and we should have the results back within a few days. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: Yeah. That sounds… okay. Blood tests, then talk. That's good. Less scary. Just… let me know when I need to… do it. And… thank you. Really. You’ve been… really understanding. It’s… a relief. I just want this headache to stop. And… to go home. Sorry. I’m probably rambling. It’s just… everything feels so… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Jaxston. And you're very welcome. I'm glad I can help. The phlebotomist, Sarah, is just finishing up with another patient. I’ll let her know you’re ready when she's available. It shouldn't be long. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m okay. Just… blood tests, then talk. That's good. Maybe… is it okay if I just… sit here for a bit? Before the blood tests? Just… to calm down? I don't want to… make a mess of things. Sorry. I'm really not good with medical stuff. It's just… everything feels so overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jaxston. Please, take all the time you need. There’s no rush. Just relax and take a few deep breaths. I’ll be right here if you need anything. And don't worry, you're not making a mess of things at all. You're doing great. I'll just quietly work on some notes while you collect your thoughts. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you feel unwell or if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you.
