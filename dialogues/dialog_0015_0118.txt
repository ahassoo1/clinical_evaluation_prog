DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Yes, well, I believe it’s for… a certification of some sort? It has to do with my work, you see. Honestly, the paperwork was rather… convoluted. I don’t recall the specifics, but it involves my… abilities. My hearing, perhaps? Or my vision? It’s all a bit of a blur, to be frank.
DOCTOR: A certification for work… involving your hearing or vision, you say?
PATIENT: Precisely. I work… in a technical field. Healthcare, actually. Though what exactly I do… escapes me at the moment. It’s terribly frustrating, you know. One gets older, and things just… fade. It’s a requirement, this exam, to ensure I'm still… competent. That’s the word, I believe. Competent. Though, frankly, I haven’t the slightest idea what they expect me to do to prove it.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it’s a competency evaluation requested by your employer. And you’re unsure of the specific requirements… and, forgive me for asking, you’re having some difficulty recalling details generally?
PATIENT: “Generally” is putting it mildly, Doctor. It’s a rather… persistent issue. I wouldn’t say it’s a complete loss, you understand. I simply… misplace things. Thoughts, primarily. And dates. And the names of… well, never mind. As for the specifics of this evaluation… no, I haven’t a clue. They just sent me here. A perfectly respectable clinic, I’m sure, but the instructions were… lacking. Do you require me to fill out any forms? Perhaps that would jog my memory. Though I doubt it.
DOCTOR: Let’s start with a basic review of your medical history, Mr. Oriley. It will help me understand your overall health and perhaps shed some light on this situation. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a difficult question. I’ve… seen doctors, of course. One does, as one ages. I recall some… discomfort, years ago. Back problems, I believe. And a rather unpleasant bout of… something. A virus, perhaps? I had a divorce, quite a messy affair, which I’m sure took a toll. But diagnosed conditions… no, not that I’m aware of. I have private insurance, so I’ve always had access to good care. They usually just… prescribe things. I don’t recall what, specifically. It’s all so… nebulous.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Now, that’s a distinct possibility. I believe I had something done with my… knee. Years ago. A sports injury, perhaps? Though I wasn’t particularly athletic, so that seems unlikely. It was… a minor procedure, I think. Nothing drastic. I was under… something, of course. Everything is so vague. Honestly, Doctor, I feel as if my mind is a rather poorly organized library. Books everywhere, but no discernible cataloging system. It’s quite frustrating. Do you need to know these details? Perhaps we could simply proceed with the exam?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to have a complete picture, Mr. Oriley. Knowing your surgical history, even in broad strokes, can be important. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… yes. Well, I was married, as I mentioned. Divorced, unfortunately. No children. My parents… they passed away some time ago. Both of them. My mother… she was rather frail in her later years. I believe she had… something with her heart. A weak heart, perhaps? My father was a… a very quiet man. He worked in… finance, I believe. Not a particularly memorable fellow, to be frank. He wasn’t one for… socializing. I have a… cousin, somewhere. But we haven’t spoken in years. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t believe my family history is particularly… illuminating. It was a rather… unremarkable lot, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your lifestyle, Mr. Oriley?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Hmm. I live a… quiet life. I enjoy… reading. When I can remember what I’ve read, that is. I prefer solitude, to be frank. I don’t… socialize much. I eat… reasonably well, I suppose. Though my appetite has diminished somewhat recently. I don’t… exercise. Never have. I’ve always preferred intellectual pursuits to… physical activity. I drink… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Nothing excessive. I don’t smoke. Never have. I’ve always considered it… uncivilized. Is this… helpful, Doctor? I feel as if I’m rambling. It’s terribly frustrating to be so… vague. I haven’t the slightest idea what you’re looking for. Perhaps the exam itself will be more… informative.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. Before we proceed with the exam, let's just quickly review any allergies you may have and any medications you're currently taking.
PATIENT: Allergies… none that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. Bees, perhaps? I’ve always been cautious around them. But no documented allergies, no. Medications… ah, that’s a tricky question. I’ve been prescribed things, as I mentioned. Little pills. White pills, mostly. Or perhaps blue. It changes, you see. I don’t recall what they were for. I simply take them as directed. I have a… a small box at home, with various pills. I’m afraid I couldn’t tell you what any of them are. I trust my doctor to… manage that side of things. Honestly, Doctor, I’m beginning to feel rather… flustered. Perhaps we should simply begin the exam? I’m sure it will be more… revealing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, I’m concerned about your memory issues. It’s important that we investigate this further. Before we proceed with any exam specifically for your work certification, I need to understand what’s going on with your cognitive function. I'm going to recommend a simple cognitive assessment to begin with. It will involve a few questions and tasks to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A cognitive assessment… yes, well, I suppose so. If it will… clarify things. Though I confess, I’m not optimistic. I’ve always prided myself on my intellect, you see. To discover it… waning, is rather… disheartening. But if it's necessary, then I suppose I have no choice. Just… please be gentle. I’m afraid my mind is… not what it once was. And please, don’t expect too much. I’m sure I’ll… stumble. It's all so… frustrating. But yes, proceed. If you think it’s best. Just… let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Oriley. We'll take it slowly, and there's no pressure to perform perfectly. It's simply a way for me to get a baseline understanding. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. That’s… a difficult question. Is it… August? Yes, I believe so. August… the second? Or is it the first? No, I’m quite certain it’s the second. August the second… 2024? No… 2025, of course. Yes. August the second, 2025. I think. It’s… terribly frustrating when things simply… slip away. Is that correct? I hope I haven’t… misremembered.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Oriley. It's understandable. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: What city… hmm. That’s… another challenging question. Is it… Oslo? No, that’s where I used to live. This is… a larger city. A bustling one. It’s… urban, I believe. Is it… New York? No, that’s too… brash. Perhaps… London? No, that’s not right either. It’s… a coastal city, I think. I’m afraid my geography is… rather rusty. Is it… Seattle? No. Oh dear. This is… most unpleasant. It’s… a city. A very large city. I… I simply can’t recall the name. It’s… on the tip of my tongue. But it refuses to come out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. That’s okay. We can try something different. Can you repeat these three words for me, and I’ll ask you to recall them later?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Three words… very well. Please proceed. I shall… endeavor to remember them. Though I make no promises. My mind is… a sieve, you see. A rather leaky sieve.
DOCTOR: The words are: apple, table, penny. Apple… table… penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… yes, I remember that one. Apple… and… table. Yes, table. And… hmm. Something beginning with ‘p’… perhaps? Plum? Pineapple? No… that’s not it. It was… a small object… a coin, perhaps? Penny! No… that’s not right either. Oh dear. This is… most distressing. Apple… table… and… something. I simply can’t recall the third word. It’s… gone. Vanished. Like… smoke. I apologize. This is… most humiliating.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Oriley. It's not a test, and it’s common to have difficulty recalling things. We'll move on to another part of the assessment. I'm going to ask you a series of simple questions about your recent memory. Do you remember what you had for breakfast this morning?
PATIENT: Breakfast… hmm. That’s… a difficult question. I believe I had… something. Toast, perhaps? Or cereal? No, that’s not right. I usually have… coffee. Yes, definitely coffee. But what with it… I simply can’t recall. Perhaps a croissant? No… I don’t believe so. It was… something simple. Something… unremarkable. I’m afraid my mornings are… rather a blur. I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful. It’s… terribly frustrating to be so… absent-minded. I believe I had something to eat… but I can’t recall what it was.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. I'm going to stop here for now. Based on this brief assessment, and your reported memory issues, I am concerned about possible cognitive impairment. I'm going to recommend a comprehensive neurological evaluation, including imaging of your brain, to determine the cause of your memory loss and assess your overall cognitive function. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A neurological evaluation… imaging of my brain… yes, well, I suppose so. If it’s necessary. Though I confess, the thought is… rather unsettling. To discover something… amiss… is not a pleasant prospect. But if it will… clarify things, then I have no choice. Yes, proceed. If that's what you recommend, Doctor. Just… please be gentle. I’m afraid my mind is… a fragile thing. And please… don’t expect too much. I’m sure the results will… be disappointing. But yes, proceed. If it will… bring some clarity. Though I fear it won’t. It simply won't. But yes. Proceed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. I'm going to refer you to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a neurologist at City General Hospital. I'll also order an MRI of your brain. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any mentally strenuous activities, and I'm going to ask a family member or close friend to assist you with daily tasks. Do you have someone who can help you with that?
PATIENT: A family member… hmm. That’s… a difficult question. I… divorced, as I mentioned. No children. I have a cousin, somewhere. But we haven’t spoken in years. I… live alone, you see. I manage… reasonably well, on my own. Though, perhaps… a little assistance wouldn’t go amiss. But I… don’t want to be a burden. I’m afraid I’m rather… self-sufficient. But yes, perhaps a little help. If it’s possible. But I don’t want to… impose. I’m afraid I’m rather… alone in the world. But yes, perhaps. If you think it’s necessary. But please… don’t expect too much. I’m afraid I’m rather… a solitary creature. But yes. Perhaps. If it's possible. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. We'll discuss resources for assistance in the area. I understand you prefer to be independent, and we'll respect that. In the meantime, please let me know if you experience any sudden changes in your condition. Here’s the referral form and information about the hospital. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with me after you’ve seen Dr. Vance to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
