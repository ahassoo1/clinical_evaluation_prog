DOCTOR: Hi Jim, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well… it’s my family, you see. Lots of… problems. My mother, she… she had the bad sickness. And my brother, he… well, he wasn't so lucky either. I just want to make sure I’m okay. You know, peace of mind.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you've been through a lot with your family's health. It’s good you’re being proactive about your own well-being, wanting that peace of mind is important. When you say “the bad sickness” regarding your mother, and your brother not being so lucky… could you tell me a little more about what those illnesses were, if you know?
PATIENT: Um… it was… cancer, I think. That’s what they said. My mother, it was in her… her stomach, I think? And my brother… well, it was all over. They didn’t say exactly what kind, not to me anyway. It was a long time ago, you know? I was young. I just remember… a lot of sadness. I don’t really know the details. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly okay, Jim. It's completely understandable that you wouldn't remember all the details, especially if it was a long time ago and a difficult experience. Knowing it was cancer in both cases is helpful. To get a better picture of things, let’s talk about your own health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the flu a few times, you know, the regular kind. And my back… it gets sore sometimes. From work, I think. Lots of lifting. But nothing… serious. I try to eat okay, mostly. Not too much red meat, you know? Doctor always told me that's bad. I think. It's hard to remember what they said back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major diagnoses, just some back soreness and the occasional flu. That’s good to know. You mentioned trying to eat okay and limiting red meat – that's a good habit. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t think so. Not that I remember. Maybe when I was a little boy? A tonsillectomy, maybe? But it was so long ago… I don’t really count that. Nothing major, definitely. Never had any big cuts or anything. Just… normal things, you know? Scrapes and bruises. Nothing a band-aid couldn't fix.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant surgeries. Good. Let's talk about your family history a bit more, beyond your mother and brother. Do you have any other siblings?
PATIENT: Yes. I have a sister, she’s… older than me. She lives in California now. She’s always been healthy, thankfully. Very active, you know? Walks a lot. And… I think my father… he had high blood pressure, maybe? He lived a long life, though. Until his eighties. It was… a long time ago. I don't remember all the details very well, sorry. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Jim. It’s perfectly normal to not remember every detail. Knowing your sister is healthy and your father had high blood pressure is helpful. Now, thinking about your own lifestyle, do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And… not much alcohol either. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, but not every day. Mostly water, to be honest. Doctor always told me to drink more water. I think. It’s hard to keep track of everything. I try to be good. I really do. I don’t want to end up like my mother.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Jim. Avoiding smoking and limiting alcohol intake is very good for your health. It sounds like you're very conscientious about taking care of yourself. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I don't think so. I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm around cats, but that's just a little sniffle, nothing serious. No reactions to any medicine I can remember. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I try to avoid taking pills when I can. They always make me feel funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a mild sensitivity to cats, but no significant allergies to medications or food. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Well… just a little something for my back. Sometimes it gets really sore, you know? I get it at the drugstore. It's… ibuprofen, I think? The kind you just swallow. And… sometimes I take a vitamin. Just a general one, you know, for older people. Helps with… things. I can't remember exactly what, sorry. It's just a little thing. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen for back pain as needed, and a general vitamin. That's helpful to know. To get a better understanding of your current health, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Uh… a physical exam? What does that involve? I don’t mind, I guess, but… I don’t like needles. And I get nervous with doctors. Is it… long? And will it hurt? I just want to make sure I'm okay, that's all. I just want peace of mind, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Jim. I understand your nervousness. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. A quick exam involves checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope, and feeling your abdomen. I'll also check your reflexes and look at your ears and throat. It won't take long, maybe 15-20 minutes. We can avoid any needles today if you prefer – we can focus on the basic exam first. If we feel it's necessary to do some blood work later, we can discuss that then. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… okay. No needles, though, right? Just… listening and feeling? Fifteen minutes… that’s not too bad. As long as it doesn’t hurt. I just… I worry, you know? With my family… I just want to make sure I'm okay. So yes, let’s do it. But gently, please? And let me know what you're doing, okay? I get scared easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jim. No needles today, I promise. And I’ll explain everything as I go, and be very gentle. I understand your worry, especially with your family history, and I’ll do my best to make you feel comfortable. Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. I’m just going to wrap this cuff around your arm. It’ll squeeze a little, but it shouldn’t hurt. Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but we can monitor that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay… 140 over 90? Is that bad? My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And you're listening to my chest now? It feels… strange. I just… I get anxious, you know? Please, just tell me if anything is wrong. I just want to know… am I okay?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. I'm hearing some slightly diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes of your lungs. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, it could just be a little shallow breathing or some congestion. Now I'm going to gently feel your abdomen, just to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Let me know if anything feels painful. Your abdomen is soft, no noticeable tenderness. A little bit of… fullness, but nothing alarming. Everything feels relatively normal. Alright, that concludes the basic exam. Everything feels generally okay, Jim, but your blood pressure is a bit elevated, and your heart rate is a little fast. I would like to discuss some further testing, if you're comfortable with that. Perhaps a simple EKG to check your heart rhythm, and some blood work to check your cholesterol and other levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay… a little fast, you say? Like my mother? And you want more tests? An EKG… and blood work? What does that involve? More needles? I… I don’t like needles. But… if it’s to make sure I'm okay, I guess. I just want peace of mind. But please, no surprises, okay? Tell me everything before you do it. And how long will it take? I have… appointments. And I don’t want to be stuck here all day. What will it cost? I'm on Medicare, you know. Is everything covered? So many questions, sorry. I just… I worry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Jim. It's good you're asking questions, and I’ll do my best to answer them all. The EKG is a very quick and painless test. We attach some small stickers, called electrodes, to your chest, arms, and legs. They don’t hurt at all, just feel a little cool. They’re connected to a machine that records your heart’s electrical activity. It takes about 5 minutes. The blood work involves drawing a small amount of blood from your arm. Yes, there will be a needle involved, but I can assure you our phlebotomist is very skilled and gentle. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes. Regarding your Medicare coverage, most of these tests should be covered, but there may be a small co-pay. We have a billing specialist who can verify the exact cost and coverage for you before proceeding. I can have them contact you after the appointment. We can schedule these tests for later this week, and they shouldn’t take up too much of your time. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… stickers and a quick test… that doesn't sound too bad. And the blood work… well, I guess I can handle it. A small needle, you say? And someone to help me with the cost? Yes, that sounds… okay. Later this week is fine. I have appointments on Tuesday and Wednesday morning, but afternoons are open. But… will I have to wait a long time for the results? I don't want to worry for weeks, you know? And what if something is wrong? Will you tell me right away? I just want to be prepared. And… can I bring my daughter next time? She worries about me too. So many questions, sorry. I just… I get anxious.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Jim. It’s good you’re asking all these questions. We can schedule the tests for Thursday afternoon, then. The lab usually has the results back within 3-5 business days. Once we receive them, we’ll review them thoroughly and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. If anything concerning is detected during the tests, we’ll contact you immediately, rather than waiting for the full results. And absolutely, you can bring your daughter to your follow-up appointment. Having support is a great idea, and she’s welcome to be involved in your care. Now, while we wait for the test results, I would recommend some lifestyle changes. Increasing your physical activity, eating a healthier diet, and managing any stress can all have a positive impact on your health. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds like a good plan. Thursday afternoon is fine. And you'll call if something is wrong… that's good to know. Lifestyle changes… I can try. More walking, less… sweets. And my daughter… yes, she worries too. She’ll be glad to come. Thank you, Doctor. You've… you've been very helpful. I was very anxious, but I feel a little better now. Still worried, but… a little better. I guess… I guess that’s all for now. Unless you need to ask me anything else? I’m ready to go if you are. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jim. I'm glad I could ease your anxiety a bit. It's perfectly normal to feel worried, and I’m here to help you every step of the way. No, I think that covers everything for today. We’ve scheduled your tests for Thursday afternoon, and you’ll be hearing from our office to confirm the details. Just remember to stay positive, take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, Jim. And thank you for coming in.
PATIENT: .
