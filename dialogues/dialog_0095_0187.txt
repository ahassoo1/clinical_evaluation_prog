DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’m Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, yes. Doctor… Vanochten. My chest, it hurts. And… feels like little fish, flapping. Also, wife say blood pressure… too much. I want quick, okay? No long talk.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand you want to keep this brief. Chest pain and a feeling like “little fish flapping,” and your wife is concerned about your blood pressure. We can definitely address those things. First, let’s talk about this chest pain. Can you tell me where exactly in your chest you're feeling it?
PATIENT: Here. Just… here. Not always. When I walk… sometimes. When I worry about bills… also sometimes. Is this need long explain? I don’t like hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, center of the chest, brought on by walking and worry. No, we don’t need a long explanation right now. Just trying to get a clearer picture. Does the pain feel sharp, dull, pressure-like, or something else?
PATIENT: Pressure. Yes, like someone… squeezing. Not sharp, not little pains. Just… squeeze. And sometimes, makes me… short of breath. Wife yells at me to slow down. She always yells.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure in the center of the chest, and it makes you short of breath. That's helpful. And it happens when you walk or when you're worried. Have you ever had this pain before?
PATIENT: Yes. Many years ago. Not so bad then. I just… take rest. But now… older. Maybe it’s worse now. Doctor, you think is serious? I have garden to take care of.
DOCTOR: Okay. Having it previously is good to know. It could be something serious, and that’s why we need to check a few things. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick EKG – that’s a simple test that checks the electrical activity of your heart. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: EKG? Is that poke me with needle? I don't like needle! Blood pressure is okay, wife always check. Just listen… quick. No poke. And no long wait. I have tomatoes need picking.
DOCTOR: No poking with needles right now, Mr. Sobkowicz. The EKG uses some stickers on your chest – nothing sharp involved at all. It’s very quick, I promise. And I'll be as fast as I can. First, let me listen to your heart and lungs. If you could just lie back on the exam table, that would be great.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Stickers, not needle. Good. Hurry, Doctor. Tomatoes don’t pick themselves.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. Take some deep breaths for me, if you would. In… and out… good. I'm hearing a bit of… congestion in your lungs, but nothing immediately alarming. Your heart rate is a little fast, but that could be from being anxious. Now, let’s get those stickers on for the EKG.
PATIENT: Congestion? What is… congestion? Is that bad? Careful, Doctor. My skin is old. Tomatoes are still waiting, you know.
DOCTOR: Just a little fluid buildup in your lungs, Mr. Sobkowicz. It can happen with a lot of things, and isn’t necessarily serious right now. We'll see what the EKG shows and that will give us more information. Okay, just relax for a moment. This will only take about 30 seconds. Try not to move too much. And yes, I'm being careful with your skin.
PATIENT: Thirty seconds... like long time. Wife say I worry too much. Machine… noisy. Is this show something bad already? I feel… funny. Tomatoes… they will be overripe.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz, we're finished with the EKG. The EKG shows some changes… not immediately life-threatening, but it does suggest some possible… irregularity in your heart rhythm and some evidence of prior heart strain. Given your symptoms – the chest pain, shortness of breath, and the changes on the EKG – I think it's best to be cautious. I'm going to recommend you see a cardiologist, a heart specialist, for a more thorough evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Cardiologist? More doctor? I just want to take care of garden! This is too much. Strain? Is like muscle pull? I can rest it. No, no cardiologist. My wife will yell if I spend more money on doctor. I just want some pills, maybe? Something for the squeeze.
DOCTOR: I understand you're hesitant, Mr. Sobkowicz, and I want to respect your wishes. But this isn't just a muscle pull. The “squeeze” you’re feeling could be a sign of something more serious, and ignoring it could lead to bigger problems down the road. While I can't definitively diagnose you without further testing, the changes on the EKG are concerning enough that I strongly recommend seeing a cardiologist. I’m not saying you have a major heart problem, but it's better to be safe than sorry. I can give you a referral, and we can discuss medication options after the cardiologist has had a chance to evaluate you. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Referral... means more waiting. And more doctor talk. Look, can you just give me something for the blood pressure? Wife has pills. Maybe same kind? I just want quiet garden and ripe tomatoes. No more tests. No cardiologist. Please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your reluctance, truly. And I respect your desire to avoid more tests. However, prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis, especially given your symptoms and the EKG results, would be irresponsible. It could mask a serious underlying problem and potentially be harmful. I can write you a prescription for a very mild blood pressure medication, the lowest dose available, to help manage your wife’s concerns. But I will also strongly urge you to reconsider seeing a cardiologist. I’m happy to provide you with a list of specialists in your area. And just to be clear, this does not mean I'm dismissing your concerns or that you definitely have a heart problem. It’s simply a precaution. Will that work for you?
PATIENT: Okay. Okay, small pills. Very small. And you promise no more tests after? Just… small pills. Write it down. And no, no doctor list. I’m too old for more doctors. Just… let me go to garden. Tomatoes are waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. Here is a prescription for a low-dose blood pressure medication. Please follow the dosage instructions carefully. And I strongly encourage you to monitor your symptoms closely. If your chest pain worsens or you experience any new symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention. I’ve documented your refusal of the cardiology referral, but I want you to understand that I’m still concerned about your heart. Do you have any questions about the medication or anything we discussed today?
PATIENT: No questions. Just… small pills. Thank you, Doctor. I’m going now. Tomatoes…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. Get well soon, and enjoy your garden. And please, if anything changes, don't hesitate to call my office. .
PATIENT: .
