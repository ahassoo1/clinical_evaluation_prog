DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. I see you’re 81 years young. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s this tiredness, you see. Just… so tired. It comes and goes, but when it hits, I can barely lift a thing. My husband says I’ve been sleeping more too, which is ridiculous. I always sleep enough. It’s just… weak, is what it is.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Weakness and fatigue. I understand. And this has been going on for… how long, precisely?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It’s not… sudden, like. It’s been creeping up on me. Months, I suppose. Maybe six? It's hard to say, really. Things just… blur together after a while, don’t they? I do remember feeling quite alright last winter, though. Before that… well, I can’t rightly recall. Everything seems a bit mixed up these days.
DOCTOR: Six months, with a recollection of feeling better last winter. That is helpful. Now, Ms. Oitker, can you describe the tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I'm sleepy, not exactly. It's more like… everything feels heavy. My arms, my legs… even talking sometimes feels like a chore. It’s like trying to move through thick mud. And it’s not just after I’ve done something, either. It can hit me even when I've been sitting all day. It just… overwhelms me, you see? It's… unpleasant. And frankly, it's undignified.
DOCTOR: I see. A pervasive sense of heaviness and difficulty, even at rest. And it's affecting your daily activities, I presume?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, absolutely. I used to potter about in the garden, you know. Weeding, planting… all sorts of things. Can't do much of that anymore. My husband, bless him, he does most of it now. And even simple things, like getting dressed… sometimes I have to sit down halfway through. It’s… embarrassing, to be reliant on him for everything. He tries not to show it, but I can tell. He worries. I used to be so capable! It’s just… not right.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Oitker. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your quality of life. Now, let’s delve a little deeper. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue and weakness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. My muscles ache sometimes, a dull sort of ache. Not sharp, just… there. And I've been a bit breathless lately, even just walking to the shops. Not a terrible shortness of breath, mind you, but enough to notice. Oh, and my hands feel a bit numb sometimes, especially in the mornings. Though that could just be the arthritis, you see. It's always flaring up. Everything aches when it rains, you know. It’s difficult to say what’s new and what’s just… old age.
DOCTOR: Muscle aches, breathlessness, and numbness in the hands… we will sort through what is “new” and what is a continuation of existing conditions. Do you have any history of heart problems, Ms. Oitker?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never had a speck of trouble with my heart. My father had a bit of a flutter now and then, but I've always been as strong as an ox. Well, used to be, anyway. My doctor always said I had a good, strong heart. Regular as a clock, he said. No, no heart trouble. And I don’t take any medicines for it, either. Just a little something for the arthritis, now and then. Though it doesn’t do much good, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Very good. And what about any family history of weakness, fatigue, or breathing problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family… that’s a tricky one. My mother… she wasn’t a strong woman, never was. Always tired, she was. But she just put it down to hard work and having too many children. And my brother… he had a bit of a cough, now and then, but nothing serious. Just a winter cold, you know. It's all a bit hazy, honestly. I was always so busy raising my own family, I didn’t pay much attention to their ailments. Though, now that I think about it, my aunt… on my mother's side… she was very weak towards the end. Bedridden, she was. But that was a long time ago, and I barely knew her. So, I don't know if that’s helpful or not. Everything just… blends together, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's often difficult to recall details accurately over time. Now, Ms. Oitker, I'm going to ask a few questions about your daily habits. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband used to smoke, years ago, but he gave it up when we were first married. Said it was bad for me. A very considerate man, my husband. Always looking out for me. No, no smoking. And I don’t drink much alcohol, either. A glass of sherry now and then, with dinner, but nothing excessive. Just a little something to help me relax. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, regarding your diet, would you describe it as generally healthy and balanced?
PATIENT: Oh, well… I try to eat well. Lots of vegetables, you know. My husband grows them in the garden. But I do love a good biscuit with my tea, and I can’t resist a bit of chocolate now and then. And I don’t get out much anymore, so I don’t have much of an appetite. I mostly eat what’s easy to prepare. Soup, toast, things like that. It’s not a bad diet, mind you, but it’s not exactly… exciting. And I do worry about not getting enough vitamins. My daughter keeps telling me I should take supplements, but I forget to buy them. Everything just… slips my mind these days.
DOCTOR: It sounds like a reasonably balanced diet, despite the occasional indulgence and decreased appetite. Now, Ms. Oitker, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I suppose you need to listen to my chest and poke around a bit? Go ahead, dear. Just be gentle, alright? My bones aren't what they used to be. And try not to take too long, I get a bit chilly sitting still.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Oitker. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but nothing alarming. Pulse is good and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Alright. I hear some crackling in the lower part of your lungs, which could indicate some fluid buildup. Now, I'm going to check your thyroid. Thyroid feels normal. And finally, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength. Please extend your arms. Strength is good, but a little diminished. I would like to order some blood tests to help determine the cause of your fatigue and weakness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, blood tests? All that poking and prodding? Well, if you think it's necessary, Doctor. I don’t particularly like needles, but I suppose I can suffer a bit if it will help me feel better. What sort of things will they be looking for? And will it take long? I have a bridge game on Thursday, you see, and I wouldn't want to miss that. It's the highlight of my week!
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Oitker. It won’t take long – just a standard blood draw. The phlebotomist is very skilled. We’ll be looking for a complete blood count to check for anemia or infection, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, a thyroid panel to rule out thyroid issues, and a Vitamin D level, as it can contribute to fatigue and weakness. We will also check your B12 levels. These tests will give us a better understanding of what might be causing your symptoms. It should take only about 15-20 minutes, and the results usually come back within a few days. That will leave you plenty of time for your bridge game on Thursday. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright then. A few days is acceptable. And you say it won't take long? Good. I do hate being stuck in doctors' offices all day. I suppose I should ask… will it hurt much? And will I be able to drive home afterwards? I don't want to risk anything. My husband usually drives me, but he's busy with the garden club this week, you see. He’s very involved. A good man, my husband. Always busy, always helpful. It's just… I prefer to be independent, if you know what I mean. Still, if you think it's necessary, I suppose I can manage. Just… be quick, alright dear? And try not to leave a big bruise. I have a lovely cardigan I want to wear to the bridge game. It's blue, you see…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Oitker. The blood draw itself will cause only a brief, mild pinch, and it's over very quickly. The phlebotomist is very experienced at minimizing discomfort. You will be perfectly safe to drive home afterwards, as long as you feel well. We'll make sure you're feeling stable before you leave. As long as you don't experience any dizziness or faintness, you should have no trouble driving. And we will be as gentle as possible to avoid bruising. I'll make a note to request a small bandage and extra care during the draw. We will have you seated comfortably while the blood is drawn and take things slow, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, Doctor. A small bandage would be lovely. And I do appreciate you taking things slow. My nerves aren’t what they used to be. Alright then… let's get it over with. I suppose the sooner it's done, the sooner I can get back to my bridge game. And hopefully, find out what’s making me feel so tired all the time. Though, honestly, at my age, one expects a bit of tiredness, don't they? Still, it's nice to know you're trying to help. A good doctor is worth their weight in gold, you know. Now, where do I sit? And is there somewhere I can rest my handbag? It's rather heavy, you see…
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Oitker. Please, have a seat here. You can place your handbag on the table. The phlebotomist, Sarah, will be with you in just a moment. She's very skilled and will explain everything to you step by step. While you wait, perhaps you’d like a glass of water?
PATIENT: Oh, water would be lovely, dear. Thank you. It's a warm day, you see, and I do get a bit dehydrated easily. A glass of water sounds just perfect. And you said her name was Sarah? A nice name. I do like a friendly face when I'm having needles. It always makes things a bit easier, you know. Honestly, I don't know what I’d do without kind people like you and Sarah helping me along. It's not easy getting old, you see. Everything aches, everything tires… and one forgets so much! Still, one keeps going, doesn't one? One has to. Now, where is Sarah? I suppose she's very busy… and I don't want to rush her. I can wait a few minutes, I suppose. Though, the longer I sit here, the more nervous I get! Still, one must be patient, mustn't one? Now, about that bridge game… I do hope I haven't forgotten any of the rules…
DOCTOR: Yes, patience is key, Ms. Oitker. And I assure you, you will remember the rules to bridge. It's like riding a bicycle – you never truly forget. Sarah?
PATIENT: Oh, hello, Ms. Oitker. Dr. Paraskevopoulos mentioned you were here for some blood work. I'm Sarah, and I'll be taking care of you today. Is this your first time having blood drawn at our clinic? We’ll get you all taken care of quickly, okay? Do you have a preferred arm? And is there anything I can do to make you feel more comfortable?
