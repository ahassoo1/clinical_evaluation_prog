DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need to get this life insurance thing done. They sent me over here for a check-up, I guess. Want to get it over with quick, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. A life insurance physical… we can definitely do that. Just need to gather some information first. Let’s start with the basics. Do you have any current medical problems, anything you're being treated for right now?
PATIENT: Not really. Just… getting older, I guess. My knees bother me sometimes, but that’s about it. No one's treating me for anything, if that makes sense. I try to tough it out.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees bothering you… that’s good to know. And how long have your knees been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez… a while now. Years, probably. On and off, you know? Worse when it’s cold, or if I’ve been walking a lot. It’s just… old age, like I said. Nothing serious. I don't need surgery or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides your knees, are you having any other pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Sometimes my back gets a little stiff, but I think that's from lifting stuff at work. I'm a lodging manager, so there's always something to move around. Nothing I can't handle with a little stretching, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, lodging manager… good to know. Any trouble breathing, chest pain, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Nope. Breathing’s fine. No chest pain or… whatever you said. Pal-pi-ta-shuns? Sounds scary. I haven’t had any of that. I walk around a lot at work, so I feel pretty good, actually. Usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let's do a quick run-through of some other things. Have you had any major illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… uh… when I was a kid, I had the usual stuff, chickenpox and all that. But nothing serious, nothing I was in the hospital for. When I got older… I broke my wrist a few years back, working at the hotel. That was a quick trip to the emergency room, but I wasn't staying overnight. That’s about it, I think. Honestly, I try not to go to the doctor unless I have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, chickenpox as a child, broken wrist a few years ago… good to know. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Always been pretty lucky, I guess. I try to avoid them if I can. My ex-wife had a bunch, but me? Nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… uh… my mom passed away a few years back, heart trouble. Dad’s still around, but he's getting up there. He has high blood pressure, I think. And my sister… she's okay, as far as I know. No major health problems that I'm aware of. It's been a while since we talked, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. My ex-wife was allergic to shellfish, but I’m good. Never had a problem. I think I would know if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you would. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Nah. Don’t take anything regularly. Maybe some ibuprofen for my knees if they’re really acting up, but that’s about it. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. Makes me feel sluggish.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mr. Putney. Just need to do a quick physical exam now. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, just the basics. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Let's just get it over with. The quicker the better, right?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat here. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Okay. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now let me check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 142/90. Pulse is 78. Now, can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. 142? Is that bad? My dad's blood pressure is always high, too. Maybe it runs in the family.
DOCTOR: It's a little higher than we’d like, but not immediately concerning. Family history is important. Now, let’s just check your reflexes, and a quick look at your throat and ears. Everything looks good in your throat and ears. Now, just a quick listen to your abdomen. Abdomen sounds normal. Everything seems okay so far, Mr. Putney. I do want to note your weight is 97 pounds. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, that sounds right. I haven't weighed myself in a while, but that’s about right. I used to be heavier, lost some weight after the divorce. It’s hard to keep track, to be honest. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: It’s something we need to be aware of, Mr. Putney. Your height is 174cm and weight is 97lbs is underweight, which can sometimes contribute to health concerns. I recommend we get some blood work done just to get a baseline and rule out anything else that might be contributing to your weight and slightly elevated blood pressure. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Blood work… ugh. Look, I just need this life insurance thing done. Is the blood work required for the insurance? I really don’t want to have to come back for more stuff. Can't you just… write something down and I can get it over with?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Putney. Unfortunately, the insurance company will likely require a basic health screening, including blood work, to assess your risk. It’s standard procedure. It doesn’t take long, and it will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. We can order it right here at the clinic. It’s just a simple draw, and we’ll get the results back quickly. I can also provide you with some resources on maintaining a healthy weight and managing blood pressure, if you’re interested. But the blood work is the first step. Would you like me to go ahead and order that for you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Order the blood work. I don't want to keep coming back here. And no, I don't want any brochures or resources. Just do the test.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. Here’s the requisition slip. You can take this to the lab across the hall. They'll take care of everything. We’ll get the results back in a few days. Once we have those results, we can discuss them and send the necessary information to your insurance company. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
