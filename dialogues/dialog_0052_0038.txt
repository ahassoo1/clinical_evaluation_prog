DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is lovely to meet you as well. Um… honestly, I’m not entirely sure what prompted me to make the appointment, beyond a… a feeling that I should. I believe it had something to do with paperwork… something about future… wishes? I apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I was told it’s called an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I’m hoping you can assist me with that.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconi. It’s very proactive of you to address this now. Advance Care Planning – including documents like Advance Directives and POLST forms – is an important part of healthcare. It sounds like you may have received some information regarding these forms and are seeking guidance in completing them. To best assist you, let's start with a general overview. An Advance Directive outlines your wishes for medical care should you become unable to communicate them yourself. A POLST form, or Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment, is a medical order that specifies which medical treatments you want or don't want. Before we delve into the specifics of completing these forms, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, that clarifies things, thank you. It’s… a bit overwhelming, to be frank. I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. As for my health… well, I try to stay active. I do a fair amount of walking, though not as much as I used to. My work, etching and engraving, requires a steady hand and good eyesight, thankfully still holding up. I don’t have any… major diagnoses that I’m aware of. I see a general practitioner for yearly check-ups, but nothing significant has come up in recent years. I had a… a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but recovered fully. Other than that… I honestly couldn’t say. I don’t recall any ongoing medical issues. It’s difficult to keep track, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Buoniconi. It can be a lot to remember. It’s good to hear you’re generally active and that your yearly check-ups haven't revealed any significant concerns. And it’s helpful to know about the pneumonia you experienced. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me if you’ve had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Yes… I believe so. When I was quite young, I had my tonsils removed. A standard procedure, I suppose. And… I think I had a minor procedure on my wrist, years ago, related to a… a small injury from my work. It wasn’t particularly serious, just a local anesthetic and a few stitches. I’m afraid that’s all I can recall. It was a long time ago, and the details are… hazy. Do you need specifics? I doubt I have any records readily available.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconi. Knowing what procedures you’ve had is more important at this stage than the specifics. We can always look into obtaining records if needed. Now, could you tell me about your family’s medical history, if you're comfortable sharing?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… a difficult question. My family is… was… quite large, spread across Mongolia and… elsewhere. Communication wasn’t always easy. I know my mother lived to a very old age, thankfully, but I don’t recall any specific illnesses she suffered from. My father… he passed away when I was young. I believe he had heart problems, but again, the details are vague. I had several siblings, but I’ve lost contact with most of them over the years. I don’t have much information about their health either. I apologize for my lack of clarity. It’s not that I don’t want to share, it’s simply that I don’t remember. Is it alright if we move on? Perhaps focusing on my own wishes would be more productive at this point?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconi. Your comfort is my priority. We can absolutely focus on your own wishes. It’s perfectly understandable that family medical history is difficult to recall, especially with a large and geographically dispersed family. Let’s talk about your current medications. Are you taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take a multivitamin, just a standard daily dose. And occasionally, when my hands are particularly sore from my work, I take ibuprofen. Nothing prescribed, just over-the-counter. That’s… I believe that’s it. I don’t regularly take anything else. I used to take something for… for mild anxiety, years ago, but I stopped that quite some time ago. It wasn’t… necessary anymore. Is that helpful? I strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle, so I avoid medication whenever possible.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Buoniconi. It’s good to know you prioritize a healthy lifestyle. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I do get a mild seasonal allergy to… to certain pollens, perhaps. It causes a bit of sneezing and a runny nose, but nothing requiring medication. Aside from that… no, I don’t think I have any significant allergies. I’m quite fortunate in that regard, actually. It’s another reason I prefer to avoid unnecessary medication.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That gives me a good overview of your medical background, Ms. Buoniconi. Now, before we discuss your wishes for an Advance Directive or POLST form, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline understanding of your current health status. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand the need for a baseline assessment. Please, proceed. I trust your expertise. I’m… not particularly fond of medical examinations, but I recognize their importance. Just… please be gentle with my hands, if possible. They are rather crucial to my work.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconi. I will be as gentle as possible, especially with your hands. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular, respiration rate is 16, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. All within normal limits. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. Finally, I’ll take a quick look at your hands. Your hands appear to be in good condition, with no obvious signs of injury or inflammation. You mentioned they are crucial to your work, and I can see why. Range of motion appears full and without pain. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. Everything appears to be within normal limits. Do you have any questions about my findings?
PATIENT: That’s… very reassuring, Doctor. Thank you. No, I don’t believe I have any questions at this time. It’s a great comfort to know everything appears to be… functioning as it should. Perhaps I worry too much. Now, shall we proceed with discussing the Advance Directive and POLST form? I confess, I’m still somewhat uncertain about the specifics, and a little apprehensive about making such… definitive statements.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Buoniconi. It is a significant decision, and it’s natural to feel apprehensive. We’ll take our time and go through everything at your pace. Let's start with the Advance Directive. This document allows you to appoint a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. It also allows you to outline your wishes regarding specific medical treatments, such as life-sustaining measures. Do you have someone in mind who you would trust to be your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. I don’t have any… close family nearby. My siblings are… distant, and I haven’t maintained regular contact. I do have a colleague, Mr. Jian, who I’ve known for many years. He’s a very sensible and compassionate man. He understands my work, and he’s quite… level-headed. I suppose he would be the most suitable choice. Though, I haven’t explicitly discussed this with him. Would it be appropriate to list him as a potential proxy, even without his prior consent? I wouldn’t want to put him in an awkward position.
DOCTOR: That's a very considerate question, Ms. Buoniconi. It's always best to discuss this with the person you intend to name as your healthcare proxy before formally listing them. It’s important that they understand the responsibilities involved and are willing to take on the role. You can certainly list him as a potential proxy, but it’s crucial to have that conversation with him first. We can provide you with some information to share with Mr. Jian, outlining the responsibilities and expectations of a healthcare proxy. In the meantime, let's talk about your general wishes regarding medical treatment. If you were facing a life-threatening illness, what are your priorities?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question to contemplate. I suppose… my priority would be maintaining my dignity, above all else. I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially, if there was no reasonable hope of recovery. I value quality of life, and I wouldn’t want to be a burden on others. I wouldn’t want to be… simply existing, without any capacity for joy or meaningful interaction. I understand the importance of medical intervention, but I also believe there is a time to… accept the inevitable. I’ve always been a pragmatic person, and I believe it’s important to be realistic about one’s limitations. I hope that doesn’t sound… morbid. It’s just… my perspective. I believe in alleviating pain and suffering, but I wouldn’t want to be prolonged indefinitely in a state of… helplessness. Perhaps that clarifies my wishes?
DOCTOR: That clarifies your wishes perfectly, Ms. Buoniconi. It’s not morbid at all. It’s very thoughtful and courageous of you to articulate these preferences. You’ve expressed a strong desire to maintain dignity and quality of life, and a clear preference against prolonged life-sustaining treatment in the absence of reasonable hope of recovery. Now, let's discuss the POLST form. This is a medical order that specifies which life-sustaining treatments you want or don't want. It’s more specific than an Advance Directive and requires a physician’s signature. We can discuss options such as Do Not Resuscitate , Do Not Intubate , and preferences regarding artificial nutrition and hydration. Would you like me to explain these options in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. I confess, I’m unfamiliar with these terms. I understand the concept of a medical order, but I’m not sure what each option entails. I believe I read something about resuscitation… but the details are… hazy. Perhaps you could explain them in simple terms, and we can discuss which options align with my wishes? I’m particularly concerned about being kept alive artificially, if there is no reasonable hope of recovery, as we previously discussed. I want to ensure my wishes are clearly documented, so there is no ambiguity.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconi. Let’s start with Do Not Resuscitate, or DNR. This means that if your heart stops or you stop breathing, we will not perform CPR or other life-saving measures. It's important to understand that this doesn't mean we won't provide any care; it simply means we won't attempt to restart your heart or breathing if they have stopped and there is no reasonable hope of recovery. Do Not Intubate, or DNI, means that we will not insert a breathing tube if you are unable to breathe on your own. As for artificial nutrition and hydration, this refers to providing fluids and nourishment through an IV or feeding tube. You can specify whether you want to receive these interventions, and under what circumstances. It’s important to remember that these are all choices. You are in control, and we will respect your wishes. Considering your previously expressed desire to avoid prolonged life-sustaining treatment, would you be comfortable with a DNR order?
PATIENT: A DNR order… Yes, I believe I would be comfortable with that. If there is no reasonable hope of recovery, I wouldn’t want to be subjected to… aggressive interventions. I understand the intention behind CPR, but I believe it’s important to be realistic about one’s limitations. Prolonging my life artificially in such circumstances wouldn’t align with my wishes. However… I’m a little uncertain about the specifics. What constitutes “no reasonable hope of recovery”? Who makes that determination? I wouldn’t want to leave that decision entirely up to others. I’d like to ensure there is a clear process in place, and that my wishes are taken into account. Perhaps there’s a way to specify certain criteria, or to involve Mr. Jian in the decision-making process? I apologize for being so… cautious, but I want to ensure my wishes are clearly documented and respected.
DOCTOR: You are not being cautious at all, Ms. Buoniconi. These are very important questions, and it’s excellent that you’re thinking through them so carefully. The determination of “no reasonable hope of recovery” is made by a physician, in consultation with your healthcare proxy – in this case, Mr. Jian. It’s based on a comprehensive assessment of your medical condition, prognosis, and your expressed wishes. We can certainly document your preferences regarding this determination in your medical record. For example, we can specify that Mr. Jian's input is crucial in the decision-making process, and that his understanding of your values and wishes should be taken into account. We can also specify certain criteria that would indicate a lack of reasonable hope of recovery, if you wish. Would you like me to draft a statement outlining these preferences?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be wonderful. A statement outlining those preferences would be… immensely helpful. Specifying Mr. Jian’s involvement and documenting my wishes regarding the determination of “no reasonable hope of recovery” would give me… peace of mind. And perhaps we could also include a section outlining my desire to avoid artificial nutrition and hydration in the absence of a reasonable expectation of recovery? I believe that aligns with my overall wishes. I apologize for being so… detailed, but I want to ensure everything is clearly documented and respected. This is… a very important decision, and I want to ensure my wishes are honored.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconi. It’s not being detailed at all; it’s being thorough and responsible. It’s my job to ensure your wishes are clearly documented and honored. I’m drafting a statement outlining your wishes regarding a Do Not Resuscitate order, the importance of Mr. Jian’s input in end-of-life decisions, and your preference against artificial nutrition and hydration in the absence of a reasonable expectation of recovery. I’m also including a clause specifying that these wishes should be regularly reviewed and updated as needed. Here’s the draft. Please take a few moments to review it, and let me know if you’d like me to make any changes. I want to ensure it accurately reflects your wishes.
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, this looks… very good. The language is clear and concise, and it accurately reflects my wishes. The inclusion of Mr. Jian’s involvement is particularly reassuring. Perhaps we could change “reasonable expectation of recovery” to “reasonable prospect of recovery”? It feels… slightly more precise. And could we also add a clause specifying my desire for pain management and palliative care, regardless of the outcome? I want to ensure my comfort is prioritized, even if a full recovery isn’t possible. Other than those minor adjustments, this looks… perfect. Thank you for taking the time to document my wishes so thoroughly. It gives me… a great deal of peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconi. I’ve made the changes to reflect “reasonable prospect of recovery” and added a clause specifying your desire for pain management and palliative care. Here’s the revised draft. Please take one last look to ensure everything is to your satisfaction. Once you’ve approved the document, I’ll have you sign it, and we’ll add it to your medical record. We’ll also provide you with a copy for your records. We can also share it with Mr. Jian, if you wish. Does this sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, this is… perfect. Everything is accurately documented, and it accurately reflects my wishes. I’m very pleased with the outcome. Thank you for taking the time to assist me with this. It’s… a weight off my shoulders, knowing my wishes are clearly documented and respected. Please, proceed with adding it to my medical record. And yes, please share a copy with Mr. Jian. He’ll be grateful to know my wishes. Is there anything else I need to do at this time? Or are we finished with this process?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Buoniconi. The document has been added to your medical record, and I’ll send a secure electronic copy to Mr. Jian immediately. We are finished with this process. You’ve done a wonderful job articulating your wishes, and I commend you for taking proactive steps to ensure your end-of-life care aligns with your values. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s everything. You’ve been… exceptionally helpful, and I appreciate your patience and understanding. I think I’ll be going now. Thank you again for everything. And thank you for making this process… less daunting than I anticipated. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Buoniconi. It was my pleasure assisting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day, and take care. .
