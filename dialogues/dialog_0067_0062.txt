DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Pfennig. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I am here today regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the masks, or the protective equipment, and a request for an exemption, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So this is related to your job and a potential need for a medical exemption regarding mask-wearing. Can you tell me a bit more about your work environment and what specifically is making you consider an exemption?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I work as a Protective Service Worker – I assist folks who need help with various situations. It's... a hands-on job, you see. A lot of direct contact, and a good deal of it involves working with individuals who can be quite distressed. The masks, while I understand their purpose, make it exceedingly difficult to communicate effectively, and sometimes, it’s vital to read people’s expressions. It also makes it harder for them to understand me clearly. It's a delicate balance, trying to provide support while also maintaining safety, and the masks feel like a significant obstacle in that regard.
DOCTOR: I see. A protective service worker – that certainly sounds challenging, and effective communication is crucial in your line of work. It's good you’re thinking about all sides of this. To help me assess whether an exemption is appropriate, could you tell me if you’ve experienced any specific difficulties while wearing a mask on the job?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. On three separate occasions now, I’ve had individuals become quite agitated because they couldn’t understand what I was saying, even when speaking clearly and slowly. One time, it escalated to the point where they became physically distressed and required additional assistance from my colleagues to de-escalate the situation. Another instance involved a misunderstanding regarding their medication schedule, which caused unnecessary anxiety for them. And just last week, a client simply refused to engage with me at all because they said I looked “unfriendly” with the mask on. It's not that they were intentionally being difficult, it’s just... the mask changes things. It creates a barrier, you understand?
DOCTOR: I do understand. Those sound like very difficult situations, and it’s concerning that the mask may be hindering your ability to provide effective care and support. To get a better picture, have you tried different types of masks – perhaps a clear face shield or a mask with a window?
PATIENT: That is a thoughtful question, Doctor. Yes, I have. My employer provided us with several options. I’ve tried the N95 masks, the surgical masks, and even one of those clear face shields. The N95s are just… impossible to breathe in for extended periods while doing the work I do. The surgical masks are a little better, but still muffle my voice considerably. And the face shield… well, it fogs up constantly, which defeats the purpose entirely. It’s quite frustrating, honestly. It feels like we’re trying to find a solution that simply doesn't exist for my particular circumstances.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know you've already explored those options. It sounds like you've given this a lot of thought. Now, let's shift gears a little. Do you have any underlying medical conditions – anything at all, even if you don't think it’s related – that might make wearing a mask more difficult for you?
PATIENT: That is a very fair question, Doctor. Let me see... I do have some mild asthma, though it's generally well-controlled with an inhaler. I haven’t needed to use it very often, thankfully. And I have a history of sinus infections, which sometimes cause congestion, making it harder to breathe through my nose in general. Other than that, I’m reasonably healthy for a man my age. I do take medication for high blood pressure, but it's a low dose and doesn't typically cause any issues. I believe that’s everything of note.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Mr. Knabenshue. It’s helpful to have a complete picture. And to clarify, you currently are using an inhaler for your asthma, even if infrequently?
PATIENT: Not currently, Doctor, no. I haven't needed to use it for several months now. I keep it on hand, just in case, but my symptoms have been very well-managed without regular use. It's more of a precaution, to be honest. I only reach for it when I experience a flare-up, which hasn't happened recently. I apologize if I wasn’t clear earlier. I tend to mention it because it is something my primary care physician monitors, but it's not an ongoing, daily concern.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, thank you for clarifying. It's good to know it's well-controlled. Okay, one last question before we do a quick physical exam. Have you had a COVID-19 test recently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My employer requires regular testing, regardless of vaccination status. I had a test last week – on July 29th, I believe – and it came back negative. I can provide documentation if you require it. I understand the importance of safety for everyone, and I am committed to following all necessary protocols. I just wish there was a way to balance that with the needs of the individuals I serve.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that's reassuring. It sounds like you are being very diligent. Okay, let's do a quick examination, just to assess your respiratory function and general health. Could you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Thank you. I am ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular and strong. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, though I do detect some mild wheezing on exhale. It’s very subtle, and likely related to your history of asthma, even if it's well-controlled. Blood pressure is 138/82, and pulse is 72 and regular. Throat looks clear, and ears are also normal. No signs of congestion. Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Everything seems within normal limits. The mild wheezing is the only finding of note, but it doesn't appear to be acutely impacting your breathing.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Pfennig. I appreciate your thoroughness. I am relieved to hear everything else seems normal. It does not surprise me to hear about the mild wheezing, given my history. So, what are your thoughts on the exemption request, considering everything we’ve discussed? Do you think it is a reasonable consideration, given my circumstances and the challenges I face at work?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. Considering your role as a Protective Service Worker, the difficulties you've experienced with communication while wearing a mask, your attempts to find alternative options, your well-controlled asthma, and the negative COVID-19 test, I believe a medical exemption may be reasonable. However, I want to be very clear: this comes with certain caveats. First, I would need to document this exemption thoroughly, outlining the potential risks and benefits, and emphasizing the importance of strict adherence to other safety protocols – frequent handwashing, social distancing when possible, and heightened awareness of any potential symptoms. Second, your employer may require additional testing or alternative safety measures, and I would fully support those. Finally, and most importantly, this exemption is contingent on maintaining your current health status. Any significant changes in your respiratory condition would require reassessment. I recommend we write a letter to your employer detailing these points. Would you like me to proceed with drafting that letter for you?
PATIENT: That sounds very reasonable, Doctor Pfennig. I completely understand the caveats, and I am fully prepared to adhere to strict safety protocols and any additional measures my employer may require. I would be more than happy for you to draft a letter outlining everything we’ve discussed. I trust your professional judgement, and I appreciate your willingness to advocate for me in this matter. Thank you for taking the time to listen and consider my concerns. It means a great deal to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m happy to help. I'll draft the letter now. It will take a few minutes. While I’m doing that, do you have any questions for me, or is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Pfennig, I believe that covers everything. I am confident that the letter will be sufficient, and I truly appreciate your time and attention to this matter. You’ve been very helpful. I think I’ll just wait here quietly while you draft it. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. Here is the letter I drafted for your employer. Please review it carefully and let me know if you have any changes you'd like me to make. It outlines your role, the communication challenges you’ve faced with mask-wearing, your attempts at alternative options, your medical history, and my recommendation for a medical exemption with the caveats we discussed. It also includes a statement of my willingness to collaborate with your employer to ensure your safety and the safety of those you serve. Please note the section regarding regular monitoring of your respiratory health. We should schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to reassess your condition. Do you have any immediate questions or concerns about the letter?
