DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kalinski. It is nice to meet you too. I am here for… the telehealth appointment, yes? They told me on the phone. I think it is to just… check how I am doing. It has been a while since my husband… passed.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, I understand. The appointment was scheduled as a follow-up to see how you’re coping after your loss, and to address any health concerns you might have. It’s perfectly normal to need support during a difficult time like this. Perhaps we can start by talking a little about how you’ve been feeling since your husband’s passing. Are you comfortable discussing that?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. It is… hard. Some days are better than others, you know? Mostly I just… try to keep busy. The work helps. I fix cars. I have my own shop. But sometimes… at night… it is quiet. Very quiet. And I miss him. I don’t sleep so good then.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Benites. It sounds like you’re managing a great deal, and keeping busy is a very healthy coping mechanism. It’s also very common to experience increased difficulty with sleep after such a significant loss. The quiet can be particularly challenging, as it allows more space for those feelings of grief and longing. You mentioned not sleeping well. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well… I go to bed at a normal time, I think. Around ten, maybe? But I… toss and turn. And my mind… it races. I think about everything. About him, about the shop, about bills… everything. And then I just… lie there. Sometimes I get up and read, but it doesn’t help much. I just feel… tired all the time. It's been like this for… a long time now. Maybe six months?
DOCTOR: Six months is a significant period, Ms. Benites. It’s not uncommon for grief to impact sleep patterns for an extended time, but persistent difficulty like you’re describing warrants further attention. It sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of insomnia, potentially related to the grief process. Just to get a clearer picture, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the sleep disturbance?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… let me think. I… I don’t have much appetite, I guess. I eat, but not like I used to. And sometimes… I feel very sad. More sad than usual. I try not to let it show at the shop, but… it is hard. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven't done much of that lately either. I just… don’t feel like it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Benites. That’s helpful to know. Loss of appetite, persistent sadness, and a decreased interest in activities you once enjoyed – these are all common symptoms that can accompany grief, and they may indicate a need for further support. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels throughout the day?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Very little energy. I can get through the work, but it takes a lot of effort. And when I get home… I just sit. I watch television, sometimes. Or I just… stare at the wall. I used to go for walks, but now… no. Too tired. And… I feel… heavy. Not physically, but… inside. It is hard to explain. It’s like… a weight on my chest.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly draining, Ms. Benites. The feeling of heaviness you describe, and the lack of energy, are both consistent with what we often see following a significant loss. It sounds like you’re carrying a very heavy emotional burden. Before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. I do not take anything. And no allergies, not that I know of. I eat everything. Except beets. I do not like beets. But that is a food preference, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Benites. Beets are… not universally loved. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder out, many years ago. Maybe twenty years? And I broke my arm once, when I was a child. But nothing else, not that I remember. I usually stay very healthy. I work hard, I eat good food… well, except for the beets. And I don’t drink or smoke.
DOCTOR: Okay, cholecystectomy twenty years ago, and a childhood arm fracture. Otherwise, generally healthy. No smoking or alcohol use. That’s very good to know. Now, can you tell me a little about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: My mother… she had problems with her heart, when she was older. She passed away when I was maybe… forty? And my father… he had diabetes. He lost his leg because of it. But that was a long time ago. My brother is healthy, as far as I know. We don't see each other much.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal history of heart problems, paternal history of diabetes. Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Benites. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your throat and ears. It will just take a few minutes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Benites. That’s very kind of you to say. Alright, Ms. Benites, everything sounds within normal limits. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that’s not uncommon with stress and anxiety. Your heart and lungs sound good, and your throat and ears are clear. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with prolonged grief. It's impacting your sleep, appetite, energy levels, and overall mood. While these symptoms are common after a loss, they've been present for six months and are affecting your daily life. We need to consider a few possibilities and decide on the best course of action. Would you be comfortable with me ordering some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes for your fatigue and changes in appetite?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will help, I am happy to have the blood work. I want to feel… better. I just… want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Benites. And we'll do everything we can to help you get there. The blood work will help us rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms, such as thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. We'll also check your blood sugar to get a baseline. The lab technician will take a small sample of blood from your arm. Do you have any concerns about that?
PATIENT: No, no concerns. I have had blood work before. It is just… a little pinch, yes? It is okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: That’s right, just a little pinch. It doesn’t take long. I’ll write the order now, and then you can go to the lab just down the hall. They'll take care of you. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I think it would be beneficial to discuss some strategies for managing your grief and improving your sleep. Have you considered talking to a therapist or grief counselor?
PATIENT: A therapist? Hmm… I haven’t. I always thought… I should be strong. My husband… he was the strong one. I don't know… it feels strange, talking to someone about my feelings.
DOCTOR: That's a very common feeling, Ms. Benites. It takes courage to ask for help, and it’s perfectly natural to feel hesitant. It’s also understandable that you feel like you should be strong, especially after losing your husband. But seeking support doesn't mean you’re weak; it means you're taking care of yourself. A therapist can provide a safe and confidential space for you to process your grief, develop coping strategies, and learn ways to manage your feelings. I have a list of qualified therapists in the area who specialize in grief counseling. Would you be interested in me sharing that list with you?
PATIENT: Yes… maybe. A list would be… helpful. I don't want to commit to anything right now, but… to have the names… that is okay. If I decide… I can look at it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Benites. That's perfectly fine. Here is a list of therapists in the area with experience in grief counseling. It includes their contact information and a brief description of their approach. Take your time reviewing it. There's no pressure to make a decision right away. While we wait for the blood work, I recommend practicing some relaxation techniques before bed. Things like deep breathing exercises or gentle stretching can help calm your mind and improve your sleep. Would you like me to share some resources with you on those techniques as well?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… kind. I try to stay busy, but… maybe something to help me calm down before sleep… that would be good. I just want to be able to sleep through the night, like I used to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Benites. Here is a handout with some relaxation techniques, including deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation. It also includes some tips for improving your sleep hygiene, such as maintaining a regular sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine. We’ll also discuss your blood work results when they come back, and we can tailor a plan to address your specific needs. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think… that is all for now. Thank you, Doctor Kalinski. You have been… very helpful. It is nice to talk to someone who understands.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. It’s my pleasure. Remember, taking care of yourself is the most important thing right now. Please take your time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. The lab is just down the hall to your left. Once you've had the blood work done, feel free to schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the results. Have a good day, Ms. Benites, and please take care.
