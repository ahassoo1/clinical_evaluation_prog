DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… my sinuses. They… they bother me. A lot of pressure, mostly. I don't… I don't remember exactly when it started, but it's been a little while.
DOCTOR: Okay, sinus pressure. I understand. And you said it's been going on for a little while… can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific…? Oh dear. Hmm… Maybe… a month? Or two? It’s hard to say. Things… they all feel a bit mixed up sometimes. I mostly just feel… stuffed up. And a little bit of a headache, behind my eyes. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: A month or two, okay. And the headache is behind your eyes… that can be common with sinus issues, yes. It sounds like you're experiencing some congestion and pressure. Just to get a better idea, is the congestion constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days are worse than others. When I… when I work, it feels a little bit better. But when I rest… it feels worse. Does that make sense? I do… a lot of drilling. For oil. It’s a… a hard job.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. So, it's worse when you're resting, and feels a little better when you’re working… interesting. The drilling… is there a lot of dust or fumes involved in your job?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Plenty of dust. And… smells. Strong smells. I try to… to wear something over my face, but it doesn’t always help. It’s just… the job. We need the oil. But it… it doesn't always agree with me, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, dust and fumes… that's definitely something we need to consider. And you mentioned trying to wear something over your face - is that a mask?
PATIENT: Yes, a mask. A… a paper one. The ones they give us at work. It helps a little, but… it doesn't stop everything. It’s better than nothing, I suppose. Do you… do you think the dust is causing my sinuses? I don’t know much about these things.
DOCTOR: It certainly could be contributing, yes. Exposure to dust and fumes is a common irritant for the sinuses. Alright, let's do a quick exam, if you don't mind. I'll take a look at your ears, nose, and throat, and listen to your lungs just to get a baseline. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. My ears too? Is something wrong with my ears? I haven't noticed anything… but maybe… I don't always pay attention.
DOCTOR: It’s just routine, Mikeisha. Checking your ears helps rule out any related issues that could be contributing to the pressure you’re feeling. It’s a quick look, and doesn’t necessarily mean I suspect something is wrong. Okay, your ears look clear. Your nasal passages are a bit inflamed and there’s some mucus present, which is expected with sinus pressure. Your throat looks a little red as well. I'm listening to your lungs now... everything sounds clear on both sides. No wheezing or crackling, which is good. It sounds like we’re dealing with a pretty standard case of sinus inflammation. Do you have any fever, or any pain in your teeth or face?
PATIENT: No fever. I… I don’t think so. I haven't measured it. And… no pain in my teeth. Sometimes my face feels… heavy. Like pressure, all around. But not pain. It's hard to explain. It’s just… uncomfortable. A lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, no tooth pain, just a feeling of pressure and heaviness in your face. That helps. Now, have you tried anything to relieve the symptoms already?
PATIENT: Um… yes. At work, one of my coworkers, she told me to try… to put warm water on my face. Like a… a steam. It helped a little, for a few minutes. But then it came back. I don't really know what else to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so warm compresses have provided some temporary relief. That's good to know. Since you're uninsured, we need to be mindful of cost-effective options. Let's start with a saline nasal rinse, like a Neti pot or a squeeze bottle, twice a day. It helps clear the nasal passages and reduce inflammation. Are you familiar with those?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. A… a Neti pot? I’ve never heard of that. Is it… expensive? I don’t have much money. I just… I want to feel better.
DOCTOR: No, they're actually quite inexpensive, usually under $20. You can find them at most pharmacies. They’re just a little pot you fill with saltwater, and you rinse your sinuses with it. I can show you a quick video on how to use one. It might seem strange at first, but a lot of people find them really helpful. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. You put the water in your nose, and it goes out the other side? It looks… strange. But if it helps… I suppose I can try. Is the water supposed to be warm? And… does it hurt? I don’t like pain.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. It goes in one nostril and out the other. And you're right to ask about the water - it should be lukewarm, not hot or cold. And it shouldn't hurt, although it can feel a little odd at first. Make sure you use distilled or sterile water, not tap water. I'll write down instructions for you, including a link to a helpful video. If the symptoms don’t improve after a week of doing the nasal rinses twice a day, we might consider a short course of decongestants. But let’s try the rinses first, and see how you feel. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… good. Distilled water. And lukewarm. I will remember. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. I… I hope this works. It is very kind of you to not suggest expensive things right away.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mikeisha. I’m glad I could help. And you’re right, we want to start with the simplest, most affordable options first. Here you go. It also includes some advice on keeping your nasal passages moist, which can help prevent future flare-ups. Now, one last thing – do you spend a lot of time around dust or smoke outside of work?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I mostly stay home when I’m not working. My husband… he does the gardening. And sometimes, he burns leaves. But I try to stay inside when he does that. Does that matter? Is burning leaves bad for sinuses too?
DOCTOR: It can be, yes. Smoke is an irritant just like dust. Try to avoid being exposed to it as much as possible. Okay, so let’s start with the saline rinses, avoiding smoke, and keeping your nasal passages moist. If your symptoms don’t improve after a week, or if they get worse, please give the clinic a call, and we can discuss other options. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you, Doctor Auelua. I really appreciate your help. I will try my best with the water. And I will avoid the smoke. It was very nice to meet you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. I'm glad I could help. It was nice meeting you too. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon.
