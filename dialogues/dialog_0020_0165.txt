DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Clide. It's... well, I keep getting fevers. They come and go, you know? Been happening for a little while now. Honestly, I just want to figure out what’s going on so I can get back to things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide. Fevers, you said. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started… around May, I guess? Maybe late April? It’s hard to say exactly. They don't come every day, more like a few times a week, then nothing for a bit. It's just annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few times a week since around late April or May. And when you get these fevers, do you notice any other symptoms along with them?
PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes. Usually I get kinda tired, achy all over, like I got the flu. No cough or anything, though. And... sometimes I get a little sweaty, even when it's not hot. My wife, Elena, she says I look flushed.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, body aches, and sometimes sweating and a flushed appearance. That gives us a little more to work with. Do you happen to know what your temperature gets to when you have a fever?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. Elena usually checks, but I don't pay much attention to the numbers. I just know I feel warm, and she tells me to lie down. Usually around 101, maybe a little higher. She's good at that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, around 101 or a little higher. And has anything made them better or worse?
PATIENT: Not really. Resting helps a little, I guess. But they just… come and go on their own. I tried some over-the-counter stuff, like Tylenol, but it doesn't seem to do much. I really don't like taking pills if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Alright, resting offers minimal relief, and Tylenol hasn't been very effective. Let's talk a bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any long-term health conditions?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing major. I had the usual childhood stuff, you know, chickenpox, measles... but nothing serious. My back's been bothering me for years, that's why I see a chiropractor. Other than that, pretty healthy. I eat okay, try to walk a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical history, just some back pain managed with a chiropractor. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, never had surgery. Elena always worries about it, but I've managed to avoid it so far. I had a bad fall a few years back, almost broke my hip, but the chiropractor helped a lot with that too.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mother had diabetes, later in life. And my father... he had high blood pressure, I think. Nothing too dramatic, though. My sister's healthy as a horse, always has been. I don't really know much beyond that, to be honest. We don't talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother and high blood pressure in your father. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Elena always asks, and I always say no. I eat pretty much anything. She's the picky eater in the family. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the occasional Tylenol for the fever, like I said. And… sometimes I take a vitamin D supplement, especially in the winter. The chiropractor recommended it. Other than that, nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional Tylenol and a vitamin D supplement. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. Just get it over with, eh? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, your temperature is currently 100.3 Fahrenheit. Blood pressure is 138/82. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Your throat looks a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. I don't feel any swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Given your history of intermittent fevers, body aches, and mild throat redness, and the fact that your temperature is slightly elevated now, we need to investigate this further. I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any potential infections or underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests, huh? Fine, whatever you think is best, Doctor. As long as it gets me an answer. I just don't want to be stuck with this forever. When can I expect the results? And will they be expensive? I don't have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Clide. We'll keep the testing as focused as possible to minimize expenses. The blood tests will help us look for common causes of fever, like infections, and check your overall blood count. We'll also check your kidney and liver function. The results usually take about 2-3 business days. Let me check the lab’s pricing for you... Okay, the basic panel will be around $150. We can discuss payment options with the billing department if that's a concern. We may need to add more tests depending on the initial results, but we’ll talk about that before ordering anything. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid strenuous activity. If your fever spikes above 102 Fahrenheit, or you develop any new symptoms like a severe headache, rash, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: $150... alright, I can manage that. Elena will be happy to hear it's not worse. Okay, yeah, that sounds good. Rest, fluids, no new symptoms... got it. I'll try to take it easy. So, I just wait for the results? Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? I'd rather not come back unless I have to, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, you just wait for the results. We’ll call you as soon as they are available, usually within 2-3 business days. We can discuss the results over the phone, and then schedule a follow-up appointment if needed. I understand you'd prefer to limit trips to the clinic, and we'll certainly try to manage this efficiently. If your symptoms worsen before we receive the results, please don't hesitate to call the office, even if it's just to speak with a nurse. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Rest, fluids, wait for the call… and don't get worse. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening. Hopefully, we can figure this out soon. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clide. I'm glad I could help, and I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. .
