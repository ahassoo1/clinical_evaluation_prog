DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, I’ve been… extraordinarily thirsty lately. And hungry, too. It’s a bit unsettling, honestly. It feels like I can’t quite quench either one, no matter how much I drink or eat.
DOCTOR: I see. That is unsettling. Increased thirst and hunger can be indicative of several things, so it’s good you’re getting it checked out. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began, oh, maybe a month or so ago? It wasn’t sudden, more of a gradual increase. At first, I just noticed I was refilling my water glass more often. Then it became… needing to. And the hunger followed shortly after. It’s been pretty consistent since then, not getting better or worse, just… there. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. A gradual onset over a month is important information. And consistent symptoms are useful to know. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me see. I suppose I’ve been going to the bathroom a bit more frequently, if I’m honest. And, now that you mention it, I've felt a bit more tired than usual. Nothing debilitating, mind you, just… a general lack of energy. It could just be the summer heat, though.
DOCTOR: I understand. Increased urination and fatigue, along with the thirst and hunger, are all things we need to consider. To get a more complete picture, could you describe your typical daily fluid intake?
PATIENT: Right. Well, I usually have a large glass of water with breakfast – about 500ml, I’d say. Then I’ll have another glass or two throughout the morning, perhaps another 750ml. In the afternoon, I try to drink another litre, and then maybe another 500ml with dinner. So, roughly… three to four litres a day, give or take. I work in shipping, so I’m quite active, if that makes any difference.
DOCTOR: That's a significant amount of fluid intake, Mr. Erxleben, and given your activity level, it’s not entirely unexpected. However, with the increased thirst and urination, it's important we investigate further. Do you notice anything unusual about your urine?
PATIENT: Unusual? No, not particularly. It’s… well, it looks like urine, I suppose. The colour seems normal, I haven’t noticed any blood or anything like that. I wouldn't say it smells any different either. It's just… there’s more of it, if that makes sense. Frequent trips to the loo, mostly. Nothing else springs to mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all, to my knowledge. I’ve always been fairly healthy, touch wood. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I’ve never been hospitalised or had any major surgeries. My divorce was… stressful, but I don’t believe it had any lasting physical effects. Aside from that, I’m a relatively clean bill of health, as far as I'm aware.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Erxleben. And thank you for sharing that with me. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe, and my father… he had some heart trouble later in life. Nothing too specific, really. No diabetes or kidney problems that I’m aware of, on either side of the family. My grandfather on my mother's side did have a bit of a sweet tooth, if that counts for anything, but it never escalated into anything serious. It's not a particularly medically-inclined family, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t take any regular medication. I occasionally take paracetamol for headaches, but that’s it. And I haven’t taken any supplements in… well, years. I prefer to get my vitamins from food, if possible. I try to eat a fairly balanced diet, despite my increased appetite lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Erxleben. To get a better understanding of what might be causing your symptoms, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. I’d also like to do a quick blood sugar test, if you don’t mind. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m eager to get to the bottom of this, so please, proceed. The sooner I know what’s going on, the better. I have a shipment to coordinate next week, and I need to be on top form.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 140 over 90. We'll keep that in mind. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to take a quick blood sugar reading with a finger prick. Your blood sugar is significantly elevated at 220 mg/dL. That, combined with your increased thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue, is quite concerning.
PATIENT: 220? That is high, isn't it? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? I haven’t been feeling that unwell, just thirsty and tired. But that sounds… quite bad.
DOCTOR: Yes, 220 mg/dL is significantly elevated. It strongly suggests the possibility of diabetes mellitus, specifically hyperglycemia. While you may not be feeling acutely unwell at the moment, prolonged high blood sugar can lead to a number of complications. It's important to get this under control. I need to order some further testing to confirm this diagnosis. I’ll need a fasting plasma glucose test and a hemoglobin A1c test. These will give us a more accurate picture of your average blood sugar levels over the past few months. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding sugary drinks and foods as much as possible. Do you have any allergies or sensitivities that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None at all. Diabetes… I always thought that was something… older people got. Or people who ate terribly. I try to eat reasonably well, honestly. What does this mean for me? Will I… need medication? Will I have to change my diet completely? And… what about my shipment next week? I have responsibilities.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed, Mr. Erxleben. Diabetes can affect people of all ages and lifestyles. While diet and lifestyle play a role, it’s often a complex condition with genetic factors as well. Regarding your concerns, we won't know the full extent of the condition until we have the results of the additional tests. However, it’s highly likely you’ll need to make some dietary changes and potentially start medication to manage your blood sugar levels. The good news is that diabetes is a manageable condition, and with proper care, you can continue to live a full and active life. Regarding your shipment next week, it's important to prioritize your health. We can discuss strategies to manage your condition while you fulfill your responsibilities. I'm also happy to provide a note for your workplace, explaining your condition and any necessary accommodations. Let’s focus on getting those tests done first. I’ll write you a requisition form for the fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c. Do you have a preferred lab?
PATIENT: No preferred lab, Doctor. Whatever’s closest is fine, honestly. I just want to get this sorted. Fasting… so I shouldn’t eat anything before the test? And how long do I need to fast for? I usually have a coffee and a biscuit in the morning… Is there anything else I should know about the test? Will it take long? I have a meeting scheduled for 11:00 on Wednesday…
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks – just water is permitted. Coffee is permissible, but without any sugar or milk. The blood draw itself should only take a few minutes. However, you may need to wait a bit at the lab depending on how busy they are. I would recommend scheduling the test first thing in the morning to minimize any disruption to your day. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you next week to discuss the results of the tests and develop a treatment plan. How does Thursday morning sound?
PATIENT: Thursday morning works, Doctor. As long as it’s not too early. I need to coordinate with my team, you see. So, no food, just water, black coffee, and then this follow-up appointment. And… assuming the tests confirm this diagnosis, what kind of treatment are we talking about? Will it be injections? Pills? A complete lifestyle overhaul? I just… I need to know what I’m facing. The uncertainty is the worst part, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Erxleben. It’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed when facing a potential diagnosis. The treatment plan will depend on the severity of your condition and your individual needs. It will likely involve a combination of lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes and regular exercise. In many cases, oral medications are prescribed to help regulate blood sugar levels. In some situations, injections may be necessary, but that’s something we’ll discuss if it becomes apparent. We will start with the least invasive methods first and tailor the plan to your specific needs and preferences. I’ll work closely with you to ensure you understand everything and feel comfortable with the treatment. We can also involve a registered dietitian and a diabetes educator to provide support and guidance. I’ll provide you with detailed information about diabetes and its management before our follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything for now. I’m still processing everything, to be honest. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And for not… sugarcoating it, I suppose. I’d rather know what I’m facing, even if it’s not good news. I’ll schedule the tests and… and I’ll see you on Thursday. Just one last thing… is it… is it contagious? My team… I don’t want to worry them unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: That’s a very thoughtful question, Mr. Erxleben. No, diabetes is not contagious. It’s not caused by a virus or bacteria, and it cannot be spread from person to person. You don’t need to worry about infecting your team. Please take care of yourself, and remember I am here to support you through this. If anything comes up before Thursday, don't hesitate to call. I look forward to seeing you then. .
