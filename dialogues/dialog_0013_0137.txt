DOCTOR: Hi Lindra, it’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Is good to meet you too. My… how you say… the place for old people? My son, he want me to go there. He say I need paper from doctor first. To make sure I… okay for live there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your son would like you to have a medical evaluation to ensure you’re healthy enough to live in an assisted living facility, and he needs a form from me. That’s very thoughtful of him. So, we’ll do a complete check-up today and get everything filled out. Let’s start with why you think you might benefit from assisted living. Are you having trouble with anything at home – like cooking, cleaning, or getting around?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not… big trouble. Just… older. My bones, they not so strong. Sometimes I feel… tired. Cooking, I still do. Cleaning, sometimes my daughter, she help. Is just… maybe is better if people can help more, yes? I not want to fall. Is scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. You're being proactive, which is great! It sounds like you’re mostly concerned about safety and having help available as you need it. We'll definitely address those concerns. Let’s go through some questions, just to get a complete picture of your health. First, can you tell me a little about any medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I have… the pressure. Doctor say is high blood pressure. I take the pills every day. And… sometimes my leg, it hurt. Is old injury, from when I was young. Is not so bad now. I think that is all. Maybe little… arthritis in my hands. Is not big problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, an old leg injury, and some arthritis. Thank you. And are you currently seeing any other doctors for these conditions, besides your primary care physician?
PATIENT: No. Just… family doctor. He give me the pills. He say I good. Is good doctor, I see him long time. He know me. I no see other doctors.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes. Long time ago. When I was… maybe 30? I have baby, and… problem. I have surgery for that. Is okay now. Is many years ago. Nothing since then.
DOCTOR: Okay, a surgery related to childbirth many years ago. And how about allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. I drink everything. No problem with that. I like mango! Is good. But no allergies, doctor. I never have problem with food or… medicine.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And what medications are you currently taking, besides the pills for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the pills. For the pressure. Is a little white one, and a little blue one. I take them every morning with my coffee. That is all. No other medicine. Sometimes, if I hurt, I take… what you call… ibuprofen? Is for pain. But not every day. Only when I need.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a white and blue pill for blood pressure daily, and ibuprofen as needed for pain. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any major medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mama… she have the pressure too. Like me. And my papa… he have the… what you call… the sugar? Diabetes? Yes, that is it. He have the diabetes. And… my sister, she have the cancer. Is… not good. But is many years ago. She is okay now, I think. But… yes, those things. In my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and cancer in your family. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, no smoke. Never smoke. And no drink. Is not good for the pressure, doctor say. I like coffee, but that is all. Just coffee in the morning. Is good. With a little sugar. But no smoke, no drink. Just coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking and no alcohol. Just coffee with a little sugar. That’s good. Now, before we do a physical exam, can you tell me about your typical day?
PATIENT: Hmm. I wake up, I have coffee. I eat little breakfast. I watch the television. Sometimes my daughter come, we talk. I cook the dinner. I pray. I go to bed. Is… quiet day. Not much happen. Sometimes I walk a little, in the garden. Is not much, but… is okay. Is good.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet day, mostly at home. That sounds peaceful. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your joints. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. You do what you need. Is good. I trust you, doctor. Be gentle with my bones, okay? They old.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be very careful. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 150/90. We’ll keep an eye on that. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I notice some mild tenderness in your finger joints, which is consistent with arthritis. Your range of motion is a bit limited, but not severely. Your reflexes are a little slow, but that’s common with age. Everything else seems within normal limits. I'm going to check your feet now for any swelling or sores. No swelling, which is good, and skin is intact. Okay, everything looks pretty good for your age, Lindra. We need to get your blood pressure better controlled, and we can talk about some strategies for managing your arthritis. Do you have any questions about the exam?
PATIENT: No, I no have questions. Is good to know everything okay. The pressure… is bad? I take the pills every day. What can we do to make it better? And the arthritis… can you give me something for the pain? Sometimes it hurt bad in the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's address those concerns. Your blood pressure is a little higher than we’d like, but it’s manageable. Taking the pills is a good start, but sometimes lifestyle changes can make a big difference. We can talk about reducing your salt intake, getting a little more exercise—even just a short walk each day—and managing stress. I can also consider adjusting your medication if needed. As for the arthritis, there are several options for pain relief. We can start with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, which you're already using. However, if that’s not enough, we can consider a prescription medication or other treatments like physical therapy. Let me quickly check your EHR to see your past blood pressure readings and any previous medications you've tried. Okay, I see you’ve been on this medication for several years, and the readings haven’t been consistently controlled. I think we should try a different medication, and I’m also going to order some blood work to rule out any other underlying causes for your high blood pressure. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sound good, Doctor. New pills, maybe they work better. And the blood work… is important? Is something bad wrong? I not want anything bad. And… maybe you can write down what I need to do for the pressure? The salt… the walking… I forget easy, you see. My brain… is old too.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to forget things, Lindra! That’s what I’m here for. The blood work is just a precaution, to make sure there isn’t anything else contributing to your high blood pressure. It’s unlikely anything is seriously wrong, but it’s always best to be thorough. I'm going to prescribe a low-dose ARB, called Losartan, instead of your current medication. It often works better for people with your condition, and has fewer side effects. And here’s a handout with tips for managing your blood pressure. It covers diet – reducing salt intake is key – exercise, and stress management techniques. I’ll also write down a few simple exercises you can do at home. We’ll also discuss these points briefly. I want you to continue taking your current medication until we get the new prescription filled. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check your blood pressure and review the blood work results. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sound alright. New pills, the paper… and see you in two weeks. Thank you, Doctor. You very kind. Is good to have someone to talk to. I worry easy. Old people, we worry.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lindra. It’s perfectly normal to worry, especially as we get older. That's what I'm here for – to help ease your worries and make sure you're healthy and happy. Before you go, I need to fill out this form for the assisted living facility. It just confirms your overall health status and any limitations you may have. Okay, I’ve completed the form, and it will be ready for you to take to the facility. I've also written you a prescription for the Losartan, and a note explaining your medication and follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions before we wrap up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. The form, the paper, the pills… you help me very much, Doctor. Thank you. I go now. Is good to see you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lindra! It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll get you feeling better. And remember, take it one day at a time. Have a wonderful day, and I’ll see you in two weeks!
