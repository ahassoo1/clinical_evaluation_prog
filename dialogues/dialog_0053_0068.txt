DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor... Pitmon, is it? Yes, thank you. Well, it's my leg. It's been swelling up, and it’s… after the cancer treatments, you see. It’s not painful, exactly, just… big. And a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Right, cancer treatments. I see. And how long has your leg been swelling, Ms. Queener?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. It started… maybe a month ago? A month and a half, perhaps? It comes and goes, but it's been worse the last week, I think. It’s hard to keep track, honestly. I'm not so good with dates.
DOCTOR: A month to a month and a half, okay. And has anything specific made it worse – like standing for long periods, or any particular activity?
PATIENT: Not that I’ve noticed, really. I don’t do a lot of standing, if I’m honest! I mostly… sit. Read, watch television. Sometimes a little gardening, but not much heavy lifting. It just… swells. Even when I’m resting it. It’s a bit of a puzzle.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. And where exactly on your leg is the swelling?
PATIENT: Right here, Doctor. Mostly around my ankle, but it goes up my calf a little bit now. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not all the way up, just… the lower part. And it feels… tight. Not painful, like I said, but… full.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower leg, mostly around the ankle, extending a bit up the calf. And you mentioned tightness. Is it warm to the touch?
PATIENT: Hmm… it doesn’t feel warm, no. It just feels… normal, I suppose. Maybe a little bit… harder than the other leg, but not hot. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at describing these things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Queener. No warmth noted. Now, have you noticed any changes in the skin color or texture in that area?
PATIENT: Let me see… the skin looks… the same, I think. Maybe a little bit… redder, perhaps? But that could just be from my socks, you know? I haven’t noticed anything different, really. No bumps, no… scales or anything. Just… normal skin, but a bit puffy.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant skin changes. Now, I’m going to need to ask you a few more general questions. Have you had any blood clots in the past?
PATIENT: Blood clots… oh dear. Let me see… I don’t think so. I’ve had a lot of tests over the years, with the cancer and all, but I don't recall anyone mentioning a blood clot. I’m sorry, I’m not very good with medical things. Would it be in my records? Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s what I mean. It’s quite alright, we have your records here. Okay, no prior history of blood clots documented. Have you had any recent surgeries or injuries to that leg?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. And no injuries! I’m very careful, you see. I haven’t fallen or anything like that. It’s just… been swelling since the treatments finished. It's a bit worrying, to be honest. I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Queener. Now, regarding your cancer treatments… what type of cancer were you treated for, and what treatments did you receive?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that was… a while ago now. It was… breast cancer. I had… chemotherapy, I think? And radiation. And… a little bit of surgery, to remove the lump. I’m sorry, I get confused with all the details. It was a very stressful time. They gave me a lot of things, you know? All to make it better. But now this leg… it’s a worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, breast cancer treated with chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. The doctor said my blood pressure was a little high once, but they gave me a pill for that. And… I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, but that's not very serious. Nothing else, I don't think. Oh! And I need glasses, but that's hardly a medical condition, is it?
DOCTOR: No, glasses don’t count. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and some arthritis. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or arthritis, besides the glasses, of course?
PATIENT: Let me see… yes. This little white one is for my blood pressure. One a day, the doctor said. And… no, nothing for the arthritis. Just a bit of cream sometimes, when it’s really bad. That’s all, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the blood pressure medication. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, no. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thank goodness. They gave me a lot of things during the treatments, and I was fine. Not a rash, not a cough, nothing. I think I would remember if I was allergic, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you would. Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle? Oh dear… what do you mean? I mostly stay at home, you see. I read a lot. And watch television. I used to go to the market sometimes, but it’s a bit difficult now. I don’t really… do much, if I’m honest. A quiet life. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I’ve never smoked in my life. And I don’t drink alcohol either. Never really liked it. A bit too strong, you see. I prefer a nice cup of tea, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tea is good. Now, Ms. Queener, I’d like to examine your leg. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, please do! I just want to know what’s going on. The sooner, the better, if you don't mind. It's been worrying me, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to take a look at your leg, and feel for any tenderness or warmth. I notice some slight redness around your ankle, but no significant skin breakdown. Now, let me feel your pulses… Your pulses are present, but a bit weaker on that side compared to your other leg. And I’m going to measure the circumference of your calf, just to see if there's a significant difference in size. Okay, your left calf is about two centimeters larger than your right. Now, I'm going to gently press on your leg to check for any pitting edema. Yes, I do notice some slight pitting edema – a little indentation remains after I press. No significant tenderness to palpation though. Overall, your leg feels warm to the touch, and the skin is soft. It doesn't appear infected.
PATIENT: Oh, that's a little uncomfortable, but not painful. Two centimeters bigger? Goodness! Is that… bad? And pitting edema… that sounds worrying. What does it mean? Is it the cancer? Is it coming back?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Queener, let's not jump to conclusions. Two centimeters isn't necessarily alarming, but it's something we need to investigate further. And pitting edema simply means there's some fluid buildup in your tissues. It doesn’t automatically mean it's cancer-related. It can be caused by a number of things, including poor circulation, prolonged sitting, or even just a slight change in your diet. Based on what I’m seeing and hearing, the most likely cause of your swelling is venous insufficiency - which means the valves in your veins aren't working as well as they should, causing fluid to pool in your legs. The chemotherapy and radiation could contribute to this, but it's not definite. To be certain, I'd like to order a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg. This will allow us to see the blood flow in your veins and check for any clots or valve dysfunction. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… venous insufficiency. That doesn’t sound too bad, does it? Not like… the cancer? A Doppler ultrasound… is that painful? And will it take long? I’m not very good with waiting, you see. I just want to know what’s going on and get it fixed, if possible.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Queener, it’s definitely not like the cancer. Venous insufficiency is a common condition, and it’s usually manageable with conservative measures – like compression stockings, elevation, and regular exercise. The Doppler ultrasound is completely painless. It involves a technician using a gel and a handheld device to scan your leg – it’s similar to a pregnancy scan. It takes about 30-45 minutes. While we wait for the results, I’m going to prescribe you a pair of compression stockings. They’ll help to improve circulation and reduce the swelling. I also recommend elevating your leg whenever possible – perhaps while you're reading or watching television. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds much better! Compression stockings… I think I can manage that. And elevating my leg… yes, I can do that easily enough. Thirty to forty-five minutes… that's not too bad. Thank you, Doctor Pitmon. You've put my mind at ease a bit. I was terribly worried it was something serious. So, stockings and elevation… and wait for the scan. Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Queener. I'm glad I could reassure you. For now, just focus on the stockings and elevation. Try to avoid prolonged sitting for long periods, and stay well-hydrated. I’ll also write you a prescription for a mild diuretic – this will help to remove some of the excess fluid from your body. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully and let me know if you experience any side effects. I'll have the nurse schedule you for the ultrasound scan, and we’ll review the results as soon as they're available. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. You've explained everything so clearly, Doctor. Thank you again for taking the time to listen to me. I really appreciate it. I’ll get the stockings and take the medicine like you said. And… thank you for not thinking I was just an old woman worrying over nothing. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Queener. It was my pleasure. And you are not just an old woman worrying over nothing. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns at all. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the paperwork and schedule your ultrasound. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
