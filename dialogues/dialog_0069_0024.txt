DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit… unusual, I think. I need a letter saying I’m able to fly. My travel insurance company requires it. I lost my husband six months ago, and I’m finally trying to get away for a bit, you see? It's… important.
DOCTOR: I understand, Kiante. That sounds very important, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. Losing your husband six months ago must have been incredibly difficult. It’s good you’re prioritizing self-care and taking this trip. To write the letter, I need to make sure it’s medically appropriate for you to fly. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that’s it, really. I don’t take any regular medications. I’m generally quite healthy, actually. I try to walk every day and eat well. It’s just… flying makes me a little anxious, and they want to be sure everything is okay before they approve the trip. They asked for a doctor's note, so here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No current medications and generally healthy is excellent. And the appendix removal, was that a long time ago and did you have any complications from it?
PATIENT: Yes, it was… oh, goodness, almost twenty years ago now. I was fifteen. And no, no complications at all. Everything went smoothly, and I recovered quickly. I don’t even think about it unless someone asks, like now! It’s really not a problem, Doctor. I just wanted to be thorough.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Kiante. Thoroughness is always good. Just making sure we have all the information. Now, when you say flying makes you anxious, can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a fear, exactly. It's more… a tightening in my chest, and I get a bit restless. I worry about turbulence, silly things like that. And being so… contained. I’m a bit claustrophobic, I suppose. But it’s manageable. I can usually distract myself with a book or music. It’s not debilitating, if that makes sense. I just… prefer not to think about it too much. It's probably just the stress of everything, honestly.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Kiante. And it's perfectly reasonable to feel anxious, especially with everything you’ve been through. It sounds like mild anxiety, and you've already identified coping mechanisms, which is great. To be completely thorough, and just to rule out anything else contributing to the chest tightness, would you mind if I listened to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds sensible. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. It’s just… I’d like to get this sorted quickly, if possible. I have a flight booked for the 15th, and I’m worried about delays with the insurance. But take your time, Doctor. I understand you need to do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as quick as possible while still being thorough. We’ll get this sorted. And I appreciate your patience. Okay, if you could just sit back and relax. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. It might be a little cool with the stethoscope. Okay, everything sounds clear. Heart rate is normal, lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles. Now, just to be complete, could I check your blood pressure and pulse?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good. The quicker we get through this, the better, right? I'm a little worried about the turbulence… I read something online about it once, and… well, you know how it is. The internet.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular. Everything looks good, Kiante. You’re right about the internet – it can be a bit alarming sometimes! Turbulence is common, and planes are designed to withstand it very well. It’s usually more unsettling than dangerous. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, I don’t see any medical reason why you shouldn't be able to fly. I’m happy to write a letter stating that you are medically cleared for air travel. Would you like me to do that now?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful! Yes, please, that would be fantastic. I really appreciate it, Doctor. It’s such a relief to hear. The insurance company is usually very strict, so this will save me a lot of hassle, I’m sure. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I’m glad I could help. Here you go. It states that you are in good health and cleared for air travel. I’ve also included my contact information should the insurance company have any questions. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Perfect! That’s exactly what I needed. Thank you so much, Doctor Andraca. You've been very kind and efficient. No, I think that's everything. I really appreciate you taking the time to see me so quickly. I can finally start looking forward to my trip.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I'm so glad I could help, and I wish you a safe and enjoyable trip. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day, and safe travels!
