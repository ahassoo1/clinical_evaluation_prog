DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is good to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… weakness, you see. It keeps getting worse. It’s in my legs mostly, but I feel it other places now, too. The other doctors… they say it’s this Multiple Sclerosis thing. I just want to know what’s going to happen.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Astore. It's certainly concerning when you're feeling weakness that's progressing, and it's good you’re seeking answers. Multiple Sclerosis is a complex condition, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want a clear understanding of what to expect. To help me get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I will try my best. It started… oh, maybe six months ago? Just a little bit harder to get up from a chair, you know? I thought it was just getting old. But then it started feeling… wobbly. Like my legs aren’t as strong as they used to be. Now, sometimes I have to use my hands to help myself stand. And I tire out easier. Walking… even just around the house… takes more effort. It's not pain, exactly. Just… tired and weak. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Astore. It sounds like it's been a gradual process, which is common with many conditions. You mentioned it started about six months ago and has been progressively worsening, affecting your ability to stand and walk. It’s good you’ve noticed that it’s not pain, but more of a tiring weakness. Now, have you noticed this weakness in any other parts of your body besides your legs?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question, Doctor. Let me think. Yes, now that you mention it, my hands… they feel a little clumsy sometimes. Dropping things more often than I used to. And… my speech, maybe? My wife, Leilani, says I don’t talk as clearly as I once did. It's very slight, but she notices these things. I didn’t really pay much attention until she said something. It’s not a big problem, but… yes, maybe in my hands and my talking, too.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Astore. It’s very helpful to hear about the changes you and Leilani have observed. The clumsiness in your hands and the slight difficulty with your speech are important details. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Oh! My vision… sometimes it gets blurry. Not all the time, but it happens. And… I get very tired, even after a good night’s sleep. More tired than I used to be. And… I’ve been a little… forgetful, maybe? Small things, like where I put my glasses or what I was just talking about. It's not terrible, but Leilani has noticed that too. She says I ask the same questions sometimes. I don't always remember. Is that… is that normal?
DOCTOR: Those are all important things to mention, Mr. Astore. Blurry vision, fatigue, and the memory issues you and Leilani have noticed. It's good you’re sharing all of this with me. These symptoms can be associated with Multiple Sclerosis, but they can also be caused by other things. To get a clearer understanding, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I had a bit of trouble with high blood pressure a few years ago, but the doctor put me on some pills and it’s been alright since then. Nothing else, really. I’ve always been a pretty healthy man, all things considered. I used to be a very active athlete. Football in my younger days, and lots of fishing and swimming. Leilani always said I was too active! I haven’t been as active lately, with this weakness. But before that, no serious illnesses, no major surgeries. Just the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Astore. So, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and otherwise generally healthy. And you were very active previously. That's helpful information. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills, Doctor. One in the morning, one at night. I take them with my breakfast and dinner. Leilani makes sure I don’t forget. She's very good at keeping me on track. No other pills, no vitamins, nothing like that. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fish and fruits, but Leilani does most of the cooking, so I can’t always guarantee it! She likes to spoil me with good food.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So, just the blood pressure medication, taken regularly as prescribed. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and Leilani tries new recipes all the time. No rashes, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. No allergies that I know of. Is that alright? Should I be thinking of something?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Astore. No known allergies is excellent. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one, Doctor. My family… we don’t really talk much about illnesses. It’s not something we focus on. My mother, she had some trouble with her joints when she got older, arthritis maybe? But that was when she was very old. My father… he was a strong man, lived a long life, but I don’t remember him having any serious problems. No one that I know of had anything like this weakness, or problems with their memory, or blurry vision. We mostly had strong people, I think. Is that helpful? I wish I could tell you more.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Astore. It’s common for families not to have detailed medical histories. Arthritis in your mother is good to know, and it's helpful to know there wasn't a history of similar symptoms in your family. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I’m retired now. Used to be a coach, working with young athletes. But now I mostly take it easy. I like to watch sports on TV, spend time with Leilani and the grandkids, and go fishing when I can. I used to drink a little bit of beer, but I’ve cut back on that since I started feeling weak. Don’t smoke, never have. I try to eat healthy, like I said, but Leilani likes to bake! I don’t do much exercise anymore, not with this weakness. Mostly just walking around the house. Is that what you mean by lifestyle? I try to live a good, quiet life.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Mr. Astore. Retired, enjoying time with family, limited exercise due to the weakness, and reduced alcohol intake. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your strength, reflexes, balance, and vision. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I want to know what’s happening, and if that helps you figure it out, then go right ahead. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I’m a bit worried, but I’m trusting you to help me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore. We’ll start with your vision. Please look straight ahead at the chart on the wall and tell me what you see. ... ... Okay, your vision is slightly blurred in both eyes, but not significantly. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms and legs. ... ... Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits. Now, let's check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It doesn’t feel as strong as it used to, Doctor. I used to have a very firm grip. These hands… they’ve done a lot of work over the years. Fishing, coaching… but now… now it feels like they’re not as reliable as they once were. I hope that’s enough? I can try harder if you want. Just let me know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, Mr. Astore. And you’re right to point that out – your grip strength is noticeably reduced on both sides. Your leg strength is also diminished, particularly in your ankles and feet. I also noticed a slight tremor in your hands when you extend your arms. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary exam findings – the blurred vision, diminished reflexes, reduced strength, and tremor – it does sound consistent with Multiple Sclerosis. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, we'll need to order some further tests. I’d like to order an MRI of your brain and spinal cord, and some blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood tests. That sounds… serious, Doctor. But if that’s what we need to do to find out what’s happening, then yes, alright. Whatever you recommend. I trust your judgement. I just… I just want to know what I’m facing. Is an MRI painful? Will the blood tests tell us anything? I’m a bit scared, to be honest. It’s just… all this talk about Multiple Sclerosis… it’s a bit frightening. What happens if it is that? What will we do?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Astore. It’s perfectly normal to feel frightened when facing the possibility of a serious diagnosis. An MRI is not painful, but you will need to lie very still inside a large machine for about 30-60 minutes. It's a bit loud, so we'll give you earplugs. The blood tests will help us rule out other conditions that can mimic Multiple Sclerosis, and also give us more information about your overall health. If it is Multiple Sclerosis, it’s important to remember that it’s a condition with a wide range of severity, and treatment options have improved significantly. We can manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease with medication and physical therapy. It doesn’t necessarily mean a drastically reduced quality of life. I'll order those tests right away, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your blood pressure medication as prescribed, and trying to maintain a healthy diet and moderate activity level, as tolerated. I also want to refer you to a neurologist – a specialist in neurological disorders – for a more in-depth evaluation and to discuss treatment options. Would you like me to arrange that referral for you now?
PATIENT: A neurologist… yes, please. That sounds… wise. Someone who knows more about this Multiple Sclerosis thing. And thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything so clearly. It… it helps to know what’s happening, even if it’s not good news. And yes, please arrange that referral. I trust your judgement, and I want to see the best specialist you recommend. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results, alright? I’m a bit anxious, but I’m ready to face whatever comes. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I should probably call Leilani and tell her about this. She'll want to know. She always worries about me. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Astore. I’ll arrange the referral to a neurologist immediately and have the results sent to you as soon as they are available. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And yes, it’s a good idea to let Leilani know. Having support during this time is very important. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Astore. I'm here to support you every step of the way. .
