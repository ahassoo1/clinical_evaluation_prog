DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for having me. I’ve been noticing a lump – a mass, I guess you’d call it – in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I wanted to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. And how long is "a little while"?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe about three or four months now? It wasn’t very noticeable at first, just felt a little… different. But it’s grown a bit since then, so I figured it was time to get it looked at. I haven’t noticed any pain, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, three or four months. No pain, that's good to hear. Has the size changed noticeably recently?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Over the last month or so, I think it has gotten a little bigger. It’s not a huge change, but I definitely feel it more now than I did before. It’s…firm, if that makes sense. Not squishy.
DOCTOR: Firm, okay. And where exactly in your lower abdomen are you feeling this lump?
PATIENT: It's… sort of in the middle, a bit to the left. Not right on my hip bone, but lower than my belly button. It’s hard to explain exactly, but it feels like it’s deep inside, not just on the surface of my skin. Do you want me to…point to it? I’m happy to, if that would help.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Pointing to it would be very helpful. It's always best to see and feel for myself.
PATIENT: Here. Right about here is where I feel it. It’s maybe…the size of a small plum, I’d say? Though, like I said, it's hard to tell exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel it. Firm, about the size of a plum, as you said. No tenderness when I press?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness at all. It doesn’t hurt when you press on it. It doesn't really bother me unless I'm, like, really focusing on it. It just…is there. It doesn't feel like a muscle knot or anything, that's what I initially thought, but it doesn't feel like that. It's…different. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. It's good you're paying attention to how it feels and noticing what it isn't. Let's get a bit more information. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Not really, no. Everything seems pretty normal on that front. No constipation, no diarrhea, nothing like that. I haven’t noticed any blood in my stool either. Is that what you were asking about?
DOCTOR: Yes, that was what I was getting at. And have you experienced any weight loss recently, even unintentional?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. My weight’s been pretty stable. I actually might have gained a little bit over the last few months, if anything! My wife keeps telling me I’m eating too much, but…that’s a separate issue.
DOCTOR: Wives often have a good perspective on these things. Alright, good. No weight loss. Any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, thankfully none of those. I haven’t been feeling sick at all, just a bit curious about this lump. I'm generally quite healthy, I think. I try to eat well and get some exercise when I can, you know? It's just this…thing. It’s just a little unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's always wise to get things checked out when you notice something new. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I have pretty good health, thankfully. No major illnesses or anything like that. My wife has high blood pressure, but that’s hereditary on her side. I haven’t had any surgeries, and I'm not currently taking any medications. I did have a bad case of the flu a couple of years ago, but that’s it. Oh! And I'm allergic to penicillin, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: Good to know about the penicillin allergy. Thank you. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Let’s see… my mother had diabetes, but that was later in life. My father was healthy as a horse, if anything. No history of cancer on either side of the family that I’m aware of. It’s not something we talked about much, to be honest. My family isn’t really one for discussing medical things. Does that help? Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. And, if you don't mind me asking, what do you do for work?
PATIENT: I'm a choreographer. I work with dance companies mostly, and sometimes do things for the theater. It keeps me busy, but I enjoy it. It's a lot of physical activity, which is probably why I’m so attuned to my body. It’s… my livelihood, so I want to make sure everything is okay. Does that affect anything?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. Quite the opposite, in fact. Being attuned to your body is excellent. Okay, Amy, based on what you've told me, I think we should investigate this further. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. It will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A CT scan and blood work, okay. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the scan? And will the scan tell us definitively what it is, or will we need more tests after that? I just want to know what I’m looking at, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. For the CT scan, you'll need to fast for four to six hours beforehand. We'll give you specific instructions when you schedule it. As for whether it will be definitive… it will give us a much clearer picture. It can often identify the nature of the mass, whether it's a cyst, a lipoma, or something else. However, sometimes further investigation is needed, like a biopsy, to get a definitive diagnosis. I don’t want to jump to conclusions without seeing the results, but we’ll take it one step at a time. I'll also give you a referral to a general surgeon who can discuss surgical options if they are needed. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… a good plan. Fasting, scan, and a referral to a surgeon, just in case. Okay. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It eases my mind a bit, knowing what to expect. When should I schedule the scan? And where would I go for that?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll send the referral to Dr. Khalil, a very good surgeon at City General Hospital. They will contact you to schedule the scan. It’s best to do it as soon as possible, so please contact them within the next few days. They will give you the specific preparation instructions. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, fever, or significant changes in your bowel habits, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your thoroughness. I’ll contact Dr. Khalil tomorrow.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before then. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I'll see you after the scan.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
