DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been botherin’ me. I have trouble when I try to lie flat. Makes it very difficult to rest, you see.
DOCTOR: I see. Trouble breathing, especially when lying flat. That is bothersome, and certainly impacts your rest. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a… a sharp pain, exactly. More like… a heaviness. A tightness in my chest. And I feel like I can’t get a full breath. It’s worse when I’m trying to sleep. I usually have to prop myself up with… well, a lot of pillows. It’s been goin’ on for… oh, maybe a month or so now. I don’t keep precise track, you understand.
DOCTOR: No, of course not. A month of that sounds quite uncomfortable. A heaviness and tightness in your chest, worse when lying flat, and requiring pillows to sleep… That gives me some ideas. Now, has this breathing difficulty been constant over the past month, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. Some days it’s barely noticeable. I can lie down with just one pillow and be alright. Other days… other days it’s like a weight is sittin’ right on my chest. Those are the days I need all the pillows I can find. It doesn’t seem to be tied to anything specific, though. I haven’t noticed any… triggers, you might say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it fluctuates. That’s helpful to know. And no specific triggers you’ve been able to identify – good. Now, besides the breathing trouble and the chest tightness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been a bit more tired lately, I suppose. But I’m seventy-one years old, Doctor. A little tiredness comes with the territory, wouldn't you agree? My ankles do swell up a bit in the evenings sometimes, but that’s happened off and on for years. Nothing new there. Oh! And I've been coughin' a little. Not a bad cough, just… dry. Mostly at night.
DOCTOR: You're right, a little tiredness does come with age, and ankle swelling can be common. But it's important to consider everything. A dry cough, especially at night… alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had a touch of arthritis in my hands a few years back, but it’s mostly managed with some cream and gentle exercises. And I had my gallbladder removed… oh, goodness, that must have been twenty years ago. Other than that… I don't believe so. I've been generally healthy, for the most part. I have Medicare, so they keep pretty good track of things, I expect.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Arthritis and a gallbladder removal… alright. And you’re right, Medicare does a thorough job of keeping records. I'll take a look at your chart to confirm. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for the arthritis, when my hands are botherin’ me. It’s a cream, called… Voltarol, I think. And sometimes I take a little ibuprofen for a headache. But that’s infrequent. No vitamins or anything like that. I try to eat a balanced diet, so I don't feel the need.
DOCTOR: Okay, Voltarol cream as needed for arthritis and ibuprofen occasionally for headaches. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. Though, I don’t particularly like shellfish, if that counts. But it’s a preference, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Have any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – had any medical conditions like heart problems, lung disease, or asthma?
PATIENT: My mother… she had high blood pressure, near the end of her life. And my brother, he had a bit of bronchitis every winter when he was a boy. But other than that… not really. My father was a very healthy man, lived to be eighty-five. And I don’t have any children, so… that’s that. I suppose, it's not much help. I never was one for keepin' up with family medical things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, you’ve told me what you know, and that’s helpful. High blood pressure in your mother and some bronchitis in your brother… we’ll keep those in mind. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I’m retired, Doctor. I used to work at the library, but I’ve been happily settled into retirement for fifteen years now. I enjoy reading, of course. And I do a little bit of crafting, mostly weaving. I don't smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to stay active, but my arthritis slows me down sometimes. I live alone, in a small house. That’s about it, I suppose. Very quiet life.
DOCTOR: Alright, a quiet, active retirement with reading and weaving. No smoking, minimal alcohol. That’s good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your ankles for swelling. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I understand that’s part of the process. Go right ahead. I would like to get this sorted out, if possible. I'm getting a bit tired of sleeping propped up with all those pillows.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit back in the chair, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Your heart rate is a little elevated, at 88 beats per minute, but it's otherwise regular. Okay, take a deep breath in… and out… good. I’m hearing some mild wheezing in your lower lungs, particularly on the left side. That could explain some of the breathing difficulty. And yes, there is some mild swelling in your ankles, with some pitting edema. That’s consistent with what you’ve described. Alright, based on what you've told me and the findings from the exam, I suspect you may be experiencing symptoms of congestive heart failure, or perhaps another underlying cardiac issue. The wheezing, shortness of breath, and ankle swelling are all consistent with this. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm this.
PATIENT: Congestive… heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. I always thought I was healthy, for my age. What sort of testing would you need to do, Doctor? And will it be painful? I don't do well with… with needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Maribeth. It does sound serious, and it’s natural to be worried. However, we are just exploring possibilities at this point, and it's often manageable even when diagnosed. As for the testing, we'll need a few things. First, I'd like to order an EKG, or electrocardiogram, to check the electrical activity of your heart. It's painless – we simply attach some stickers to your chest, arms, and legs. Then, we’ll need a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart size. That's quick and doesn't involve any needles. Finally, I’d like to order a blood test to check your levels of BNP, a hormone that can indicate heart failure, as well as to check your kidney function and overall health. The blood test will involve a small needle, but I can assure you it's very quick, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. We'll also do a complete blood count to make sure everything else is looking good. Do those sound manageable?
PATIENT: Well… stickers and a picture don’t sound too bad. The needle… I suppose I can tolerate a small needle, if it’s quick. And if it will help to find out what's goin’ on, then it’s worth it. I don’t want to be sleepin’ with all those pillows forever. Could you tell me what happens after the tests? How long will it take to get the results? And… what if it is congestive heart failure? What does that mean for me?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to get these tests done. The results for the EKG and chest X-ray usually come back within a few hours. The blood test results will take a little longer, usually one to two business days. I’ll call you as soon as I have all the results and we can discuss them together. If it is congestive heart failure, it means your heart isn’t pumping blood as efficiently as it should. This can cause fluid to build up in your lungs and other parts of your body, which explains the shortness of breath and ankle swelling. However, it’s very treatable. We have several medications that can help improve your heart’s function and reduce the fluid buildup. We would also likely recommend some lifestyle changes, such as reducing your salt intake and getting regular, gentle exercise. We may also consult with a cardiologist - a heart specialist - to help guide your treatment. It doesn’t necessarily mean a drastic change in your life, Maribeth. Often, with proper management, people with congestive heart failure can live full and active lives. It’s about getting the right diagnosis and treatment plan. Does that help ease some of your worries?
PATIENT: That… that does help, thank you, Doctor. Knowing there are things that can be done makes it a little less frightening. I appreciate you explainin’ it so clearly. So, the stickers, the picture, and the… needle. What do I need to do now? Do I need to make an appointment? And… should I stop taking anything before the tests? The Voltarol cream, the ibuprofen… anything?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Maribeth. I’m glad I could help ease some of your worries. Yes, let's get those tests scheduled. I’ll have my assistant, Sarah, come in and schedule the EKG, chest X-ray, and blood work for you. She’ll also give you a slip for the blood work to take with you. Regarding your medications, please continue taking the Voltarol cream as needed for your arthritis. However, please avoid taking any ibuprofen for the next 24 hours before the blood test, as it can interfere with the results. Continue with your usual diet unless otherwise instructed by Sarah. Sarah will also give you instructions about fasting before the bloodwork, if it’s required. I'll also write you a referral note to a cardiologist, just in case we do need to see a specialist. We’ll discuss that once we have the test results. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds… manageable. I appreciate you thinkin’ ahead, and writin’ the note for the specialist. I suppose I’ll just wait for Sarah to come in. Thank you for your time, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I was quite nervous, but I feel a little better now, knowin’ what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Maribeth. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to let Sarah or me know if you have any questions at all, even after the tests. We're here to help you every step of the way. Sarah will be in shortly.
