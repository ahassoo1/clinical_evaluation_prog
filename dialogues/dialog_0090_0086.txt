DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Kovtun. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hi Doctor. Just here for the results, if you could just tell me what those showed. I don’t have a lot of time today, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: “Results.” Right. Well, simply telling you the results isn't usually how we do things. It’s important to understand what those results mean, and why we ordered them in the first place. But, alright. You had some bloodwork and a urine sample taken on July 18th. Do you recall that visit?
PATIENT: Yes, I remember. Lots of poking and prodding, as usual. But I really just need the bottom line, please. Is everything okay? I'm good at remembering details, so you can skip the explanations if you want.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kovtun, with all due respect, “skipping the explanations” isn't responsible medical care. However… your complete blood count was within normal limits. Your basic metabolic panel was also unremarkable. Your urine analysis showed… a slightly elevated protein level. It’s not alarming, but it does warrant a little discussion. Are you experiencing any swelling, particularly in your feet or ankles?
PATIENT: Elevated protein? Hmm. No, no swelling. I haven’t noticed anything like that. I work on my feet all day, so my feet are usually just tired, you know? Logistics…lots of walking around warehouses. Is it something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Well, it could be related to your work, as you say. Prolonged standing can sometimes cause temporary protein elevation. But we can’t simply assume that. Have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Not really. Same as always, pretty much. Lots of fruit, some fish when I can get it, and… I try to drink enough water. I don't really eat a lot of processed foods. Is it something serious? Like, do I need more tests or… something? I have a shipment coming in tomorrow morning and I really need to know if I need to reschedule anything.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kovtun, you are being rather…dismissive. Protein in the urine can be a sign of kidney issues, among other things. It’s far too early to say definitively, and jumping to conclusions will not help anyone. We should repeat the urine analysis, just to be certain it wasn't a lab error or a temporary fluctuation. And frankly, I'd like to do a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio to get a more accurate reading. It's a simple test. Would you be available next week for a follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests. Okay, fine. Next week… let me see. Monday morning is good, if that works. But if it’s going to take all day, I might have to reschedule things again. Is that the only way to know for sure? Because honestly, I'm starting to get a little stressed about this. A shipment is a lot of money and I need to be there.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kovtun, I understand your concerns about the shipment, truly. However, your health is more important. The spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio will take approximately 15 minutes to collect, and the results usually come back within 24-48 hours. It is not an all-day affair. If the results are consistently elevated, then we would discuss further investigation, possibly including a 24-hour urine collection or referral to a nephrologist. But we are getting ahead of ourselves. Monday morning will work. We’ll collect the sample, and I’ll call you as soon as the results are available. Is there anything else I can address today, or shall we schedule that appointment now?
PATIENT: No, that’s it. Monday is fine. Just… please call, okay? Don’t make me wait around all day wondering. I’ve got a job to do. Schedule it, please. And thanks, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. I have you scheduled for Monday at 9:00 AM. The lab slip will be sent electronically to the lab you frequent. Please bring a copy of your insurance card, even though you mentioned you are uninsured; sometimes there are assistance programs available. And Ms. Kovtun…try not to worry unnecessarily. I understand your schedule is demanding, but it’s important to prioritize your health. I’ll call with the results as soon as they are available. Have a good day.
