DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I'm Dr. Noordin. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I have… a problem with my ear. It is leaking something. A discharge, you could say. It started maybe… four days ago? It is the left ear.
DOCTOR: Okay, a discharge from your left ear for about four days now. Alright. Can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: It is… not a lot. A small amount. The color is… yellowish. And it smells a little. Not very good smell, Doctor. Like… old water, maybe? It is also… sometimes itchy inside my ear.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish discharge, a little bit of odor… you said like old water, and some itching. Is there any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain. Not really. A little… fullness, maybe? Like something is inside. But no sharp pain, or throbbing, nothing like that. It just feels… blocked.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, just fullness and a blocked sensation. Have you noticed any hearing loss in that ear, or any ringing in your ear?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, now that you mention it… my hearing is not as good in that ear. Everything sounds… muffled. Like someone is speaking with a pillow in front of their mouth. And yes, a little ringing. A very quiet ringing, but it is there. I thought it was just… old age, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing and a quiet ringing… that's helpful. Have you had any fever, or any dizziness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. I checked myself yesterday. And no dizziness. I can walk straight. Everything is… steady. I am not falling or anything. I am careful man, always careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And have you had any recent colds, or ear infections?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No colds recently. Not for maybe… six months? And I have not had an ear infection since I was a small boy. Very small boy, in Somalia. A long, long time ago. I remember my mother… she used warm oil, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you tried anything to treat it yourself at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I did not try anything. I know it is best to come to a doctor, yes? I do not want to make it worse. I just… waited. And it did not get better, so I came today. I have private insurance, if that is important.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. You did the right thing coming in. And yes, the insurance information is helpful, thank you. Now, I’m going to take a look in your ear. It’ll just take a moment. I'll need you to sit back and tilt your head slightly to the right.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. I will sit back and tilt my head to the right. I hope it is not too bad? It does not feel… very comfortable, sometimes, when someone puts things in my ear.
DOCTOR: Okay… I see some inflammation in the ear canal. And there is a discharge, as you described. It looks like there's some fluid behind the eardrum as well. The eardrum itself appears slightly bulging. It appears you have an acute otitis media - an ear infection. It's likely the inflammation is causing the blockage, muffled hearing and ringing. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I think antibiotics are needed. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes sense. An… infection. I understand. So, antibiotics will help? Will they make the pain go away, even though I do not have much pain now? I hope they are not too strong? I have a little… sensitive stomach, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. We'll start with a course of Amoxicillin. It’s a relatively mild antibiotic, and usually well-tolerated, but if you do experience any stomach upset, nausea, or diarrhea, let me know right away. We can adjust the medication if needed. It should help with the inflammation and clear up the infection, which should resolve the muffled hearing and ringing as well. I'll write you a prescription for ten days. You should start to feel some improvement within 2-3 days. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not allergic to any medications. I have never had a problem with any medicine before. Thank you for asking, that is… important, yes? And thank you for the antibiotics. I hope they work quickly. Ten days, you said? I will remember that.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And you’re very welcome. Ten days, yes. Now, I also want to give you a few instructions to help with the healing process. Avoid getting any water in your ear for the next few days – so no swimming, and be careful when showering. Also, try to avoid blowing your nose too forcefully, as that can put pressure on your ear. I'm going to give you this sheet that summarizes everything we discussed, including potential side effects of the Amoxicillin. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No water in my ear… and be careful with blowing my nose. I understand. This is very helpful, thank you, Doctor. I will read it carefully when I get home. No, I do not think I have any questions right now. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you for seeing me today, Doctor Noordin. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help. If your symptoms worsen, or don't improve within 48-72 hours, please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment. Here's a card with the clinic's contact information. Get well soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And thank you again for everything. Goodbye. .
