DOCTOR: Alright, Kerriann, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hi Doctor Osterholm. It’s… it’s a little embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in how I smell, like my body odor. It’s not… normal for me, and it started a few weeks ago, maybe a month.
DOCTOR: A change in body odor, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s hard to describe… it’s not just more smell, it's… different. It used to be, well, just a normal sweat smell, you know? Now it’s kind of… sharper? And it seems to linger, even after I shower. I use the same soap I always have. It's just… concerning.
DOCTOR: Right. And how would you rate this change on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the most noticeable and bothersome?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Hmm… I’d say a six, maybe a seven. It’s not overpowering, but I notice it. And I’m worried other people might, too. I used to not have to think about it at all, and now… I find myself sniffing my clothes and stuff. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, it does. Now, has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. I’ve been eating pretty much the same things. Work’s been… work. I'm still laying floors, you know, like always. No new detergents or anything like that. My divorce was finalized about six months ago, so… I guess that’s a change, emotionally, but not physically? I haven’t started a new medication or anything. Honestly, I’m drawing a blank.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any sweating more than usual?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Actually, no. I don’t think so. It's not that I’m sweating more, it’s just… the smell is different when I do sweat. Like, a normal amount of work makes me smell…off. It's just... peculiar. I've been trying to figure it out for weeks now.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your skin?
PATIENT: Changes in my skin… hmm. Now that you mention it, maybe a little bit of redness under my arms? It's not a rash or anything, just… a bit more pink than usual. It doesn’t itch or anything. I just figured it was from the friction of my work clothes, honestly. It’s not really noticeable unless I’m looking for it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about fever, chills, night sweats, or any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills, and definitely no night sweats. And my weight is… pretty stable, I think. I haven't weighed myself lately, but my clothes fit the same. I'm a little heavier than I used to be, but that's just getting older, I suspect. Nothing sudden or dramatic, if that makes sense. I eat pretty regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s take a look at your underarms. It will only take a minute. Just lift your arms for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. There you go. I hope I'm not being a bother. I really appreciate you looking into this, Doctor. It's just... unsettling, not knowing what's going on.
DOCTOR: Hm. Okay. A little bit of redness there, as you mentioned. Nothing too concerning, but we’ll keep it in mind. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't had any allergic reactions to anything, ever, really. I’m pretty careful about what I eat and what I use on my skin. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. This is… new territory for me, feeling like something's off. Is it possible it’s just… stress, maybe? Even though I said the divorce was a while ago, it still bothers me sometimes.
DOCTOR: Stress can sometimes manifest in unexpected ways, certainly. But it's best to rule out other possibilities first. Are you currently taking any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, good point. Yes, actually. I take a multivitamin, just a basic one for women over 40, and I started taking Vitamin D a few months ago. The doctor at the clinic said a lot of people are low on it, especially in the winter. I take about 2000 IU a day, I think. Is that… a lot? I don't really pay attention to the specifics, to be honest.
DOCTOR: 2000 IU is a fairly common dose, but we can consider if that could be contributing. Now, do you have a family history of any unusual body odor or skin conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. I don’t really… talk about body odor with my family, if that makes sense. It's not really a topic of conversation. My mother had eczema when she was younger, but I never had it. And my father… he was healthy as a horse. No known skin conditions or anything unusual. I don’t remember anyone ever having… a noticeable odor problem, if that helps. It's just… not something we talked about. I wish I could be more helpful!
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's consider a few things. It's possible this is related to your Vitamin D supplement, although it’s not very common. It could also be a mild skin infection, or a change in your skin's bacteria. I'd like to order a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count, just to rule out any underlying issues. I'm also going to recommend a topical antifungal cream to try for two weeks to see if that helps. If that doesn't improve things, we may need to consider a referral to a dermatologist. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good, actually. A little overwhelming, but good. I’m just glad we're doing something to figure it out. So, blood work and the cream. Is the cream something I can pick up at the pharmacy? And will the blood work be done here, at the clinic? I'm pretty flexible, so I can work around whatever schedule you need. I just want this to go away.
DOCTOR: Yes, the cream is something you can pick up at any pharmacy. It's a mild over-the-counter antifungal. And yes, we can do the blood work here at the clinic. The lab is just down the hall. Let me write you a requisition. It doesn’t require fasting. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you're doing. If things get significantly worse before then, or you develop a fever or rash, please call the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Two weeks, and call if anything changes. I will definitely do that. Thank you, Doctor Osterholm. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure this out. It’s… a weight off my shoulders, honestly. And where can I find the lab down the hall?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. It’s my job. The lab is just down the hall to your left, room 203. The technician, Maria, is very nice. She’ll take good care of you. After that, just let the front desk know you're finished, and they’ll help you schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll go get the blood work done now. Have a good day.
