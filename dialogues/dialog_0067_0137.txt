DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. My name is Lindra. I… how you say… my family want me to go to a… a place for old people. They say I need paper from doctor to say I okay for go there. Is for… live there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So your family would like you to move into an assisted living facility, and they need a medical assessment from me to confirm you're able to safely do so. That’s perfectly reasonable. Just to confirm, and so I have a complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about why they feel you might need some extra support right now?
PATIENT: Extra support? Hmm… I think they worry because… sometimes I forget things. Little things. Like… where I put my glasses. Or what I eat for breakfast. Not big things, you know? I still cook, I still clean… I just… get mixed up sometimes. My husband, he does more now, too. He is good man. But I still can do things!
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. So mostly memory lapses—forgetting where you put things, or what you've eaten. And it sounds like your husband is helping out a bit more, but you still feel capable of managing most things on your own. When did you first start noticing these memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a hard question. Maybe… a year? Six months? I not sure. Is not… sudden, you know? Slowly. Like the fog coming in. Not every day. Sometimes good days, sometimes… not so good. It scare my daughter, I think. She is very worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, slowly progressing over the last six to twelve months. And it varies from day to day. I understand that's concerning, especially for your daughter. Besides the memory issues, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… Sometimes I feel… tired. More tired than before. And… sometimes, when I walk, I feel a little… shaky. Not all the time. But sometimes. And I fall… once. Last month. Not hurt bad, just… scare me. My husband, he say I need to be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, occasional shakiness, and a fall last month. Those are important things to mention. A fall is always something we need to investigate further. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions…? Hmm… Let me see. I have… the blood pressure. The doctor give me pills for that. I take them every day. And… my knees. They hurt. Old age, you know? They say is arthritis. I go to physical therapy sometimes, but not now. Too busy. And… oh! I had the… the flu, last winter. Very bad flu. But I okay now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have high blood pressure, managed with medication, some knee pain due to arthritis, and you had the flu last winter. Can you tell me the names of the medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh… names are hard. I… I have the little box, you know? With the pills. My daughter, she fill it for me. I not remember the names. Is… a white one, and a little blue one. And… the yellow one is for my knees. I take them every day. Sorry… I wish I could tell you the names.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s very common to have trouble remembering medication names. Your daughter keeping track of it is very helpful. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I not think so. I eat everything. I like all the food. And… no. I don't think I am allergic to anything. I never had a problem. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, when I go in the garden, but that is just the bugs. Not a allergy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No known allergies. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family’s health history?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mama, she… she had the sugar, you know? The diabetes. And my papa, he had problems with his heart. He was old when he die. My sister, she is healthy. And my brother… he had some trouble with his eyes. Is… hard to remember everything. Old family, you know? Many people.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of diabetes in your mother, heart problems in your father, and some eye issues in your brother. That's helpful. Now, I'd like to ask about your daily habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no! No, doctor. I don't do those things. Never have. I drink tea. Sometimes, a little wine with my husband, on Sunday. But not much. Just a little glass. I am a good woman. I take care of myself.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. Tea and an occasional glass of wine—sounds very reasonable. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, let’s talk a little bit about what brought you here today. Your family is suggesting assisted living. Do you have any thoughts about that yourself?
PATIENT: Assisted… living. I… I don't want to go. I like my house. I like my garden. I like my husband. But… I am getting old. And sometimes… sometimes I worry. Worry about falling. Worry about forgetting. My daughter, she say it will be safer. But… I don't know. I feel sad to leave my home.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you have mixed feelings—you want to maintain your independence and stay in your home, but you also recognize your family’s concerns and are starting to worry about your safety. That’s completely valid. Before we make any decisions, I want to get a better understanding of your current physical and cognitive abilities. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam and a few simple tests to assess your memory and balance?
PATIENT: Physical… test? Is… okay. If you think is good. I trust you, doctor. You seem very nice. But… please, be gentle. My knees… they not so good. And… I get nervous when people touch me. But I will try. For my daughter. And for my husband. Is… okay. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Abdollahi. I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll take things slowly. First, let’s just check your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then we'll do a brief physical exam, listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and looking at your knees. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Is alright. But… you will tell me what you doing? I not like surprises. Is make me nervous. Tell me first. Then I can… be ready. Is okay. Start slow.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will explain everything before I do it. No surprises. First, I’m going to wrap this cuff around your arm to check your blood pressure. It will inflate and tighten for a moment, but it shouldn't be painful. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. I’m just listening for any unusual sounds. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay. The… the cuff. Yes. And the… stethoscope? You listen to my heart? Is my heart okay? I feel sometimes… a little flutter. Is that bad? Is that what you listen for? Please tell me if is bad.
DOCTOR: It's good that you mention that flutter. Sometimes people feel those occasional palpitations and they are often harmless. That’s exactly what I'm listening for—to make sure everything sounds regular. It doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem, but it's good to check. I’m just going to inflate this cuff now. It will feel tight for a few seconds. Just relax your arm. And then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so, given your anxiety. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart… Sounds regular, no murmurs. Let’s check your lungs now.
PATIENT: Okay… is okay. I feel little nervous. Is that why my… pressure is high? My lungs…? Is everything okay? Please tell me. I worry too much. My husband, he say I worry too much.
DOCTOR: You’re doing very well, Ms. Abdollahi. Your nervousness definitely can contribute to a higher blood pressure reading, so it’s good to know. And you’re right to ask. Lungs are clear. Good breath sounds bilaterally. Now, let’s just take a quick look at your knees. I’ll gently bend and straighten them to assess your range of motion. And I’ll check for any swelling or tenderness. There’s some mild swelling in both knees, and you do have some tenderness when I bend them. That’s consistent with arthritis. But there’s no significant fluid buildup or signs of a more acute injury.
PATIENT: Arthritis… yes. Old age, you know? Is hurt a little. But is okay. I can handle it. But… is getting worse, maybe? Is that why I fall? Is my knees making me fall? My daughter, she worry I will break something.
DOCTOR: It's understandable why your daughter worries. The arthritis could be contributing to your balance issues and the fall, yes. When your knees are painful and weak, it can make it harder to stay steady. However, we need to rule out other potential causes, like medication side effects or issues with your inner ear. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. I'll tap on a few spots on your knees and ankles. This tells me how well your nervous system is functioning. Just relax your legs. Reflexes are normal. Now, let's do a quick memory test. I'm going to say three words, and I want you to try and remember them. Can you do that?
PATIENT: Three words… yes. Is okay. I will try. My memory… is not so good. But I will try my best. Please, say the words. Slow. Please, slow. I want to remember. For my daughter.
DOCTOR: Of course, slow and clear. Okay, here are the three words. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes… I am ready. Please say them. Slow.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are… table, penny, and garden. Now, I'm going to ask you a few other questions, and then I’ll ask you to repeat the three words. Don’t worry if you don't remember them right away. Just do your best. First, what year is it?
PATIENT: Hmm… what year… Oh dear. Is… 2025? Yes. I think is 2025. Is August, right? August 2nd? My birthday is in November.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're exactly right, it's August 2nd, 2025. Good. And where are we right now?
PATIENT: Where are we…? Is the… doctor’s office. The… rural clinic. Doctor Pfennig’s office. Is very nice office. But… I miss my house. Is getting cold in here, maybe?
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is a little chilly. I’ll adjust the thermostat. And yes, we are in my office at the rural clinic. Okay, last question before we get back to the three words. Can you tell me the names of the current President and Vice President?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That… I don't know. Is… Mr. Biden, maybe? Is a man. I don't remember the other one. I not good with names. I always forget names. Is bad, yes? Is very bad my memory.
DOCTOR: It's okay. These questions are challenging for many people, especially with stress and anxiety. It’s not a failing grade, Ms. Abdollahi. Now, can you repeat the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Three words…? Hmm. Was… table? And… penny? Was that right? And… garden. Yes. Table, penny, and… garden. Is that correct? I think… I think is correct. Is hard. My head… is a little fuzzy.
DOCTOR: That's excellent! You remembered all three words perfectly. Now, I know this has been a lot. Let's talk about what all this means and what our next steps should be. You have some memory lapses, but your overall cognitive function seems to be largely intact. The arthritis in your knees is contributing to some balance issues, and we need to consider other possible causes for your fall. I want to order some bloodwork to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or other underlying medical conditions. And I think a referral to a physical therapist would be very beneficial to help strengthen your knees and improve your balance. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Bloodwork…? And the physical… theapy? Yes. Is reasonable. If you think is good, doctor. But… will it help? Will I fall again? I don’t want to fall again. Is scary. And… my daughter, she want me to go to the… assisted living. But I don't want to go. Is okay if I try the… therapy first? Before I go to that place? Please. Is okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Abdollahi. That's perfectly reasonable, and we’ll absolutely try physical therapy first. I understand your concerns about falling, and that's exactly what we want to address with the therapy. It will help strengthen your legs and improve your balance, which will reduce your risk of falling. And we will work on strategies to prevent falls in the future. As for assisted living, we can absolutely hold off on that for now. Let’s see how you do with the physical therapy and address any other underlying medical conditions. We’ll make a decision based on your progress and how you’re feeling. I’m also going to prescribe a Vitamin D supplement. Vitamin D deficiency can contribute to muscle weakness and falls. Does that sound like a good plan to you?
PATIENT: Vitamin D… yes. Good. That sound good. Therapy… Vitamin D… not the… the place. Is good. Thank you, doctor. You listen to me. My daughter, she just want me to be safe. But I want to be at home. Is good plan. Yes. When do I start the… therapy? And… is the bloodwork bad? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. I understand how important it is to stay in your home, and we will work together to make that happen. The bloodwork isn’t necessarily bad, it’s just a routine test to rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. We’ll check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and other basic markers. The lab results typically take a few days to come back, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. As for the physical therapy, I’ll write you a referral to a local clinic. They'll contact you to schedule an evaluation. I recommend starting as soon as possible. They’ll create a personalized treatment plan based on your needs. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. You explain everything very good, doctor. I worry too much. My husband, he say I worry too much. But… thank you. For listening. And for not… for not making me go to the place right away. Is good. Is very good.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. It's my pleasure. And don’t worry about worrying—it’s perfectly natural. We'll take things one step at a time, and we'll work together to make sure you stay safe and comfortable in your home. Here’s the referral to physical therapy and the lab order. The physical therapy clinic is located at [Clinic Address] and their number is [Phone Number]. The lab is located at [Lab Address]. Please call to schedule your appointments as soon as you can. And don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Abdollahi. And please, be careful. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
