DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Kobler, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s… difficult to explain, exactly. I’ve been feeling quite breathless lately. And my mouth… it feels very dry, and my eyes too. It’s been happening for a while now, but it’s getting… more noticeable, I suppose. I don’t really remember when it started, though. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Hm. “Just is,” you say. Alright. Well, “just is” doesn't really help me narrow things down, does it?
PATIENT: You are quite right, Doctor. I apologize. My memory… isn’t what it once was. I wish I could be more precise. Perhaps… a few weeks? Maybe a month? It feels like a long time, but I truly can't be certain. It hasn’t been interfering with my work too much, but it’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling. Okay. And is this breathlessness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I believe. It’s not… all the time. More when I exert myself, perhaps? Or… when I’m thinking very hard. It’s hard to say. Sometimes I don't even notice it, and other times it feels… like I can’t quite get enough air. It’s not painful, though. Just… worrying.
DOCTOR: Right. And aside from the breathlessness and dry mouth, any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I’ve been feeling… rather tired lately. More tired than usual, perhaps. And… my eyes feel gritty, even when I close them. I’ve been using eye drops, but they don't seem to help much. I don't think that's unusual, though, is it? I do a great deal of reading, for my work.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not necessarily unusual, with the reading. But let’s cover all bases. Any fever, chills, cough, or chest pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever or chills. I haven’t had a cough. And no chest pain, thankfully. It’s mostly just… the breathlessness, the dryness, and the tiredness. It’s a bit… frustrating, because I can’t seem to pinpoint anything that might be causing it. I haven’t changed anything in my routine recently, that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Just… one, I believe. Let me see… Ah, here it is. Lisinopril. For my blood pressure. The doctor prescribed it a few years ago. I take it every morning. Other than that, just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s not very often.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lisinopril. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. That’s a good question. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything, that I’m aware of. I used to be allergic to cats when I was a child, but I haven't been around one in years. And I don’t have any known food allergies. But… it’s possible I’ve forgotten something. My memory, as I said, isn’t what it once was. Is there anything specific you’re concerned about?
DOCTOR: We just need to be thorough, Ms. Kobler. Now, let's talk a little about your past medical history. Have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses… let me think. I had pneumonia when I was quite young, I believe. And… I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager. Other than that… nothing that I can recall. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I try to eat well and get plenty of rest, although lately… that’s been difficult. I did have a rather nasty fall a few years ago, but it didn't require surgery, just a lot of ice and rest. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: A fall, alright. Was there any head injury involved?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I… I don’t believe so. I hit my shoulder, mostly. I remember being quite bruised, and I had to take it easy for a while. But I don't recall any head injury, or a concussion. They checked me over at the clinic, and everything seemed alright. But, again, my memory isn’t the most reliable. It’s possible I’ve forgotten something. They did ask me a lot of questions, I remember that.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… complicated. My mother passed away when I was young. I don’t really know much about her medical history. My father… he was a fisherman. He was a very strong, healthy man, as far as I know. He never seemed to get sick. I have some distant relatives, but I haven’t seen them in years. I’m afraid I don’t have a great deal of information about their health either. It’s not something we talked about much. Is that… helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not ideal, no. Let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I’ve never smoked. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I’m a writer, Doctor. I need a clear head to work. Those things would simply interfere. I find I need a quiet and peaceful life to be productive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Can you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: 144 pounds. And you mentioned your height is 172 centimeters. Okay. Now, let me listen to your lungs and heart. Breathing sounds are a little diminished, but not significantly abnormal. Heart sounds are regular. Now, open your mouth for me… let’s take a look. Your throat is a little dry, but no obvious signs of infection. Your mucous membranes are also a little dry. Blood pressure is 138/82. Normal. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can follow your finger. It’s… a little difficult, perhaps? My eyes feel rather tired, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any double vision or blurry spots?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No double vision. And no blurry spots, not that I'm aware of. My vision is just… a little strained, perhaps? Like I've been reading for too long. It's not a sudden change, it's been gradually worsening over time. A little like… trying to focus on something in a dim light. But no spots or doubling of vision. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your symptoms – the breathlessness, dry mouth, tiredness, dry eyes – and the exam findings, it could be a number of things. Sjogren’s syndrome is one possibility, especially given the dryness. It’s an autoimmune disorder that affects moisture-producing glands. But it's also possible this is simply due to dehydration or medication side effects. We need some blood tests to rule things out. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, of course. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. Sjogren’s… I’ve never heard of it. Is it… serious? I suppose I should be prepared for the possibility of something being… wrong. It’s just… unsettling. I’ve always been so healthy. Yes, please. Let’s do the blood tests.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll draw some blood to check for antibodies associated with Sjogren’s, as well as a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel to assess your overall health. I'm also going to order a Schirmer's test to measure your tear production. The nurse will explain those tests to you. It may take a few days to get the results. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of water, and avoid things that might dry you out, like caffeine and alcohol. And make sure you’re getting enough rest. It sounds like you need it.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Plenty of water, and rest. I understand. Thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate you taking this seriously. I’ll do as you’ve instructed, and await the results. Will you… will you explain them to me when they’re back? I confess, I don’t understand much about these things.
DOCTOR: .
