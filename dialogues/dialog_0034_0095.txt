DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's about time I saw someone. It's… embarrassing, really. Woke up this morning and half my face feels like it's going to fall off. And I can’t hear out of one ear. It's just… inconvenient. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite concerning, and you're right to seek attention. It's never embarrassing to come in when you’re experiencing something like this. Let's try to figure out what's going on. Could you describe what you mean by "half your face feels like it's going to fall off"?
PATIENT: Well, it’s droopy, alright? On the left side. Like… everything is sliding downwards. It's hard to explain. I tried to smile just now, and it's… crooked. Very crooked. And it feels… weak. Like I can’t really control it. Is that clear enough? I don’t have time for a detailed anatomy lesson, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very clear, Ms. Nissenbaum. Drooping and weakness on the left side of your face. And this happened suddenly this morning?
PATIENT: Yes! Just… woke up. Everything was fine yesterday. Perfectly fine. I was at a luncheon, actually. Very important people there. I wouldn't have gone if I was looking… like this. It's just… disruptive. Honestly, I suspect it's stress. I've been very busy lately. Is there anything you can give me for stress? Something quick?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and stress can certainly play a role in various health issues. However, sudden facial weakness is something we need to investigate carefully to determine the underlying cause. While I’m happy to discuss stress management strategies with you, we first need to rule out other possibilities. Before we talk about potential treatments, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your symptoms and medical history. Then, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really? Look, I’m a radiologist. I see things, Doctor. I don’t need to be poked and prodded. But fine. If you absolutely insist. Just… try to be quick about it. And please don’t tell me it’s something contagious. I have a board meeting next week. Is it… is it something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: I understand your expertise as a radiologist, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I appreciate your perspective. However, a physical exam is crucial for a proper neurological assessment, even for those familiar with medical imaging. It allows me to evaluate the extent of the weakness and check for other potential signs. I assure you, I’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. And I understand your concern about contagiousness and your upcoming board meeting. That’s why a thorough evaluation is so important. We need to determine the cause to provide the most accurate information and guidance. To start, can you tell me if you've experienced any other symptoms alongside the facial weakness?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. Just the face and the ear. No headache, no dizziness, no… nothing. Honestly, it's just incredibly inconvenient. I had to cancel my lunch with Beatrice! She's very important. And I’m already behind on my paperwork. Look, is it… is it a stroke? That's what my housekeeper said. She watches too much television. But is it a stroke? Because if it is, I need to know now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about a stroke, Ms. Nissenbaum. It's good that you're thinking proactively. The sudden onset of facial weakness can be a sign of a stroke, but it can also be caused by other things. The fact that you haven't experienced headache, dizziness, or other symptoms is reassuring, but it doesn't rule anything out. To help determine the cause, I'd like to perform a brief neurological exam. This will involve checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation. It will also include examining your ears, eyes, and throat. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But make it snappy, Doctor. I have a reputation to uphold. And please, try not to touch my hair. It’s… a process. Just get it over with. And don't tell me it's something serious. I really don't have the time for serious right now.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your concerns and will be as quick and gentle as possible. I will absolutely respect your wishes regarding your hair. Let’s start with your eyes. Could you please follow my finger as I move it in an “H” pattern?
PATIENT: There. Done. Is that enough? Honestly, I could be reviewing patient files right now. This is a complete waste of my time. Just tell me if it's something I need to worry about or not. Is it… permanent? That’s what I really want to know.
DOCTOR: Your eye movements appear normal at this point. Now, I'd like to check your facial strength. Could you please close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: There. Done. It’s… harder on this side, obviously. You don’t need to tell me that. Is it… Bell's Palsy? My sister had that once. Awful. She couldn't even blink properly. Is that what I have? Just tell me straight, Doctor. No beating around the bush. I have a board meeting, remember?
DOCTOR: Bell's Palsy is a possibility, Ms. Nissenbaum, and your description of the symptoms is consistent with it. However, we need to rule out other causes first. Now, I’m going to ask you to smile. Can you show me your teeth?
PATIENT: There! Happy now? It’s… not pretty, is it? It looks ridiculous. Honestly, I look like a… a clown. Is there anything you can do about it? Something immediate? I can’t possibly attend a board meeting looking like this. A shot? Pills? Anything? And is it contagious? I really need to know about the contagious part. Beatrice would never forgive me.
DOCTOR: The weakness is quite pronounced on the left side, as you've noticed. Based on the exam so far, Bell's Palsy is the most likely diagnosis, but to be absolutely certain, I’d like to perform a quick hearing test. It's a simple procedure and will help rule out other potential causes affecting the facial nerve. It also addresses your concern about the ear. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But it better be quick. And don’t tell me it’s something I caught. I haven’t been near anyone sick, and Beatrice is very particular about my social calendar. Just… get it over with. I have a reputation to uphold, Doctor. A reputation.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your concerns. This will only take a moment. I’m going to gently place this instrument in your ear and listen for any sounds. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort. Okay, I’m listening now… Do you hear me clearly in both ears?
PATIENT: Yes! I hear you perfectly fine in both ears. Honestly, I have excellent hearing for my age. It’s the face that’s the problem. It's… unsettling, really. I look… diminished. And it’s all happening right before the board meeting. This is a disaster. Just tell me what it is. Is it Bell’s Palsy? And what do I do about it? Are there any… side effects to the treatment? I have a very busy schedule, Doctor. A very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Based on the examination, including the hearing test, Bell’s Palsy is the most likely diagnosis, Ms. Nissenbaum. The hearing test was normal, which helps rule out other causes. Bell's Palsy is a temporary weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face. It’s thought to be caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, often following a viral infection, but the exact cause is often unknown. The good news is that most people recover fully, although it can take weeks to months. The treatment typically involves a course of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, and sometimes antiviral medication. We can also discuss supportive measures like eye drops to keep your eye moist and protect it from irritation, and physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles. The side effects of corticosteroids are generally mild but can include increased appetite, fluid retention, and mood changes. We can discuss these in more detail and tailor the treatment to your specific needs. Do you have any questions about Bell's Palsy or the treatment options at this point?
PATIENT: Corticosteroids… side effects… fluid retention… mood changes… Honestly, that sounds dreadful. I have a very precise regimen. And I cannot afford to be… irritable. It would be a disaster. Is there… is there anything else I can do? Something… faster? Something that won't interfere with my schedule? Some kind of… injection, perhaps? And how long will it take to recover? Weeks? Months? That's… unacceptable. I have a board meeting next week! And Beatrice is expecting me at the opera in two weeks. Honestly, this is a catastrophe. A complete and utter catastrophe. And will it… will it be visible? Will people stare?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to help you manage this situation. Unfortunately, there isn’t a “quick fix” for Bell’s Palsy. Corticosteroids are the most effective treatment to reduce inflammation and improve the chances of a full recovery, and starting them as soon as possible is crucial. While there are some alternative therapies, there is limited evidence to support their effectiveness. I wouldn’t recommend foregoing the standard treatment in favor of unproven methods. As for an injection, there are some limited studies looking at botulinum toxin injections, but the evidence is still inconclusive, and it’s not routinely recommended. Regarding the timeline, most people start to see improvement within a few days to a week of starting corticosteroids. However, full recovery can take weeks to months, and in some cases, it may not be complete. As for visibility, the degree of asymmetry varies depending on the severity of the weakness. With treatment, the symptoms should improve over time. We can discuss strategies to minimize the appearance of asymmetry, such as wearing sunglasses or using eye drops to prevent dryness. I can prescribe a course of corticosteroids, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to assess your progress. I can also provide a referral to a physical therapist specializing in facial rehabilitation. Would you like me to proceed with the prescription?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. Prescribe the… the corticosteroids. But if I start to gain weight, or if I become… difficult, I’m holding you personally responsible, Doctor. And I want a detailed list of potential side effects. Everything. Don’t leave anything out. And a referral to a physical therapist, yes. Someone discreet. I don’t want anyone asking questions. And Beatrice… I need to be presentable for the opera. It's very important. Can you… can you write a note explaining the situation? Something I can show her, in case she notices anything… unusual. A medical explanation. Something sophisticated. She's a very discerning woman. Just get it over with, Doctor. I have a board meeting to prepare for. A very important board meeting. And an opera to attend. And a reputation to uphold.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your concerns and will ensure we address them thoroughly. I will write a prescription for a course of corticosteroids, and I will also provide a detailed list of potential side effects. I will also include a referral to a discreet physical therapist specializing in facial rehabilitation. I will also prepare a note explaining the situation to Beatrice, emphasizing the temporary nature of the condition and the steps you are taking to manage it. I will ensure it is sophisticated and addresses her discerning nature. I will have both documents ready for you before you leave. Here's the prescription. Please take it as directed, and let the pharmacy know if you have any questions. The physical therapy referral and the note for Beatrice will be ready in just a moment. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No. That will be all. Just… get it over with. I have a board meeting to prepare for. A very important board meeting. And an opera to attend. And a reputation to uphold. Thank you… I suppose.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Nissenbaum. I’ve prepared the physical therapy referral and the note for Beatrice. Here they are. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you. I wish you all the best with your board meeting and the opera. Have a good day.
