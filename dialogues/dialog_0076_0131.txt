DOCTOR: Right. Mykeisha Sla… Sla-ven, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Sla-ven. It’s kinda funny how people say it, sometimes. But yeah, that's me.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Doesn’t matter. So. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, the nurse kinda already went over it, but it’s my blood pressure. It’s been a little high lately, and she said I should come get it checked out by you. I don't really know much about it, to be honest. Just that it's not good if it stays up too high.
DOCTOR: The nurse… yes. They mean well. Alright. “A little high.” Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I usually check it at the pharmacy when I pick up my stuff, ‘cause they have one of those machines. And the last couple of times, it’s been around… I think one time it was 140 over something, and the other time it was 135 over… I don’t really remember the second number, sorry. Does that make sense? It's not always high, just sometimes.
DOCTOR: 140/… Right. And when was the last time you had it checked before these two instances?
PATIENT: Ooh, good question. Let me see… Before the pharmacy checks? Probably… at my last physical, I guess? That was… um… April of this year. Everything was normal then, I think. They didn’t say anything about my blood pressure being high, if that helps.
DOCTOR: "Normal." People say a lot of things. And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, not much, really. Just a vitamin D supplement, ‘cause the doctor said I was a little low on that a while back. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s about it. Nothing regular, if that makes sense. No blood pressure pills or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, anything like that?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything! My mom always said I had a cast iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Lucky you. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My grandmother on my mom’s side, she had high blood pressure, I think. And maybe my uncle on my dad’s side? But he didn’t take good care of himself, if you know what I mean. He smoked and drank a lot. It’s hard to remember exactly, 'cause it was a long time ago, and we didn’t really talk about health stuff much back then. Does that help at all?
DOCTOR: Vague. Extremely vague. Alright. How about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Okay… I work part-time, helping out at a senior center. It’s not too stressful, mostly just chatting and making sure everyone's okay. I try to walk when I can, but it’s been hot lately, so not as much as I’d like. I eat okay, I guess. I try to avoid too much fried food, but I have a sweet tooth, so I definitely enjoy a treat now and then. I don't smoke, and I only drink socially, like at parties or something.
DOCTOR: “Try to.” Right. Alright. Let’s take a look at your vitals, shall we?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: 152 over 88. Pulse 76. Not ideal. And let’s listen to your lungs… breathe deeply. Clear. No wheezing. Your weight is also a bit elevated for your height. We need to address this.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. That… doesn’t sound good, does it? 152… Wow. I didn’t realize it was that high. And my weight? I mean, I've been a little stressed lately, and I guess I haven’t been as active as I should be. I just haven’t had the energy. What do you think I should do? Like, what’s the first step?
DOCTOR: Lifestyle changes. Obviously. More exercise. Less… indulging. And watch your sodium intake. Frankly, it's common sense. We can start you on a low-dose diuretic. But don't expect miracles. This requires effort on your part.
PATIENT: A diuretic? Is that a pill? And… “effort”? I mean, I want to be healthier, but I’m just not sure where to start. It feels like a lot. What kinda exercise are we talking about? And what about food? What does "watch my sodium" even mean? I'm not really a cook, to be honest. I usually just get something quick and easy. Can you give me some examples? Like, really simple things I can do?
DOCTOR: I have patients all day who need my attention. Look, I can prescribe the diuretic – hydrochlorothiazide, 25mg, daily. It will help your body get rid of excess fluid and lower your blood pressure. As for the rest, I'll print out a pamphlet on low-sodium diets and general exercise guidelines. It's all basic information. Walk 30 minutes most days. Avoid processed foods. Read the labels. Is that clear enough?
PATIENT: Okay… a pamphlet. And the pill… hydrochlorothiazide. Right. Yeah, that's clear. But… are there any side effects with the pill? Like, anything I should be worried about? And… walking is fine, but what if I can't get out every day? Would other stuff work, like… swimming? I used to enjoy swimming, but it’s been a while. I just… don’t want to mess anything up, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course there are potential side effects. Dizziness. Fatigue. Electrolyte imbalances. Rare but possible. If you experience those, contact the office. Swimming is acceptable, if you’re able. Just… be sensible. Don’t overexert yourself. And stop asking so many questions. It’s a simple regimen. Take the pill, exercise, watch your diet. I have other patients. Here's the prescription. And here's the pamphlet. Next.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Right. Take the pill, exercise, watch my diet. Okay. Thank you, Dr. Ruocco. I guess I’ll… see you around then.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Goodbye. .
