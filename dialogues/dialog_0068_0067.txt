DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. Or... is it Murry?
PATIENT: Morning, doctor. Murry is fine. Just... Murry. It's good to meet you, I think. My back… it’s been bothering me. Not sure what day it is, honestly. Is that today, August? Feels like August.
DOCTOR: Yes, today is August 2nd. And you’re here because of your back, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, my back. When I breathe deep… oof. It hurts. Not all the time, just… when I really take a breath. It's hard to explain. Feels like something’s pulling, maybe? Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Around here, I think. Low down. It's not like a sharp pain, more… a deep ache. And it spreads sometimes, up my side a little. But mostly when I breathe, like I said. It's… hard to pinpoint. Everything feels a little achy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything specific happened that made it start?
PATIENT: Specific…? Not that I recall. Things just… started feeling tight. Maybe I lifted something too heavy? Or bent over wrong. I do a lot of work around the house, still. Building things, fixing things… I can't remember when it started hurting, though. It just… gradually got worse. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Not really. No fever, no cough. Just… tired. Old age, again, probably. Sometimes my legs feel a little weak, but that could be from not moving around enough. It's mostly just this pain with the breathing. Honestly, doctor, I just want to be able to breathe without it hurting. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that is not too much to ask at all. Alright, Mr. Ruocco. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just so I can get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. A quick exam… sounds good. I just hope it doesn't take too long. I've got things to do, you know? Building a birdhouse for my granddaughter. But yeah, go ahead. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just lie down on the table for me, please. We’ll start with listening to your breathing, then I’ll gently feel around your back. Just let me know if anything feels particularly painful.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Careful now… my bones aren't as strong as they used to be. Go ahead, doctor. I'll try to be still. Just… don't poke too hard, okay?
DOCTOR: Your breathing sounds… a little shallow, but clear. No wheezing or crackling that I can hear right now. And… there is some tenderness here on the left side. Not severe, but noticeable. Any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: Oof… yeah, that's it. That's where it hurts. Not a sharp pain, more… a dull ache, like a heavy weight. And… it kind of spreads around, doesn't it? Yeah, that’s definitely it, doctor. Don't press too hard, please. It's… uncomfortable. Old injury, maybe? I used to do a lot of heavy lifting when I was younger. Construction work, you know. But I can’t remember exactly what happened.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you bend forward towards your toes, if you’re able?
PATIENT: Whoa… no. No, that’s… that’s too much. Oof… that really hurt. I can’t do that, doctor. My back just won't let me. It feels like something’s going to snap. Maybe I'm just getting too old for this.
DOCTOR: Alright, no need to push it. That's very helpful to know. Okay, Mr. Ruocco. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you may have a muscle strain or sprain in your lower back. It’s difficult to say for certain without imaging, but given your age and lack of other concerning symptoms, I don't think it's anything immediately serious.
PATIENT: Imaging…? You mean… like an x-ray? Oh, dear. I don't really like hospitals. And… isn’t that expensive? I don’t have… well, I don’t have insurance. Is it really necessary? Just… is there anything else I can do? Maybe some cream or something? I just want this pain to go away. And I'd like to get back to building that birdhouse.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about the cost, Mr. Ruocco. An X-ray would give us a clearer picture, but given your history and the lack of red flags, we can try a more conservative approach first. We can start with some pain relief measures, such as over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you're able to take them. And I can recommend some gentle stretches and exercises to help strengthen your back muscles. I will print you a handout with those. We can reassess in a week or two, and if the pain isn’t improving, then we can discuss imaging options. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah… that sounds… okay. No poking, no x-rays for now. Just some… stretches? Over-the-counter… I think I can manage that. I used to take those for my arthritis, a long time ago. A handout… yes, that would be good. I forget things easily, you know. And a week or two… yeah, let’s try that. I just want to feel better. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. Here's the handout with the stretches and exercises. Start slowly and gently, and don't push yourself too hard. If you experience any increased pain, stop immediately. Also, I will write down a recommendation for over-the-counter pain relievers. If the pain worsens or doesn't improve within a couple of weeks, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can reconsider the imaging. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you again, doctor. You’ve been very kind. And… I appreciate you not wanting to poke or do x-rays right away. I’ll try to do those stretches. And I’ll take those pills. Hopefully, I can get back to building that birdhouse for my granddaughter soon. Okay… I think I’ll be going now. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And I hope you enjoy building that birdhouse with your granddaughter. .
