DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s my back. It’s been really bad lately. Much worse than usual. It’s hard to even stand up straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, “really bad lately,” and hard to stand straight. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well… it’s like a sharp pain, mostly in my lower back. It shoots down my leg sometimes too, the right one. It started a few weeks ago, but it’s getting worse every day. I try to move slow, but even then… oof. It hurts. I remember when the cancer was first found, it didn’t hurt this much.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharp pain in the lower back radiating down the right leg, worsening over a few weeks. And you're comparing the pain to when your cancer was first found… that's concerning. Just to clarify, when you say "when the cancer was first found," are you referring to a previous cancer diagnosis?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A few years back, they found something in my… well, I don’t know exactly where, but it was cancer. I had treatment, and it seemed okay for a while. But now… this back pain is different than anything I felt before, even then. And it’s making me worry it’s come back.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Meigs, and it's good you’re bringing this up. We definitely need to investigate this thoroughly. To get a clearer picture, can you describe the pain more specifically?
PATIENT: Okay… hmm. It’s not just one kind of hurt. Sometimes it’s a constant ache, like a heavy weight on my back. But then, if I try to bend over, or even just twist, it’s like a stabbing pain. And when I sit for too long, it gets really bad. Standing is… well, it’s not good either, but moving somehow helps a little. Does that make sense? I try to remember what it felt like before and… it’s just different now.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Constant ache with sharp, stabbing pain on movement, worsened by sitting. It's good you’re able to articulate that. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My right foot… sometimes it feels kinda numb, like it’s asleep. And sometimes I get a tingling sensation, like pins and needles, up my leg. It comes and goes, but it’s definitely been happening more lately. It’s worst when the pain is really bad, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness and tingling in the right foot, correlating with the pain. Good to know. Now, let's move onto your medical history. Besides the cancer you mentioned, have you had any other significant medical problems, surgeries, or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder taken out a long time ago, maybe 15 years? And… I broke my arm when I was a kid. Nothing major since then, really. Just the usual colds and flu. And… oh! I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I try to take my medicine, but sometimes I forget. It’s been a little hard since the divorce. Sorry, I don’t mean to talk about that. It doesn’t really matter, I guess.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Meigs. It's important for me to have a complete picture, and life events can affect things. So, gallbladder removal 15 years ago, broken arm as a child, and high blood pressure. You mentioned forgetting to take your medication sometimes. What medication are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: It's… Lisinopril, I think. The little white pill. I used to have a really good routine, but… things got messed up after. I try to remember every morning, but sometimes I’m just too tired, or I get distracted. It’s silly, I know. And I do have insurance, so getting refills isn’t a problem. I just… forget. I take something for the pain too, but that’s just Tylenol, and it’s not helping much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and Tylenol for pain, which isn't providing adequate relief. Good. Let’s talk about allergies – are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had to rush to the hospital or anything. I don’t have any skin allergies either, like poison ivy or anything. I used to worry about shellfish, but I’ve eaten it a bunch of times and I’m fine. I’m pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the Lisinopril and Tylenol?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I take a multivitamin, but I haven't been very good about it lately. And my sister sent me some herbal tea, something for sleeping. I tried it a couple of times, but it didn’t really help, so I stopped. That’s it, I think. Just the tea, and the vitamins sometimes. I don’t really like taking pills, so I don't take much.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional multivitamin and herbal tea, otherwise no regular medications. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Okay… my mom had high blood pressure, like me. And… my dad, he had something with his heart, I think. He died when I was young, so I don’t remember much about it. My sister is healthy, as far as I know. No one else in my family had cancer, as far as I know. We didn’t really talk about health much, growing up. It wasn’t a big thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure and potential heart issues in your father. That’s good to know. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on with my back. It’s been scaring me. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs. If you could please lie down on your stomach on the table, that would be great. I’m going to start by checking your back for tenderness and range of motion. Then I’ll check your reflexes and strength in your legs. It may be a little uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything causes you sharp pain. Okay, I'm starting now. Can you tell me where exactly it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s… yeah, right there. A little to the right of my spine. And it hurts when you push… kinda deep down. It’s not just on the surface. It feels… like a ache, but it shoots down my leg when you press too hard. Not bad yet, but… I can feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness with palpation in the lower back, right side, radiating pain down the right leg. Now, can you try to lift your right leg straight up like this?
PATIENT: Oof… that’s… difficult. It hurts to lift it. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a straining feeling. It feels like my muscles are tight. I can’t get it very high. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion with straight leg raise. Now, can you try to bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ooh… no. I can’t. It hurts too much. I can get this far… But I can’t go any further without it hurting really bad. My back just… stops me. It's like something is blocking me. It feels...tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited forward bending. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Could you please turn over and lie on your back?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. This is… uncomfortable. Everything hurts. But I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your legs. I’m just going to check your reflexes now. Right side… okay, a little diminished. Left side… good. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay… I’m trying… it feels weaker than usual, though. My right hand feels… harder to control. Like it’s not as strong. Is that bad? I don't know if I'm squeezing as hard as I can. Everything just hurts, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly diminished grip strength on the right side. Now, let's move on to some neurological testing. I'm going to lightly touch different parts of your legs and ask you to tell me if you can feel that. Okay?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That sounds… alright. I hope it doesn't hurt. I'm ready when you are. I can feel things, I think, but sometimes it’s hard to tell with all the other pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with the right leg. Can you tell me if you can feel this?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I can feel that. And… yes, I can feel that too. But… it feels kinda… numb. Not completely gone, but… not as sharp as it should be. Like a pins and needles feeling, if you know what I mean. It’s harder to tell on my leg than on my arm.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased sensation in certain dermatomes on the right leg. This is concerning. Based on the physical exam, the limited range of motion, diminished reflexes and grip strength on the right side, and the decreased sensation, it is possible you have nerve compression, potentially from a herniated disc. It's also important to rule out other causes. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order an MRI of your lower back. This will give us a clear picture of your spine and help us identify the source of the pain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… okay. That sounds… serious. But if it helps figure out what’s wrong, then yes. I want to know what’s going on. Especially with… with the cancer. Is it… is it possible this is related to that? I just want to get better.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Ms. Meigs. While it’s possible the pain could be related to your previous cancer, it’s more likely, based on the exam, that this is a separate issue. The MRI will help us determine that for certain. We’ll also need to review your cancer history to be sure. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory medication to help manage your pain and inflammation. I’ll also give you a referral to a physical therapist, who can teach you exercises to strengthen your back and core. Would you like me to go over the medications with you and explain any potential side effects?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be good. I always forget things, so it helps to have it explained. And… the physical therapy sounds good too. Anything that might help. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen. I was getting scared, thinking it was the cancer coming back.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. It’s my job to listen and help you figure out what's going on. Okay, so the first medication is called Cyclobenzaprine. It's a muscle relaxant that will help ease the tension in your back muscles. It can cause drowsiness, so it's best to take it at bedtime. Avoid driving or operating machinery if you feel sleepy. The second medication is Naproxen, an anti-inflammatory drug. It'll help reduce the inflammation that's causing your pain. It's important to take it with food to avoid stomach upset. I'll also write a referral for physical therapy. They'll assess your condition and develop a customized exercise plan to help strengthen your back and core muscles and improve your range of motion. Do you have any questions about the medications or the physical therapy?
PATIENT: Okay, Cyclobenzaprine at bedtime and Naproxen with food. And the physical therapy… how often will I need to go? And will it hurt? I’m already in so much pain, I don’t know if I can handle much more. Will the exercises be hard? I don’t want to make it worse. And… will my insurance cover the physical therapy? I hope so. I don't want to worry about the money, too.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ms. Meigs. Typically, physical therapy is scheduled two to three times per week for a few weeks, then gradually reduced as you improve. The physical therapist will start with gentle exercises and gradually increase the intensity as you get stronger. It’s possible you’ll experience some discomfort during the exercises, but it shouldn’t be sharp or unbearable. They will monitor your pain levels and adjust the program accordingly. As for your insurance coverage, I’ll have my staff check your benefits and confirm what’s covered. We can also discuss payment options if needed. I want to make sure you have access to the care you need without financial worry. I'm also going to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to review the MRI results and assess your progress. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything. You explained it really well, Doctor. I feel a little better, knowing what’s going on and what we’re going to do about it. Thank you again. I’m glad I came in today. And please… please let me know if the MRI shows anything bad. I want to know the truth, even if it’s scary. I can handle it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I understand your concern, and I promise to be honest and upfront with you about the MRI results. We will discuss everything thoroughly, and I’ll answer any questions you have. My staff will schedule the MRI and the follow-up appointment for you. They’ll also provide you with the prescriptions and instructions for the medications. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. I wish you well, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.
