DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it's… a bit embarrassing, to be frank. It’s something in my mouth. A white coating, you see. It’s quite bothersome and my wife insisted I come. She worries over everything, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. It’s good that your wife encouraged you to come in. It’s always best to get these things checked out. A white coating in the mouth… okay. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… on my tongue mostly. And the insides of my cheeks, a little. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it feels… unpleasant. Like there’s something… fuzzy there. I’ve been rinsing with mouthwash, the strong kind, but it doesn’t seem to be doing much good. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this, Doctor. I have work to get back to. Fallers don’t simply stop falling trees, you know.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you coming in despite your busy schedule, Mr. Schieber. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. “Fuzzy” is a helpful description. And it’s good to know it’s not painful. Has this coating been appearing for a long time, or is it something new?
PATIENT: New, I suppose. Within the last week or so. Perhaps a little longer. It’s difficult to say precisely. I don’t spend a great deal of time examining my mouth, if you understand. I eat, I work, I sleep. These… aesthetic concerns are not high on my list of priorities. Though my wife… well, she insists.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, within the last week or so. Has anything changed in your routine around that time?
PATIENT: Changed? No. Not really. Same work, same food… perhaps a little more stressed, if anything. The timber market is… volatile, let’s say. But nothing out of the ordinary. I assure you, Doctor, I’m a practical man. I don't believe a bit of stress causes… this.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Schieber. It’s helpful to know. Stress can sometimes contribute to various health issues, though we’ll explore all possibilities. Now, just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: My overall health? I work outdoors, Doctor. I lift heavy things. I’m… robust. I don’t do “health” – I live. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, I can't recall the last time, truthfully. I don’t take any medications, and I certainly don’t have any… conditions. Do I look unhealthy?
DOCTOR: You certainly appear very healthy, Mr. Schieber. That's excellent. And it’s good that you’re active. Just to be thorough, have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Nothing significant. A few cuts and bruises, naturally, from the work. Broken a rib once, years ago. But nothing that required… fussing. Honestly, Doctor, are you going to ask me about my childhood illnesses now? I’m here because of a bit of white stuff in my mouth, not to recount my medical history. I have trees to fell. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your time, Mr. Schieber. And I apologize if my questions seem tedious. Just a few more, and then we’ll take a look at your mouth. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
