DOCTOR: Hi Mackenzi, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. Well, to be quite frank… it’s about a surgery I’m considering. I believe I need a check-up beforehand to make sure everything is alright? It’s… a cosmetic procedure. I don't recall all the details, to be honest. It was discussed some time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A pre-operative check-up for a cosmetic procedure. No problem at all, that's a very sensible thing to do. Let me just pull up your file here…Okay, Mackenzi Brightful, age 29. And it looks like you have private insurance, which is great. To get started, can you tell me a little bit more about the surgery you're considering?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's right. Private insurance… thankfully. As for the surgery itself… it’s proving… difficult to recall precisely. I think it involves… some adjustments to my face? Perhaps around the cheeks? It was… a while ago when I spoke with the surgeon, and honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. My husband… he handled most of the arrangements. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly common to not remember every detail, especially when it comes to things planned some time ago. “Pt considering facial cosmetic surgery - details unclear. Husband involved in arrangements.” Okay, let's try a different approach. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort in your face currently?
PATIENT: Pain… not exactly. Discomfort… sometimes, yes. A little ache, here and there, but nothing persistent. It’s… hard to describe. It’s more of a… tiredness, I suppose? Like the muscles are always a bit strained. But it could just be stress, honestly. I… haven't really paid it much mind. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, "tiredness" or strain in the facial muscles, coming and going. That's helpful. Do you notice if anything specifically triggers this tiredness or ache?
PATIENT: Triggers… hmm. It's difficult to say. Sometimes when I’ve been… outdoors for a long time, working, perhaps. The sun, I think. And… smiling for extended periods. It sounds silly, I know. But it’s… a bit uncomfortable after a while. But I do a lot of landscaping, so being outside is unavoidable.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't sound silly at all, Mackenzi. That actually gives me some good information. Have you noticed any changes in your skin recently?
PATIENT: Changes… well, now that you mention it, yes. A few new freckles, I believe. More than usual, perhaps. And… my skin feels a little drier lately. I’ve been using more moisturizer, but it doesn’t seem to help as much as it used to. It’s not terribly bothersome, just… noticeable. I mostly work outside, so I assumed it was the sun.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased freckling and dryness, despite using moisturizer. Any changes in vision, Mackenzi?
PATIENT: Vision… No, I don’t think so. Everything seems… normal. Perhaps a little blurry sometimes, but I’ve always needed glasses. I wear them when I’m reading or doing close work, but my distance vision is alright. I haven’t noticed any changes to my vision, specifically. Not that I’m aware of, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No recent changes in vision. To get a better picture of things, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just a general check of your face, skin, and some basic neurological checks. It shouldn’t take too long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I want to be as prepared as possible for this surgery. I just… I apologize again for being so vague. I truly wish my memory was better.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mackenzi. We’ll figure things out. Okay, I’m just gently feeling around your facial muscles now… Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes… just a little there, actually. It's not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache. I hadn't really noticed it before, to be honest. It's… subtle. Is that normal? I… sometimes I get tension headaches in that area, so I assumed it was related to that.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight tenderness near the temple, which you’ve also experienced with tension headaches. "Palpable tenderness near temple, reports association with previous tension headaches." Now, I’m just going to gently check your reflexes and sensation in your face. This is to make sure everything is functioning properly. I'll also take a look in your ears, nose and throat. Everything seems normal so far, Mackenzi. Your reflexes are intact, and your sensation is appropriate. Your ears, nose, and throat look clear. I'm noting some mild sun damage to the skin, as expected given your profession, but nothing concerning at this time.
PATIENT: That’s… very reassuring to hear, Doctor. I was rather worried that my job might cause some issues. It’s good to know everything seems alright. So, what does this all mean, exactly? Is the surgery still a viable option?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. Given your history and the exam findings, the surgery should be a viable option, but I think it’s important to have a thorough consultation with your surgeon. Specifically, I’d like them to be aware of the mild tenderness you experience near your temple and the potential for sun sensitivity. To be completely safe, and given the dryness you’ve experienced, I also recommend getting a baseline dermatology evaluation just to rule out anything pre-existing, like precancerous lesions, before proceeding. We can get a referral for you. And to cover all bases, I’d like to order some basic blood work – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel – just to make sure your overall health is optimal for surgery. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. A referral for dermatology and the blood work… absolutely. I just want to be as prepared as possible and minimize any potential complications. I appreciate your thoroughness, truly. It’s… comforting to know you’re taking everything so seriously. My husband always said I was too trusting, so it’s good to have a professional looking out for me. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. It's my job to ensure you have all the information you need. I’ll get the referral and blood work order sent over to the front desk now. They’ll schedule everything for you. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
