DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore, good to see you. I'm Dr. Billman. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor Billman. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… this weakness. It’s been getting worse, you see. Not all at once, but little by little. Makes things… difficult. Especially walking.
DOCTOR: Hmm, weakness, you say. And it's been progressive. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about where you’re feeling this weakness?
PATIENT: It started in my legs, I think. Just… felt a little heavier when I walked. Now, it’s… well, it’s both legs, and sometimes my arms feel tired too. Not always, but when I try to lift things… it’s harder now. It's not pain, Doctor. Just… not as strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started in your legs and is now affecting your arms as well. Not pain, just weakness. And you said it’s been happening gradually. Have you noticed it being worse at certain times of the day, or after specific activities?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think… it’s worse in the afternoon, maybe? When I’ve been doing things around the house. Gardening, mostly. I like to keep busy, you see. But after a bit… the legs just feel… heavy again. And sometimes, if I get too warm, it feels a bit… stiffer.
DOCTOR: Alright, so worse in the afternoon with activity, and possibly with heat. Do you have any trouble with balance?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. Not falling, not yet. But I feel… unsteady sometimes. Like I could… stumble. I have to hold onto things, you see. The furniture, mostly. And my wife, Leilani, she worries, of course. She helps me a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you have Leilani to help. Okay, let's talk about other things. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Oh… well. Yes, a little. It’s… harder sometimes, to… go. And I have to go more often, you see? Especially at night. It’s… inconvenient. I didn’t want to bother you with it, Doctor, but… you asked.
DOCTOR: No, it's good you told me. These things are important. And it is my job to ask. Okay. Have you had any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no chills. My weight… maybe a little, but I don’t think so. I’ve been eating pretty good, Leilani makes sure of that. Just… getting older, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's review a little bit of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions - like diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor told me years ago I have high blood pressure. I take pills for that, every day. And… I had some trouble with my heart a long time ago, but they fixed it with a… a thing. A little wire, I think. Otherwise, nothing much. I try to stay healthy, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure and a history of a heart issue that was addressed with a… device. Good. What medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Let me see… for the blood pressure… it’s a little white pill, I think. Leilani handles most of that, you see. She keeps them all organized. And… sometimes a pill for my knee, when it acts up. But that's not every day. I really don't know the names, Doctor. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That's alright, we can look it up. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. Never had any trouble with that. I can eat anything, praise the Lord. Leilani makes wonderful food, you see. She likes to experiment.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and balance. Can you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just… be gentle, okay? These old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astore, squeeze my hands as hard as you can. Good. Now, push against my hands – don’t push me off the table, just resist my force. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, and you have some mild weakness in your legs. . Your balance is a little off too. . Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: A little, Doctor. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Been feeling a little achy there lately. Like I pulled something, maybe. But nothing too bad. I thought it would go away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, Mr. Astore, based on what you've told me, and the exam, it sounds like you are experiencing progressive weakness, balance issues, and changes in your bowel habits. The mild lower back discomfort could be related, or it could be separate. Given your age and these symptoms, I'm concerned about a few possibilities, including nerve compression in your spine, or potentially something called peripheral neuropathy – damage to the nerves in your legs. It could also be a sign of something more serious, so we need to investigate further. I want to order some blood tests to start, to check for vitamin deficiencies and other potential causes. And I also recommend an MRI of your spine to get a better look at the nerves and rule out any compression. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… serious, Doctor. But… if you think it’s best, then yes. Whatever you think will help. I just want to know what’s going on, you see? And… are these tests expensive? My Medicare…
DOCTOR: It is a good idea to get to the bottom of this, Mr. Astore. And don’t worry about the cost right now. We'll submit everything to Medicare, and our billing department will handle any co-pays or deductibles. They're very good about working with patients. I'm also going to refer you to a neurologist – a specialist in nerve and brain disorders. They can help us interpret the MRI results and determine the best course of treatment. I’ll give you a list of the blood tests to get done, and a referral slip for the neurologist. I'll also have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, to discuss the results. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity, and be careful when walking. Use a cane or walker if you need to. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A neurologist… that sounds… frightening. But you think it’s important? And… will these tests tell us what’s wrong? I just… I don’t want to lose my independence, you see? I like to help Leilani in the garden. And… will I still be able to do that?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel anxious about seeing a specialist, Mr. Astore. I'm recommending it as a precaution, to get a clear diagnosis and ensure we're providing you with the best possible care. The tests should give us a better understanding of what’s causing your symptoms. And it's possible that it’s something we can manage with medication, physical therapy, or other treatments. It's too early to say whether you'll be able to continue gardening exactly as you do now, but we'll do everything we can to help you maintain your independence. The neurologist will discuss all of your options with you and develop a personalized treatment plan. I want to reassure you that we’re here to support you every step of the way. We'll answer any questions you have and address any concerns you may have. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that’s all. Just… thank you. For explaining everything. And… for not making me feel like an old fool.
DOCTOR: You're not an old fool, Mr. Astore. You're a patient who's rightfully concerned about his health, and you're doing the right thing by seeking medical attention. Here’s the information you'll need. The nurse will schedule that follow-up appointment for you before you leave. Please don't hesitate to call our office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care of yourself, and try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out together. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Astore.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Billman. You too. And… God bless you for your help.
