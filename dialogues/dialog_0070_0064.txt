DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, my chest. It’s been… hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. It feels… tight, sometimes. Like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Chest pain is certainly something we want to investigate. Can you tell me a bit more about this tightness?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, you know? More like… a heavy feeling. And it comes and goes. Usually when I’m walking, or… doing something. Not when I’m just sitting. Does that make sense? I don’t know all the fancy words. It just feels bad.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Chelberg. You don’t need to worry about “fancy words” at all. “Heavy feeling” and coming on with activity are very helpful descriptions. Now, when you say “activity”, could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh! Okay. Well, like… walking to the store. Or, you know, when I’m cleaning the house. Even sometimes just climbing the stairs. Not when I’m watching TV, or sleeping. It’s when I move. And it goes away when I stop. It doesn’t last long, maybe five, ten minutes. Sometimes less.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s brought on by exertion, relieved by rest, and doesn’t last very long. That's good information. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it a new symptom?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… not brand new. It started, I think, maybe a month ago? At first, it was just once in a while. I thought it was just… me being old, you know? But it’s been happening more lately. That’s why I came. I don’t want it to be… something bad.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Chelberg. It’s always best to get these things checked out. A month is certainly long enough to warrant a closer look. Now, aside from the chest tightness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well… I get a little breathless sometimes. Not all the time, just when I’m really walking fast. And… my left arm feels a little funny sometimes. Not pain, exactly. Just… heavy. Like when you’ve been holding something for a long time. Does that sound… silly?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t sound silly at all, Ms. Chelberg. Breathlessness and a heavy feeling in your left arm are important things to tell me. Just to clarify, does the heaviness in your arm happen at the same time as the chest tightness, or is it separate?
PATIENT: Usually… yes. When my chest hurts, my arm feels funny too. Not always, but most of the time. It’s on the left side, like… here. And the breathlessness… that comes with the walking. It’s hard to explain. It feels like I’m not getting enough air, you know? But only when I push myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, so chest tightness, heaviness in the left arm, and breathlessness with exertion, all occurring together most of the time. That’s very helpful. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Let me see… My doctor told me my blood pressure is a little high, but he gives me a pill for it. I take it every morning. And… I think I had a little bit of cholesterol, a long time ago, but I don’t take anything for that now. I don’t have the sugar sickness, no. My husband always tells me I eat too much sugar, but! That’s different.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you're being treated for high blood pressure, and you were told you had some elevated cholesterol in the past. And no diabetes. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Umm… let me think. I have the bottle here somewhere… Here! It says… Lisinopril. Is that right? Lisinopril. I take one every morning with my coffee.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lisinopril is correct. And how often do you see your primary care physician?
PATIENT: Usually… twice a year. For a check-up. And I go when I’m sick, of course. But the last check-up was… maybe six months ago? Everything was okay, he said. Just told me to watch my salt. My husband is always on me about that too!
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a very attentive husband! Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! When I was younger, I had my tonsils out. A long, long time ago. And… when I broke my wrist, falling down the stairs. But that was a long time ago too. No other surgeries, no. And I haven't been in the hospital for anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and a broken wrist in the past. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of heart disease, stroke, or diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father… he had a bad heart. He had to have… something done to it. A long time ago. I don’t know what it was called. And my aunt… she had a stroke. It was very sad. She couldn’t walk after that. And my mother… she had the sugar sickness. She had to take shots for it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart disease in your father, stroke in your aunt, and diabetes in your mother. That’s important information. Now, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t like smoking. My husband used to smoke, a long time ago, but he quit. It was very hard for him. He says it’s the worst thing you can do to yourself.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe two or three times a week. Nothing much. My husband has one too. We enjoy it with our food.
DOCTOR: Alright, a glass of wine with dinner a few times a week. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I can eat anything, take any medicine. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. She was right! I've never had a problem with anything like that.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Now, Ms. Chelberg, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. I’m a little worried, but I know you’ll help me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Chelberg. I appreciate your trust. Alright, let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me... and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not necessarily concerning, but we’ll need to investigate further. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90, and your pulse is 78 and regular. Now, let's check your reflexes… Your reflexes are normal, and your muscle strength appears good. Do you experience any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, no swelling. My feet sometimes hurt a little, after I’ve been on them all day, but no swelling. I try to put them up when I can. Oh, and I forgot to tell you… sometimes I get a little dizzy. Not often, but when I stand up too fast. It goes away pretty quick. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s important, Ms. Chelberg. Dizziness upon standing, even if brief, can be a helpful piece of the puzzle. It could indicate a drop in blood pressure. Alright, based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary examination, I'm concerned about the possibility of angina – chest pain related to reduced blood flow to the heart. The murmur, slightly elevated blood pressure, dizziness, and your family history all support this. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a few tests. Specifically, I'd like an EKG, a blood test to check your cholesterol and other markers, and a chest X-ray. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh… okay. If you think it’s necessary, yes. I just… I don’t like going to the hospital. But if it will help me… yes, tests are fine. What do I have to do?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Chelberg. We can arrange these tests to be done right here at the clinic. The EKG is quick and painless - we just place some stickers on your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity. The blood test will require a small sample from your arm. And the chest X-ray is also quick and won’t cause any discomfort. I’ll write you a referral for these tests, and the clinic staff will schedule them for you. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to prescribe a low dose of aspirin. Aspirin can help prevent blood clots, which is helpful if it turns out to be angina. Is there anything that would prevent you from taking aspirin?
PATIENT: Aspirin? No, I don’t think so. I take it sometimes for a headache, but… no allergies or anything. I haven’t taken it in a long time, though. My husband doesn’t like me taking too many pills. But if you think it’s okay, Doctor… then yes, okay. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm prescribing a low dose – 81 milligrams – to be taken daily. While we wait for the test results, I want you to avoid strenuous activity. If you experience any chest pain, stop immediately and sit down. If the pain doesn't subside within five minutes, call 911. We’ll review the test results together as soon as they are available. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: 911… okay. No strenuous activity. That means no cleaning the house, huh? No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I’m still a little worried, but I feel better knowing we’re doing something about it. When should I expect to hear about the tests?
DOCTOR: No cleaning the house for now, Ms. Chelberg. Rest is important. The clinic staff will contact you within 24-48 hours to schedule the tests. Once the results are in – typically within a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or feel lightheaded, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic immediately. Here is the prescription and the referral for the tests. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind a little more at ease. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I’ll go schedule those tests right away.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Chelberg. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get some rest, and we’ll see what the tests reveal. Have a good day.
