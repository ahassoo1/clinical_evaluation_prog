DOCTOR: Right, hello Mr. Hartness. Good to meet you. I'm Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, I gotta be quick, alright? I'm here for… the thing. The army thing. Need a check-up before they let me sign up. Don't have a lot of time to waste, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, the army physical… right. I remember seeing something about that. Well, let's try to be efficient. Just to confirm, you're looking for a general check-up to ensure you meet the requirements for joining the army?
PATIENT: Yep. That's it. Just…make sure I'm not falling apart, I guess. Though I doubt that. I keep myself in good shape. Better than most these days, I’ll tell ya. Don't need a long list of things, just... the basics. You know. Heart, lungs, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to hear you’re staying active. We’ll definitely cover the heart and lungs, and a general overview. Just so I have a complete picture… have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? What does that even mean? Look, I've had a cold now and then, like everyone. Broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. Stupid thing to do, really. Nothing serious. No hospitals, no…fancy diseases or anything. Just normal stuff. I'm a pretty healthy Swede, if you have to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major hospitalizations, broken arm as a child… good. And no chronic conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Chronic…? No. Look, I work with engines all day. Grease under my nails, that's my biggest problem. Not some…long-term sickness. I eat alright, sleep alright. Sometimes my back aches after a long day, but who doesn't have a bad back? It’s the job. Doesn’t stop me from anything, though.
DOCTOR: Right, some back pain related to work. Okay. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not that I know of. Never needed anything stronger than, uh, maybe aspirin for a headache. And I don’t get headaches often. Honestly, I don’t go near pills if I can help it. Prefer to just…tough it out, you know? My wife keeps trying to get me to take something for my back, but I always say no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're not currently taking any medications. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any family history of serious illness?
PATIENT: Serious…? My… my grandfather had something with his heart, I think. A long time ago. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had… well, she wasn’t very careful with what she ate. Got a bit… big, and then something with her breathing. But that was her own fault, really. Didn’t take care of herself. Not much else. My family’s pretty sturdy folk, generally.
DOCTOR: Okay. Grandfather with heart issues, aunt with weight and breathing problems. Alright. And just one last quick question before we move on to a physical exam… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Are you serious? Look at me! I work with engines. I need a clear head. No, no, and no. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, that's it. And it's not every night. Don't need a hangover when I have work to do. I'm a practical man. No time for messing about. So, can we just get this over with? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam then. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Then we'll do a quick check of your reflexes. Sound good?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just… don't take all day, alright? And don't poke too hard. I need my hands for work, remember? Let's get it over with. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could just have a seat here. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Another one… and out. Your heart rate is a little elevated, probably from talking, but sounds regular. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles that I can hear. Blood pressure is 140/90… a little on the higher side. Now, I'm just going to check your ears and throat. Open wide and say “Ahhh…”
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It's all perfectly normal, I assure you. Just a bit of grease under the fingernails, that’s all. And don't tell me I have high blood pressure. Everyone gets a bit worked up when they're talking to doctors, don't they? It’s the stress! So what’s next? Can we please hurry this up? I’m losing valuable time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ears look clear, throat is a little red, but nothing alarming. Your reflexes seem normal. Now, just to be complete, could you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. Walking. Perfectly fine. See? No problems. What are you looking for, exactly? I’m a perfectly capable man. I build engines all day! It requires a lot of walking, and standing, and lifting. So just tell me if I’m good to go, alright? I've got a schedule to keep. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, gait appears normal. Your balance is good. You mentioned back pain earlier. Is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Mostly after a long day at the shop. Like I said, it’s the job. Lifting heavy things, bending over… it takes a toll. I just rub some cream on it, and it gets better. It doesn’t stop me from anything, though. Honestly, it’s barely noticeable most of the time. Don't make a big deal out of it, alright? It’s just… an ache. A normal ache for a normal working man. You’re wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, based on this quick examination, and what you’ve told me, you appear to be in generally good health. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and the back pain warrants further attention. I recommend a more thorough blood pressure check over a few days, and possibly some physical therapy for your back. And I would also advise that you schedule a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician, if you have one. And, honestly, you might want to consider looking into ways to manage your stress.
PATIENT: Stress? Stress? I don’t have stress! I build engines! That’s not stressful, that’s…satisfying! And physical therapy? I don’t have time for physical therapy. Look, I appreciate you looking me over, but all this…fuss… It’s unnecessary. I’m going to the army. They’ll give me a proper check-up. I don’t need a list of things to worry about. So, am I cleared for the exam? Yes or no? Don't tell me I need to schedule appointments. I need a straight answer. Now. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Look, I understand your frustration. And legally, I can't prevent you from proceeding with the army exam. Based on this limited examination, there are no immediate red flags that would disqualify you. However, I strongly advise you to address your blood pressure and back pain, even if it's just monitoring them closely. So, yes. You are cleared for the exam. But I'm also documenting my concerns, and I recommend you follow up with a healthcare professional in the future. Do you have any further questions for me before I finish this report?
