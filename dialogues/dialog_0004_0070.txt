DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Deschane, you say? Yes. Well… I just moved here, see? New place. Need… doctor. Medicare, you know? Social thing. Not feeling bad, exactly. Just… new. Everything new.
DOCTOR: Right. A new patient visit. Understandable. And you said you're not experiencing any specific illness, per se… just establishing care. To be thorough, even when people feel “fine,” we still need a good history. It helps me get a baseline for your health. Let’s start with this: can you tell me about any medical conditions you have been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… hmm. That's a word. Long time ago, maybe. Back home, everything different. I… I think my back, a little. Old injury. From… work. Makeup, you know? Always bending. But not bad now. Honestly, I forget what the doctor said exactly. Something about… disc? Maybe. It was a long time.
DOCTOR: “Disc” is a good start. So, a history of back pain, potentially related to a previous work injury – possibly a slipped or herniated disc. We’ll need to clarify that. Do you currently experience any back pain?
PATIENT: Currently? No, not really. A little stiff sometimes, when I wake up. Old man stuff. But I work with… faces, you know? Not heavy lifting. I bend, yes, but it's not bad. I put cream on it. Rub it. That helps.
DOCTOR: Alright. Intermittent stiffness, managed with topical creams. And you mentioned working with faces… are you a makeup artist, Mr. Szmyd?
PATIENT: Yes, yes! That's right. Kile Szmyd, makeup. For… theater, mostly. Performance. I make people look… beautiful. Or scary. Whatever they need. Been doing it a long time. Many years.
DOCTOR: That's quite an occupation. Okay, so we've established a history of back discomfort and your profession. To get a full picture, I’m going to ask a series of questions about your overall health. Have you been hospitalized for anything, ever?
PATIENT: Hospital? Hmm… a long time ago. When I was… young. Maybe broken arm? Playing… football. A long time ago. Not important now. Very long time. I don't remember much about it. I just remember… white walls. And… not liking it.
DOCTOR: “Hospitalization for a possible broken arm in youth.” Vague, but noted. Any surgeries, Mr. Szmyd?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. No. I don't think so. Definitely no surgeries. Maybe… tonsils? When I was a little boy. But that was… ages ago. Mama took me. Not a real surgery, you know? Quick thing. I don't remember pain. Just… ice cream afterwards.
DOCTOR: Childhood tonsillectomy. We won’t worry about that. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – who has a history of any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. Mama, she… old. Very old. Still alive, I think. But in Russia. Far away. She… always tired. And Papa… he was strong. Farmer. Died… long ago. I think… heart? Maybe. I don’t remember. They didn’t… tell me much. Everything… sad.
DOCTOR: Okay. Maternal history of fatigue, paternal history of possible heart disease, both vague. We'll need to rely on your self-reported history for now. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Drink everything. Smoke everything… well, not anymore. Used to. No allergies. Never had a problem. Sometimes… itchy eyes. But that’s just the dust, you know? Old buildings. Not allergies.
DOCTOR: “Possible seasonal allergies, self-reported.” And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… just the cream. For the back. Rub it in. Sometimes I take… something for sleep. But not every night. Just when… things are loud. The neighbors, you know? Old building, thin walls. Not a real medicine, really. Just… helps.
DOCTOR: Okay. Topical cream for back discomfort and an as-needed sleep aid. We'll need to get specifics on the names of both, if you recall them. Now, I'm going to do a brief physical exam. Nothing extensive, just a general assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Yes, yes. Okay. Whatever you need. Just… be gentle, please. Old bones, you know? Not as strong as they used to be. And… don't stare at my stomach, okay?
DOCTOR: Of course. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. 140 over 88. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… Heart sounds are regular, rate is 72. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Some mild tenderness to palpation in the lower lumbar region. Range of motion is slightly limited. Alright. Everything appears generally within normal limits, aside from the mild lower back discomfort. We'll need to address that. Now, Mr. Szmyd, based on your history and the brief exam, I suspect your back pain is likely due to muscle strain and age-related wear and tear. We can try some conservative measures, like over-the-counter pain relievers and physical therapy.
PATIENT: Physical therapy… sounds expensive. And… I work with faces, you know? Don’t have time to… stretch and bend. Can’t I just get… stronger cream? Or maybe some pills? Something quick. Something easy.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, relying solely on topical creams or pills is not a long-term solution, and can have unintended consequences. I understand your schedule is busy, but neglecting proper care will only exacerbate the problem. We can discuss a referral to a physical therapist who can teach you some simple exercises to do at home. As for medication, I'm hesitant to prescribe anything strong at this point. We can start with a mild anti-inflammatory. But it's crucial you understand that this is a temporary fix. I'm prescribing Naproxen 500mg twice daily as needed for pain. Take with food. And I’ll provide you with a referral to a physical therapy clinic. Here you are. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to assess your progress. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Four weeks… hmm. That's a long time. And… physical therapy? Sounds like… work. Okay, okay. Fine. But… if it's too expensive, I’m not going. And… will these pills make me… sleepy? I need to make faces, you know? I can’t be… drooping.
DOCTOR: Naproxen is generally non-sedating, but everyone reacts differently. If you experience drowsiness, stop taking it immediately and contact my office. As for the cost of physical therapy, I recommend contacting the clinic directly to inquire about their fees and insurance coverage. Here’s a pamphlet outlining exercises you can do at home to supplement the therapy, should you choose to pursue it. It also covers proper posture and lifting techniques. I strongly advise you to follow these guidelines, regardless of whether you go to physical therapy or not. Now, is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… try not to give me anything too… strong, okay? And… make sure the pills don’t make me look… old. I make faces, remember? It's important. Thank you, doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Szmyd. Follow the instructions carefully. And please, schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks. .
PATIENT: .
