DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly, but I’ve noticed a change in my body odor. It's...different than usual, and not in a good way. I can’t really describe it, just that it’s not me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to discuss these things, Ms. Purtee—we’re here to help with all health concerns, no matter how personal they may seem. And it's good you're addressing it. "Different" is a helpful start. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this change?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started maybe a month ago? Around the beginning of July, I’d say. It wasn't sudden, more like… gradual. At first, I thought maybe I was just imagining things, or that I hadn’t been thorough enough with my usual routine. But it’s definitely persisted, and now I’m starting to worry a little. I usually don’t have any odor, you know? Unless I’m really working hard. And I have been working hard lately… flooring is tough work.
DOCTOR: Flooring is tough work! That level of physical exertion can certainly contribute to body odor, but since you say this is different than what you’d normally experience even with that level of activity, it’s good we’re looking into it. You mentioned it wasn’t sudden. Has it been steadily getting worse over the past month, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: It… fluctuates, I think. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and I almost convince myself it was just my imagination. Other days… it’s pretty strong. It doesn’t seem to be tied to how much I’m working, though. I had a really light day last week, barely lifted a thing, and it was worse that day than when I’m laying subfloors all day. That’s what’s really worrying me, to be honest. It doesn’t make any sense.
DOCTOR: That is unusual, Ms. Purtee. The fact that it's not consistently linked to exertion is definitely something we should investigate. Aside from the change in odor, have you noticed any other changes—anything at all—like changes in your skin, sweating patterns, or even your overall health?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. My skin feels normal. I haven’t noticed any difference in how much I sweat, actually. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but I figured that was just the heat. And the work, of course. I haven’t been sick or anything, no fever, no aches… just the tiredness. Oh! And maybe… a little bit of indigestion sometimes, but I eat pretty irregularly when I’m busy, so I just chalked that up to that. Nothing major, though. I really haven’t felt sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No fever, no aches, no significant changes in sweating… and the tiredness and indigestion are potentially work-related. To get a better picture, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. Just… high blood pressure, years ago. The doctor put me on a little pill for it, I took it for a while, then he said my numbers were good and I could stop. That was… oh, maybe ten years ago? And I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was a long time ago, and I recovered fine. No other major illnesses or anything. I'm on Medicare, so I see a lot of doctors, but nothing serious ever came of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, managed successfully, and gallbladder removal. That gives us a good starting point. And you said you see a lot of doctors with Medicare. Do you happen to know if they’ve documented your current medications, or any allergies you might have?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I'm sure they have. I go to the eye doctor and the foot doctor regularly, and they always ask. Let me think… No allergies, that I know of. I can eat anything. As for medications… well, I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said my levels were low. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, after a long day. But that’s it. Nothing regular, other than the vitamin D. I’ll have to look at the paperwork next time I’m at the eye doctor to be sure.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Purtee. That's very helpful. Vitamin D and ibuprofen as needed. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your skin, and take a look at your lymph nodes. It’s a standard exam, and it will help me rule out some possibilities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I'm a bit worried, but I'm glad you're looking into it. Go ahead. I'll just sit here, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, just relax and sit comfortably. Alright, Ms. Purtee. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good airflow on both sides. Now I'm going to take a look at your skin and check your lymph nodes. Skin appears normal, no rashes or lesions. Lymph nodes are… slightly palpable in your neck, but not significantly enlarged or tender. It’s within normal limits, but we’ll keep it in mind. Alright. Everything seems generally normal on the physical exam, which is good. However, a change in body odor, even with a normal physical, warrants further investigation. Given your history and the fluctuating nature of the odor, I’d like to order some blood work. It will help rule out any underlying medical conditions and give us a clearer picture of what might be going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood work is fine. I’d rather be sure than worry about it. What kind of things are you looking for, if you don’t mind me asking? I don't need to know everything, just… a general idea. I always get a little anxious about tests, you know? Knowing what to expect helps.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety completely, Ms. Purtee. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. We'll be looking at a complete blood count – that checks your red and white blood cells, which can indicate infection or other issues. We’ll also check your thyroid function – thyroid problems can sometimes cause changes in body odor. And we’ll do a metabolic panel, which looks at your kidney and liver function. It’s a standard set of tests, and it will give us a good baseline. We can also check for diabetes, which, in rare cases, can contribute to body odor changes. It's a fairly comprehensive panel, but it's all relatively routine. The lab technician will draw blood from your arm, and it shouldn't take very long. Do you have any concerns about getting blood drawn?
PATIENT: No, I don't mind the blood draw itself. I get a little lightheaded sometimes, that's all. I always try to eat something beforehand, just in case. And I’m not good with needles, but I can handle it. I’ve had blood work done plenty of times. So, thyroid, kidneys, liver… and diabetes? Okay. Is there anything I should do while we’re waiting for the results? Any particular things I should be watching for, or avoiding? Or should I just carry on as usual?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know you’re comfortable with the blood draw, Ms. Purtee. And yes, eating something beforehand is a very good idea, especially given your history of lightheadedness. As for what you should do while we’re waiting for the results, I wouldn't recommend making any significant changes to your routine right now. Continue with your normal activities and diet. However, I would suggest keeping a little log of the odor changes—when they occur, how strong they are, and if anything seems to trigger them. It might help us identify any patterns. And if you experience any new symptoms—fever, weight loss, fatigue, anything unusual—please don’t hesitate to call the clinic right away. Otherwise, just carry on as usual and we’ll discuss the results as soon as they come in. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A log of the odor… okay, I can do that. I’ll write it down every day, just to be safe. And I’ll call if anything else comes up. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Dr. VODZAK. It makes me feel a lot better. So, do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment, or will someone call me with the results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Purtee. I'm glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today, just to discuss the results in person. That will give the lab enough time to process everything. We can review the log you're keeping then, and decide on the next steps, if any are needed. How does next Tuesday at 10:00 AM sound?
PATIENT: Yes, next Tuesday at 10:00 AM works perfectly. Thank you again, Dr. VODZAK. I feel much better knowing we're getting this checked out. I’ll start my log tonight.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have the receptionist schedule that for you. And you're very welcome, Ms. Purtee. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next Tuesday.
