DOCTOR: Hi Radford, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Doctor… Morenomartinez, is it? Yes, well. It’s… a delicate matter. A most unpleasant matter, really. I don’t typically discuss such things, you understand. It's… a discharge. From… down there. I haven’t the foggiest idea what’s caused it, and frankly, I'd rather not dwell on it. It simply appeared.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s perfectly alright to feel uncomfortable talking about this, Radford, but it’s important we address it so we can figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. “A discharge,” you said. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More details? Really, Doctor? Must we? It’s… well, it’s not water, if that’s what you’re asking. Nor is it… solid. A sort of… fluid. And… yellowish, I believe. Though my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. It’s been… present for a few days, perhaps a week. I haven’t been feeling particularly ill, beyond the… indignity of it all. My wife, bless her heart, noticed it first. She insisted I come.
DOCTOR: Alright, a yellowish fluid discharge for about a week, no other significant symptoms, and your wife noticed it. That’s helpful. And you haven’t noticed any odor associated with it?
PATIENT: Odor? Good heavens, no! I would certainly remember that. No, it's not… pungent. Though, truthfully, I haven't been getting close enough to detect any odor, if there is one. One doesn’t simply… sniff at these things, Doctor. It’s quite… uncouth. Is this… common? Do many men suffer from such… ailments? It's rather distressing, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Radford, you’re not alone. These things happen, and it's much better to get it checked out. No odor is good. Now, have you noticed any pain, burning, or itching in the area?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not precisely pain. A slight… discomfort, perhaps. A bit of… irritation. It’s not debilitating, mind you. I wouldn’t call it painful. And itching… no, no significant itching. Just a general… unease. A sort of… chafing, if you will. Though I suspect that’s from the… situation itself, rather than a separate issue. My wife uses a rather… harsh laundry detergent, you know. Could it be that?
DOCTOR: Okay, slight discomfort and irritation, no significant pain or itching. You suspect the laundry detergent might be a factor. That's good to consider. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches recently?
PATIENT: Fever? Chills? No, no, nothing like that. I feel… perfectly normal, apart from this… unfortunate business. I had a bit of a cold last month, perhaps, but that’s passed. And no body aches. I play dominoes three times a week, you know. Keeps me quite active. I assure you, Doctor, if I were aching, I’d be the first to know. Dominoes requires a certain… physical prowess. It's not simply sitting around, you know. Are you sure this isn't just… age? Things wear out, don't they?
DOCTOR: You're very active, that's wonderful! And you're right, things can change with age, but it's important to rule out other possibilities. Now, have you had any changes in your urination – like increased frequency, burning, or difficulty going?
PATIENT: Changes in urination? Doctor, I've been urinating for eighty-three years. I think I would notice a change. No, everything is… as it always has been. Regular, if you will. No burning, no difficulty. Perfectly… normal. Though, now that you mention it, perhaps a little… weaker stream than usual. But that could be the dominoes. All that bending over… strains the back, you know. It’s a very physical game. Is this… serious, Doctor? Do I need… tests? I really dislike tests.
DOCTOR: Alright, a slightly weaker stream, but otherwise normal urination. I understand your dislike of tests, Radford, and we'll try to keep things as minimal as possible. But given the discharge, it's important to do a quick exam and possibly a urine test just to rule out any infection or other underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An exam… and a test. Just what I feared. Well, I suppose I have no choice. If you insist, Doctor. But please be gentle. And quick. I have a dominoes game at three. A very important game, you understand. I'm playing against old Mr. Henderson, and he's been bragging all week. It’s a matter of principle, you see. A man must defend his honor. But please, be as… discreet as possible. And thorough, of course. One wouldn’t want to miss anything, even if it means… discomfort. What exactly does this exam entail? I’d prefer a clear explanation, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Radford. I'll explain everything clearly. The exam will involve a brief visual inspection of the area, and I'll gently palpate your abdomen and groin area to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. We'll also collect a urine sample to test for infection. It will be quick and as comfortable as possible. I’ll have you lie down on the examination table, and I’ll provide a sheet for privacy. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Lie down, you say? A sheet… well, that’s something, I suppose. But a visual inspection… and palpation? It sounds… invasive. I trust you’ve seen this all before? You’re a professional, of course. But… must you touch everything? Is there no way to avoid the… physical aspect of this? I’m a modest man, Doctor. Very modest. And I really don’t want to be reminded of… well, you understand. But if it’s necessary… very well. But please be quick. And gentle. And try not to make eye contact. That would be most… unsettling. Is there a nurse present? Perhaps I would feel more… comfortable with a chaperone.
DOCTOR: Okay, Radford, I completely understand your concerns. I assure you, I am very professional and I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. We can absolutely have a nurse present as a chaperone if that would make you more comfortable. I will step out and ask one to join us. It will only take a moment. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. That would be… immensely reassuring. A nurse, yes. Thank you. A chaperone is… essential, really. It’s a matter of… propriety, you understand. I appreciate your understanding. And thank you for asking. It’s good to know you respect my… sensibilities. Please, don’t keep me waiting too long. The dominoes game… is fast approaching. Is this going to take long? Perhaps I should reschedule?
DOCTOR: Alright, Radford, this is Nurse Patel. She’ll be assisting us today. Nurse Patel, this is Mr. Krok. Are you comfortable with proceeding now?
PATIENT: Nurse Patel, is it? Yes, well. With a nurse present, I suppose I can… endure. But please, be discreet. And gentle. Both of you. This is… a delicate matter, you understand. Very delicate. And I really must be at my dominoes game by three. Old Mr. Henderson is quite the opponent. Very well. Let us get this over with. But please, do be quick. And no unnecessary… conversation. I prefer to remain… composed. Proceed when you’re ready. But I warn you, I am a very ticklish man.
DOCTOR: "Nurse Patel, if you could please hand Mr. Krok a drape for privacy, that would be wonderful." "Alright, Mr. Krok. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I'm just going to take a quick look and gently feel your abdomen. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately. Just relax as much as you can." “I’m just feeling for any tenderness or masses. Everything seems normal so far…” "Can you tell me if you've had any recent changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: “Bowel habits? Good heavens, Doctor, must we discuss everything? It’s… a rather personal question, you know. But… no, no recent changes. Perfectly regular, if you will. Though I did have a bit of… indigestion last week. A rather spicy kebab, you see. But that’s passed. Please, be gentle. This is… unsettling. And you’re poking about rather vigorously, Doctor. A bit less pressure, if you wouldn’t mind. It feels as though you're trying to… deflate me. Is this going to take much longer? The dominoes… they await.”
DOCTOR: “I apologize if I was a bit too vigorous, Mr. Krok. I’ll be much more gentle now. Just checking for any tenderness. Everything feels normal so far. We’re just moving to the groin area now, if you're comfortable with that.” "I see no obvious signs of inflammation or swelling. Now, can you describe the discharge to me again?
PATIENT: "The groin area? Must you? Really, Doctor… Very well. But please, be quick. And discreet. As for the discharge… it’s… yellowish. A sort of… fluid. Not thick, not watery. Just… present. It appears… intermittently. Sometimes more, sometimes less. It's not… pungent, thankfully. My wife was quite concerned, you see. She insisted I come. It's… embarrassing, really. A man of my age… to be discussing such things with a… doctor. And a nurse! It’s simply… unseemly. Is there any sign of… infection? Is it… serious? I really must be at my dominoes game. Old Mr. Henderson is counting on it."
DOCTOR: “Alright, Mr. Krok. I don’t see any obvious signs of infection, redness, or swelling. Everything appears normal on the surface. Given your description – the yellowish discharge, no odor, and no significant pain – it could be several things. It could be a mild irritation, a slight infection that’s not causing major symptoms, or even a benign fluid buildup. To be sure, I’d like to send a sample of the discharge to the lab for analysis. Nurse Patel can help with that.” “Could you please collect a sample of the discharge, if Mr. Krok is comfortable with that?
PATIENT: "A sample? You mean… that sample? Good heavens, Doctor, must we go to such lengths? It’s… degrading. Truly. I thought a simple visual inspection would suffice. But… if you insist. Very well. But please, be quick. And discreet. And gentle. I am a man of… delicate sensibilities, you know. And my dominoes game… it’s fast approaching. Tell me, Nurse Patel… have you collected many samples in your career? It’s… a rather personal question, you know. But I like to know… what I’m dealing with. Just… get it over with quickly. Please."
DOCTOR: “Nurse Patel, if you could please explain the procedure to Mr. Krok and assist him with collecting the sample in a private and respectful manner?
PATIENT: "Well… that is done. A most unpleasant experience, I assure you. Truly degrading. I trust you have enough sample? And I sincerely hope you can determine the cause of this… affliction quickly. My dominoes game… it’s starting soon. Tell me, Doctor, what are the chances this is something… serious? A disease, perhaps? Something… contagious? My wife would be devastated. I really must be going. What is the next step? Do I need to… quarantine? Is a special laundry detergent required? Please, tell me it’s nothing serious."
DOCTOR: "Thank you, Nurse Patel." “Alright, Mr. Krok. We’ve collected the sample, and we’ll send it to the lab right away. It typically takes 2-3 business days to get the results. While we wait, it’s unlikely to be anything serious. Given your description and the lack of fever or other concerning symptoms, it’s most likely a mild infection or irritation. But we need the lab results to confirm. “As for quarantine, no, that’s not necessary. It doesn't sound like anything contagious. A special laundry detergent isn't required, but avoiding harsh chemicals in the meantime is a good idea. We'll discuss treatment options once we have the results. “In the meantime, if you experience any fever, increased pain, or changes in your urination, please contact us immediately. “Is there anything else I can address before you go to your dominoes game?
PATIENT: “No quarantine? That is… reassuring. And no special laundry detergent? Good. My wife would have insisted on a full change of wardrobe. Dominoes… yes. I must attend my dominoes game. It’s… a matter of principle. “No, I believe that is all. Just… please, expedite the results. My reputation is at stake, you see. Old Mr. Henderson is counting on it. And I really must maintain my… composure. “Thank you, Doctor. And thank you, Nurse Patel. You have been… remarkably discreet, considering the circumstances. I shall await your call with… anticipation. Perhaps a little less anticipation than I await my dominoes game, but… anticipation nonetheless. Good day to you both.” “.”
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Mr. Krok. We’ll do our best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. Enjoy your dominoes game, and please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. “Nurse Patel, if you could please provide Mr. Krok with a copy of our after-visit instructions and the lab requisition form, that would be wonderful.” “Have a good day, and good luck with your game!”
