DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s my back. It’s been really bad. Worse than usual, you know? I keep thinking about the… the other thing, and this just feels like it’s getting harder to deal with.
DOCTOR: "The other thing?
PATIENT: You mean the… cancer. Yes. They found it last year. It was in my lung. They did… things. Medicine, mostly. It was okay for a while, but now this back pain is… different. It’s not just sore, it feels… deep. Like something’s broken, even when I don’t move. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Meigs, that does make sense. And I see here your history of lung cancer, treated last year. We need to determine if this back pain is related to the previous cancer, a new development, or something else entirely. Let's start with the pain itself. Can you describe exactly where the pain is located?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… it’s not just one spot. It’s… low, on my back, like where your… belt would be. But it goes around, to the sides, a little. And sometimes it feels like it’s shooting down my legs, but not all the way, just in the back of my thighs. It’s hard to explain. It's not like a quick hurt, it's...always there. Even when I'm sitting still.
DOCTOR: Okay, low back pain radiating around the flanks and into the posterior thighs. Constant pain, even at rest. Is there anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… nothing much, really. Lying down sometimes helps a little, but even then it's not gone. And… when I take the pain pills the doctor gave me before, they take the edge off, but not for long. It comes back pretty quick. I try to move around, ‘cause I heard that’s good, but sometimes that just makes it worse. It’s… confusing.
DOCTOR: I see. And what pain pills are you currently taking, and how often are you taking them?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. They’re… white, little pills. I think the doctor said… oxy… oxycodone? Something like that. I’ve been taking two, two times a day, when it gets really bad. But like I said, it doesn't last. Maybe four hours, five, then it's back to hurting. I don’t want to take too many, you know? I don’t want to get… used to them.
DOCTOR: Okay, oxycodone, two pills twice a day as needed. That's good you're mindful of the dosage. Now, Ms. Meigs, I need to ask about other symptoms. Have you experienced any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no weakness. I can walk okay. Sometimes my feet feel a little tingly, but just sometimes, and it doesn’t last long. It's like when they fall asleep, but not as bad. And… no problems with… going to the bathroom, if you don't mind me asking? Everything works normal there.
DOCTOR: No weakness, occasional tingling in feet, and normal bowel and bladder function. Good. Now, thinking more broadly, have you noticed any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss…? Um… I don’t know. I haven’t really been trying to lose weight. Maybe a little? I haven’t been eating as much, ‘cause everything just feels… hard. But I don’t know if that’s weight loss, or just not hungry. It's hard to say. I haven't stepped on the scale in a while, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay. And just to be thorough, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No fever, not that I've noticed. And no chills. Sometimes I get warm at night, but just from the blankets, I think. And… no night sweats. I sleep pretty normally. Except for the back pain, of course. That keeps me up sometimes. It's… frustrating. Does all this make sense? I'm trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Meigs, and you’re doing very well. I’m going to need to perform a physical examination now. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. I'm going to palpate your spine and assess your range of motion, and I'll also check your reflexes and sensation in your legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That's alright. I guess. I just… I don’t like doctors poking around too much, but if you need to, then go ahead. Just… be gentle, okay? And tell me what you’re doing, so I don’t get scared.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Meigs. I will explain everything as I go, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. Alright, if you could lie face down for me, please. I’m just feeling along your spine to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Okay, a little tenderness here, on the left side, at the L4-L5 level. And some muscle guarding. Now, can you lift your right leg, keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Okay… It… hurts a little when I lift it. Not terrible, but… it’s there. Feels like it’s pulling on my back. Is that normal? And… what’s L4-L5? Is that bad? I'm getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Ms. Meigs. L4 and L5 are simply the names of the vertebrae in your lower back. It’s not necessarily “bad” to have tenderness there, but it does indicate an area of potential concern. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Just relax your legs. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. And now I’m going to check sensation in your feet and legs. Can you tell me when you feel this?
PATIENT: Okay… Yes, I feel that… and that one too. Everything feels normal there. But… I'm still worried about my back. And what does all this mean? Is it the cancer again? Should we do a scan? I just want to know what's going on. It's scary not knowing.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Meigs. It is concerning to have persistent back pain, especially given your history of lung cancer. While the physical exam doesn’t reveal any immediately alarming neurological deficits, your pain warrants further investigation. Given your history, the most prudent course of action is to order imaging. I recommend an MRI of your lumbar spine to evaluate for any potential metastasis, compression fractures, or other structural abnormalities. We’ll also order routine bloodwork, including a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, to assess your overall health. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a muscle relaxant to help alleviate some of the pain and spasm. It won't solve the problem, but it should provide some temporary relief. We need to find out why you’re having this pain. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… an MRI. That sounds… serious. And bloodwork. Is it… is it likely it’s the cancer? I'm really scared now, Doctor. I thought things were okay for a while. And a muscle relaxant… will that make me sleepy? I need to be able to do things, you know? I have to take care of my place.
DOCTOR: It’s natural to be scared, Ms. Meigs, and I won't minimize your concerns. Ordering an MRI doesn’t automatically mean it is cancer. It's simply the most responsible way to rule out serious causes and get a definitive diagnosis. There are many other potential reasons for back pain, and we need to investigate those as well. As for the muscle relaxant, yes, it can cause some drowsiness, but the effect varies from person to person. We’ll start with a low dose, and you can adjust your activities accordingly. If it makes you too sleepy to function, we can discuss alternative options. It's important to balance pain relief with your ability to maintain your daily routine. We’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible, and I will personally review the results with you. In the meantime, please avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. We’ll get this figured out together. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address right now?
PATIENT: Okay… What about the pain pills? Can I keep taking those until we get the results? And… how long will the MRI take? And will it hurt? I don’t like being in those machines. And… will the insurance cover it? I don't want a big bill. I'm trying to think of everything. This is a lot.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Ms. Meigs. Yes, you can continue taking your pain pills as you have been, but I would advise against increasing the dosage. We want to avoid relying on them excessively while we determine the underlying cause of your pain. The MRI itself typically takes about 30-45 minutes. You’ll lie flat on a table, and the machine will make a loud knocking sound. You’ll be able to communicate with the technician at all times, and they can provide headphones if the noise is bothersome. It's generally not painful, but some people feel claustrophobic in the machine. If you are concerned about that, we can discuss a mild sedative to help you relax. Regarding insurance coverage, yes, your private insurance should cover the MRI, but there may be a co-pay or deductible. I will have our billing department verify your specific coverage and provide you with an estimate before the procedure. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to get you a diagnosis and appropriate treatment. We will proceed methodically, and I will be here to answer any questions or concerns you may have along the way. Does that alleviate some of your worries?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah. That helps. Knowing the insurance will cover it is good. And the sedative… I might need that. I don't do well with small spaces. When will I hear about the results? And what happens next, depending on what they find? I'm scared of what they might find, but I need to know. I just… I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: I understand your need to be prepared, Ms. Meigs. We typically receive the MRI results within 24-48 hours. I will personally review them as soon as they are available and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail. What happens next will depend entirely on the findings. If the MRI shows no signs of cancer or other serious pathology, we will explore other potential causes of your back pain, such as muscle strain, disc issues, or arthritis. If the MRI does reveal concerning findings, we will discuss appropriate treatment options, which may include medication, physical therapy, injections, or, in some cases, surgery. I want to emphasize that we will cross that bridge when we come to it. We don't want to jump to conclusions or cause unnecessary anxiety before we have all the facts. My priority is to get you an accurate diagnosis and develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your specific needs. I will also provide you with a referral to a physical therapist now, who can begin evaluating your condition and teach you some exercises to help manage your pain in the meantime. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That sounds good. A physical therapist… that might help. It’s better than just sitting around worrying. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything really well. And thank you for not… making me feel silly for being scared. I guess I’ll just… wait for the results. And try not to worry too much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. It's perfectly natural to be scared, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, we will face this together. I’ve ordered the MRI and scheduled the referral to physical therapy. The staff will contact you to schedule those appointments. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, Ms. Meigs, and try to rest. I will be in touch as soon as the results are available. .
