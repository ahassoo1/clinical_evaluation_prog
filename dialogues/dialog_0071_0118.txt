DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, it’s a bit of a… procedural thing, I suppose. Some paperwork needing filling, a certification, that sort of business. It's all rather tedious, really. I believe it has something to do with… keeping my license current? I don't recall the specifics, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes… right. Routine certification. My apologies, things do get a bit… muddled sometimes. Just trying to pull up your file here… Let’s see… Venard Oriley, age 60… Okay. So, to be clear, you're not experiencing any specific health concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: Concerns? No, not particularly. I maintain a… reasonable standard of health, Doctor. I wouldn't be here if I were falling apart, would I? It’s simply a matter of compliance, as I said. Though, I have noticed the television volume seems… louder than it used to be. Perhaps it’s the neighbours. They have dreadful taste in music, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, reasonable health… and the television volume. Noted. Just to be thorough, and my memory isn’t what it used to be… have you experienced any changes in your hearing recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, I am sixty years of age, Doctor. One expects a certain amount of… alteration. As I mentioned, the television. It's probably the neighbours. Or the programming. Dreadful, simply dreadful. I fail to see how anyone can enjoy such… noise. Are we going to get on with this certification, or are we simply discussing the decline of modern entertainment?
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. The certification. It's just… sometimes changes in hearing can indicate other issues, even if it seems minor. I just want to be certain. Perhaps a quick hearing screening wouldn't be a bad idea, just to rule things out?
PATIENT: A screening? Doctor, with all due respect, I am a healthcare professional myself. I assure you, my ears are perfectly functional. I’ve spent decades… well, a considerable amount of time, assessing the auditory capabilities of others. It seems rather… patronizing, to have my own hearing tested. Unless this is required for the certification, I fail to see the purpose.
DOCTOR: You are right to point that out, Mr. Oriley. My apologies. Let me double-check the requirements for this certification… It does seem to require a basic physical assessment, including a brief hearing check. It's a standard precaution, unfortunately. It's quite quick, I assure you. We just need to rule out any underlying issues before completing the paperwork. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Standard precautions… of course. Always something. Very well, Doctor. If it is absolutely required, I suppose I can endure a… brief examination. But do try to be expeditious. I have… commitments. And please, no loud noises. I find them quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Oriley. As quick and painless as possible, I promise. Let's start with your weight and height. If you could step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Must I? It seems rather… unnecessary. I assure you, my physique hasn’t altered dramatically in recent months. However… Very well. Get it over with. But do be gentle with the equipment. I wouldn't want to be held responsible for any calibration errors.
DOCTOR: 86 kilograms… and your height is listed as 195 centimeters. That’s consistent with your records. Alright. Now, for the hearing check. I'll just put these headphones on you, and you tell me when you hear a tone. Simple as that. We'll do one ear at a time.
PATIENT: Very well. But I must insist on a thorough cleaning of those devices beforehand. One can never be too careful with hygiene, you know. Especially in these… times. And please, no excessively high frequencies. I have a rather delicate constitution.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Oriley. Clean as can be. And we'll keep the volume at a comfortable level, I assure you. Just relax, and let me know when you hear a sound. Ready?
PATIENT: As I’ll ever be, I suppose. Proceed… but do be quick about it. And, for the love of all that is holy, keep it brief. I have a rather important appointment with… paperwork, you understand. Begin.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Oriley. I'm going to play a series of tones at different frequencies. Just press this button every time you hear a sound. It doesn't matter how faint it is. Just let me know.
PATIENT: …There. Did you get that? A rather… faint tone. It was barely audible. Honestly, the quality of this equipment is questionable. Continue. But do try to adjust the volume, Doctor. It’s quite irritating.
DOCTOR: Yes, I got that. And thank you for pointing that out. Okay, and now… It appears there's a slight dip in hearing at the higher frequencies in your left ear. Nothing drastic, but it's something to note. Let's try the right ear now.
PATIENT: A dip? A dip! Honestly, Doctor, I told you, this equipment is atrocious. It’s probably malfunctioning. Perhaps it needs recalibrating. Or replacing. A slight dip… as if that means anything. Very well, proceed with your… examination. But I assure you, the results will be entirely unreliable. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. The right ear shows a similar slight dip in higher frequencies, consistent with the left. It’s a mild loss, often seen with age. It doesn’t seem to be impacting your day-to-day hearing significantly, but it’s worth monitoring. Would you be open to a referral to an audiologist for a more comprehensive assessment?
PATIENT: An audiologist? Doctor, are you suggesting I have…hearing problems? I assure you, my ears are perfectly functional. This is preposterous. I’ve spent decades… well, a considerable amount of time, assessing the auditory capabilities of others. I wouldn't be here if I couldn't hear perfectly well. No. Absolutely not. A waste of time, and frankly, rather insulting. I think I’ve endured enough “assessments” for one day. Let’s simply complete the certification paperwork and be done with it. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Oriley. As you wish. We'll proceed with the certification completion. Just to reiterate for the record, you’re declining a referral to an audiologist at this time. It'll just take a few minutes to finalize everything. I just want to ensure everything is documented accurately.
