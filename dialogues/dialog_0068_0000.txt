DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It's this… weakness in my legs. It came on suddenly, just after I got over a really nasty cold. Not a pleasant experience, I assure you. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I’m a tour guide, you see, and you can’t exactly guide tours if you can barely stand.
DOCTOR: Weakness… and it started right after the cold?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. One day I was feeling a bit sniffly, the next I felt… well, not right. And then, boom. Legs like jelly. It’s not a complete collapse, mind you. I can still walk, but it's… effortful. And it feels… unstable. Do you understand? It's rather frustrating, honestly. I pride myself on being capable.
DOCTOR: I understand. Unstable, effortful… and this started very abruptly, after the cold resolved. Any pain associated with the weakness?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain. It's more… a heaviness. A sort of dull ache, if I push myself too much. But it's not like a sharp, throbbing pain. More… a discomfort. And honestly, I think some of that is just from trying to walk normally when my legs aren't cooperating. It’s quite annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long ago did this cold finish?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… the cold itself, it petered out about four days ago, I’d say. Maybe five. I remember distinctly because I was so relieved to finally be rid of it, and then this started. It's just… bad timing, really. I had a particularly good group scheduled to start yesterday, but I had to cancel. They weren’t pleased, I can assure you.
DOCTOR: Five days ago… Okay. And aside from the weakness and heaviness, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No fever now, certainly. I did have a mild one with the cold, but that’s gone. No numbness, tingling… nothing like that. Just… the legs. And a general feeling of being… off-balance, I suppose. It's hard to explain. It’s like trying to stand on a slightly uneven surface. And I’ve been rather tired, but honestly, who isn’t tired these days?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Doctor, really. Do you always ask people such… personal questions? I mean, I understand you’re a doctor and all, but… well. No, everything is perfectly normal in that regard. Completely unchanged. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Apologies, Ms. Firestone. It's… standard procedure, part of the neurological assessment. Just trying to be thorough. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything significant?
PATIENT: Well, I had a rather nasty bout of bronchitis a few years back, but that was quickly taken care of with antibiotics. Other than that… not really. I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. I eat reasonably well, I try to get some exercise when I can, and I don’t smoke or drink excessively. It's why this is so baffling, honestly. I don’t usually get sick.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always avoided them like the plague. Too much risk, too much downtime. I’m a practical woman, Doctor. I prefer to let my body heal itself whenever possible. It’s served me well enough up until now. Though, clearly, something is amiss.
DOCTOR: No surgeries. Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? Well, my mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had something with his heart. But nothing… dramatic. No history of anything neurological, certainly. We're a fairly sturdy bunch, generally.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. And occasionally, some ibuprofen for headaches. But that’s it. I try to avoid medications whenever possible. They always have so many side effects, don’t they? I prefer natural remedies whenever I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. I suppose that's unavoidable. Though, I do hope it won't take too long. I have arrangements to reschedule those tours, you see. And they are rather particular clients.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just step up on here, please. I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. First, let's just see if you can stand with your eyes closed, and try to maintain your balance. Just let me know when you feel unsteady.
PATIENT: Oh dear… This isn’t very promising, is it? I feel… remarkably unstable. It’s worse with my eyes closed, naturally. I can feel myself wobbling.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Alright, don’t strain yourself. That’s helpful to know. Now, can you try to walk a few steps for me, heel-to-toe?
PATIENT: Honestly, it feels ridiculous. Like I’m trying to walk on a tightrope. I can do it, but it's… labored. And it feels very unnatural. I usually have a much more graceful stride, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And I'm noting some mild instability with your gait, as well. Now, let's check your reflexes. Can you just relax your legs?
PATIENT: Very well. Do hurry, Doctor. This is… rather unsettling. And I have a great deal to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Reflexes are present, but a little bit weaker than I’d expect. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? I pride myself on having a good grip, but I suppose it's not my strongest asset.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your strength is a little bit diminished in your legs, as well. Based on what I’m seeing, Ms. Firestone, your symptoms – the weakness, the instability, the diminished reflexes – are concerning for peripheral neuropathy. It’s a condition where the nerves that control sensation and movement in your limbs are damaged. It can have various causes.
PATIENT: Peripheral… what now? Nerves damaged? That sounds… rather serious. And what sort of causes? Is it… contagious? And will I be able to guide tours again? Honestly, Doctor, I need a straight answer. This is my livelihood we're talking about.
DOCTOR: It’s not contagious, Ms. Firestone. Peripheral neuropathy isn’t an infection. It can be caused by a number of things – diabetes is a common cause, but also vitamin deficiencies, certain medications, and sometimes, it can develop after an infection like a cold, although that is less common. It’s not always serious, but it's important to find the underlying cause so we can treat it. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order some blood tests – to check your vitamin levels, blood sugar, and rule out any other underlying causes. I also think it would be a good idea to get a nerve conduction study, which can help us assess the extent of the nerve damage. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… another study? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite involved. Very well, if it's necessary. But I do hope it doesn't take too long. I have a reputation to uphold, you see. And frankly, I’m not fond of needles. Are these tests covered by Medicare, at least?
DOCTOR: Yes, these tests should be covered by Medicare, Ms. Firestone. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood for the tests today. The nerve conduction study will require a referral to a specialist, and we'll schedule that as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding activities that strain your legs – so, unfortunately, guiding tours is not advisable at this time. I'll also prescribe a multivitamin with B vitamins, as deficiencies can contribute to neuropathy. It's a relatively simple step, and may provide some relief. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Very well. A multivitamin is… acceptable, I suppose. No allergies, Doctor. Though, as I mentioned, I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. But if you insist… And I trust you’ll expedite this process as much as possible? I can’t afford to be laid up for weeks on end.
DOCTOR: I will, Ms. Firestone. I'll personally follow up with the specialist to ensure a timely appointment. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available, and we’ll discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if your weakness worsens or you develop any numbness or tingling, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I suppose not. Just… please do hurry. And thank you, I suppose. Though I do wish this hadn’t happened. It’s terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Firestone. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please let us know if you have any concerns. Have a good day, despite the circumstances.
