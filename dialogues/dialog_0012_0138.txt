DOCTOR: Hi Alayne, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Dr. Yoshino, you said? Well, it’s a bit hard to explain… things have been… fuzzy lately. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… weakness? And my family… there’s been a lot of bad headaches, you see. My sister, she used to get them something awful. I can’t quite remember all the details, though. It's just… a worry, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, “fuzzy” and a worry about weakness and headaches… that’s a good place to start. It's completely understandable to feel worried, and it’s great your daughter brought you in. Let’s try to sort through things a bit. When you say “fuzzy,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not like I’m confused, exactly. It’s more… like trying to grab smoke. Things just… slip away. Dates, mostly. And names, sometimes. And… oh, what was I going to say? It happens mostly in the evenings, I think. Not all the time, thankfully. It’s just… frustrating, you know? It’s not like I used to be this way. I worked in insurance for… oh, goodness, nearly fifty years! You have to remember details for that! But lately… not so much.
DOCTOR: That’s really helpful, thank you. So, mostly memory issues, particularly with dates and names, and it's more noticeable in the evenings. And it's a change from how you used to be, which is important to know. Fifty years in insurance – that does require a good memory! Okay. Just to get a clearer picture, has this been happening suddenly, or has it been a gradual change over time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think… It wasn’t a sudden thing, no. It sort of… crept up on me. A little bit worse each year, maybe? It’s hard to say for sure. It’s like… a slow leak in a tire, you know? You don’t notice it right away, but then one day you realize it’s pretty low. My husband, bless his soul, he started noticing it before I did, I think. He’d help me remember things, little things. He always had a good memory. It’s been… a while since he passed.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your husband. It sounds like he was a wonderful support. And that's a good analogy – a slow leak. So, it's been developing gradually over some time. Okay. Besides the memory issues, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Well, sometimes my hand feels… heavy. Not always, and it doesn't hurt, exactly. Just… clumsy. I drop things more than I used to. And… oh dear, what was I going to say? My daughter mentioned something… about my face drooping? I don't notice it myself, but she said it happens sometimes when I’m talking. She worries so. It’s probably nothing, though. Old age, you know. Things just wear out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some clumsiness in your hand and your daughter has noticed some drooping on one side of your face when you talk. That’s good information, and it's important that she brought that to your attention. We’ll need to take a closer look at that. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that you’re currently being treated for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, nothing too bad. I take some pills for that. And… my blood pressure, it gets a little high sometimes. The doctor put me on something for that, a little white pill. I take it every morning, I think. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that’s… that’s all I can think of right now. I’ve been pretty healthy, all in all. Until lately, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your knees, high blood pressure, and gallbladder removal in the past. That’s helpful. Do you happen to know the names of the medications you take for your blood pressure and arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now you're asking something difficult! I'm terrible with names, you know? I just take the pills the doctor gives me. They're… little white ones for the blood pressure, I think. And… pink ones for my knees, maybe? Or yellow? Honestly, I leave all that to my daughter. She keeps track of everything. I just know to take them with my breakfast. It’s probably written down somewhere, but I can't remember where! Don’t worry, my daughter will have the list. She's very organized.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can check your medication list in our system or have your daughter bring it in. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can remember. I used to eat everything! My sister, now she had allergies. Pollen, mostly. Sneezed all spring. But me? No, I don’t think I have any allergies. I’ve been lucky that way, I guess. Though, I don’t eat shellfish anymore. But that’s just because I don’t particularly like it! It's not an allergy, just a preference.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just a dislike for shellfish. That’s good to know. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's a bit of a sad story, actually. My mother, she had… something with her heart. I don’t remember the details, it was a long time ago. And my sister, like I said, she had terrible migraines. Just awful headaches. She suffered with those for years. And… oh dear, what else? My uncle, he had… something with his brain, I think. It affected his memory. He got very confused in his later years. It's all a bit fuzzy, you see. But there were a lot of… problems with the brain, and the heart, in my family. It worries me, of course. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart problems and migraines in your family, and some memory issues in an uncle. That is helpful information. Now, let's do a quick exam, if that’s alright with you. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a brief neurological exam to assess your memory and coordination. It won’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do, just let me know. I trust you. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding. My daughter always said I was a good patient. Go right ahead. Just… try not to make it too uncomfortable, okay? My knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be as gentle as possible. Take a nice, deep breath for me, Alayne. And another one… Good. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not particularly concerning at this point, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Take a few deep breaths… Good. Your lungs are clear. And now I'm going to check your reflexes… These are a little diminished, but not unexpected given your age. Now, can you remember these three words: apple, table, penny?
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny… Hmm… apple… that’s easy enough. And… table, yes. But… penny… Oh dear. It’s right on the tip of my tongue! It’s something small, round… metallic… I just can’t seem to grasp it! It’s so frustrating. I know I heard it, but it’s slipped away. Table… and… something. I'm sorry, dear. It's just gone. It's like trying to hold water in my hands.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Alayne. It happens. It’s very common. Now, I’m going to do a quick assessment of your facial strength. Could you please smile for me?
PATIENT: Is that alright? It feels a little strange, actually. Like one side isn’t quite… cooperating. I don’t usually notice it, but now that you mention it… yes, it feels a little weaker on this side. It’s probably nothing, though. Old age, you know. Everything starts to droop eventually.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do notice some slight asymmetry when you smile, and there's some weakness on the left side of your face. Your speech is clear, but I’ll need to document this finding. Alright, Alayne, thank you for letting me do a thorough exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, I'm concerned about a few things. The memory issues, the clumsiness, the facial weakness… These symptoms, especially together, could indicate several possibilities. It could be something relatively benign, like a vitamin deficiency or a minor stroke, but it's important to rule out anything more serious. I want to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels and thyroid function. And I’m going to order an MRI of your brain to get a better look at what’s going on. It’s the best way to rule out a stroke or other neurological issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. An MRI? Is that… is that going to hurt? I don't like the sound of all this. Strokes… that's what my uncle had, wasn't it? But I feel okay, mostly. Just a bit… fuzzy. Is it something I did? Did I eat something bad? What are you thinking it could be, Doctor? And what happens if… if it is something bad? I just want to get my memory back. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be worried, Alayne. It does sound serious, and I want to assure you I’m taking your concerns very seriously. An MRI is a painless imaging test. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it uses magnets and radio waves to create pictures of your brain. It’s completely non-invasive. It's like a very detailed X-ray, but without the radiation. And no, this isn’t something you did. It's not about eating something bad. These things can happen for a variety of reasons, and it's not your fault. As for what it could be, it’s too early to say definitively. The symptoms you’re experiencing could be due to a number of things. It could be a small stroke, as you mentioned, but it could also be something else like a vascular issue, a vitamin deficiency, or even early signs of dementia. That's why the MRI is so important - it will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. I want to be upfront with you - if it is a stroke, the sooner we diagnose it, the better the chances of treatment and recovery. And if it’s something else, like early dementia, early diagnosis allows us to start managing the symptoms and planning for the future. I want to reassure you that we will take things one step at a time. We’ll get the MRI results back, and then we’ll discuss all your options and create a plan that’s right for you. We will be with you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about the MRI itself?
PATIENT: An MRI… so it's like a picture. That's good. But… magnets? Will it hurt my heart? I have a bit of a murmur, you know. And what if it shows something… bad? My daughter, she’s very worried about my memory. She says it’s getting worse. She’s the one who made the appointment, you see. She's always looking out for me. But… dementia? That's what my grandmother had. She… she didn't remember anyone at the end. Is that what’s going to happen to me? I just… I don't want to forget my family. I don't want to forget them. Will it make me forget?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly natural to be scared, Alayne. And I want to address all your concerns. The MRI uses strong magnets, but it’s very safe. The magnetic field won’t affect your heart murmur. We’ll take all the necessary precautions to ensure your safety during the scan. We’ll ask you about any metal implants you have before the scan, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable throughout the entire process. Now, let's talk about dementia. It’s understandable that you’re worried about that, given your grandmother’s experience. Dementia is a complex condition, and there are many different types. If the MRI does show signs of dementia, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll experience the same thing your grandmother did. There are treatments and therapies that can help manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. And more importantly, it doesn't mean you will lose yourself. I want to emphasize that we don’t know for sure if you have dementia yet. The MRI is just one piece of the puzzle. We’ll also do some cognitive tests to assess your memory and thinking skills. It’s important to remember that even if you do have some cognitive impairment, you’re not alone. There are support groups and resources available to help you and your family cope with the challenges of dementia. And most importantly, it doesn’t mean you’ll lose your personality or your connection to your loved ones. Right now, let’s focus on getting the MRI done. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss all your options and create a plan that’s right for you. I will be with you every step of the way. Do you want me to explain the process of the MRI in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Tell me what it will be like. Will I be in there for a long time? Will it be loud? And… will I be alone? I don't like small spaces, you see. And I don’t do well with loud noises. I just… I get scared easily, sometimes. It’s silly, I know, but… my daughter says I worry too much. But I can't help it. What if something happens while I’m in there? What if I get stuck?
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all to be scared, Alayne. It’s perfectly understandable to feel anxious about being in a small space with loud noises. And I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to make sure you’re comfortable and safe. The MRI machine is a large, cylindrical tube. You’ll lie on a table that slides into the machine. It’s not a completely enclosed space – there’s a good amount of room around you. The scan itself typically takes about 30 to 60 minutes, depending on what we need to look at. And yes, it can be quite loud. The machine makes a series of banging and whirring noises. We’ll give you earplugs or headphones to help block out the sound. You can even listen to music during the scan if you’d like. You won't be alone. A technologist will be in the control room the entire time, monitoring the scan. They can see and hear you, and you can communicate with them through a microphone. If you feel uncomfortable at any time, you can press a button to stop the scan. We'll also make sure you're as comfortable as possible. You can close your eyes, and we'll give you a blanket if you're cold. Before the scan, we’ll go over a questionnaire to make sure you don’t have any metal implants that could be affected by the magnets. If you’re feeling claustrophobic, we can talk to your doctor about giving you a mild sedative to help you relax during the scan. And if you start to feel anxious during the scan, just let the technologist know, and they’ll stop the scan immediately. We want you to be comfortable and safe. We will take things at your pace. Does that help ease some of your concerns?
PATIENT: That… that does help a little. Knowing someone is there, and that I can stop it if I need to. And the music… that sounds nice. I like old Italian songs, you know. My husband used to sing them to me. But… what if I can’t lie still? I have a bit of arthritis, and sometimes it hurts. Will that ruin the pictures? And… what are you looking for, exactly? What will the pictures show? I don’t want to know if something is really bad. Just… tell me if it's something that can be fixed.
DOCTOR: It’s lovely to hear about your husband. Music can be very soothing. And don’t worry about lying still. We understand that you have arthritis, and we’ll do our best to make you comfortable. We can provide pillows and blankets to support your joints. The technologist will give you clear instructions on how to position yourself, and we’ll work around your limitations. We can also do the scan in shorter segments if needed. It's okay if you move a little, as long as you can keep your head relatively still. As for what we’re looking for, we’re checking for any abnormalities in your brain. This includes looking for signs of stroke, tumors, bleeding, or inflammation. We’re also assessing the size of your brain and checking for any changes in brain structure. We’re looking to understand the cause of your memory problems and rule out any serious underlying conditions. If we do find something, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s something that can’t be fixed. Many conditions can be treated with medication, therapy, or lifestyle changes. Even if we can’t fix the problem completely, we can often manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. I want to be upfront with you – it’s too early to say definitively what we’ll find. But we’ll do everything we can to get a clear understanding of what’s going on and create a plan that’s right for you. And I promise to be honest with you every step of the way. We will discuss all your options and make sure you feel informed and empowered. Do you want me to go over the questionnaire with you now, just so you know what to expect?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be good. Knowing what to expect always helps. My daughter always says I worry too much. But I can't help it. It's just… a lot to take in. And I want to be a good patient. I want to help you help me. Go ahead with the questionnaire. I'm ready. I think.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Alayne. And you are a good patient! Asking questions and wanting to understand what’s going on is the best thing you can do. Okay, let’s go through this questionnaire. It’s mostly about your medical history and any metal implants you might have. First, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh yes, I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… I think I had my tonsils removed when I was a little girl. But that was so long ago, I barely remember it. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy when I was about thirty. My daughter always reminds me of all these things, you see. She has a very good memory. I don't think I’ve had any other surgeries. Nothing major, anyway. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Alayne. Gallbladder removal, tonsils removed, and a hysterectomy. Now, do you have any metal implants in your body?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, metal implants… I don’t think so. I never had any plates or screws put in. I never broke any bones, thankfully. But… wait a minute. My dentist, he put in a couple of fillings a few years back. Are those metal? And… oh dear. My bra… it has underwire. Is that metal? I don’t know if that counts. It’s all so confusing! My daughter says I worry about the silliest things. Is the underwire a problem? I certainly couldn’t go without my bra!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Alayne! It is confusing, and you're very thorough for thinking of those things. The fillings are metal, and that’s good to know. The underwire in your bra is generally not a concern for the MRI, as it's not the type of metal that would cause a problem. Now, have you ever had any allergic reactions to contrast dye or medications?
PATIENT: Oh, contrast dye… I don’t think so. I’ve never had any special tests that needed that, as far as I remember. I’ve had a few shots, you know, for the flu and things like that, but I never had any bad reactions. I get a little bit of a sore arm sometimes, but that’s all. And I’ve taken a few different pills over the years, for my arthritis and my blood pressure, but nothing ever bothered me. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. But my daughter always says I should be more careful. She says I should write everything down. I’m just not very good at remembering things, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know, Alayne. No known allergic reactions. One last question. Are you currently pregnant or breastfeeding?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, dear! I haven’t been pregnant in… well, a very long time! And I certainly haven’t been breastfeeding! My children are grown up and have grandchildren of their own now. No, I am definitely not pregnant or breastfeeding. Are those all the questions, dear? I hope I didn't miss anything. I get so flustered sometimes.
DOCTOR: No, those were all the questions, Alayne! You did perfectly fine. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to answer everything so thoughtfully. Okay, that completes the questionnaire. Now, I’m going to go over the MRI procedure with you in detail, so you know exactly what to expect. First, you’ll lie on a table that slides into the machine. The machine is a large, cylindrical tube, and it’s open on both ends. You’ll be given a blanket and a pillow to make you comfortable. We’ll also give you earplugs or headphones to block out the noise. The scan itself takes about 30 to 60 minutes, depending on what we need to look at. During the scan, you need to lie very still. It’s important to keep your head relatively still, as any movement can blur the images. The machine makes a series of banging and whirring noises. It can be quite loud, but the earplugs or headphones will help block out the sound. You can even listen to music during the scan if you’d like. A technologist will be in the control room the entire time, monitoring the scan. They can see and hear you, and you can communicate with them through a microphone. If you feel uncomfortable at any time, you can press a button to stop the scan. Do you have any questions about the procedure?
PATIENT: That… that sounds a little scary, to be enclosed in a tube like that. And lying still for so long… my arthritis, you know. Will it hurt? And… what if I get claustrophobic? I’ve never been in one of those machines before. And the noises… you said it will be loud? Will it bother my ears? I have a bit of tinnitus sometimes. And if I do get scared, and press the button… will that ruin the whole scan? I don't want to waste everyone's time. I feel so silly worrying about all this.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all to be worried, Alayne. It's perfectly natural to feel anxious about being in a confined space with loud noises. Let's address your concerns one by one. First, about the pain: the machine itself doesn't hurt. You won't feel any sensations during the scan. If you're uncomfortable because of your arthritis, let me know, and we'll do everything we can to make you comfortable. We can provide extra padding and support, and we can take breaks if needed. As for the claustrophobia: if you start to feel anxious during the scan, just let the technologist know, and they’ll stop the scan immediately. We can also open the machine a little bit to give you more space. If you’re really concerned, we can even give you a mild sedative to help you relax. About the noises: it will be loud, but we’ll give you earplugs or headphones to block out the sound. You can even listen to music during the scan if you’d like. And if you have tinnitus, we can adjust the volume to make sure it doesn’t bother your ears. And if you do press the button to stop the scan, it won’t ruin everything. We can always reschedule the scan for another day. Your comfort is our top priority. We want you to be relaxed and comfortable during the scan, so we can get the best possible images. We will be with you every step of the way, and we'll do everything we can to make you feel safe and comfortable. Does that help ease some of your concerns?
PATIENT: That… that does help, dear. Knowing you’ll be there, and that I can stop it if I need to. And the music… that sounds lovely. My husband used to sing old Italian songs to me. But… what about the images? What will they show? Will I see them? I’m afraid of what they might find. And… how long will it take to get the results? I hate waiting. I just want to know what’s going on, so I can get back to my normal life.
DOCTOR: It's lovely to hear about your husband. Music can be very soothing. As for the images, the radiologist will review them and send a report to me. You won't see the images directly, as they're very complex and require specialized training to interpret. I will explain the results to you in detail, and we'll discuss what they mean and what our next steps should be. As for what the images might show, it's too early to say definitively. But we're looking for any abnormalities in your brain, such as signs of stroke, tumors, or inflammation. The results typically take about 24 to 48 hours to come back. I know it's hard to wait, but it's important to give the radiologist enough time to review the images carefully. Once I have the results, I will call you immediately to schedule an appointment to discuss them. I know it's frustrating to wait, but I promise to keep you informed every step of the way. And I will be with you when we discuss the results, so we can make a plan together. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think that's everything. You've answered all my questions, and you've made me feel much better. I'm still a little nervous, but I know you'll take good care of me. Thank you, Dr. Yoshino. You're a very kind doctor. I think I'm ready to schedule the MRI now. When is the earliest appointment available?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alayne. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. And you're very kind to say so. Let me check the schedule for you. The earliest appointment we have available is next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 10:00 AM… yes, that should be fine. My daughter is coming over that afternoon, so I’ll have someone to drive me. Yes, Tuesday at 10:00 AM is perfect. Thank you, Dr. Yoshino. I think that’s everything. I’m ready to go home now. Thank you again for everything. You’ve been a great help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alayne. I’m glad we were able to get something scheduled. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before Tuesday. Let me walk you to the reception desk to schedule the MRI and confirm the appointment. And remember, we'll take good care of you. Have a good day, Alayne. And try not to worry too much. We'll get through this together.
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. You’re a very kind doctor. I feel much better now. Have a good day too, dear. And thank you again for everything. I think I'll go home now and have a nice cup of tea. That always makes me feel better. Bye bye, dear. And thank you again for everything.
