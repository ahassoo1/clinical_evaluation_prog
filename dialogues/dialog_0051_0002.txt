DOCTOR: Good morning, Zoie. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Glazewski. Why don't you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Stoffregen, yes… that’s me. Hmm… what brings me in… let me think. It’s… going to the bathroom. It’s a bit hard now, you see. Not… not easy like it used to be. It takes a while, and… well, it's just not right. My husband, he says I take too long in there!
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie. So, you're experiencing some difficulty with urination – it takes longer than usual and doesn't feel quite right. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More… hmm. Well, it feels like… like I don't get it all out, you know? And I have to… push a little. Not a lot, but… some. Sometimes I feel like I still need to go right after I just went. Does that make sense? It’s… frustrating. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. A while ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Zoie. So, you feel like you’re not emptying your bladder completely, and you sometimes feel the urge to go again shortly after urinating. You mentioned you have to push a little to get it out. Has this been a gradual change, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… gradual, I think. Yes, gradual. It wasn’t… bam, suddenly bad. Just… little by little, harder and harder. I don’t… I don’t really pay attention to things like that unless they bother me, you see. My husband, he notices everything! He’s the one who told me I should come see someone. He says I’m getting old!
DOCTOR: Husbands are good at that, aren't they?
PATIENT: Oh, he is! A good man, really. Always looking out for me. Though he does nag sometimes… but that’s just him. I mostly just want it to be easier, you know? It's just… uncomfortable. And I don’t want to have accidents. That would be… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Zoie. It sounds like this is causing you some discomfort and worry. We definitely want to figure out what’s going on and make things easier for you. Let's talk a little bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… medical conditions… Let me see. I have… I think the doctor said something about my blood pressure a while ago. Not too bad, he said. And my knees, they bother me when it rains! But that’s just old age, I think. Oh, and I take a little pill for… for my heart, I think. A small white one. I’ve been taking it for years. I don’t really remember the name of it. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Zoie, don't worry about it. We can look things up. It sounds like you have a history of high blood pressure and you’re taking medication for your heart. Let me just confirm… is it alright if I take a look at your medical records here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course! That’s fine. I don't remember all those names anyway! You do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. My husband always says I worry too much. He says doctors know best.
DOCTOR: Alright, Zoie. Thank you for letting me review your records. It helps me get a better picture of your overall health. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… surgeries… let me think. Years ago… years ago, I had my gallbladder out. That was… a long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, when I was young. But that was just a simple break. No big deal. Hospitalizations… not really. Just for the gallbladder, I think. And maybe when I had my babies, but that was… well, a long time ago! My memory is just… not good anymore, you see.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Zoie. So, gallbladder removal many years ago, and a broken wrist. No other significant hospitalizations that you recall. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. My husband always jokes that I have a cast iron stomach! I’ve never really had any reactions to anything. I take my pills without any trouble. I think I’d know if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You certainly would, Zoie. That's good to know. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh, goodness. My mother… she had… high blood pressure, I think. And my father, he had… something with his heart, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I don’t really remember. We didn’t talk about those things much back then. My brother… he was healthy as a horse, until… well, until he passed away. Not from anything with his heart, though. Just… old age, I think. It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Zoie. It's alright if you don't have a lot of details. So, some family history of high blood pressure, and possible heart issues. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. My husband, he used to smoke, years ago, but he gave it up when we got married. Said he didn’t want to smell like an ashtray when he kissed me! No, I don’t smoke. And I don’t drink much either. Just a little wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: And how much wine would you say, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, not much. Just a glass, maybe two, with dinner, a few times a week. If I’m feeling… fancy. My husband likes to call it “treating ourselves.” He’s a good man, really. But enough about me, what do you think about all this?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Zoie. And it doesn’t sound like an excessive amount. Alright. Now, let's talk about a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a quick neurological exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course! Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. My husband says I’m a good patient. I don’t usually complain.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will certainly let you know. It shouldn’t be too uncomfortable. Alright, let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are a little irregular, but nothing concerning at this time. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness. I'm noticing a little tenderness when I press here, on your lower abdomen. This could be related to your urinary symptoms. Now, I’ll just do a quick neurological exam. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Neurological exam is normal. Okay, Zoie. That concludes the physical exam. Overall, everything seems relatively normal, except for the slight irregularity in your heart rhythm and the mild tenderness in your lower abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tenderness… well, no wonder it’s hard to go! Is it… serious? My husband will be so worried if it’s serious. He’s a good man, really. Always fretting over me. What do you think I should do?
DOCTOR: It's unlikely to be serious, Zoie, but we need to investigate further. The tenderness in your lower abdomen, combined with your difficulty urinating, could indicate a urinary tract infection, or possibly some bladder irritation. The irregularity in your heart rhythm is something we should monitor as well. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order a urine analysis to check for infection, and an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests… well, I suppose that’s necessary, isn’t it? I trust your judgement, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. My husband always says I worry too much. An EKG… will it be uncomfortable? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: It’s not too bad, Zoie. For the EKG, we’ll just place a few small stickers on your chest and arms. No actual needles involved – it just measures the electrical activity of your heart. The urine analysis is a simple sample, you’ll just need to provide one in a cup. While we wait for the results, I’d also recommend increasing your fluid intake to help flush out your urinary system. And try to urinate when you feel the urge, don’t hold it in. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds alright. Stickers… I can handle stickers. And drink more water… yes, that makes sense. My husband always tells me I don't drink enough water. He’s a good man, really. Always looking out for me. So, stickers and water… and then we wait for the results? How long will that take, Doctor? I have a bingo game on Friday!
DOCTOR: That’s right. Stickers and water. The urine analysis results should be back within a couple of hours. The EKG results may take a little longer, possibly a day or two, as I need to review them carefully. We will call you as soon as we have the results. I’m hoping we can get this sorted out before your bingo game on Friday. If your symptoms worsen before then – if you experience fever, chills, back pain, or severe discomfort – please don’t hesitate to call us or go to the emergency room. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Fever… chills… I don’t want to end up in the emergency room! My husband would be so worried. He’s a good man, really. Always fretting over me. No fever, no chills, I’ll remember that. Stickers and water, and no emergency room. I think I can manage that. Is there anything else I should be doing, Doctor? Anything at all? I want to be a good patient.
DOCTOR: You are being a very good patient, Zoie. Honestly, you’ve been wonderful. At this point, just focus on increasing your fluid intake and listening to your body. If you have any questions or concerns at all – even if they seem small – please don’t hesitate to call. We’ll call you as soon as we have the results. In the meantime, I’ll have the nurse come in and give you a list of instructions and some information about urinary tract infections. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds lovely. A list of instructions… yes, that would be very helpful. My husband can read them to me. He has good eyes! And a nurse… that’s good. They’re always so kind. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little better already, just knowing what’s going on. Now, I think I’ll go have a glass of water. And maybe practice my bingo calls!
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s a great idea. And please do let us know if anything changes. It was a pleasure meeting you, Zoie. We’ll be in touch soon. Have a wonderful day, and good luck with your bingo game!
PATIENT: Oh, you too, Doctor! And thank you again. You're a good man. A very good man!
