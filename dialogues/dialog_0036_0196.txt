DOCTOR: Good morning, Janie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it’s this tiredness. Just…always tired. It’s been going on… a while now, I think. Honestly, the days all sort of blend together. I just feel… worn out. Is that enough to start with?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a good place to start. “Always tired” is definitely something we need to investigate. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: More… how? It’s just… like when you’ve had a really long day, and you just want to collapse? Except it’s… all the time. It doesn’t really get better with sleep, not like it used to. I mean, I sleep, but I don’t feel rested after. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Janie. Feeling tired despite getting sleep is a key thing to explore. And it's helpful that you can describe it as not feeling rested. Okay, let's try to pinpoint this a little more. When did you first start noticing this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… when did I start noticing? That’s… a tough one. It’s been… since my husband passed, I think. Or maybe a little before? Everything feels so fuzzy. It wasn't sudden, like one day I was fine and the next I wasn't. It just… crept up on me, slowly. It's been… a couple of years, maybe? I really can’t say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of years. And it started around the time of your husband’s passing, or slightly before. I’m very sorry for your loss, Janie. That must have been incredibly difficult. Grief can certainly manifest in many ways, including fatigue. Besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other changes since this started?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… hard. Still is, some days. Other changes… hmm. Let me think. I don’t have much energy for… well, anything really. I used to love gardening, but I just don't bother anymore. It’s too much effort. I get… achy sometimes, my joints. And… I’m a bit more forgetful than I used to be, if that makes sense. Though, honestly, who isn’t forgetful at my age?
DOCTOR: That's all helpful information, Janie. The loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, the aching, and the forgetfulness… these are all things we should look into further. I see here in your chart your height and weight. 187 centimeters and 108 kilograms. Have there been any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Oh, that's right. I'm a tall woman. No, not really. It's pretty much stayed the same. I don't eat much, to be honest, but I guess I don’t move around much either. It’s been like this for a while. I mostly just eat… whatever's easy. I don't really bother with cooking much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent weight. And a decreased appetite, with a preference for easy-to-prepare foods. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I have… high blood pressure, I think? The doctor put me on pills for it a few years back. And… my knees are bad, arthritis. That’s why I don’t walk much. Oh, and I was diagnosed with… something with my thyroid, a long time ago. I can't really remember what it was. It's managed with medication too, I think. I just take a lot of pills, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, arthritis in the knees, and a history of thyroid condition managed with medication. We’ll need to get a list of all those medications. Do you know what the name of the thyroid medication is?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness... that's a good question. I just… take a little white pill every morning. That’s all I know. I have a big pill organizer, you know? It has all my pills in it, all sorted out. I don’t really pay attention to the names, just that I have to take them. My daughter used to help me keep track of everything, but she moved away...
DOCTOR: Okay, we can definitely sort that out. We'll get a complete list of your medications today. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... allergies... not that I know of. I haven't had any reactions to anything, not in years. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. Nothing recent, nothing I can remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear… my family? That’s… complicated. My mother had… heart trouble, I think? She died when I was young. And my father… he had diabetes. That’s about all I really remember. It’s been a long time. My family wasn’t very good at talking about health problems, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart trouble and diabetes. That's helpful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh no, never. I never liked the smell of it. My husband smoked for a while, but I always made him go outside. It’s just… bad for you. I always told him that.
DOCTOR: Okay, never a smoker. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t drink much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. That’s about it. I don’t really care for it. It doesn’t… agree with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional social drinking. Now, before we do a brief physical exam, I’d like to ask about your current symptoms. Besides the tiredness, are you experiencing any other issues – like fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, or any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No fever or chills, no night sweats. Weight loss… I don’t think so. Maybe a little, but I haven’t really been keeping track. And pain… mostly just my knees, like I said. And sometimes, I get a headache. But nothing too bad. It's just… a general achiness, you know? All over. Like I haven’t slept well, even when I have.
DOCTOR: Okay, generalized aches, headaches, and ongoing knee pain. Alright, Janie, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, feel your abdomen, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, if you don't mind. I have… things to get back to. Not important things, but… things nonetheless.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'm listening to your heart now. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that can be due to several things. And your lungs sound clear. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, which is consistent with a history of thyroid condition. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Your knees show some swelling and crepitus, and the range of motion is limited, which is expected with arthritis. I also notice some tenderness on the inner side of both knees. Okay, I've completed the exam. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, I'm concerned about a few things. The fatigue, enlarged thyroid, and family history suggest we need to check your thyroid function. The arthritis in your knees explains the pain and limited mobility. We should also rule out other potential causes of fatigue, such as anemia or vitamin deficiencies. I’d like to order some blood work to start. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, blood work sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Honestly, I just want to feel… normal again. I’m tired of feeling tired all the time. So, yes, do the blood work. When will I get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, we will get the blood work done today. It usually takes about 3-5 business days to get the results back. The lab will send them directly to the clinic. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. I am ordering a complete blood count, a thyroid stimulating hormone level, a vitamin D level, and a basic metabolic panel. In the meantime, are you currently taking any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter… hmm. I take… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, when they're really bothering me. That's about it. No supplements, no vitamins. I just… take my pills, you know? The ones the doctor gave me. Honestly, I mostly just try to get through the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional ibuprofen for knee pain. We’ll make a note of that. Alright, Janie, I’ve ordered the blood work. You can go to the lab just down the hall. They should be expecting you. Once you’ve had the blood drawn, you can come back, and we’ll finalize the appointment for your follow-up. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s all. Just… get the blood work done, and hopefully find out what’s wrong. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janie. We'll do our best to figure things out. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here’s a lab requisition form, and the lab technician will walk you through everything. Get some rest, and we’ll talk soon. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. It's… good to finally be doing something about it.
