DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Stilaire. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been havin’ this headache, right at the back of my head. It’s been goin’ on for… oh, let me think… about a week now, I’d say. Not constant, mind you, comes and goes. Feels like a pressure, more than a pain, if you know what I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. A pressure at the back of the head, coming and going for about a week. That’s helpful. Could you describe when you typically notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It seems to be worse in the evenin', mostly. After I’ve been on my feet all day at the salon, you know? I do a lot of filin’ and polishin’, standin’ for hours. And sometimes, if I'm really concentratin' on a tricky nail, it’ll start up then too. But not always. It's just… unpredictable, really. My wife, bless her heart, she says I look a little strained when it’s comin’ on.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Popova. It sounds like it’s quite bothersome. So, it’s worse in the evening after being on your feet all day at the salon, and sometimes when concentrating. Do you notice anything that relieves the pressure – perhaps lying down, or taking a break?
PATIENT: Well, lyin’ down does help, yes. And a nice cup of chamomile tea my wife makes. She’s good at that, bless her. But it doesn’t make it go away completely, just takes the edge off. And… now that I think about it, a cold compress on the back of my neck sometimes helps too. Not every time, but often enough. I usually just try to ignore it, to be honest. I don’t like complainin’.
DOCTOR: I understand you don’t like to complain, Mr. Popova, but it’s important to address these things. It's good to know that lying down, chamomile tea, and a cold compress provide some relief. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No fever, no dizziness. My vision’s been alright, I reckon. No blurry spots or nothin’. I haven’t been feelin’ sick to my stomach, and I’ve been eatin’ regular. Oh! Now that I remember, I have been a little more tired lately, but I put that down to just gettin’ older, you know? I'm eighty-seven years young, after all. It’s hard to keep track of what’s normal and what’s not at my age, really.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Popova. It can be difficult to distinguish changes as we get older. No fever, dizziness, or changes in vision. Eating and appetite are normal, and you’ve noticed some increased fatigue. Now, have you had any recent changes in your medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, bless you for askin’. No medications, no. Never been much of a fan of pills, to be honest. And allergies… nothin’ serious. A little sniffle with the dust sometimes, but that’s about it. My wife does the shoppin’, she keeps track of all that. I just tell her what I need. Nothing to worry about on that front, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Popova. Now, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical history. Let me see… I had the flu pretty bad when I was a young man, livin’ in Jamaica. But that was a long time ago. And… oh, I broke my wrist a few years back, fallin’ in the garden. But it healed up alright, strong as new. Other than that… not much, really. I've always been a pretty healthy fella, if I do say so myself. I always kept active, workin' with my hands, you know? It keeps you goin’.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Flu as a young man, a broken wrist that healed well, and generally good health. Now, is there a family history of headaches, or any other neurological conditions – things like stroke or dementia – that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think… My mother, she used to complain of headaches often, yes. But I don’t remember it bein’ anything serious. Just a bit of a tension headache, she’d say. And… my uncle, on my wife’s side, he had a stroke, maybe ten years ago. But he was an old man, and he hadn’t been lookin’ after himself, if you know what I mean. Smokin’ and drinkin’, all the bad habits. Nobody else, not that I recall. We weren't a family that talked about illnesses much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Popova. That’s helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological assessment. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I trust your judgement. Go right ahead. I haven’t got nothin’ to hide, you know? Just try not to poke too hard!
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Mr. Popova. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148/86. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please sit up straight and follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Right you are, Doctor. Easy as pie. I used to be a pretty good dancer, you know. Good eyesight helps with that, I reckon. Though my knees aren't what they used to be. Go on, test away!
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Balance is slightly unsteady, but within normal limits for age. I observe some mild difficulty with rapid alternating movements. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your head and neck muscles to check for tenderness. I note some mild tenderness in the occipital muscles at the base of his skull. Based on what you've told me and the findings of the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing tension headaches, likely related to muscle strain in your neck and shoulders from prolonged standing and concentration at work. The slight unsteadiness and difficulty with rapid movements could be related to age, but we should rule out other possibilities. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We can also discuss some strategies for managing your headaches. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Well, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If you think it’s best to get some tests done, then go right ahead. I trust your judgement, you know? Tension headaches… that’s what you reckon it is? From standin’ all day? That makes sense, I suppose. I never thought of it that way. And yes, strategies for managin’ it would be good. I don’t want these headaches ruinin’ my work, or botherin’ my wife, bless her. Let’s do whatever needs to be done.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write the lab orders now. They can draw the blood right here in the clinic. It should only take a few minutes. While we wait for the results, let’s discuss some things you can do at home. I recommend regular breaks during your workday – even just a few minutes to stretch and walk around. Applying a warm compress to your neck and shoulders can help relax the muscles. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can also provide some relief, but please follow the dosage instructions on the label. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: That all sounds manageable, Doctor. Breaks, warm compress, over-the-counter pills… yes, I think I can do that. My wife is always tellin’ me to slow down, anyway! She’ll be pleased to hear I’m takin’ your advice. Hmm… let me think… Are there any particular stretches you recommend? Or is any kind of stretch alright? And what about pillows? I sleep on my back, is that alright? I always thought it was best for my spine, but maybe it’s makin’ my neck worse?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Popova. For stretches, gentle neck rotations – slowly turning your head from side to side – can be helpful. Also, shoulder rolls – lifting your shoulders up towards your ears and then rolling them back and down – can help release tension. Avoid any jerky movements or stretching that causes pain. Regarding pillows, sleeping on your back can be good for your spine, but it’s important to use a pillow that supports the natural curve of your neck. A contoured memory foam pillow can be particularly helpful. You want to avoid pillows that are too high or too flat. I can print out some diagrams of recommended stretches and pillow types for you to take home. And if the headaches don’t improve with these measures, or if they worsen, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We can discuss further treatment options, such as physical therapy or referral to a neurologist. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. Diagrams and pillow advice… yes, that’s exactly what I need. My wife will be pleased too, she’s always lookin’ after me. And it’s good to know I can call if things don’t improve. I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease, you know? Now, about those blood tests… are they ready yet? I'm not afraid of needles, but I'd rather get it over with, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. That’s what I’m here for. The lab technician is just finishing up processing your blood work. It should be only a few more minutes. I’ll let you know as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve covered everything brilliantly, you really have. I’ll just sit here quietly and wait for the results, then. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. It’s nice to know there are still doctors who take the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You’re very kind to say so, Mr. Popova. It’s a pleasure to meet patients like you. I’ll be right back with your results as soon as they’re available.
