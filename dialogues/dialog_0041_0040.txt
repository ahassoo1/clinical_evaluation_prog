DOCTOR: Hi Clearance, good to see you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side again, lower down on my back. And, truthfully, I’ve been getting a lot of water infections lately. It’s been happening quite a bit, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain in your lower back and frequent water infections. Hmm. Let's start with the back pain. When did it start, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a bit tricky to say exactly. It comes and goes, you see. But if I had to guess… maybe six months ago it started becoming more regular. Before that, it was just now and then.
DOCTOR: Six months of more regular pain… alright. And would you describe it as a sharp pain, a dull ache, or something else?
PATIENT: It’s more of a dull ache, I’d say. Not a stabbing sort of pain, thankfully. It just… sits there. Sometimes it's worse than others, of course. And it can travel around a little bit, down towards my… well, you know. Down there.
DOCTOR: Right, travels down towards your groin area. Okay. And does anything make it worse?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Drinking a lot of fluids makes it worse, strangely enough. And if I lift something heavy, it really flares up. Not that I do a lot of lifting these days, mind you. But even just carrying the groceries can be enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased fluid intake and lifting both worsen it. That is a little unusual with fluids, we’ll definitely need to explore that. And you mentioned frequent water infections… how often would you say you’re getting those?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. In the last three months, I’d say at least four times. Maybe five. It’s getting quite bothersome, to be honest. I have to keep going back to the pharmacy for… you know, the medicine.
DOCTOR: Right, four or five times in the last three months. Okay. Do you experience any other symptoms with these infections, like burning when you urinate, or a feeling of needing to go urgently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, you're spot on. The burning is quite unpleasant, and I do feel the urge to go very frequently. Even when there isn’t much to go, if you understand what I mean. It’s… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning with urination and frequent urgency, that certainly sounds like urinary tract infections. And just to clarify, are you experiencing any fever, chills, or pain in your upper back or sides?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no fever or chills. And the pain is really just in my lower back, like I said. Nothing up higher. Just that dull ache… and the constant need to visit the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your medical record here… Okay, I see a history of several UTIs treated with antibiotics. And your weight is listed as 116 pounds, height 153 cm… Hmm. Okay, well, let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your abdomen and check your back for tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. My kidneys… they've always been a bit of a worry, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, your abdomen sounds normal, no tenderness there. And your lower back is a little tender to the touch, on both sides, but nothing particularly alarming. No signs of a fever right now, which is good. Let's get a urine sample to confirm the infection and rule out anything more serious. Do you have a sample cup, or should I provide one?
PATIENT: I don’t have one with me, Doctor. If you could provide one, that would be much appreciated. It’s a bit embarrassing, I suppose, but what can one do?
DOCTOR: Don't worry about it at all, Clearance. It's perfectly normal. Here you go. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a little bit in the cup, and finish as usual. I'll leave you some privacy, and I’ll be right back when you’re done. Just let me know.
PATIENT: Right you are, Doctor. Mid-stream. I think I remember that from… well, from past experiences.
DOCTOR: Clearance?
PATIENT: Just a moment, Doctor! Here you are. I hope that was sufficient?
DOCTOR: Perfect, thank you very much. I'll send this to the lab right away. While we wait for the results, let's talk a little bit about your fluid intake. You mentioned that drinking fluids worsens the back pain. That's unusual. How much fluid are you typically drinking in a day?
PATIENT: Well, I try to drink at least eight glasses a day, like they say on the television. It’s usually water, sometimes a bit of juice with my meals. But honestly, Doctor, it feels like the more I drink, the worse that ache gets. It's a bit counterintuitive, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is counterintuitive, yes. And it’s good you’re paying attention to how your body feels. Eight glasses a day is generally recommended, but it sounds like it might be too much for you, given your back pain. We need to rule out anything serious with this infection, but I suspect there might be something else going on causing the back pain. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no swelling at all, Doctor. My ankles are quite slim, actually. And I haven't noticed anything different about my legs. I do wear socks most of the time, though. Perhaps that hides it? But no, generally, no swelling.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Okay. I'm going to check your kidney function with a blood test as well, just to be on the safe side. And I'll also order a complete blood count to look for any signs of infection. It’s just standard procedure with recurrent UTIs and your unusual reaction to fluids. While we wait for the results, I recommend cutting back on your fluid intake slightly – maybe try six glasses a day and see if that makes a difference with your back pain. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. I've never had a reaction to anything. And yes, six glasses sounds much more manageable. It's just… this pain is quite unsettling. It's always at the back of my mind.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good we’re trying to get to the bottom of it. Okay. I’m going to write a prescription for a course of antibiotics for the UTI, just to get that under control. We'll adjust it if the lab results show anything different. And I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to review the results and see how you’re feeling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. A prescription for the infection and a check-up next week. Thank you for listening to me. I do appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clearance. Here's the prescription for the antibiotics. Take it as directed, and finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better. And here’s the appointment card for next week. We'll get this figured out. In the meantime, if you develop a fever, chills, or severe pain, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough. I appreciate your kindness. I’ll be sure to follow your instructions and keep the appointment next week. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clearance. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day.
