DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a bit now. Don't feel good.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes. I see. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe a month? Hard to say exactly. Time goes fast when you're older, you know? It’s just… they itch and feel gritty. Especially when it’s windy. We get a lot of wind here.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can imagine. Rural living certainly has its… elements. A month, alright. And is it both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both of ‘em. Not bad all the time, but… mostly both. Sometimes the left one feels a little worse, maybe. Hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly both, with the left sometimes feeling a bit more irritated. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the dryness and itchiness?
PATIENT: Like what kind of symptoms? I just… they feel dry. And sometimes blurry. Not all the time blurry, just when they're really dry. Is that a symptom? I don't know all the fancy words.
DOCTOR: Blurriness with the dryness is definitely a symptom, Mr. Pipolo. Don’t worry about the “fancy words,” just tell me what you’re experiencing. Have you noticed any redness, discharge, or pain in your eyes?
PATIENT: No pain, no. And I don’t think they’re red. Haven’t noticed any… stuff coming out of ‘em either. Just dry and sometimes blurry. And itchy. I rub ‘em a lot, probably shouldn't, but… it feels good for a minute.
DOCTOR: I understand. Rubbing can provide temporary relief, but it can also worsen the irritation. Let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes or Sjogren’s syndrome?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never been told I have anything like that. Just… old. I work with cement, you know? Been doin' that my whole life. Lots of dust. Maybe that has somethin’ to do with it?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good point, Mr. Pipolo. Working with cement and being exposed to dust frequently could certainly contribute to dry eyes. Do you wear any protective eyewear when you’re working?
PATIENT: Sometimes. I have some goggles, but… they fog up. And they're uncomfortable. I usually just try to blink a lot. Old habit. It's hard to get used to new things when you've done somethin’ one way for so long.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No medications. Just… aspirin sometimes, for my knees. And no allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. Don’t take much.
DOCTOR: Okay, just aspirin as needed for your knees, and no known allergies. Let’s do a quick examination of your eyes. I’ll just take a look at them closely and check a few things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Whatever you need to do. Just get it over with, if you don't mind. I got things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. I’ll be as quick as possible. Alright. I’m seeing some mild dryness and a little bit of irritation in both eyes. Your corneas look clear, which is good. There doesn't appear to be any significant inflammation at this time. I also checked your tear production and it seems a bit lower than ideal. It's not alarming, but it explains the dryness.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean? Is it serious? I need to be able to see to work.
DOCTOR: It’s not serious in the sense that it’s not an emergency, Mr. Pipolo. It sounds like you have what we call dry eye disease, and it’s quite common, especially with exposure to dust and wind. It means your eyes aren’t producing enough tears to keep them adequately lubricated. We can manage this with a few different approaches. First, I recommend using over-the-counter artificial tears frequently throughout the day, even when your eyes don't feel dry. Think of them like lotion for your eyes. Do you have any trouble remembering to take medications?
PATIENT: No, I can remember. I just… don’t like puttin’ stuff in my eyes. Feels weird. But I guess I can try. What kind do I get? And how often? I don't want to be puttin' drops in all day.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can feel a bit strange at first. For the drops, I recommend preservative-free artificial tears. The preservatives in some drops can actually worsen the dryness. As for how often… start with every 2-4 hours when you’re awake. If that doesn’t provide enough relief, you can use them more frequently. We want to keep your eyes comfortable. I also suggest trying to shield your eyes from the wind and dust as much as possible. Perhaps a wraparound pair of glasses would be better than goggles, even if they aren't perfect. Do you have any other medical conditions or take any supplements besides the aspirin?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the aspirin when my knees bother me. And I try to drink enough water. Old people get dehydrated easy, you know. That's what my sister always says. I don't take no fancy supplements, just regular water. Is that all? Can I go now? I really need to get back.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Pipolo, that sounds good. Just the aspirin and water. Okay, so to summarize: we’re going to start with preservative-free artificial tears every 2-4 hours, and try to protect your eyes from the wind and dust. We can revisit this if the drops aren’t providing enough relief. I’m not seeing anything that requires a referral at this time, but if your symptoms worsen, or you experience any pain, redness, or vision changes, please come back immediately. I’ll write you a brief note outlining these instructions. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… try the drops. And try to remember to wear somethin’ on my eyes when it's windy. It's hard to get old, Doctor. Everything hurts. .
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Pipolo. It certainly has its challenges. I hope the drops provide some relief. Please don’t hesitate to come back if you need anything. Take care of yourself, and try not to overdo it. .
