DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um, it's my chest. It hurts. Not all the time, but... yeah, it hurts. It's like, a pain in here... <gestures vaguely to chest> It's not from falling or anything. Just... pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Chest pain is certainly something we need to investigate. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm... it's not a sharp pain. More like... dull, you know? Like a heavy feeling. Sometimes it feels like it's spreading, but not always. It's not really bad bad, but it's enough to notice. It's... uncomfortable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. And when you say “not all the time,” can you tell me what activities, if any, seem to bring the pain on or make it worse?
PATIENT: It's hard to say... I work on roofs, so I'm moving around a lot. Maybe when I lift heavy things it's worse? But honestly, sometimes it hurts when I'm just sitting. It doesn't seem to have a pattern, really. My wife says I seem more bothered by it at the end of the day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Um... maybe a month? A month and a half, something like that. At first it was just a little thing, I didn't even think much of it. But it hasn't gone away, and sometimes it's more than just a little thing now. That's why I thought I should come see you.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no cough. I haven't lost weight or anything. Just the pain. Maybe a little tired, but I work hard, so... I thought that was just from work. Nothing else, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've never really been sick, honestly. Just the usual colds and stuff when I was a kid. I don't take any medicine regularly. I'm usually pretty healthy.
DOCTOR: Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. Like I said, pretty healthy. My wife worries too much, if you ask me. <chuckles softly> But she made me come in about the pain, so... here I am.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family... my mom and dad, they're both okay. Older now, but doing alright. My mom had some trouble with her knees, but that's it. No one's had... heart problems, or anything serious like that. As far as I know. We don't really talk about health stuff much. It's not something we do.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. I don't drink much either. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, but not every night. And definitely no drugs. Never done any of that. I'm a simple man. Just work and family.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, I don't react to anything. I've never had a problem with that. <pauses> Is that... everything? Are we done with the questions? It's a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful, thank you. Yes, we're almost done with the initial questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. It'll only take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Go ahead. It's just... I hope it's nothing serious. My wife will really be worried if it is.
DOCTOR: Okay. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart sounds regular, I don't hear any murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. Right... here. <points to the left side of his chest, slightly below the nipple> Not a sharp pain, just... uncomfortable. Like the pain I was telling you about. Not everywhere, just right there. It's not terrible, but I can feel it. It's more noticeable when you push on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That's helpful to know. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, it’s difficult to say definitively what's causing the chest pain. It could be musculoskeletal – meaning related to the muscles, bones, or cartilage in your chest wall, which would explain the tenderness. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order an EKG - that’s an electrocardiogram - to check your heart’s electrical activity. And I'd also like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and heart. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Uh... an EKG and an X-ray? <frowns slightly> Is that... serious? I mean, is it something bad? I don't like the sound of those. But if you think it's necessary... yeah, okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. But please tell me if it's something I should be really worried about. My wife... she gets scared easily.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Bulaong. These tests are precautionary. We want to be thorough and rule out any serious underlying causes. An EKG is non-invasive – it involves placing stickers on your chest to record your heart's activity. The X-ray is also non-invasive – it uses a small amount of radiation to create an image of your chest. The risks are minimal. I don't want you to worry unnecessarily, but chest pain always requires investigation. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible, usually within a few hours. Once we have those results, we can discuss the best course of action. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Okay... a few hours, you said? That's good. Less scary if it's quick. Stickers and a picture... I guess that doesn't sound too bad. Does it... does it hurt? Either one? And... will I have to wait here a long time? I have to get back to work eventually. And my wife is expecting me. Not that she'll let me forget it, if I'm late. <chuckles nervously> I just... I don't like being at the doctor's. Makes me anxious.
DOCTOR: No, neither test should hurt. The stickers for the EKG might feel a little cold when applied, and the X-ray machine will be positioned near your chest for a short time. We will do our best to get you in and out as quickly as possible. The tests shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes total, and then we’ll wait for the results. I'll let the nurse know you need to get back to work, and we’ll try to expedite the process. We'll have a more definitive idea of what’s going on once we have the results. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Would you like me to call your wife and let her know we are running some tests, just to reassure her?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be good. She worries a lot. Tell her it's just tests, and I'm okay. Just... tell her I'm getting checked out, and I'll call her as soon as I know something. She's probably already wondering where I am, and if I'm okay. Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. I appreciate you calling her. What do I need to do now? About the tests? Do I need to change clothes or anything?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I'll call your wife now. Okay, I've spoken with your wife. She understands and is relieved to hear from me. For the tests, you don't need to change clothes. We'll just ask you to remove any metal objects – jewelry, belt buckles, anything like that – that might interfere with the X-ray. The nurse will be in shortly to take your vitals and prepare you for the EKG and X-ray. She'll explain the process in more detail. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Just... hurry up with the tests, if you can. And thank you again for calling my wife. She'll be much happier now. <takes a deep breath> I guess I'll just sit here and wait for the nurse. It's alright. I'm used to waiting. My job... it's a lot of waiting for the right weather. <fidgets with his hands> .
