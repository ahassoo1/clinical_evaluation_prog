DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what does bring me in… My wife, bless her heart, she said something about… paperwork? Something for when you… can’t work? Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. She filled out a lot of things online, and now she wants me to get something from you. It has to do with… time off, I think? Is that right? FMLA… does that ring a bell?
DOCTOR: Yes, FMLA – Family and Medical Leave. It sounds like your wife was proactively getting some paperwork started in case you need to take time off work for a medical reason. That's very thoughtful of her. So, to be clear, are you currently planning on taking time off, or is she just getting things prepared in advance?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds about right, she’s always thinking ahead. No, no, I'm not planning on it, not right now. I feel… alright, mostly. Just a little… tired, you know? Getting older. But she said something about needing a doctor’s note, just in case. Something about my job… Directors, Religious Activities and Education, that’s what I do. It’s… it's a long story. She just wants to have everything ready, if… if something comes up. Honestly, I’m a bit confused about the whole thing.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s very common to feel a little confused about these things. And it’s excellent that your wife is so organized and thinking ahead. So, to clarify, she’s requesting a note to support a potential future leave request, and she wants me to assess your current health status to determine if a leave might be medically necessary at some point. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds exactly right! A potential future leave… that’s it. She’s always saying I push myself too hard. And… truthfully, sometimes I do feel a bit run down. It’s not a major thing, just… a general tiredness. I still get to work, I still do my duties, but… it takes more effort than it used to. So a note… to have on hand… just in case. You know, for peace of mind.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like you’re very dedicated to your work, and it’s admirable that you continue to fulfill your duties despite feeling some fatigue. We can certainly document your current health status and address the fatigue to see if there’s anything we can do to help. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well… it’s hard to explain. It’s not like I’m collapsing or anything. It’s more… a constant drag. Like… when you’ve been working in the sun all day, but it doesn’t go away with a good night’s sleep. It affects everything, you know? Even things I enjoy. I used to love gardening, but now… it feels like a chore. And… sometimes I just feel… foggy. Hard to concentrate. It's been… going on for a while, I suppose. Months, at least. I really wish my memory was better… My wife keeps track of everything.
DOCTOR: That's a very helpful description, Mr. Limtiaco. A persistent drag and feeling foggy – those are good ways to put it. And it’s alright about the memory – we can work through things together. Months, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, months. At least. Maybe six months, maybe more? It’s all a bit… blurred. It’s not constant, you understand. Some days are better than others. But it’s always… there, in the background. And like I said, it’s getting harder to… push through it. Honestly, I just want to feel… normal again. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. My wife does so much already.
DOCTOR: I hear you, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds incredibly frustrating to have this persistent fatigue and feeling of not being quite yourself. And it's completely understandable that you don't want to be a burden. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… I’m 67, as you know. I’ve always been… fairly healthy, I think. I don’t smoke, hardly drink any alcohol. I used to be very active, played a lot of sports when I was younger. Now… not so much. I have a bit of trouble with my knees, arthritis, the doctor told me. And… my blood pressure is sometimes a little high, but they have me on medication for that. Other than that… I can’t really think of anything major. I see my primary care physician regularly. I really should remember his name…
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like you’ve taken good care of your health overall, and it’s helpful to know about the arthritis and high blood pressure. And don’t worry about remembering names – we can look those things up if we need to. Do you happen to know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s a little white pill… My wife manages the medications, so I don't really pay attention to the names. It starts with an 'A', I think? Or maybe a 'B'? I really wish I could be more help with this. She’ll be so much better at remembering all this. Honestly, I feel like I’m failing here, not being able to give you the information you need.
DOCTOR: You are not failing, Mr. Limtiaco. These things happen. It's perfectly alright that you don’t remember the exact name of the medication. We can access your medical records electronically to find that information. It's actually quite common for patients to not recall all the details of their medications. Do you mind if I take a moment to access your file on the computer?
PATIENT: No, no, not at all! Please do. That would be wonderful. Honestly, that would save my brain a lot of trouble. My wife always says I need to write things down, but… well, you know how it is. Getting older. Just don’t mind my rambling, Doctor. I tend to go off on tangents.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's see… Ronald Limtiaco, date of birth… yes, here we are. It looks like you do see Dr. Kalani as your primary care physician. And you are currently prescribed Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension. It also lists your arthritis diagnosis and some routine blood work results from six months ago. Those results show slightly elevated cholesterol, but everything else was within normal limits. Now, looking at your history, have you had any major surgeries, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… yes, that sounds right! Thank you, Doctor. You're a lifesaver. Let me think… Surgeries… I had my appendix taken out when I was a boy, a long, long time ago. And… I had a knee replacement about five years ago, on my right knee. As for allergies… not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication, as far as I can recall. My wife would definitely know if I did, she’s very careful about that sort of thing. Does that help? Am I being useful now?
DOCTOR: Yes, you are being very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco! This is excellent information. Appendectomy and right knee replacement, no known allergies. That’s all very good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. Well, I’m retired now, used to be a director of religious activities and education, as you know. I spend a lot of time with my wife, she’s a wonderful woman. I enjoy gardening when I have the energy. I try to stay active, but it’s hard sometimes with the knees. I don’t smoke, hardly drink. I eat… reasonably well, I suppose. My wife does most of the cooking, and she's very health-conscious. We go to church every Sunday. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very fulfilling life, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s good to hear you stay active and involved in things you enjoy. I’m just trying to get a sense of your overall habits and routines. Do you experience any stress in your life, and if so, how do you typically manage it?
PATIENT: Stress… hmm. Well, retirement is supposed to be relaxing, but it has its own challenges, you know? I miss the work sometimes, the sense of purpose. And I worry about my wife, she has some health issues of her own. And… well, just the general worries of getting older, I suppose. I try to manage it by spending time with her, going to church, and… just taking things one day at a time. Honestly, I don’t handle stress very well. I tend to just… internalize it. I'm not very good at talking about these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It's very common to feel stress about adjusting to retirement and worrying about loved ones. And it's alright if you're not comfortable talking about it in detail. Now, to wrap up the history part, I’d like to ask a few quick questions to get a better understanding of your current symptoms. When you say you’re tired, is it mostly physical fatigue, mental exhaustion, or both?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. I think… both, actually. It’s not just that I feel physically drained, it’s like… my brain is foggy, too. Like I said, hard to concentrate. It makes it difficult to even enjoy my hobbies. It’s not a sharp tiredness, more like… a dull ache all over. And it’s worse in the afternoons, usually. It makes it hard to even read, sometimes. And my wife says I’m more forgetful than usual, which… she’s probably right.
DOCTOR: Both physical and mental fatigue, worse in the afternoons, and some difficulty with concentration and memory… that’s very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I have trouble sleeping, I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep. And… occasionally I feel a little bit… down, I suppose. Not depressed, exactly, just… a general lack of enthusiasm. And my knees ache, of course, but that's nothing new. Oh! And sometimes I feel a little dizzy, especially when I stand up quickly. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely counts, Mr. Limtiaco. Trouble sleeping, occasional low mood, knee pain, and dizziness when standing up… thank you for sharing all of that. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? Whatever I need to do to get there, I'm willing to try.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/85, but that’s not unexpected given your history. Heart rate is 72, and your temperature is normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Next, I'd like to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Finally, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam to assess your balance and coordination. Balance is slightly diminished, but not significantly. Overall, the neurological exam is normal. Based on my initial exam, everything seems within normal limits, but your slightly diminished balance and the fatigue and dizziness warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Okay. Further investigation… What does that mean, Doctor? Do you think it’s something serious? I just don’t want to worry my wife unnecessarily. She gets stressed easily.
DOCTOR: It doesn't necessarily mean it's something serious, Mr. Limtiaco. It's simply that several of your symptoms – the fatigue, dizziness, and slightly diminished balance – could indicate a few different possibilities, and it's important to rule those out. We'll start with some blood work to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any underlying infection or anemia. I also recommend an EKG to check your heart rhythm. These are routine tests, and they'll help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. I'll explain everything in detail when we get the results, and we can discuss the best course of action. We're just being thorough, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… thorough. That’s good. Blood work and an EKG… yes, that sounds reasonable. I’ll do whatever you recommend, Doctor. When can I get those done? And… will the results take long? I have a doctor’s appointment with Dr. Kalani next month, maybe we can share the results with him?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I can order those tests for you right away. There’s a lab just down the street here at the clinic, and they usually have quick turnaround times – results should be available within 2-3 business days. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, schedule those for you before you leave. And yes, absolutely, sharing the results with Dr. Kalani is a great idea. He’s your primary care physician, and he needs to be kept informed of everything. I can easily send the results directly to his office. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, severe dizziness, or weakness – please don't hesitate to go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Are you experiencing any of those symptoms now?
PATIENT: No, no, nothing like that. Just the tiredness, the occasional dizziness, and… well, the forgetfulness. Nothing urgent. And thank you, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen and for being so thorough. I feel much better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this. And thank you for sending the results to Dr. Kalani, that’s very helpful. Is there anything else I need to do, or should I just wait for Sarah to schedule the tests?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. For now, just wait for Sarah to schedule the tests. She’ll also give you instructions on how to prepare for them. After the tests, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. Do you have any questions for me before I let Sarah in?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. And I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I trust your judgment and I’ll follow your instructions. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Well, I'm glad I could help, Mr. Limtiaco. I'll have Sarah come in now to schedule your tests. Sarah, could you please come in here for a moment?
