DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It's about my foot. It's just…awful. Been bothering me for weeks now, and it's not getting any better. A sore, really. A nasty one. And it won't heal. I've tried putting creams on it, you know, the ones they sell at the store, but nothing seems to work. It’s a diabetic thing, I suppose. They always say everything is a diabetic thing.
DOCTOR: Yes, foot problems can certainly be common with diabetes, you're right to mention that. It's good you've been trying to address it. When did you first notice the sore, Louine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it must be… about six weeks, maybe? Around the time of my grandson's birthday, I believe. Yes, six weeks. He turned twelve, a very boisterous boy, always running around. I remember because I was trying to keep up with him at the party, and I think that’s when I first felt it. A little ache, nothing serious, I thought. Now look at it. It's gotten quite… substantial.
DOCTOR: Okay, six weeks, around your grandson’s birthday. And it started as a little ache and has grown from there. Could you describe the sore to me?
PATIENT: Well, it's… red, of course. And rather deep, I’m afraid. Not just a surface scratch. And it weeps, Doctor. It weeps something awful. I have to keep it bandaged, or it makes a mess of everything. The bandage sticks to it terribly, too, even the special ones they sell for diabetics. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my heel. A very inconvenient place, I must say. It hurts when I walk, naturally. Though I don’t do much walking these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, red, deep, weeping, near the heel… and painful with walking. I’d like to take a look at it, if that’s alright with you. It’ll help me get a better understanding of what we’re dealing with. Would you mind if I examined your foot?
PATIENT: Oh, go right ahead, Doctor. Though I warn you, it’s not a pretty sight. I’ve tried not to look at it myself, if I can help it. Honestly, these old feet have seen better days. Just be gentle, please. I have sensitive skin, you know. And don’t be surprised if I flinch. It really does hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright, Louine. I see the area here. It is quite inflamed, and there is some drainage present, as you mentioned. The skin around it is also a little fragile. I'm also noting some redness extending outwards. It is tender to the touch, and there's a little bit of warmth. I’m going to check your pulses in your feet now. Could you tell me if you have any numbness or tingling in your feet or toes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the tingling. That’s been going on for ages, actually. Mostly in my toes, the little ones especially. Feels like pins and needles, you know? It comes and goes, but it’s always there, lurking in the background. And sometimes, even my ankles get numb. It's just… part of getting old, I suppose. Though the doctor keeps saying it’s the diabetes. Everything is the diabetes. Is it a bad one, Doctor? Is it infected? Don't tell me I'm going to lose my foot. I’ve heard stories… dreadful stories.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Louine, and it’s good you’re sharing your worries with me. It’s important to address these things. The tingling you’re experiencing is consistent with neuropathy, which, as you know, can be a complication of diabetes. And you’re right to be concerned about infection. The redness and drainage are concerning, and we need to determine the extent of it. I'm going to order a quick test to check for infection. It’s a simple swab of the wound. In the meantime, I'm going to check your blood sugar to see where that's at. And I'd like to get an x-ray of your foot just to make sure there's no underlying bone infection. We'll get all the information we need to figure out the best course of action. It's too early to say definitively what's going on, but we're going to take good care of you. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Well, alright, I suppose. Tests are never pleasant, but if it’ll tell you what’s going on… Do they hurt? The swabs, I mean. And the x-ray… I don’t like those machines. All that radiation. But if you think it’s necessary… I do wish my grandson was here. He's a sensible boy, and he always asks good questions. He'd probably know what to ask you. He's studying to be a doctor, you know. A very bright boy. Though a bit boisterous, as I said. But bright. Do those tests take long? I have a luncheon appointment later this afternoon. With the ladies from the church. We're discussing the flower arrangements for the bazaar. It’s very important.
DOCTOR: The swab is quick, Louine, just a gentle swipe inside the wound. It might feel a little bit of pressure, but it shouldn’t hurt. And the x-ray is very quick as well—you’ll just need to stand still for a moment while the machine takes a picture. The amount of radiation is minimal, and it's a valuable tool for seeing what's happening under the skin. We’ll try to be as quick as possible so you don't miss your luncheon. I’ll have the lab technician come in shortly to collect the swab. And then we’ll head over for the x-ray. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes total, I’d estimate. While we wait for the results, perhaps we could talk a little bit more about your overall health?
PATIENT: Thirty minutes… alright. As long as it doesn’t delay me too much. The bazaar is very important, you know. We raise a lot of money for the new church roof. And I promised to bring the lemon bars. Everyone loves my lemon bars. Overall health… hmm. Well, I’ve been feeling a bit tired lately, to be honest. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. But what old person isn't tired? And I’ve got a bit of arthritis in my hands, makes it difficult to do my knitting sometimes. But I manage. I’ve got a good appetite, I suppose. Though I have to be careful with the sugar, of course. Everything in moderation, that’s what my mother always said. Now, is there anything specific you want to know? I don’t think I’m very interesting. Mostly just old age and lemon bars.
DOCTOR: You are very interesting, Louine, and lemon bars sound wonderful! It’s good you have a good appetite. Fatigue, worsening eyesight, and arthritis are all common, and it’s helpful to know about them. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. Must be… thirty years now? And I had a hysterectomy, even longer ago. That was… unpleasant. And I have high blood pressure, the doctor says. I take pills for it. Little white pills, twice a day. And, of course, the diabetes. That was diagnosed about ten years ago, I believe. It runs in the family, you know. My uncle had it, and my cousin. And I have… oh, what was it? Something with my thyroid. They said it was underactive. I take a little brown pill for that, too. Every morning. I think that’s all. Though I’m probably forgetting something. I get so confused sometimes. Do you need the names of the pills? I have them written down somewhere. It’s just… a bit of a mess. Old ladies collect pills, you know. It’s a hobby.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been through quite a bit, Louine, and it’s perfectly normal to have a lot going on. And yes, pill lists can be a bit of a mess! No need to worry about having the names right now—we can get that information from the pharmacy later. Just knowing you’re on medication for high blood pressure, diabetes, and your thyroid is a good start. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or latex?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Let me see. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I can remember. Though I used to get hives when I was a little girl, from poison ivy, I think. But that was ages ago. And I don’t eat shellfish, not because I’m allergic, but because I don’t like it. It smells funny. And I’m a bit sensitive to the cold, gets my fingers all numb. But that’s just old age, I suppose. No, I don’t think I have any serious allergies. Unless you count a dislike of shellfish. That’s a very strong allergy, if you ask me. Is that important? Are you writing all this down? It feels like I’m being interrogated. Though, you are a very polite interrogator, I must say.
DOCTOR: No serious allergies—that’s good to know. And a dislike of shellfish is perfectly valid! It doesn't sound like you have any allergies that we need to be concerned about. You’re not being interrogated, Louine, just gathering information to help me provide the best possible care. Now, before we get the lab technician, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh dear. What does that even mean? Do you want to know about my friends? I used to have a lot of friends, but most of them have… passed away. Now I mostly just see my family. My grandson visits a lot, he’s a good boy. And my daughter comes by sometimes, when she has time. She’s very busy with her job. I used to be very active in the church, helped with the flower arrangements and the bake sales. But I don’t do much of that anymore. It’s too tiring. I mostly just stay home and watch television now. And read. I like to read mysteries. They keep my mind sharp. Do you want to know about my marital history? I was married for fifty years, to a very good man. He passed away ten years ago. We didn’t have any children, just each other. Is that what you want to know? It feels awfully personal, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: I apologize if that felt personal, Louine. "Social history" is just a way of understanding your lifestyle and support system. It helps me get a fuller picture of your overall health. You've already told me a lot about your social history – having a close relationship with your grandson and daughter is wonderful, and it's good you enjoy reading. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Smoke? Never! My husband smoked, for a while, but I made him stop. It’s a dreadful habit. And alcohol… well, I used to have a glass of sherry with dinner sometimes, when we were younger. But I haven’t had a drink in years. It doesn't agree with my stomach. And it's not a good habit, you know. Not at all. I prefer tea, with a little lemon. Keeps me regular, you see. And it's much healthier. Now, is that all? Can we get this over with? I'm starting to feel rather faint. All this questioning… it's exhausting. I need a lemon bar.
DOCTOR: Of course, Louine. No smoking or alcohol—that’s excellent. And a cup of tea sounds lovely. I apologize for the long questions, I promise we're almost finished. Before we call the lab tech, just one last question. Can you tell me about any falls you've had recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, actually. I had a little tumble last month. In the garden. Tripped over a rose bush, silly thing. Didn’t break anything, thank goodness, just a few bruises. My daughter was very worried, made me promise to be more careful. And I did fall last year, in the grocery store. Slipped on a wet floor. That was more serious, I had to go to the hospital. They checked me for a broken hip, but it was just a sprain. I’m a bit unsteady on my feet these days, you see. It’s the arthritis, I suppose. And the dizziness sometimes. It’s a bit frightening, actually. I don’t like falling. It's undignified, you know. Can we please stop now? I really need a lemon bar.
DOCTOR: Alright, Louine. Falls last month and last year—thank you for telling me. We'll definitely address that. Okay, I think that's all the information I need for now. I’m going to call the lab technician to come in and collect a quick swab of the wound. Then we’ll get an x-ray. After that, we’ll discuss the results and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And please, be gentle with the swab. My skin is very sensitive, you know. And try not to keep me waiting. I have that luncheon to get to. With the ladies from the church. We’re discussing the flower arrangements, you see. Very important. And I promised to bring the lemon bars. Now, where is that lab technician? I'm starting to feel a bit peckish. Perhaps a lemon bar would help.
DOCTOR: The lab technician should be here any moment now. And I promise, we'll try to be as quick as possible. You've been very patient. Perhaps after the luncheon, you can enjoy a lemon bar as a reward. Here they come now…
