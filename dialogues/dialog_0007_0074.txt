DOCTOR: Hi Venna, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. My blood pressure’s been acting up, that’s what brought me here. The lady at the pharmacy said I ought to get it checked by a real doctor. I don’t really understand all that pressure stuff, but it’s high, she said.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information, thank you. It’s always a good idea to get things checked out when you’re concerned. And you’re right to have it looked at. “Acting up” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I get these headaches, mostly in the back of my head. And sometimes I feel dizzy when I stand up too fast. It’s not every time, but enough to worry me. My husband… well, he passed a few years back, and he had trouble with his pressure. That’s why I’m fussing over it so much, I reckon.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s completely reasonable to be concerned, especially with your husband’s history. Headaches and dizziness can be related to blood pressure, but they can also be caused by other things. Let’s get a better picture of what’s going on. First, have you been measuring your blood pressure at home at all?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Like I said, I don't rightly understand all that equipment. The pharmacy lady just told me it was high when I went to pick up my arthritis medicine. I just figured I needed to get it checked proper. I'm not much for gadgets.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. We can definitely get a reading here in the office. And we'll talk about whether home monitoring might be helpful later. Aside from the headaches and dizziness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Not really. I get tired easier, maybe. Old age, mostly, I figure. I used to be able to bake all day and still have energy to work in the garden. Now, I need a nap after just a few pies. But other than that… nothin’ much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Getting tired more easily can be related to a lot of things, so it’s good you mentioned it. Now, let’s go over a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of, besides the arthritis?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis, really. And a touch of cataracts, the eye doctor said, but nothin’ they need to fix right away. I had the usual childhood things, measles and such, but nothin’ serious. Oh! And my gallbladder, they took that out a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, cataracts, and gallbladder removal. That’s helpful. Do you know roughly when you had your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... it must've been… forty years ago, give or take. Maybe even longer. It was before my husband got sick, definitely. It was a pretty quick thing, I don’t remember much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, forty years ago. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the arthritis medicine?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis pills. A little orange one, I think. And sometimes, if my arthritis is really bad, I'll take one of those pain pills the doctor gave me a while back. But I try not to, they make me feel funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, so an orange pill for arthritis and pain pills as needed. Do you happen to know the name of the orange pill?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, I don't. I just ask the pharmacist for 'the orange one for my arthritis' and he gives it to me. I don’t bother with names, too hard to remember. I just know it helps with the pain in my hands.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can look it up in our system, don’t worry. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve eaten just about everything there is. Never had a reaction to anything. My mama always said I had a cast iron stomach.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Okay, last few questions about your history before we do a quick physical exam. Have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. My mama wouldn’t allow it. Said it was a nasty habit and would ruin your lungs. I did spend a lot of time around my daddy when he smoked his pipe, but I never took it up myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, never smoked. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing much. A glass of red, usually. It helps with my arthritis, I think. Not every night, just when I’m feeling fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little wine occasionally. Good to know. Alright, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure. Then, I'll take a look in your ears and check your reflexes. Sound good?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Get it over with, if you please. I've got pies to bake, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll be quick. Okay, blood pressure is a bit elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but I do hear some slight crackling at the bases. Ears look clear. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for someone your age. Alright, everything sounds pretty good overall, but that blood pressure is definitely something we need to address. The slight crackling in your lungs could be from a number of things, and we’ll keep an eye on that.
PATIENT: Well, that didn't sound too awful. Is it bad, that pressure thing? I told you I didn't understand all that medical talk. And what was that about crackling? Like… in my bones?
DOCTOR: It's okay, we'll go through it slowly. The blood pressure being high means your heart is working harder than it should to pump blood around your body. It can strain your heart and blood vessels over time, and it's important to get it under control to prevent problems down the road. As for the crackling, it’s not in your bones! It’s in your lungs. It can happen when there’s a little fluid buildup, or sometimes just with aging. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but we’ll want to monitor it. Do you mind if I order a few simple blood tests and a chest X-ray just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on?
PATIENT: Tests and X-rays… goodness gracious. Seems like a lot of fuss over a little pressure. But… alright. If you think it’s best. But I tell you what, Doctor, I’m not good with waitin'. I need to know somethin' soon. Pies don’t bake themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. Waiting is never fun, especially when you have things to do. We’ll get those tests done as quickly as possible. The lab is right down the hall, and the X-ray technician is usually very efficient. It should only take about an hour or so to get the results back. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a low dose of a blood pressure medication. It’s a good starting point, and we can adjust it if needed once we have the test results back. We’ll also talk about some lifestyle changes that can help lower your blood pressure - things like reducing salt intake, getting regular exercise, and managing stress. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… less salt, exercise, stress… Oh, dear. I make pies, Doctor. Pies have salt. And I am stressed, waitin' on all these tests! But alright, I’ll try. I’ll try my best. As long as I can still bake. Write that down, Doctor - must be able to bake.
DOCTOR: “Must be able to bake” – absolutely. That’s a very important note. We will definitely work around your pie-making. Here's your prescription for Lisinopril, 5mg, to be taken once a day. And these pamphlets have some helpful information about managing blood pressure and reducing salt intake. We’ll get the lab results and X-ray back in about an hour, and then we can discuss them and make a plan. I’ll have my nurse come in and draw your blood now. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just get it over with, so I can get back to my kitchen. And thank you, Doctor. You seem… nice, for a doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. I’m glad I could help, and I appreciate your patience. My nurse, Sarah, will be right in. She’ll explain everything and get the blood draw done quickly. If anything comes up before we talk again, please don’t hesitate to let the staff know. And don’t worry about the pies. We’ll figure out a way to keep them coming.
