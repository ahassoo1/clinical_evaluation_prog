DOCTOR: Hi Sherrell, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It is… difficult to explain, really. Words… they do not come so easy now. It is frustrating, yes. I find myself… searching. For the right… things to say.
DOCTOR: I understand. No need to rush, Sherrell. Take your time. We all have trouble putting things into words sometimes. Is this something that's been happening for a while, this difficulty finding the right words?
PATIENT: Yes. A… some time. Months, I think. It comes and goes. Sometimes… it is worse than others. I… I do not remember exactly when it started. My wife… she would always know what I meant, even when I stumbled. It is… lonelier now.
DOCTOR: Okay, months of intermittent difficulty finding words. And it seems to be progressing, or at least feeling more noticeable recently. Is this difficulty with understanding words as well, or mostly with expressing yourself?
PATIENT: Hmm… expressing, I think. I… I can usually understand what people say to me. Though sometimes… if they speak quickly, or use… complicated words… it is harder. But mostly, it is I who cannot find the words. It is… like they are on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot grasp them.
DOCTOR: Alright, so primarily expressive aphasia – difficulty finding the words you want to say, with some occasional trouble understanding, especially with faster or more complex speech. Has anything specific happened around the time you think this started?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. My wife… she passed away, you see. About six months ago now. It was… sudden. A heart attack. I… I have been… adjusting. It has been a difficult time. Perhaps… perhaps it started around then. I do not know. Everything feels… blurred. I was very close with her, you understand. It is… hard to remember details.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry for your loss, Sherrell. That’s a tremendous shock and grief can certainly affect many things, including cognitive function. It's entirely possible this is related. To get a better picture, let's go through some other things. Do you have any history of stroke, head injury, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No stroke. No… head injury that I recall. I have always been… healthy, for the most part. A little arthritis in my knees, but that is all. My wife… she was the one who worried about health. She made sure I went to the doctor regularly. I… I do not know much about… neurological conditions. What are those?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Neurological conditions are issues with the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Things like Parkinson’s, Multiple Sclerosis, that sort of thing. We're just ruling things out. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just… a small pill for my blood pressure. The doctor prescribed it last year. And… sometimes, when my knees are bothering me, I take something for the pain. Ibuprofen, I think it is called. Not… regularly, though. Only when I need it. My wife… she kept track of all that, usually. I am not very good with remembering names and… things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a blood pressure medication and ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me see. No… I do not think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always asked before giving me anything new, just to be safe. She was very… careful. I… I suppose I could be allergic to something and not know it. It is possible, yes. It is… difficult to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll proceed as though you have no known allergies for now. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'd like to do a very brief neurological screening - some simple tests of your memory, language, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just… I want to understand what is happening. I want to… be able to speak again, like I used to. I… I miss being able to express myself. It is… very frustrating. Please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sherrell. We'll do everything we can to figure this out. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart and lungs sound good. Now, let's just do a few simple tests. I'm going to ask you to repeat three words after me, and then I'll ask you to recall them later. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am ready. Please, tell me the words. I will try my best. I… I hope I can remember them. My memory… it is not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: table, penny, orange. Repeat those for me, please.
PATIENT: Table… penny… orange. Yes. Those are the words. Table, penny, orange. I… I think I have them. Is that… correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Now, I'm going to ask you to count backwards from 100 by sevens. Don’t worry if it’s difficult, just do your best. It's a test of concentration.
PATIENT: One hundred… ninety-three… eighty-six… seventy-nine… seventy-two… sixty-five… sixty-… oh dear. Sixty-… I seem to be… losing my place. It is… difficult. My wife… she was always good at math. I… I apologize. I am not very good at this.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Sherrell. It is challenging. Don't worry about it at all. Now, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. Oh dear. I… I am not sure. Is it… August? I think it is August. But the day… I cannot remember the day. I… I apologize. My mind… it is very foggy. I know I was here yesterday, but… the date escapes me. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay. I’ve done a quick assessment. Your reflexes are good, and overall strength is okay, though there's a little bit of slowness and some slight difficulty with coordination on your left side. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, I’m concerned about possible early signs of cognitive impairment. The difficulty with word recall, the problems with counting backwards, and some mild coordination issues are all things we need to investigate further. Now, I want to be clear – this doesn't necessarily mean anything definitive, and there are many possible causes. We need some additional testing to get a clearer picture. I want to order a full blood panel to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or underlying medical conditions, and I'd like you to have a brain MRI to look for any structural abnormalities. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A… a brain MRI? Is that… serious? What could be wrong? I… I am very nervous, Doctor. I just want to be able to speak again. And now… you are talking about… things I do not understand. A full blood panel… an MRI… It all seems… very frightening. But… if it will help me… if it will help me find my words again… then yes. Yes, please. Do what you need to do. But… please explain everything to me. I… I need to understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Sherrell, and I'll explain everything as clearly as I can. A brain MRI is a very safe and effective way to get detailed pictures of your brain. It doesn't involve any radiation, and it's painless. It helps us rule out things like stroke, tumors, or other structural abnormalities that could be contributing to your symptoms. The full blood panel will check for things like vitamin deficiencies – B12 is particularly important for brain function – or any other underlying medical conditions that might be affecting your cognitive abilities. We're not looking for anything specific at this point, just trying to gather information. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and then we can discuss them and formulate a plan. I'm also going to refer you to a neurologist – a specialist in brain disorders – for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can do more detailed cognitive testing and help us determine the exact cause of your symptoms. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A neurologist… yes. That sounds… wise. If a specialist can help… then yes. Please, do that. A full blood panel, the MRI… and the neurologist. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… I want to be able to communicate again. I miss being able to… to express myself. And… I miss my wife. She would always know what I meant, even when I stumbled. Please, do everything you can to help me. I… I appreciate your kindness. When will I hear about the results? And… will the MRI be painful? I am very nervous about that.
DOCTOR: Of course, Sherrell. We’ll do everything we can. I'll write down the orders for the blood panel and the MRI, and the referral to the neurologist. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood work, and the imaging center will call you to schedule the MRI. It usually takes a few days to get the results back – I'd say within a week. As for the MRI, it's not painful at all. You’ll lie down on a table, and a large machine will make some loud noises – that's just the machine working. You'll need to lie very still for about 30-40 minutes. You may feel a little warm, and if you're claustrophobic, you can ask for a mild sedative to help you relax. They'll give you headphones so you can listen to music if you like. I’m also going to give you a handout with some resources for people experiencing cognitive changes, just in case you find it helpful. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all for now, Doctor. I… I need to process this information. It is a lot to take in. I… I will try not to worry. But it is… difficult. Thank you for your kindness. And… thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience. I… I suppose I should go now? And wait for the phone calls? Thank you again, Doctor Rosanova. You have been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. Take your time processing everything, and remember we're here if you need anything at all. Don't hesitate to call. And please, try to get some rest. It was a pleasure meeting you. And don’t worry – we'll figure this out together. Have a good day, Sherrell. And please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Good day to you as well. .
