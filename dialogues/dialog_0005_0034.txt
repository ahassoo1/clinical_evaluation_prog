DOCTOR: Alright, Emileigh, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's nice to meet you too. I just... moved here? And I think I need to, like, get checked out 'cause of the insurance. Medicare, yeah. I'm married. It's all new, so... I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, new to the area and getting settled with Medicare. That's perfectly alright, we'll figure it out. A check-up is a good start. Just to be clear, are you experiencing any specific health concerns right now, or is this primarily to establish care and satisfy the insurance requirements?
PATIENT: Uh... hmm. Not really anything right now that I can think of. I mean, I get tired sometimes, but... doesn't everyone? I think I just wanted to make sure everything was okay. And, like, the lady at the Medicare place said I needed to pick a doctor. So… that’s me, I guess. I don’t remember feeling bad, exactly. It's just… a check-up.
DOCTOR: Right. A general check-up to establish care. That’s fine. A lot of people do that when they move, especially with new insurance. “Tired sometimes” can mean a lot of things, though. Is it more like exhaustion, or just feeling a little sluggish at the end of the day?
PATIENT: Umm... kinda both? Like, I work… with machines. It's… a job. And sometimes at the end of the day, I just want to sit. A lot. It's hard to explain. I don’t think it's… sick tired, just… normal tired. My husband says I sleep okay, though. I think. It’s all a little fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, “normal tired” after working with machines. We'll keep that in mind. To get a better picture, let's run through a little bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… umm. I don’t think so? I mean, I went to the doctor when I was little, but… I don't remember what for. Maybe a cold? Nothing big. My mom… she used to take me. I don't really… remember much about it. I don’t think I have anything wrong, but… I'm bad with remembering things like that. Is it okay if my husband comes in? He's better at keeping track of stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. It's not uncommon to not recall details from childhood medical visits. And yes, absolutely, your husband is welcome to join us. Having someone else present can be helpful. We can go over things together. But let's start with this: have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I don’t think so? No, I’m pretty sure. I mean, maybe when I was a baby? But I definitely haven’t had any as an adult. I’d remember that, right? It hurts a lot, I think. No, I haven't had any surgeries. I'm pretty good at remembering things that hurt.
DOCTOR: Good. No surgeries. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh… um. My grandma… on my mom's side… she had something with her heart, I think? She was really old, though. And my uncle… he got sick a while ago, but… I don’t know what it was. I didn't really know him that well. Mom doesn't talk about it much. It's all kinda blurry. It's hard to remember… everything.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Vague family history. We'll note that. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. No, not really. I mean, sometimes I take something for a headache, but it's just… over-the-counter, I think? Like, from the store? Tylenol? Or something. But I don’t take it very often. And no vitamins… my husband gets those, sometimes, but I don't really remember taking any. It's all kinda… floating around.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Umm… allergies… I don’t think so? I mean, I get itchy sometimes, but I thought that was just… bugs? Or something. I don’t remember ever being really sick from anything I ate. Maybe a little upset stomach once or twice, but… nothing serious. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. I think. My husband says I can eat anything, though. He's better at remembering stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Yeah, that's fine. That sounds… good. I guess. As long as it doesn't take too long? I get a little… nervous, sometimes. And I don’t like things in my ears.
DOCTOR: Alright. It won't take long. Please sit back and relax. ...130 over 80. A little elevated, but not concerning at this point. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. ...Heart rate is regular, no murmurs detected. Now, let's check your lungs. Take a deep breath... and exhale slowly. ...Lungs are clear. Now, open your mouth, say "Ah". ...Throat looks normal. ...Ear canals appear clear, tympanic membranes are normal. Finally, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. ...Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. All normal so far. Your weight is 82 kilograms, and your height is 150 centimeters. That puts your BMI at 36.2. That’s in the obese range.
PATIENT: Obese? Oh. That doesn’t sound… good. I thought I was just… kinda normal. I mean, I don't eat that much. Is that bad? Should I… change something?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily "bad," it's just... a factor we need to consider. A BMI in that range does increase your risk for certain health problems – heart disease, diabetes, things like that. It doesn't mean you will develop those problems, but it's something we want to be aware of. And yes, lifestyle changes – diet and exercise – can make a significant difference. We can discuss that further. For now, I'd like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. That will give us a better picture of your overall health. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Blood work? Um… what does that mean? Will it hurt? And what about the… the lifestyle changes? What kind of changes? I’m not really good at… exercise. And my husband does most of the cooking. I don’t want to cause trouble. Is it expensive?
DOCTOR: The blood work is a simple procedure. A small sample of blood will be drawn from your arm. It may sting for a moment, but it's not usually painful. The results will help us assess your cholesterol levels, kidney function, blood sugar, and other important indicators. As for lifestyle changes, we're talking about making small, manageable adjustments to your diet and activity level. We can start with something simple, like walking for 30 minutes a few times a week and reducing your intake of sugary drinks. I can provide you with some resources and refer you to a nutritionist if you'd like. It doesn't have to be drastic. The cost of the blood work will depend on your insurance coverage. Medicare should cover a significant portion of it, but there may be a copay or deductible. The lab will be able to give you a more accurate estimate. Do you want me to go ahead and order the tests?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Walking… that sounds… doable. But I don’t know about the… the sugary drinks. I like juice with breakfast. And what if my husband doesn’t want to change anything? I don’t want to argue. And the… the copay? How much is that? Maybe… maybe I should just think about it? It’s a lot… everything is a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. It is a lot, I understand. We don't have to make any decisions right now. We can just start with the blood work. It's a basic assessment and will give us a better starting point. We can revisit the lifestyle changes later, if you're comfortable with that. I will write you a referral for blood work and you can schedule an appointment at the lab. If you're concerned about the copay, you can call the lab beforehand and ask for an estimate. I’m also going to print out some information on healthy eating and exercise. It’s just general information, nothing you need to follow immediately. If you have any questions after reviewing the material, feel free to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you. It’s just… a lot to remember. I hope the blood work isn’t too bad. And… maybe my husband will help. Is there anything else I need to do right now?
DOCTOR: No, that's all for today. Just schedule the blood work at your convenience. The results will be sent to me, and we can discuss them at your follow-up appointment. I'll have the receptionist schedule that for you before you leave. And don't worry too much about the results. We'll figure things out together. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. I will. You too.
