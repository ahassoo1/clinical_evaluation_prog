DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t quit. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, maybe a month now? More, even. It’s especially bad at night, keeps me up. And it feels… wet, if you know what I mean. Not a dry tickle, but something in my chest. It worries me, because of my heart, you see.
DOCTOR: A month or more, and worse at night… and you describe it as "wet". Alright. And you mentioned your heart – do you have a diagnosed heart condition, Ms. Sadhu?
PATIENT: Oh yes, dear. Congestive heart failure. The doctor – Dr. Ramirez, lovely man, retired now – told me about it years ago. I take my pills, every day, just like he said. Water pills, and one for the heart itself. I can’t remember the names, I’m afraid. But I take them! And I try to watch my salt, though it’s hard with all the good food around. It’s just… this cough feels different than usual, even for my heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of congestive heart failure, managed with diuretics and another heart medication – you don't recall the specific names, that's alright. And you feel this cough is different than what you've experienced with your heart condition previously. I understand. Let's get a bit more detail. When you say “wet,” is there any color to the mucus you’re coughing up?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. It’s… usually whitish. Sometimes a little bit of yellow, but mostly white. Not much, really, but it’s there. And it doesn’t always have color, sometimes it’s clear. But it’s the feeling, you see? Like something’s rattling around in my chest. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Sadhu. A rattling sensation… whitish, sometimes yellow mucus. Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the cough?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me see. I get a little more short of breath than usual, especially when I walk. Not a lot, but enough to have to stop and catch my breath. And my ankles… they swell up some, at the end of the day. I put my feet up, and it helps, but they get puffy. And I’ve been feeling a bit tired, more than usual. Just… worn out, you know? I sleep alright, but I don’t feel rested when I wake up. Does that help? It’s hard to say what’s just old age, and what’s something new.
DOCTOR: Short of breath with exertion, ankle swelling, and fatigue… Yes, that is helpful. We need to consider a few things. Have you had a fever at all recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever. I check myself pretty regularly, you know, with all my troubles. No fever, no chills. Just this cough, and feeling a bit worn down. And the swelling. Oh! And sometimes I feel a little bit dizzy when I stand up too fast. But that’s happened on and off for years, so I don’t know if that’s new or not. It's hard to keep track, Doctor. Really hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever. Intermittent dizziness... I understand it's difficult to keep track of changes over time. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, check your ankles for swelling, and take your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that sounds perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I’ve had a lot of doctors listen to my heart over the years, so I’m used to it. Just try not to be too cold with that stethoscope! It always makes me shiver.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your lungs have some crackles bilaterally, especially at the bases. Your heart rate is a little elevated at 92, and I do hear a gallop rhythm – which isn’t new, but is more pronounced today. Your blood pressure is 130/80. And, as you mentioned, you have 2+ pitting edema in both ankles. Your oxygen saturation is 93% on room air. Based on what you’ve told me and what I've heard, it sounds like your congestive heart failure may be exacerbating. However, the crackles in your lungs and the change in your cough warrant further investigation. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a BNP blood test. The X-ray will help rule out pneumonia, and the BNP will give us a better picture of how your heart is functioning. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. X-ray and a blood test? Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, alright. Do whatever you need to do. I just want to feel better. Pneumonia… that doesn’t sound good. Is it bad? And what is a “BNP” test? I don’t think Dr. Ramirez ever mentioned that one. But if you say it’s important, I trust you. I've just always worried about my heart… it’s been a trouble for so long.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re letting me know your concerns, Ms. Sadhu. The X-ray and BNP test are simply to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Pneumonia can be serious, especially at your age, but we’re going to rule it out. A BNP test measures a hormone released by your heart when it's under stress. It helps us assess the severity of your heart failure. While we wait for the results – which should be back within a couple of hours – I want to start you on a short course of diuretics – a water pill – to help remove some of the fluid buildup. I'll also prescribe a mild bronchodilator – an inhaler – to help open up your airways, just in case there's some underlying bronchitis contributing to the cough. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Diuretics… yes, I’ve taken those before. Water pills, you said? And an inhaler… alright. If it will help my breathing, then yes, please. As long as they don’t interfere with my heart medicine, that is. I worry about mixing pills, you know. Dr. Ramirez always said to be careful. Will they make me feel better right away? I'm just so tired of coughing, dear. It’s wearing me out.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sadhu, you’ve taken diuretics before, so that’s good. I'll double-check to ensure there are no interactions with your current medications – Dr. Ramirez was very wise to caution you about that. And I assure you, I will be extremely careful. The diuretics should help reduce the fluid buildup and make it easier to breathe, though it might take a day or two to fully kick in. The inhaler will provide some immediate relief from any airway constriction. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to reassess your condition and review the results of your tests. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a lot to remember. A week… alright. Shortness of breath, chest pain, fever… I’ll try to remember. My daughter, Elena, she's very good at keeping track of things, I'm sure she'll remind me. Um… yes, I do have one question. Will the water pill make me have to go to the bathroom a lot? Because that’s always… inconvenient, you know. And I don’t want to fall, getting up in the night. I've been a little unsteady on my feet lately. It's just… a worry of mine. And…thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better knowing what’s going on, even if it’s not good news.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sadhu. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about the side effects of the water pill. Yes, it will likely increase your urination, especially initially. To minimize the risk of falls, I recommend taking the pill in the morning, before lunch, so the increased urination doesn't interfere with your sleep. And, please, keep a light on at night and call for assistance if you feel unsteady getting up. We’ll start with a low dose and adjust it as needed, so hopefully the side effects won't be too bothersome. Elena sounds wonderful – it’s good you have someone to help you. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Taking it in the morning… that sounds sensible. Elena will be glad to help me with that. And I’ll keep a light on, like you said. You’ve been very kind, Doctor Deschane. Very thorough. I suppose I should go get those tests done, then? The X-ray and the blood work? And then come back in a week? Thank you again. You’ve put my mind a little bit at ease. Even if it’s just a little.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct, Ms. Sadhu. Please head to radiology for the X-ray and then the lab for the blood work. The staff there will guide you. Once those are complete, you can come back and see me in a week – we'll schedule a specific time now. Here’s a paper with the orders for the tests and your follow-up appointment time. If anything changes before your appointment – any worsening symptoms or new concerns – please don't hesitate to call the office, or go to the emergency room if you feel it’s necessary. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Sadhu. I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: .
