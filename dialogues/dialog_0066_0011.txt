DOCTOR: Hi Armando, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, Doctor… Condray, is it? I have a… a thing I want cleared. A procedure. Don't have time to be sittin' here all day explainin' it, frankly. Just need a paper signed, if possible. Something about bein' able to have it done. You understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're hoping for a quick sign-off for a procedure. I want to make sure I do everything right though, and that means I need to understand what procedure we're talking about, and why you need it. It's important for me to know your medical history and make sure it’s safe for you. Could you tell me a little bit about what's going on, even if you’d prefer to keep it brief?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I ain't got a whole lot of history to tell. I fix towers. Radio stuff, cell towers… been doin' it a long time. Healthy as a horse, mostly. Always been. This… this is somethin' personal. Cosmetic. I just want to know if I'm allowed to do it. Don’t need a whole examination. Honestly, it’s… it's for my appearance. That’s it. Is that sufficient? I don't recall specifics, if you need 'em. It was a while back I was lookin' into it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear you. You're generally healthy, work in tower maintenance, and this is a cosmetic procedure you've been looking into. It's good you're thinking about your health even with something elective. Just to be thorough – and I do need to document this – do you recall what kind of cosmetic procedure you're considering?
PATIENT: Honestly? No, not really. It was… somethin' with my face. I was lookin' at pamphlets, advertisements… a clinic downtown sent 'em. Somethin' about liftin'… or tightenin'. I don't know! It was a long time ago, and I don't pay attention to details. I just want to be told if I'm able to do it. Is that so difficult? I can tell you it ain't nothin' major. Not like heart surgery or somethin'.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not difficult, Armando. It just makes it hard for me to assess safety without knowing what the procedure is. We need to know what's involved. Let me ask a different way. Do you happen to remember the name of the clinic downtown that sent you the pamphlets?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. Names… I never was good with names. Small clinic. Fancy lookin', I suppose. Lots of… bright lights. That's all I remember. Look, are you going to ask me about my whole life story, or are you going to tell me if I can have this thing done? I have work tomorrow. This is important. Don’t you have other patients?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Armando, and I apologize if I'm taking too much time. It's just that signing off on any procedure without knowing what it is would be irresponsible. I need to make sure it won't cause you harm. Let’s try this. Have you had any medical procedures done at all in the past, even something minor like a skin tag removal?
PATIENT: Skin tags? No. Never had no skin tags. Listen, I’m a practical man. I fix things. I don't need things fixed on me. I might have had a tooth pulled when I was a boy, a long time ago. But that’s it. Nothing fancy. This cosmetic thing… it's new territory. I just want a quick opinion. And frankly, I don’t appreciate bein’ interrogated. I'm perfectly healthy!
DOCTOR: Okay, so no prior procedures, and you feel generally healthy. I appreciate you telling me that. Just to cover all bases – and I need to ask this for documentation – do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Never had a problem. Dust makes me sneeze sometimes, but that’s it. Look, Doctor, this is gettin’ ridiculous. I work with metal, climb towers, I’m exposed to all sorts of things. I’d know if I had an allergy. Are you tryin’ to waste my time? I'm tellin' ya, I’m a sturdy fella. Built tough. No allergies. Can we please move this along? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, just a couple more quick questions, and then we can see what our next steps might be. Do you currently take any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t believe in all that medicine stuff unless I’m really sick. And I haven't been really sick in decades. I eat right, work hard, and that’s good enough for me. Vitamins are for weak people. I take… nothing. Zero. Can we finally be done? This is… this is absurd.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, one last thing – and I promise this is almost finished. Do you have any family history of any serious medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family? Look, my mother… she lived to be old. Pretty healthy, I think. My father… worked in a factory. Died when I was young. Can’t remember what he died of. And I don’t keep up with the rest of the family. No. No history that I know of. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very private person. And this line of questioning is… unnecessary. Are you going to sign the paper or not? I’m losin’ daylight.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known family history. Alright, Armando. Given your overall health as you describe it, and with no known allergies or medications, and no significant family history, it sounds like you’re generally a healthy individual. However, I still can’t sign off on a procedure without knowing what that procedure is. It’s my responsibility to ensure your safety. Even a seemingly minor cosmetic procedure can have risks. I understand you’re private, and you don’t remember specifics. But I need something. Do you have any of those pamphlets you mentioned?
PATIENT: No! I threw those away months ago. Look, I came here for a simple clearance, not a life story investigation. I can see this isn't going anywhere. I'll find another doctor. One who respects my time and doesn't pry into my personal affairs. Thank you for nothing.
