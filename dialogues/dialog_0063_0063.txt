DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me why you've come to see me today. I have a rather full schedule, so if you could be concise, that would be appreciated.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Okay, yes, concise. My back… it really hurts. Bad. It started, hmm… maybe three weeks ago? It’s gotten worse every day since then. It’s not like a pull or something. It's deep pain. And… you know, I have the cancer. So I worry it's that.
DOCTOR: Cancer, you say. Right. And this back pain… you’ve had it for three weeks, progressively worsening. Deep pain. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yes. It's... hard to say exactly. It's not just one spot. It feels like it's all across my lower back. And it goes around a little to my side, both sides. Like… a big ache. And when I try to stand up straight, or bend over, that’s when it really hurts. Like something is stuck. Does that make sense? I don't know all the words for it, sorry.
DOCTOR: It’s…adequate. And does anything relieve the pain, Ms. Meigs?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. When I lie flat, it’s a little better. But not much. And… warm baths help for maybe twenty minutes, then it comes back. I've been taking the pain pills the other doctor gave me, but they don’t seem to be working as good now. I have to take more and more to get the same relief. That's why I came. It's getting scary.
DOCTOR: You’re taking pain medication, and it’s becoming less effective. And you mentioned another doctor… what was prescribed, and for how long have you been taking it?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Doctor Ramirez. He gave me… oxycodone, I think it was called. The little blue pills. I started taking them about six months ago, after the first… treatment. At first, it helped a lot. But like I said, now I need more each time. Maybe four pills at a time now, and it doesn’t last as long. I’m scared to take too many, but the pain… it keeps me awake at night.
DOCTOR: Oxycodone… six months. Alright. And you said this pain started three weeks ago, but you’ve been experiencing pain longer than that, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. The sharp pain is new, three weeks. But… I always have some ache, you know? From the cancer. It’s just usually manageable. But this is different. This feels… worse. Like something is really wrong. It's not just the usual tired ache. Does that make sense? I worry it's spread.
DOCTOR: Ms. Meigs, with all due respect, “worrying” is not a clinical diagnosis. We need to be factual. You have a history of… malignancy. And you are reporting new onset of worsening back pain despite escalating analgesia. I need to perform a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, yes. That’s fair. I just… I get scared. I’m sorry. Examination table, right. I will lie down. Is… is there anything special I need to do? Or just… lie still?
DOCTOR: Just lie flat, Ms. Meigs. I will need to palpate your spine and assess your range of motion. Try to relax. And please, inform me immediately if anything causes significant discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay. Relax… I will try. It already hurts a little just lying down, but I’ll tell you if it gets worse. Do I need to move any arms or legs?
DOCTOR: I'm assessing for tenderness and muscle spasm. Bend forward slowly, Ms. Meigs. And tell me if you feel any sharp pain. Limited range of motion noted. Tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine, L4-L5. No radicular symptoms noted at this time. Muscle spasm present bilaterally.
PATIENT: Okay… bending… Oh, that hurts. Right there, in the lower back. It's a sharp pain when I bend, like something is catching. And… it stays hurting for a few seconds after I stop. And… yes, it feels tight. Like a knot. It doesn’t feel like it used to. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Sharp pain with forward flexion at L4-L5. Pain persists briefly after movement. Muscle spasm palpable. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, within normal limits. Sensation intact to light touch. No weakness noted. Alright. Given your history and these findings, I suspect musculoskeletal etiology, possibly a lumbar strain or facet joint dysfunction. However, given your underlying malignancy, we need to rule out other causes. I'm ordering an MRI of the lumbar spine to evaluate for potential metastasis or other structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: MRI… okay. That sounds… serious. Metastasis… that means the cancer has spread? Is that what you’re thinking? I’m just… scared. What if it's bad? Will it hurt? I just want to know what's happening. And what can we do about it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Meigs, as I stated, we are ruling out metastasis. An MRI will provide us with definitive imaging. It is a standard diagnostic procedure, not a confirmation of anything at this point. It will not necessarily "hurt," though you may experience some discomfort lying still for an extended period. As for "what we can do," that depends entirely on the results of the imaging. Until we have those results, I cannot provide a specific treatment plan. I'm also prescribing a stronger muscle relaxant and a course of physical therapy. In the meantime, continue taking your current pain medication as directed, but be mindful of the dosage. I will schedule the MRI for tomorrow morning. You will receive a call to confirm the appointment time. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… I don't think so. No, I don't think I've ever had an allergic reaction to anything. But… what if the MRI shows something bad? Like… a lot of cancer? Will they tell me right away? And what about the physical therapy? What will that do? I just… I feel so lost.
DOCTOR: Ms. Meigs, I understand your anxiety, but I cannot speculate on hypothetical findings. The radiologist will review the images and provide a detailed report, which I will discuss with you at your follow-up appointment. Regarding the physical therapy, it will help to strengthen your core muscles, improve your posture, and reduce pain and inflammation. It is a conservative approach to managing musculoskeletal issues. I have to see other patients now. The MRI order will be sent to the imaging center, and they will contact you to schedule the appointment. My nurse will provide you with instructions regarding the medication and physical therapy. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… no. I… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… wait for the call. Thank you. .
