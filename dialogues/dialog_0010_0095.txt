DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Honestly, I don’t have all day. I woke up yesterday and… well, I can’t hear out of one ear. And my face… it feels droopy on that side too. It's quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Loss of hearing and facial drooping, starting yesterday. That is concerning, and you’re right to get it checked out quickly. Just to clarify, which ear is affected, and can you describe the drooping?
PATIENT: The left one. And… look, it’s just… the whole side of my face feels weak. Like when you try to smile, and it only goes up on one side? It’s like that, but it's… constant. It's not a nice look, I assure you. I haven’t exactly been out showing it off.
DOCTOR: Okay, left ear hearing loss and facial weakness – unilateral facial droop. And it’s been constant since yesterday morning. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No. That’s it. No dizziness, no headache, no… anything else. I just want to know what’s wrong and what you’re going to do about it. I have things to attend to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given the sudden onset of hearing loss and facial weakness, we need to rule out a few possibilities, the most important of which is Bell’s palsy, but we also need to consider other, more serious causes. I’m going to need to do a quick neurological exam, and I’ll take a look in your ears. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look in my ears? Fine. Just be quick about it. I really don’t understand why you need to look at my ears when I'm telling you I can’t hear out of one. Is this standard procedure? Because frankly, it seems rather… pointless.
DOCTOR: It is standard, Stephane. We need to rule out other causes of hearing loss, such as an infection or blockage, before settling on a diagnosis. Even with facial weakness pointing towards Bell’s palsy, a thorough exam is essential. It will only take a moment. I’m looking for any signs of inflammation, fluid, or obstructions… Hmm. The ear canal appears clear. Now, I’m going to ask you to open and close your eyes, raise your eyebrows, and smile for me.
PATIENT: There. Happy? It’s quite obvious, isn’t it? The whole side is just… limp. Don’t you need some sort of machine to test my hearing? This feels… insufficient.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is quite obvious, Stephane, and your assessment is correct. There's significant weakness on the left side of your face. You’re right to ask about hearing testing, and we will definitely do that. However, given the timing of the symptoms and the exam findings, I’m strongly considering Bell’s palsy. To be certain, I'd like to quickly check your reflexes and some sensation on your face. It will give us a more complete picture.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. I have a luncheon appointment. And honestly, this is all rather… undignified. A perfectly respectable woman, having her face poked and prodded… It's hardly a pleasant experience. I suppose you have some sort of explanation for why this happened? Is it… contagious?
DOCTOR: Okay, everything else checks out neurologically, which further supports a diagnosis of Bell’s palsy. It's a condition where the nerve that controls the muscles on one side of your face becomes inflamed, causing weakness or paralysis. The cause is often unknown, but it's not contagious. It’s thought to be possibly triggered by a viral infection, but we rarely identify the specific virus. Now, I do want to get some baseline hearing tests done to document the extent of the hearing loss. After that, we can discuss treatment options – typically a course of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and supportive care. Would you be able to stay for those tests now, or would you prefer to schedule them for another day?
PATIENT: Corticosteroids? Are there… side effects? I don’t particularly enjoy taking medication, even if it's just to reduce “inflammation.” And frankly, if it's just a nerve… couldn’t it just… get better on its own? I’m not inclined to spend a fortune on tests and drugs if it’s likely to resolve itself. I suppose I can stay for the tests, but I want to know exactly how long this will take, and how much it’s going to cost. Don't waste my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and you're right to ask about side effects and the likelihood of recovery. Corticosteroids can have side effects, though they're usually mild in the short term – things like increased appetite or temporary changes in mood. However, they significantly improve the chances of a full recovery. Bell’s palsy can resolve on its own in some cases, but about 30-40% of patients experience some degree of permanent weakness without treatment. The hearing test will take about 20-30 minutes, and it costs $150. If we confirm the hearing loss, we can discuss the risks and benefits of corticosteroids in more detail. We don't have to proceed with treatment if you're not comfortable with it, but I want you to have all the information to make an informed decision. Do you want to proceed with the hearing test now?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Twenty minutes, you say? And $150? I expect a detailed explanation of the results, and no attempt to pressure me into unnecessary medication. I have other commitments, you understand. This is… deeply inconvenient. Let’s just hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the technician come get you shortly. Please let me know if you have any questions while you’re waiting. .
