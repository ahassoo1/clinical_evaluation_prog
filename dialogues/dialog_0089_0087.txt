DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Croonquist, yes, that’s me. Look, I just need some lab work done, if we could get right to it? Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be, and I’d rather not spend all day talking about things I can’t rightly recall. Just… the usual check-up stuff, I suppose? If that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Croonquist. We can definitely focus on getting those labs ordered. But even a quick overview can help me make sure we’re ordering the right tests, and I want to be thorough. Just a few basic questions, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Quick though, please. I've got… things to do. What sort of things are you asking about? Just so I know what I’m getting into.
DOCTOR: Mostly just to get a sense of your overall health. We'll talk about any current symptoms you might be having – anything new or bothering you. Then a bit about your past medical history – any major illnesses or surgeries. And finally, some questions about your family health, just to see if there’s anything we should be paying closer attention to. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds… thorough. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit of a blur. I worked at the power plant for… well, a long time. Lots of noise, lots of stress. Don't recall much illness, thankfully. Surgeries… maybe? A bad knee once, I think. Family… my brother was… something or other. Heart trouble, maybe? It was ages ago. Really, I’m not much help on that front. Just do the tests, and if anything jumps out, I guess you can tell me?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Croonquist. We’ll proceed with some baseline labs. But to clarify, you mentioned a bad knee – have you had any problems with it recently?
PATIENT: Recently? Hmm. Let me think... No, not really. It aches sometimes, like all old joints do, but nothing that’s stopped me from… well, from doing things. I walk okay. Mostly. I haven't fallen or anything. It's just… old. Is that enough detail? I’m really not good at this remembering stuff.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. And no new pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing new. Back’s a bit creaky in the mornings, but that's just… getting old, right? Honestly, I think I'm mostly just worn out. I wouldn’t bother you if it wasn't a yearly thing, I suppose. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. We can certainly get this moving. Just a few more quick questions, and then we’ll head to the lab. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see. Um… I take a little something for my… well, for sleeping, sometimes. A small pill. Don’t remember the name. And that’s it, I think. Occasionally some aspirin for headaches, but not regularly. A very small amount. Honestly, Doctor, I try to avoid pills if I can. They don’t usually agree with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, sleep medication occasionally, and aspirin as needed. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I get a bit sniffly sometimes in the spring, but that’s just the dust, I think. Nothing serious. No hives, no breathing problems, nothing like that. Never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. It’s honestly been a long time since anyone asked me about allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. Before we head to the lab, let's just do a quick check of your blood pressure and pulse. And I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, just as a standard precaution. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. As long as it’s quick. Honestly, I don't like doctors poking around. Just get it over with, please. I’m not a fan of all this fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not critically high. Pulse is good. I did hear some mild crackles in your lungs when I listened, and your heart sounds are a bit faint. It's not necessarily cause for alarm, but it’s something we should keep an eye on. These results, along with the labs, will give us a clearer picture. Let's get those lab orders sent in. I'll need a urine sample and a blood draw. The nurse will guide you.
PATIENT: Fine. Crackles… sounds unpleasant. Just tell me where to go, and I’ll get it over with. I really just want to be done with this. And please, don’t poke around too much. This old body’s seen enough. Where's the nurse?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. I understand. The nurse, Sarah, is just through that door. She'll take excellent care of you. She’ll explain everything step-by-step. It will just be a routine blood draw and a simple urine sample. She’ll be right with you.
PATIENT: .
