DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I am Dr. Leidy Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. Well, to be frank, I haven't been myself lately. It’s… difficult to explain. Just a general unhappiness, I suppose. And it’s been going on for too long.
DOCTOR: "Unhappiness," you say. A rather… broad symptom, I must admit. Perhaps we can narrow that down. Can you tell me when this began?
PATIENT: Hmm. When did it begin… That’s a good question. It wasn't sudden, not at all. It crept up, slowly. If I had to put a time on it... perhaps six months ago? Around February, I think. Yes, February. My grandson started university then, and… well, things felt a bit empty after that. It’s silly, really. But that's when I noticed it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: February… six months. And this feeling of… emptiness… has it been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. But… it’s happening more and more often. There are days where I can manage, you know? I go about my business, I see my friends… But then, out of nowhere, it just… descends. Like a heavy cloak. And then I just want to be left alone. It’s exhausting, honestly. Especially at my age, you’d think I’d have learned to cope with these things.
DOCTOR: “Exhausting,” yes. Well, it's not uncommon for emotional fluctuations to occur, even – and perhaps especially – with age. Now, when these… episodes descend, as you put it, are there any specific triggers?
PATIENT: Triggers… That's… difficult to say. Not always. Sometimes it’s nothing at all. Just… a feeling. But… looking back, perhaps when I’m alone for too long? Or… thinking about my late husband, Samuel. It’s the anniversary of his passing in April, and that always… affects me, of course. But it’s not just that. It's… complicated. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Complicated,” yes. Naturally. Now, are there any other symptoms accompanying these feelings?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Other than… feeling sad? Oh… well, I haven't been sleeping properly. I wake up in the middle of the night, and then I just lie there. And my appetite… it’s not what it used to be. I used to enjoy cooking, but now… it feels like a chore. I've lost a little weight, I think, but nothing drastic. Just… not as much energy as I used to have. Is that a symptom? I don't know all these medical terms, you see.
DOCTOR: Loss of sleep, decreased appetite… yes, those can certainly be indicative of various conditions. Now, Ms. Derasmo, have you experienced any changes in your concentration, or any difficulty with memory lately?
PATIENT: Memory… Now that you mention it… perhaps. I forget things more easily than I used to. Little things, mostly. Where I put my keys, what I was going to say… Things like that. It’s not… debilitating, not yet. But it’s noticeable. My daughter keeps reminding me of things, and it’s… embarrassing, to be honest. I used to have a very sharp mind. Samuel always said so. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Medications? No, Doctor. I try to avoid them if I can. Samuel always said, "Don't put things in your body that don't belong there." I take a multivitamin, if that counts. And sometimes, if my joints are bothering me, I’ll take ibuprofen. But that's it. Nothing for… anything else. I prefer natural remedies, if possible.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses? No, Doctor. I’ve been remarkably healthy, all my life. I was a swimmer, you see. For many years. Keeps the body strong. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… nothing serious. My blood pressure has been a little high lately, the doctor at home told me, but it’s manageable. And I had my gallbladder removed, oh, twenty years ago now. But that’s it. Truly. I’ve always taken good care of myself.
DOCTOR: And your family history, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. Samuel’s mother had… arthritis, I believe. And his father… he had a weak heart, I think. Died young. My mother… she lived to be quite old, actually. Ninety-two. But she had… dementia, towards the end. It was very sad. And my sister… she had high blood pressure, like me. But that's about it, really. Nothing… major. Is that what you were asking about?
DOCTOR: And finally, Ms. Derasmo, would you mind describing your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle? Well, I live alone, as I said. But I’m not idle. I volunteer at the community centre twice a week, helping with the children’s reading program. And I still swim, whenever I can. Though not as often as I used to. I enjoy gardening, and I see my friends regularly. I cook for myself, mostly healthy meals. And I go to church every Sunday. I keep busy. I don’t just sit around feeling sorry for myself.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Now, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination. It's standard procedure. If you would please, lie back on the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well, Doctor. But please be gentle. My joints aren’t what they used to be. And… I don’t particularly enjoy being prodded and poked. Do hurry, if you would. I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 148 over 92. Pulse is 78, regular. Temperature is normal at 98.6. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Reflexes are diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Given your symptoms and examination findings, it’s difficult to pinpoint a single cause. It could be a number of factors – stress, grief, even the natural effects of aging. However, given the changes in memory and the sleep disturbances, I believe it would be prudent to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I'm going to order some routine blood tests, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and a Vitamin D level. I would also like to schedule a cognitive assessment to evaluate your memory and thinking skills.
PATIENT: Blood tests? A cognitive assessment? Really, Doctor? Is that truly necessary? I’ve already told you, I’m perfectly fine. A little tired, perhaps. A little sad. But I’m not… losing my mind. Samuel always said I had a photographic memory. He used to say I remembered everything. What exactly are you looking for? And how long will all of this take? I have an active life, you know. I can’t just sit around waiting for test results.
DOCTOR: Ms. Derasmo, it is standard procedure to investigate these symptoms thoroughly. It’s not a question of doubting your self-assessment, but of ruling out any potential medical causes. The blood tests will help identify any vitamin deficiencies or underlying conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue and mood changes. And the cognitive assessment is a simple evaluation to assess your memory and cognitive function. It will not take long, perhaps 30-45 minutes. Furthermore, it would be wise to consider a referral to a psychologist for grief counselling. The loss of your husband, even after a significant period of time, can still have a profound impact on your emotional wellbeing. I have provided you with information regarding local psychologists who specialize in grief counselling. Please review it at your convenience. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Grief counselling? Honestly, Doctor. I grieved for Samuel properly. Years ago. I’ve moved on. I have my friends, my community, my faith. I don’t need to sit and dwell on the past. And I do not appreciate you implying that I am not coping. Very well. I suppose I can agree to the blood tests. But I am not promising to attend any cognitive assessment or grief counselling sessions. I will consider it. Now, can we please get this over with? I have an appointment later this afternoon, and I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Derasmo. I will submit the blood test order to the lab. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the samples. I strongly advise you to reconsider the cognitive assessment and grief counselling. However, the decision is ultimately yours. I will schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the blood test results. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new concerns, please do not hesitate to contact the clinic. You may get dressed now. I will see you then. .
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. I do hope this proves to be… worthwhile. .
