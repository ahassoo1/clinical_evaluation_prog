DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's about… a letter. For my… companion. Yes, that's right. A letter saying I can have him, you know? To prove I'm allowed. It’s for the building, they need it. Honestly, the fuss some people make. It’s not like he’s a… a problem.
DOCTOR: A letter…to allow a companion to live with you?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! A companion. A… a very special companion. They’re being difficult about it, the management, that is. All sorts of rules and regulations. Honestly, it's ridiculous. I pay good rent. It's not like I'm bringing in… well, never mind what I'm not bringing in. It's a perfectly respectable situation. They just want paperwork, it seems. Is that what you do? Write letters like that?
DOCTOR: I’m a family physician, Ms. Wrye. I provide medical care. While I can certainly document medical necessities, I don’t typically write letters confirming… living arrangements. Could you clarify who this companion is, and what specifically the building management requires from a medical professional?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Medical. Yes, of course. I get things mixed up sometimes. It’s… a dog. A lovely dog. A big one. A rescue. They want proof I’m… stable enough to care for him. Something about… emotional suitability? Honestly, it’s insulting. I’ve had pets my whole life! But they need a doctor’s note, apparently. Something saying I’m… capable. That’s all. Do you do… capability notes?
DOCTOR: So, the building management requires a statement regarding your ability to care for a pet dog. They're assessing your… suitability as a pet owner. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. That’s it precisely. Suitability. As if they’re qualified to judge! I feed him, I walk him, I love him. What more do they want? It's just... they asked for a doctor’s note, and honestly, I haven’t the foggiest idea what that entails. Some sort of form, I suppose? I just want to get it over with. It’s… a bit embarrassing, really. They’re treating me like I'm some sort of… unstable person.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Wrye. To properly address this request, I’ll need to gather some information. Let’s start with your general health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical or mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That’s… a bit personal, isn’t it? I mean, what does my health have to do with a dog? I’m perfectly fine, thank you very much. A bit tired sometimes, but who isn’t? I don’t have any conditions. Not that I know of. Look, I just want a letter saying I can look after a dog. Is it really necessary to delve into my entire medical history? It feels… invasive.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, the building management is requesting an assessment of your ability to provide consistent care for an animal. That includes evaluating factors that could potentially impact your capacity to do so. While I understand your discomfort, a basic health overview is necessary to fulfill their request responsibly. Are you currently under the care of any physicians?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you must. I… used to see someone. Years ago. For… stress. After the divorce. But that was ages ago. I haven’t been in years. And I certainly don’t see anyone now. Perfectly fine, I tell you! No need to worry about anything like that. It was just a phase, really. Is that enough? Can we just skip all this and get the letter? I’m starting to feel quite flustered.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I need a complete medical history to properly assess your suitability. Simply stating you were once treated for stress isn’t sufficient. Do you recall the name of the physician you saw, or the diagnosis you received?
PATIENT: Ugh. This is ridiculous. Honestly! It was… Dr. Albright, I think? Yes, Dr. Albright. She was… very nice. And the diagnosis… something about… situational anxiety? Or… reactive depression? Something like that. Look, it was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the specifics! It was just a stressful period. Why does this even matter? It has absolutely nothing to do with a perfectly well-behaved dog! I’m starting to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, building management has requested a more thorough assessment of your psychological and emotional stability to ensure you can provide long-term, consistent care for a pet. This form requests details about past treatments, and any current symptoms you may be experiencing. It is a standard procedure when evaluating someone's capacity for animal ownership, especially with a large breed dog. Please answer these questions to the best of your ability. It's important for me to have a complete picture of your health history to fulfill their request accurately. I understand your frustration, but this is necessary. Would you like me to explain any of the questions before you begin?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. A form? Really? It’s a dog, Doctor, not a small child! And now I have to fill out a questionnaire about my… emotional state? Honestly, the audacity! This is beyond ridiculous. I suppose… I have no choice, do I? If you insist. But don't expect detailed answers. I barely remember what I had for breakfast, let alone the specifics of some therapy session from years ago. And please, don't ask me to justify my love for a perfectly lovely animal. .
