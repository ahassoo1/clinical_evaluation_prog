DOCTOR: Hi Chelise, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Dr. Yoshino. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? It said my cholesterol is high. That’s why I’m here. I don’t really know what that means, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a high cholesterol result. That's a good reason to come in and talk about it. It's really common, and we can definitely figure out what it means for you and what, if anything, we need to do. First, let's talk a little about what cholesterol is and why it's important. But first, can you tell me if you’ve been feeling any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed. I feel pretty good, actually. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just… life, you know? I haven’t been having any chest pain or anything like that. I walk a lot, and I haven’t had any trouble with that. Should I be feeling something?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're feeling generally well! And no, you shouldn’t necessarily be feeling anything with high cholesterol, especially in the early stages. That’s why routine screenings are so important. Often, people don’t realize there’s a problem until it leads to something more serious. Okay, so no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no unusual fatigue… that’s all helpful. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. Not much to tell, really. I’ve always been pretty healthy. I had chickenpox as a kid, like everyone else. No big illnesses, no surgeries. My mom had… I think it was high blood pressure, when she got older. And my dad… he had some problems with his knees. Nothing major. I go for my yearly checkups, and everything’s usually fine. I have Medicare, so they check a lot of things. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. Knowing about your mom’s high blood pressure is useful. Family history can definitely play a role. And you said you have routine checkups with Medicare, great. Do you happen to know what your cholesterol numbers were on that lab report?
PATIENT: Let me see… Ah, here it is. Okay… Total cholesterol is 245. HDL is 40. LDL is 160. And… Triglycerides are 180. Does that mean anything to you? I don’t even know what those are.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Yes, these numbers give us a clearer picture. You're right to ask what they mean. Basically, cholesterol travels in the blood in different types of packages. HDL is what we call “good” cholesterol – it helps remove other kinds of cholesterol from your bloodstream. LDL is the “bad” cholesterol – it can build up in your arteries. Triglycerides are a type of fat in your blood. Your total cholesterol at 245 is higher than we’d like, ideally we want that under 200. Your LDL at 160 is also elevated - we generally want that under 100, especially with a history of family history. Your HDL at 40 is a little on the low side, we prefer to see that above 60. Your triglycerides at 180 are borderline high. Now, these numbers, combined with your family history, suggest we need to take a closer look. Before we jump to any conclusions, could you tell me a little bit about your diet and lifestyle?
PATIENT: Okay… so higher is worse? That doesn’t sound good. Diet and lifestyle… well, I try to eat pretty healthy. I cook most of my meals at home. Lots of vegetables, some chicken or fish. I do like a good steak every now and then. I don’t eat a lot of processed foods. And I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner, but I cut back on that a little bit. As for lifestyle… I walk about three miles a day, almost every day. I enjoy gardening, too. That’s good exercise, right? I don’t smoke, and I haven’t for years. I'm not very stressed. I’m a pretty relaxed person, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very healthy lifestyle, Chelise! Honestly, it’s good to hear you’re already doing so many things right. The walking, the gardening, the home-cooked meals… those are all excellent. The fact that your numbers are elevated despite these healthy habits suggests there might be other factors at play, or perhaps a genetic predisposition. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs and check your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. I don’t mind. It’s good to be thorough, I guess. I trust your judgment, Dr. Yoshino. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your pulse and blood pressure. Okay, your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear, good air movement on both sides. Blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. And your pulse is 72 and regular. Everything sounds pretty good, structurally. Given your cholesterol numbers, family history, and slightly elevated blood pressure, I think it would be a good idea to order some additional blood work. This would include a more detailed lipid panel, as well as some tests to rule out other potential causes of high cholesterol, like thyroid problems or diabetes. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. If it helps figure things out, I’m happy to do more tests. I don’t want to just… ignore it. So, more blood work. Will Medicare cover that? I don’t want any surprises on the bill. And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and a smart thing to ask. Yes, Medicare should cover the additional blood work, given your elevated cholesterol and my clinical assessment. However, it’s always best to double-check with your insurance provider directly to confirm coverage and any potential out-of-pocket costs. Our billing department can also help with that if you’d like. The results typically take about 5-7 business days to come back from the lab. Once I have them, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them and create a plan of action. In the meantime, it might be helpful to continue with your healthy lifestyle habits – the walking, gardening, and healthy diet are all excellent. We can also talk more about dietary modifications and potentially lifestyle interventions during our next appointment. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Dr. Yoshino. And I’ll check with Medicare, just to be sure. So, 5-7 days for the results, and then we’ll schedule another appointment. I’m glad we’re getting to the bottom of this. Is there anything else I should be doing now? Anything I should avoid eating or drinking?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chelise. I'm glad I could help ease your concerns. For now, while we wait for the results, there aren’t any drastic changes you need to make. However, it's generally a good idea to limit your intake of saturated and trans fats, which can raise LDL cholesterol. These are often found in red meat, processed foods, and fried foods. You can also try to increase your intake of soluble fiber, which can help lower cholesterol. Things like oats, beans, fruits, and vegetables are great sources of soluble fiber. I wouldn’t restrict anything completely, but just be mindful of your choices. And continue with your walking and healthy diet – those are already great steps. I'll have the lab order sent electronically to the lab, and they'll contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, Dr. Yoshino. I feel much better knowing we’re looking into it. Thank you again. I’ll see you in a week or so, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chelise. I'm glad I could help. And you’re right, we'll see you back in about a week or so once the results are in. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and enjoy your walking!
PATIENT: It’s good to know. I will. You too, Dr. Yoshino.
