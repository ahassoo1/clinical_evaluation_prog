DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner, welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, yeah, nice to meet you too, I guess. It’s my face and legs, see? They're… puffy. Been that way a little while now. Not sure why though. It’s just… happening. Don't really understand it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Puffy face and legs… alright. And how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Time… that’s a tough one. Seems like… a few weeks, maybe? Longer? Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. My wife, bless her soul, she always knew. Now… it's all a bit of a blur. It's not painful, just… noticeable. And kinda uncomfortable, especially in this heat.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, give or take. Not painful, just noticeable and uncomfortable. I understand. It’s good you’re paying attention to it, even if the timing is a bit fuzzy. Now, has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean? Like… did I move the furniture? No. I haven’t been doing much different, to be honest. Same routine, mostly. Work, come home, watch the news… eat my dinner. I haven’t been traveling, if that's what you’re getting at. Used to go fishing with my wife, but… well, that's not happening anymore. Everything's just… quiet now. I suppose I have been eating a bit more salt lately, though. The canned soup is easier than cooking, you know? Not much energy for all that.
DOCTOR: I see. Quiet now… I understand. And the canned soup… a little more salt, you say. Okay. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, or perhaps any changes in how much you're urinating?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No, not really. I get a little winded walking up the stairs, but that’s just 'cause I'm not as young as I used to be. Always been a bit outta shape, to be honest. Urinating… I go to the bathroom, same as always. Maybe a bit more often at night, now that I think about it. But I figured that's just old age creeping up on me. Is that… is that bad? Everything feels like it's just falling apart, you know? It's just... a lot.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not necessarily bad, Mr. Miner. It’s good you’re noticing these things and telling me about them. A little more frequent urination at night can be something we need to look into, but it’s not immediately alarming. Now, do you have any history of heart problems, kidney issues, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Heart problems? Not that I know of. My father had something, a long time ago, but I don't remember what exactly. Kidney issues… no. Never been told I had anything wrong with my kidneys. Diabetes… hmm. My wife, bless her soul again, she was a bit worried I might be getting it a few years back. Said I was eating too much sugar. I didn't pay much attention, to be honest. I always thought it was just a way to get me to eat more vegetables. She was a good woman. Is diabetes something you can get from, uh, not eating enough greens?
DOCTOR: It’s not from not eating enough greens, Mr. Miner, but not eating enough greens can certainly contribute to it. Diabetes is about how your body processes sugar, and it can develop for a variety of reasons. And it’s understandable that you’re thinking of your wife right now. Let’s see… do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies to medications… not that I know of. I haven’t taken much in my life. A little aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. I don’t really believe in all those pills, to be honest. Just seem like a way for the doctors to make money. My wife, she was always taking something, though. Blood pressure, cholesterol… a whole pharmacy in the bathroom. But I never needed much, thankfully. Strong Swedish blood, I always said.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Good to know. Now, would you mind if I just take a quick look at your legs and feet, and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Oh. Yeah. Sure. I guess so. Sounds… thorough. Though I don't know what you're gonna find, to be honest. Just old legs, that's all. And a tired heart. Don't expect much, Doc. I'm not exactly a spring chicken anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Miner. It's not about expecting much, it's about getting a clearer picture. If you could just sit on the table for me, and I'll start with your legs. Now, these legs… I notice some swelling, as you mentioned. It's mostly around your ankles. And the skin feels a little warm to the touch. Can you tell me if this swelling comes and goes, or is it fairly constant?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Hard to say for sure, honestly. Some days it’s worse than others. Usually worse in the evening, after I’ve been sitting around all day. I try to put my feet up, but it doesn’t seem to help much. It’s just… there. Annoying, mostly. I used to have nice ankles, my wife always said. Now they look like… sausages. She had good taste, my wife. Everything looks worse when you're old, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s frustrating when things change. And you’re right, it can be annoying. Alright, listening to your heart… I hear a normal rhythm, but there's a slight murmur. It’s not a strong one, but it’s something we should investigate further. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Again, not dramatically high, but it’s worth keeping an eye on. Now, I'd like to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. A complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an EKG. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… ugh. More poking and prodding. I don't like tests. But… I guess if you think it’s necessary. I just want to know why my legs are puffy, you know? And if it's serious. I haven't got much time left to worry about things, so… yeah. Do what you gotta do. Just… try to be quick, Doc. I get nervous around hospitals and doctors and all that. It reminds me too much of… well, never mind. Let's just get it over with, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Miner. I’ll make sure everything is as quick and comfortable as possible. We'll get the tests ordered, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. It's just a routine procedure. The EKG is painless - we just attach some stickers to your chest. While we’re waiting for the results, I'm going to recommend a low-sodium diet and some light exercise, like walking for 15-20 minutes a day, if you’re able. And I want you to monitor your weight daily, and let us know if there are any sudden changes. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Low sodium, light exercise… yeah, I guess. Easier said than done, though. I’m not much of a cook, as I said, and walking… well, my knees aren’t what they used to be. But I’ll try. For my wife, I’ll try. She always wanted me to take better care of myself. Monitoring my weight… that I can do. Got a scale in the bathroom. Just… don’t expect miracles, Doc. I’m an old man, and old men fall apart. That's just the way it is. Let me know when those tests are back, alright? And try not to keep me waiting too long. I'm not as patient as I used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Miner. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible, and we’ll discuss them thoroughly. And you’re right, we’ll take things one step at a time. No pressure, just information. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just… get it over with, Doc. And thanks. For listening, I mean. It's… nice to talk to someone. My wife… well, she was always the one who did all the talking. Just… hurry with those tests, alright? I wanna get home. It's quiet there.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Miner. We'll get right on it. You just relax, and we'll take good care of you. The nurse will be with you soon. .
