DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I am Dr. Blim. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Blim. Thank you for seeing me. I have… something coming out of my ear. A discharge, yes? It is… troubling me. It started maybe three days ago.
DOCTOR: A discharge, you say. Three days ago. Very well. And could you describe this discharge for me?
PATIENT: It is… not much. A little bit of liquid. It is… yellowish. And sometimes, a small… smell. Not very strong, but it is there. It does not hurt, but it feels… wet. Is that… a good way to say it?
DOCTOR: Yellowish discharge, with a slight odor...and a sensation of wetness. Alright. Have you experienced any pain, fever, or hearing loss alongside this discharge?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. No fever that I know of. I… feel normal, other than the ear. And… no, my hearing seems okay. Maybe a little muffled sometimes, but I thought that was just… getting old. I am sixty years old, you know.
DOCTOR: Sixty years. Yes, well, things do decline. Have you attempted any self-treatment for this discharge?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I did not try anything. I thought… it was best to come to you. I do not know what to put in my ear. I did not want to make it worse. My… ex-wife, she always had remedies, but… this is different.
DOCTOR: Sensible. Avoid self-treatment. Now, have you had any previous ear infections, surgeries, or trauma to the ear?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. No infections, no surgery. No accidents… nothing. My ears… they were always okay. Until this. I… I am a teacher, you know? I need to hear my students. This is… concerning.
DOCTOR: No prior history. A teacher, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I teach at the community college. History classes. It is… important work. But hard to explain when you cannot hear well. Is… is this something serious, Doctor? I worry.
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions. We need to examine it first. I’ll need to take a look inside your ear. Please sit up and face me.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will sit. Please… be gentle. My ears are… sensitive. Is there a light?
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick as possible. Hmm. There appears to be cerumen impacted, and some inflammation of the ear canal…and a small amount of purulent discharge present. Your tympanic membrane appears intact, but it’s difficult to see clearly with this buildup. It looks like you may have otitis externa, or a swimmer's ear. Though, without a clear view, it's hard to say definitively.
PATIENT: Otitis… externa? Swimmer's ear? I… do not swim, Doctor. I live very far from the ocean. And I have not been in a pool in many years. What… what does this mean? Is it… contagious? I have grandchildren.
DOCTOR: It doesn't require swimming, Mr. Radillo. It's simply an infection of the outer ear canal, often caused by bacteria or fungi. It's not particularly contagious, but I wouldn't recommend sharing earbuds, naturally. We'll need to clear out the cerumen to get a better look, and then I'll prescribe some topical antibiotic ear drops. I’ll also want you to avoid getting water in your ear as much as possible. I’ll also recommend you avoid Q-tips. They often worsen the condition. Do you have any allergies to antibiotics?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I have never had a… reaction to medicine. I… take some pills for my blood pressure, but that is all. And no, I do not use Q-tips. My mother always said they were bad. Blood pressure pills, and… nothing else. What… what do these ear drops do? Do they… hurt?
DOCTOR: The ear drops contain antibiotics to combat the infection. They're generally well-tolerated, though some people experience mild stinging for a moment. It's usually brief. I am prescribing Ciprofloxacin otic solution. Use two drops in the affected ear twice daily for seven days. This should resolve the issue. I will also give you a referral to an audiologist to evaluate your hearing as a precaution, to ensure there's no underlying loss. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Ciprofloxacin… I will remember that name. Seven days, two drops. An audiologist? Is my hearing… bad? I thought it was just getting old. And… will the drops… make my ears feel wet? I do not like the feeling of water. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very… helpful.
DOCTOR: The audiologist will simply assess your hearing levels. It's a routine check, Mr. Radillo, nothing to be alarmed about. As for the wetness, yes, the drops will have a liquid sensation briefly, but it should dissipate quickly. I am sending the referral now. Follow up with your primary care physician if symptoms persist or worsen. Any other concerns, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You have answered everything. Thank you again for your time and… explanation. I will… I will take the prescription and make an appointment with the audiologist. Good day, Doctor Blim. And thank you. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Good day to you, Mr. Radillo. .
