DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I’m Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs… on my shins, mostly. They’re red and kinda sore. Been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bumps on your shins that are red and sore. And how long have they been bothering you, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… a couple of months, I guess? It started with just one, then a few more popped up. Not every day, but slowly. I didn't think much of it at first, figured I bumped them on something. But they just… stayed. And now they hurt a bit more when I walk.
DOCTOR: Alright. A couple of months, starting with one and gradually increasing, and now causing some pain with walking. Do you recall any specific injury or event that might have triggered the first bump?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I work… I move things around at the warehouse, you know? Boxes, supplies. Lots of walking. Could've been anything there, honestly. It’s hard to say. I don't remember hitting my leg on anything special. I just noticed it one day after work.
DOCTOR: I see. Warehouse work involves a lot of physical activity, so it's possible it's related to that. Besides the pain with walking, have you noticed any other symptoms associated with the bumps?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. They itch sometimes, a little. Not all the time, and not badly itchy, but enough that I have to… not scratch, but kinda rub them sometimes. And… they feel warm, maybe? I haven't really paid too close attention, to be honest. Mostly just the pain when I'm on my feet.
DOCTOR: Okay, some occasional itching and a feeling of warmth. Thank you. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or fatigue recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. Feeling pretty normal, except for these legs. No fever, no chills, just… tired after a long day at work, you know? But that's normal for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your skin anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: No, not really. My skin’s always been… well, old skin, you know? A few age spots here and there. Nothing new that I’ve noticed. These bumps are the only thing different.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or skin conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see... I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. I take a pill for it every day. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy, I think. No diabetes, no heart problems, and no skin problems, not usually. Just… regular old man stuff, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure managed with medication. And what medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It’s a little white pill… I think it’s called… lisinopril? Yes, that’s it. Lisinopril. I take one every morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril. Good. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything, that I remember. No allergies to food, no allergies to medicine… nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just my appendix when I was a kid, a long time ago. That’s it. Nothing else. No other surgeries, not ever.
DOCTOR: Alright. And lastly, regarding your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or skin cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had heart problems, I think. He had to have a… a pacemaker, maybe? And my mother… she had high blood pressure too, like me. I don't think anyone else had anything… serious. No skin cancer that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease and high blood pressure. Thank you for that information, Mr. Aluia. Now, if you'll allow me, I'd like to take a look at your legs. Could you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. No problem. Go ahead, take a look. Let me know if you need me to move or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Aluia. I see several small, reddish bumps on your shins. They appear to be slightly raised and are tender to the touch. There’s no visible drainage or open sores. The surrounding skin isn’t particularly inflamed. Do you feel any numbness or tingling in your legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No numbness or tingling. Just… sore. They hurt when I press on them, and a little bit when I walk a lot. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on the appearance and your symptoms, it's possible these are shin splints, or more accurately, stasis dermatitis with some possible component of venous insufficiency. However, to be certain, I’d like to order a few tests. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a venous Doppler ultrasound of your legs. This will help rule out other possibilities and determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Woah, Doctor… that’s a lot of big words! Tests… okay, that sounds… good. If you think it’s best. I don’t really understand all that, but I trust your judgment. What do I need to do for these tests?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Aluia, I’ll explain everything as simply as possible. The complete blood count will check for any signs of infection or inflammation. The basic metabolic panel checks your kidney function and electrolyte levels. The venous Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive scan that looks at the blood flow in your legs to see if there's any blockage or valve issues. You’ll need to have some blood drawn, and then you’ll lie on the table while a technician uses a handheld device to scan your legs. It doesn’t hurt at all. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment for the ultrasound. I’ll also send a prescription to your pharmacy for a topical steroid cream to help with the inflammation and itching in the meantime. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… blood tests, scan, and a cream. Yes, that makes a little more sense. Topical… what was that word again? For the legs? I’ll get the cream. And they’ll call me for the other stuff. My wife can help me with all that. Is this covered by Medicare?
DOCTOR: Topical steroid cream. It's a cream you apply directly to your legs to reduce inflammation and itching. And yes, Medicare should cover these tests and the cream, but it's always a good idea to check with your insurance provider to confirm your coverage and any potential out-of-pocket costs. I'll have the nurse provide you with information on how to contact Medicare if you have any questions about coverage. In the meantime, try to elevate your legs whenever possible, and avoid prolonged standing or walking if it causes pain. Once we have the test results, we can discuss a more specific treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, elevate… and not stand too long. I can do that. My wife will remind me, for sure. No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You explained everything pretty well. Just… glad to be getting something done about these legs. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to go over discharge instructions and schedule your follow-up appointment. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and try to take it easy on your legs.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor, you too. Thank you again. Bye now.
