DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie, good to see you. Or… good to meet you, I suppose. I'm Dr. Gorga. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh, hello Doctor. Laury Scobie, yes. I want… test. For… where my people come from. DNA test, you know? My son, he say I should find out more. He say it good to know.
DOCTOR: A DNA test… to find out more about your heritage, you mean?
PATIENT: Yes, yes! Heritage. That right. Where my… family, long time ago, come from. I born Marshall Islands, but… before that? I no know so good. That why I here. My son, he say you can help.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Your son is right, we can arrange that. It's becoming more common these days. Before we do, though, just to get a full picture… are you having any health concerns currently?
PATIENT: Health? No, no big problem. Old man things, you know? Little aches here and there. But nothing… doctor need to worry about now. Just want to know about my family, long time ago. You understand?
DOCTOR: I do, I do. It's good to be proactive. Just a couple of quick questions, routine things. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. No, I don’t think so. Never had much need for them. Maybe when I little boy, some… syrup when I cough. But nothing now. I just… take a little bit of coconut oil when my joints ache. That all.
DOCTOR: Coconut oil, alright. And are you currently taking any other supplements or herbal remedies, besides the coconut oil?
PATIENT: No, no. Just coconut oil. Sometimes I drink a little bit of ginger tea when my stomach feel bad. But not every day. Just when I need it. I try to eat good, fish and fruit, that is. Not much else.
DOCTOR: Okay. And… have you been feeling any changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: Appetite? No change. I eat when I hungry, no eat when I no hungry. Old man, you know. Sometimes hungry, sometimes no. No big change. I like fish. Very good for me, yes?
DOCTOR: Fish is very good for you. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any recent weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Weight? Hmm. I no think so. Maybe little bit. But I always small man. Been this weight long time. No big change. My son, he say I look okay. He say I good!
DOCTOR: Alright. And… do you have any history of serious illnesses – things like heart problems, diabetes, or cancer – in your family?
PATIENT: Serious illness… hmm. That hard to say. Long time ago, people just… get sick and then… gone. No doctor, no talk about things like… cancer. My grandfather, he got very sick when he old, but I no know what it was. My mother, she strong woman, very healthy. My father, he fisherman, work hard all his life. I don’t think so much serious sickness in my family. Just… old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had surgery. I just… bumps and bruises when I little boy. Fall down, play with friends. But no doctor cut me open. Never. I good man! No need surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, one last thing before we talk about the DNA test… are you experiencing any pain anywhere right now?
PATIENT: Pain? Little bit in my knees sometimes. Old man things. But I can walk, I can work with my wood. Not bad pain. Just… aches. Like… tired bones. I can live with it. It's okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. So, no major health concerns at the moment, just some aches and pains. Now, about that DNA test. We send a sample to a lab, usually a swab from inside your cheek. It takes a couple of weeks to get the results back, and it will give you an estimate of your ancestral origins. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sound good! Cheek swab? Easy! Couple of weeks, okay. I wait. I want to know where my people come from. You think you can find out? My son say it good, he say you very good doctor.
DOCTOR: We’ll do our best, Mr. Scobie. It’s not always exact, but it can give you a good idea. Let me just get the paperwork started, and then we’ll do the swab. It'll just take a few minutes. Now, let's get your insurance information... you said Medicare, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Medicare. I got the card here. Here you go, Doctor. Old man, always lose things. But I got it!
DOCTOR: Alright, perfect. Just need to copy this down… Okay, and a signature here… This just authorizes us to bill Medicare. Now, if you’ll just have a seat, I'll grab the swab kit. It's very simple.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I sign here? Here you go, Doctor. Good? I hope it easy. Old hands, sometimes shake a little.
DOCTOR: Yes, perfect. Thank you. Now, this is just a quick swab inside your cheek… it doesn’t hurt, just a little…uncomfortable. Open wide, and I'll get this done quickly. Alright, that's it! All done. Now we’ll send this off to the lab, and you should have the results in about two weeks. We'll contact you when they're ready. Any questions?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Thank you, Doctor. You very good. I hope I find out about my people. My son will be happy. Two weeks, okay. I wait.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Well, you have a good day, Mr. Scobie. And if anything changes, don't hesitate to call.
PATIENT: Okay, you too, Doctor. Thank you very much. Goodbye.
