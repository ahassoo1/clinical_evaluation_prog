DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m pleased to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It's… well, I've been bruising a lot easier lately. And I'm on blood thinners, so it's a bit worrying. I didn’t really want to come in, to be honest, but it's getting worse.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hainley, especially given that you’re already on blood thinners. It’s good you decided to come in – it’s always best to investigate changes like this. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the bruising?
PATIENT: Sure. It's just… everywhere, really. Little bumps, mostly. Like, I'll brush against the counter and get a bruise. Or sometimes I don’t even remember hitting anything. They’re not huge, but there’s a lot of them. And they seem to last longer than they used to. I didn't used to get this many, that’s for sure. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Bruising easily, with seemingly minor trauma, and the bruises lasting longer—those are definitely things we need to look into. And you said this is a recent change?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty recent. Maybe the last month or so? It started slowly, just a couple here and there. I thought I was just being clumsy, honestly. But then it just kept happening. It’s definitely more than usual. I'm a bit worried it’s the medication, but I don't want to mess with it without talking to someone first.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise of you to not adjust your medication on your own. We'll certainly consider that as a possibility. Could you tell me what medication you're currently taking, and what dosage?
PATIENT: It's… Warfarin. Five milligrams, once a day. I've been on it for about two years now, since the… well, never mind that. It was for a blood clot. And I get my blood tested regularly, like the doctor tells me, to make sure the levels are right. They were right last time, I remember that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin 5mg daily, and your last INR was within the therapeutic range. That's good information. Just to clarify, when you say "last time," how long ago was that blood test?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It was… July 12th, I think. Yeah, July 12th. I had to go early in the morning. I always do. And the lady who takes the blood said everything looked good. I have the results at home, if you need me to bring them in next time?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. July 12th is about three weeks ago. Okay. Now, besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. No. I mean, I'm a little more tired than usual, maybe? But I always chalk that up to… life, you know? And I haven’t had any bleeding gums or nosebleeds or anything like that. No big cuts that won’t stop. Just… the bruises. And being a bit worn out. That's it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant bleeding, just the easy bruising and increased fatigue. Now, I’m going to ask you a few general health questions, if that's alright. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. No, nothing like that. I had a little sniffle back in… April, maybe? But that was quick. Nothing serious. And I haven’t been sick since. I try to stay away from people when they’re sick, if I can. Don't need any extra problems.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. My appetite's the same, maybe a little less when I'm tired, but nothing major. And my weight… I haven’t weighed myself in a while, to be honest. Probably the same. I don't really focus on that too much. I'm not a big eater, never have been.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll just take your blood pressure and pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at the areas where you’ve been bruising. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. I just want to get this sorted out, you know? I don't like feeling like I'm going to turn into a purple person. I'm wearing shorts, if that makes it easier to look at my legs. They're the worst, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 128/82, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, looking at your legs, I see several areas of ecchymosis—that’s the medical term for bruising—varying in size, mostly small, and they do appear tender to the touch. The coloration suggests they are at different stages of healing, which is consistent with your description. I don’t see any signs of swelling or warmth, which is good. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to get a better look at your blood cells and organ function. This will help us rule out any underlying causes for the bruising. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. A complete blood count and… the other thing. Is it going to be expensive? I don’t really have insurance, so… I’m a little worried about the cost. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Ms. Hainley. We'll do our best to keep things as affordable as possible. I will speak with our billing department and see if we can offer any assistance or a payment plan, given your lack of insurance. The CBC and CMP are fairly standard tests, and we can discuss the results as soon as they come back. We may also want to repeat your INR just to be absolutely sure it hasn’t changed since your last test on July 12th. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s good. Repeating the INR sounds smart. And thank you for checking on the cost, I appreciate that. I'm just… a little stressed, to be honest. I don't like being a burden. And I don't like feeling sick. So, yeah. Whatever you need, just let me know. Can I go now? I have a few things I need to do today.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your stress, Ms. Hainley, and you are not a burden at all. We are here to help, and that's what we are going to do. Okay, so we’ll order the CBC, CMP, and repeat INR. The lab results typically take 24-48 hours. The lab technician will draw the blood samples before you leave. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. I will also have our billing department contact you regarding potential assistance with the costs. In the meantime, if you notice any significant bleeding, such as prolonged nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in your stool or urine, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Just… thank you. I appreciate you listening. And checking on the cost. I'm going to go get this blood work done. I'll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hainley. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and take care.
