DOCTOR: Hi Nixon, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg has gotten quite swollen. And… I have a heart thing, the atrial… fibrillation, is it? The other doctor told me about it. It’s been happening for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, good to know. Swelling in your left leg and a history of atrial fibrillation. That gives us a good starting point. Let’s talk about the leg swelling first. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… a week ago? It wasn’t too bad at first, just a little puffiness, you see. But it’s gotten worse each day, I believe. It's especially bad at the end of the day now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago, gradually worsening, worse at the end of the day. That’s helpful. Is the swelling just in your left leg, or is it affecting your right leg at all?
PATIENT: Just the left one, Doctor. My right leg feels perfectly normal, thank you. No swelling there at all. It’s just… quite bothersome in this one, really. It feels heavy, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. Heavy feeling is a common complaint with leg swelling. And good, it's isolated to the left leg. Has anything specific made it worse – like standing for long periods, exercise, or any injury to the leg?
PATIENT: Oh, standing does make it worse, I think. I work with computers, so I’m on my feet a bit when I’m setting things up for the students. And… well, I don’t do a lot of exercise, to be honest. No injuries, though. I’d remember that! I’m quite careful, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's aggravated by standing, and no recent injury. That's good to know. Now, let's circle back to the atrial fibrillation. How often have you been experiencing episodes of that?
PATIENT: Oh, the… the fluttery feeling? It comes and goes, Doctor. It’s not every day, thankfully. Maybe once a week or so? Sometimes two weeks. It doesn’t last very long when it does happen. Just a few minutes, usually. But it does worry me, you see. It feels… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Nixon. It's good it's not constant, but any heart rhythm issue deserves attention. A few minutes, happening maybe once a week or so. Are you currently taking any medication for the atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. The other doctor didn't prescribe anything for it. He just said to… keep an eye on it. He said something about blood thinners, maybe, if it got worse. But he didn’t give me anything. I don't take anything regularly, no. Just… occasional painkillers for a headache, if needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medication for the Afib, just occasional painkillers. And you said you haven’t been prescribed anything yet. Now, to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been feeling a bit tired lately, I suppose. But that could just be the summer heat, you see. And… sometimes I feel a little short of breath, especially when I climb the stairs. But again, I'm not very active, so maybe that's normal? I’m not sure. It’s hard to say, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue and shortness of breath, especially with exertion. It's good you're noticing these things, even if they might be subtle. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll also check your leg for any signs of blood clots. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Please do. I trust your judgement. I’d like to know what’s going on, you see. It’s been worrying me. I’ll do as you need me to, thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another one… good. Okay, your heart rate is a little fast, and I can hear a slightly irregular rhythm, which is consistent with the Afib. Your lungs sound clear, but I'll have you take a few deeper breaths just to be sure. Now, let's take a look at your leg. Your left leg is definitely swollen compared to your right, and it's a bit warm to the touch. There isn’t any significant pain when I press on it, which is good. I'm also checking for any redness or discoloration. It looks normal so far. I'd like to get a D-dimer test, just to rule out a blood clot in your leg. And given your history of Afib, an EKG would also be helpful to see what your heart is doing right now. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. Please do both of those tests. I’d like to know what’s going on, and those sound like sensible things to do. A D-dimer and… an EKG. Yes, thank you. I trust your judgement. What will happen next? Will it be painful?
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. Great. The D-dimer is just a simple blood test – a quick prick of the finger or a draw from your arm. The EKG is completely painless. It involves placing some sticky patches on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart's electrical activity. It doesn’t take long at all. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood for the D-dimer, and then we'll do the EKG right here in the exam room. It should only take about 15-20 minutes total. While we’re waiting for the results, can you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. A prick of the finger is no trouble at all. And sticky patches… that sounds manageable. My family history… Hmm. My mother had… high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandfather on my father’s side had something with his heart, but I don’t recall exactly what. He passed away when I was very young. No one else, to my knowledge, had any significant heart problems. My father is healthy, thankfully. He’s quite active, you see. He enjoys gardening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. High blood pressure in your mother and some heart issue in your grandfather. That’s helpful to know. And just one more thing – are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As I said before, I only take occasional painkillers for a headache, if needed. Nothing regularly. No vitamins or herbal supplements. I don’t really believe in those things, to be honest. Just the occasional ibuprofen, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional ibuprofen. That’s good to know. Alright, Nixon, let’s get these tests done. We'll discuss the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, try to elevate your left leg as much as possible. That can help reduce the swelling. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. Elevate my leg… yes, I can do that. I’ll try to keep it up as much as possible. I think I’ll just wait for the results now, then. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a bit. It's always best to be proactive. The nurse will let me know as soon as the results are back, which should be within the next 15-20 minutes. I’ll be right in to discuss them with you. Please just relax and let me know if you feel any changes in your symptoms while we wait.
