DOCTOR: Hi Denis, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because of some tests I recently had done… a GI Endo test, I believe it was called. The results weren’t quite what I expected, and my primary care physician suggested I come in for a closer look.
DOCTOR: Okay, a GI endoscopy. And your primary care physician felt a specialist follow-up was needed. I see. Let’s talk about those results. Do you happen to know what specifically the endoscopy was for – what were they looking at, and what were the initial concerns that led to the test?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. It was… well, I had been experiencing some discomfort. Not severe pain, mind you, but a persistent ache in my abdomen, mostly on the left side. And some… changes in my bowel habits, if you will. More frequent trips to the restroom, and… less solid, shall we say? My doctor thought it best to investigate further, to rule out anything serious. They mentioned something about looking for inflammation, and perhaps checking for any… growths. I hope that’s clear enough? I’m not very good with the medical details, you understand.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly clear, Denis. Persistent abdominal discomfort, changes in bowel habits – more frequent, looser stools. And the endoscopy was to look for inflammation or growths. When did you first start noticing these changes in your bowel habits, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began… oh, around the beginning of spring, I’d say. Perhaps March? It was gradual at first, barely noticeable. I dismissed it as something I ate, or a slight change in my routine. But it became more consistent… and then a little more worrying as the weeks passed. I’d say by May it was definitely something I needed to address. Does that timeline sound right to you, Doctor? I try to keep track, but my memory isn’t quite as sharp as it once was, despite what people say!
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Starting in March, gradual changes becoming more noticeable by May. And has anything specific seemed to trigger these symptoms?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I’ve been trying to pinpoint something…and honestly, I haven’t found a clear connection. I’ve been eating much the same diet for years – mostly fruits, vegetables, and fish. I did try a new brand of tea in April, a herbal blend, but I stopped drinking it after a week when it didn’t improve things. I also started taking a new vitamin supplement, but I’ve discontinued that as well, just to be sure. It’s rather frustrating, I must admit. I’m usually very careful about what I consume, but it seems this issue came on without any obvious cause. Perhaps it's just…age?
DOCTOR: It's good you've been trying to identify potential triggers, and that you discontinued the tea and supplement. It could be age-related, but we need to investigate further to rule out other possibilities. Let’s talk about some other symptoms. Have you experienced any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No, not that I’ve noticed. I always check, of course, one does, but everything has appeared… normal in that regard. I have noticed a bit of… mucus sometimes, a small amount, but no blood at all. And no change in color, either. I apologize for being so detailed, Doctor, but I do try to be thorough. Is that something I shouldn't be mentioning?
DOCTOR: No, please, don't apologize at all! Being thorough is exactly what I need. Mucus is good to know. And have you had any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, actually. A little. My clothes have been fitting… looser, shall we say? I hadn’t paid much attention, I thought perhaps it was the warmer weather. But looking back, I have lost a few pounds, perhaps five or six, over the last few months. It’s not a dramatic change, but enough to be noticeable. I haven't been actively trying to lose weight, that's for certain. I rather enjoy my meals!
DOCTOR: Okay, a few pounds of unintentional weight loss. And finally, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Thankfully, no. No fever, no chills, and certainly no night sweats. I sleep quite soundly, thankfully. I do get a little warm sometimes, but that’s just the blankets, I think. No other symptoms along those lines, Doctor. I'm fortunate in that regard. I really do try to stay healthy. Is there anything else I should be thinking about? I want to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: No, that's a very thorough rundown, Denis. Thank you. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me – the abdominal discomfort, changes in bowel habits starting in March, mucus in stool, and the unintentional weight loss – and given that your primary care physician ordered a GI endoscopy, I'd like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Many years ago, when I was quite a bit younger, I was diagnosed with… what was it called? Oh dear, my mind is playing tricks on me. It was an autoimmune condition, something affecting my joints. Rheumatoid arthritis, I believe that was it. I was on medication for many years, but I’ve been in remission for quite some time now, over fifteen years. I also had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. Other than that, nothing major. I've always been quite resilient, thankfully. Is that condition relevant, Doctor? It was so long ago, I'm not sure if it still poses any concerns.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Denis. Rheumatoid arthritis in remission, and a gallbladder removal. The RA is potentially relevant, as autoimmune conditions can sometimes present with gastrointestinal symptoms. Were you experiencing any gastrointestinal problems at the time of your RA diagnosis, or during treatment?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a very good question. I hadn't thought about it in those terms. Let me see… when I was first diagnosed, I did experience some… discomfort, yes. Not severe, but a general feeling of unwellness. Some nausea, and a loss of appetite. But it was difficult to separate those symptoms from the effects of the illness itself, and the medication I was taking. The doctors attributed it to the RA, and the side effects of the treatment. It subsided once the medication was adjusted, and my condition improved. I don't recall any specific gastrointestinal issues that persisted beyond that. It was a very long time ago, though, as I mentioned. My memory isn't what it used to be! Perhaps I should have kept better records, but one doesn’t think about these things when one is young.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Okay. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Let me think. My mother had some issues with her digestion, a rather sensitive stomach, she always said. And my brother, he had… colon polyps, I believe. He had them removed a few years ago, and everything was fine after that. Other than that, no major gastrointestinal issues on either side of the family, that I am aware of. My father was very healthy, lived to be eighty-five, and my grandmother, she was quite robust as well. It's difficult to say, really. We weren’t a family that discussed these things openly, you understand. One didn’t talk about such matters. Is there anything specific you’re looking for, Doctor? Perhaps I can be of more help if I know what to focus on.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Denis. A sensitive stomach in your mother, and colon polyps in your brother – that’s good information. Let’s move onto social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Never have, never will. I find the habit quite dreadful. I always considered it very unhealthy, and my late husband felt the same way. We were both very careful about our health, and we instilled those values in our children as well. I did enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I've cut back significantly in recent years. Perhaps a glass once a month, if that. I much prefer a nice cup of herbal tea, as I mentioned earlier, though I have stopped drinking that for the time being, just to be safe. I've always believed in moderation, Doctor. Does that answer your question? I hope I'm not rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. That’s very good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Thankfully, no. I've never had any allergic reactions to anything, as far as I am aware. No food allergies, no medication allergies, nothing at all. I am quite fortunate in that regard. I’ve always been very cautious about trying new things, though. I prefer to stick with what I know, just to be safe. It's one of the habits I've cultivated over the years. Is there anything else I should be mentioning, Doctor? I want to be sure I've provided you with all the information you need. I understand you're very busy, and I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: No, you’ve been very thorough, Denis. Thank you. Now, let's talk about the results of your GI endoscopy. What did your doctor tell you specifically about the findings?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the results. Well, my doctor… she said there was some inflammation in my colon. And some… polyps, she called them. Small ones, thankfully. She said they needed to be removed and examined further to rule out anything serious. She also mentioned something about a biopsy being taken, to check for any abnormal cells. She wasn't overly concerned, she said it could be a number of things, but she wanted me to get a specialist’s opinion, which is why I am here. She did say the inflammation was a bit unusual, and she wanted to investigate the cause. Honestly, Doctor, it was all a bit overwhelming. I try to listen carefully, but medical terminology is not my forte, and I get rather flustered easily. Do you understand what I mean? It was a lot to take in. She did write me a referral, of course, and I brought the results with me. Would you like to see them? I have them right here in my bag.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Let's take a look at those results together. That will give me a better understanding of what's going on. Okay, so the report indicates mild to moderate inflammation in the descending colon, and several small polyps were found. Biopsies were taken… and the pathology report is pending. Your primary care physician is right to refer you to a specialist. Based on this, and everything you’ve told me, it’s important to investigate the cause of the inflammation. There are a number of possibilities – it could be something as simple as a mild infection, or a flare-up of something like diverticulitis. It could also be related to your past rheumatoid arthritis, or an early sign of a condition like ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. The polyps need to be examined to rule out any precancerous changes, but small polyps are common, and often benign.
PATIENT: Ulcerative colitis… Crohn’s disease… those sound rather serious, Doctor. Is that what you suspect? I must admit, I am rather anxious. I've always been a healthy person, and the thought of something… chronic… is quite unsettling. And the polyps…are they likely to be cancerous? I apologize for being so direct, but I would rather know the truth, however unpleasant it may be. I understand you haven't seen the pathology report yet, but is there anything I should be particularly concerned about? Should I be preparing myself for… surgery, or other drastic measures? I realize I am asking a great many questions, but my mind is racing, and I feel rather overwhelmed. Perhaps a glass of water would help?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to ask questions, Denis. And it's good you're being proactive. Let’s not jump to conclusions. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are possibilities, but we need the pathology report to determine what’s going on. Right now, it's premature to say definitively. As for the polyps, most small polyps aren’t cancerous. The biopsy will tell us if they are benign, or if they need to be removed and further analyzed. If they are precancerous, we can typically remove them during a colonoscopy, preventing them from developing into cancer. Right now, the best course of action is to wait for the pathology report. I’m going to order a stool sample analysis to rule out any infection. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are back – typically about a week. We can discuss the findings then, and determine the next steps. I’m also going to order a repeat colonoscopy in six months to monitor the polyps. We don't need to talk about drastic measures at this point. We will take things one step at a time. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much more reasonable, Doctor. Taking things one step at a time is certainly preferable to dwelling on worst-case scenarios. A stool sample and a follow-up appointment…I can manage that. And waiting for the pathology report… it will be difficult, I must admit, but I understand it is necessary. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind and patient with my questions, and you have put my mind at ease considerably. I appreciate your thorough explanation, and your reassuring demeanor. I will be sure to schedule the follow-up appointment as soon as possible. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any dietary restrictions I should observe? Or any symptoms I should be particularly vigilant for? I want to be prepared, and I don’t want to overlook anything. Perhaps I should avoid… fiber-rich foods? Or spicy dishes? I am a bit of a worrier, you see, and I tend to overthink things. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. It’s my job to help. And it's good you're proactive. For now, there are no strict dietary restrictions. Continue to eat a balanced diet, and drink plenty of fluids. However, if you experience any significant changes in your bowel habits – such as bloody stool, severe abdominal pain, or a fever – please contact the office immediately. Otherwise, just focus on getting the stool sample analysis done, and we’ll take it from there. Here’s the lab requisition for the stool sample. It’s good to get it done as soon as possible. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment.
