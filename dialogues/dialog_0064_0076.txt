DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my legs, actually. I got these… bumps, red ones, on my shins. They’re kinda painful, you know? Especially when I’m working.
DOCTOR: Okay, bumps on your shins that are painful, particularly when you're working. I see. Hmm… let's get a little more detail. How long have you been noticing these bumps?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… maybe a couple of months now? It started small, just one or two, and now there's… quite a few. I didn’t really think much of it at first, figured I just bumped them around, but they don’t seem to be going away. And like I said, they really bother me when I’m on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: A couple of months, starting small and gradually getting worse, and worse with activity... alright. Can you describe the bumps to me?
PATIENT: Well, they're… hard, kinda like little knots under the skin. Red, of course, and… a little bit raised. Not huge, but you can definitely feel them. And sometimes they get warm to the touch, if that makes sense. Like a little fire under my skin. They don’t… leak or anything, just bumpy and sore.
DOCTOR: Bumpy, sore, hard knots, red, warm… no leakage. Do they itch at all, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: No, thankfully they don’t itch. That would be awful. Just…painful. Especially when my work pants rub against them. It's a dull ache, mostly. Sometimes a sharp pain if I really knock them on something. It’s mostly just annoying, but I worry it’s something serious, you know? Being on my feet all day like I am… it can't be good.
DOCTOR: Right, no itching, just pain and annoyance. And the rubbing of your work pants seems to aggravate it. We’ll certainly take a look and see what’s going on. Now, just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. I work at the warehouse down by the docks. Mostly moving stock, loading and unloading trucks, that kind of thing. Lots of walking, lots of lifting. It's pretty physical work, if you can imagine. Been doing it for… oh, must be fifteen years now. It keeps me busy, at least.
DOCTOR: Fifteen years... that's a good stretch. And when you're not working, are you generally active?
PATIENT: Not as much as I used to be, to be honest. When I get home, I'm pretty tired. Mostly I just like to relax with my wife, watch a little TV. We go to church on Sundays. Nothing too strenuous. We used to go dancing more, but my knees aren’t what they used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had a little trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor got it under control with some pills. I take those every day. Other than that… not much. I get a little arthritis in my hands, but that's pretty common for someone my age, I guess. And I have Medicare, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled high blood pressure with medication, and some arthritis in your hands. And you're covered by Medicare – good to know. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. I’ve been lucky so far, I think. Just the usual bumps and bruises from working, nothing serious enough to need a doctor to cut me open. My wife, she had her gallbladder taken out a few years back, but that was her, not me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries for you. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my mother had diabetes, and my father had problems with his heart. He passed away when he was pretty young, actually. And my wife’s mother had arthritis, like me. That’s about all I can think of off the top of my head. It’s been a while since we talked about family history, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother, heart problems in your father, arthritis in your wife’s mother… Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully. And the doctor hasn’t ever said I was allergic to any of the pills he’s given me. I’ve had a few reactions to mosquito bites when I was younger, but that’s about it. Just a little itchy bump, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Mr. Aluia, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to take a look at those bumps on your shins, if you don't mind. Would you be comfortable rolling up your pants legs so I can examine them?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s fine. Be careful, they're a little tender.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take a look here... They are a bit tender, as you mentioned. I see some small, firm, reddish nodules, primarily on the anterior shins. No signs of open sores or infection at this time. Do they feel warm to the touch?
PATIENT: Yes, they do. Not burning hot, but… warmer than the rest of my skin, definitely. Especially when I’ve been on my feet all day. It’s hard to explain, but they just feel… irritated. Like they’ve been rubbed raw, even though my pants aren't that rough.
DOCTOR: Okay, warm to the touch and feeling irritated. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I'm seeing, it's possible you may have what we call stasis dermatitis, or perhaps some mild shin splints aggravated by your work. However, there are other possibilities we need to rule out. To be sure, I’d like to order a couple of tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh… what kind of tests? I’m not afraid, but… I just hope they’re not too painful. And I hope they don’t take too long. I got things to do, you know? What exactly are we looking for?
DOCTOR: Nothing to worry about, Mr. Aluia. We'll start with a simple blood test to rule out any underlying inflammation or infection, and just check your basic kidney and liver function. We might also do a skin scraping just to ensure there isn’t a fungal infection. It’s a very quick and painless procedure - we simply use a small blade to collect a tiny sample of skin cells. It's just to cover all our bases, and help us get a clear diagnosis. The blood test will take a few days for the results, and the skin scraping results are usually available within a day or two. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… blood test and a skin scraping. A few days, a couple of days… that doesn't sound too bad, I guess. Better to be safe than sorry, right? Yes, that sounds alright. Just… how do I get the tests done? And where? Do I need to schedule something? I’m not good with all these medical things, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no problem at all. I'll write you a referral for the lab just down the street – it’s right across from the pharmacy. You don't need an appointment, you can just walk in. They’ll draw a small sample of blood, and we'll also have them do the skin scraping while you’re there. I'll give you the lab’s address and phone number. It should only take about 30 minutes to an hour, tops. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a treatment plan. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much better. Walk-in, no appointment… that’s good. Across from the pharmacy, that's easy to remember. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a lot better. I was worried it was something serious. And I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Sometimes these doctors just use a bunch of big words I don’t understand.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Aluia. It’s my job to make sure you understand everything that’s going on. We’ll take things one step at a time, and figure out what's causing these bumps. In the meantime, try to avoid anything that irritates your shins further – that might mean modifying your work routine if possible, and wearing loose-fitting clothing. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Loose clothing, try not to irritate them… I can do that. I might talk to my foreman about maybe switching tasks for a little bit, just to give my legs a break. Thank you again, Doctor Smetak. I appreciate your help. I'll go to the lab tomorrow. I guess that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Aluia. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are back. Get some rest and try not to worry too much. It was nice meeting you.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again. Bye now.
