DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my muscles. They just feel weak. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s starting to get annoying, honestly. I just want to figure out what’s going on so I can get back to work. I appraise cars for a living, and it takes a lot of moving around.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Weakness, you say. And it’s interfering with your work… alright. Could you describe the weakness for me?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not like I can’t do things, it’s just… everything takes more effort. Like, lifting things feels heavier than they should. And even just walking, sometimes my legs feel like they’re going to give out. It’s not painful, usually. Mostly just… tiring. Does that make sense? It's all over, really, not just one spot.
DOCTOR: All over… not localized. Alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Let me think… It started maybe… three months ago? At first, I just thought I was tired from work, you know? But it hasn't gotten better, and if anything, it's a little worse now. I'd say it's been steadily getting more noticeable over those three months. I remember distinctly it was after a particularly busy week, a lot of total loss claims… but that’s just when I noticed it. It could have been starting before then.
DOCTOR: Three months, gradually worsening. And you mentioned total loss claims… a lot of physical work involved in those, I presume?
PATIENT: Yeah, a lot. Inspecting the damage, taking photos, sometimes even helping to move things around a bit. It’s not heavy lifting, but it’s constant movement, bending, reaching… you get the idea. It adds up, I guess. I haven't really taken a day off since it started though. Bills, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, bills. Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I mean, I've been a little more tired than usual, but I figured that was from working and not sleeping enough. No fever, no dizziness, no… anything like that. I haven’t lost any weight, and my appetite is normal. It’s really just the muscle weakness. I guess I have been a bit clumsy lately, dropped a few things, but I chalked that up to being tired too.
DOCTOR: No other symptoms reported. Alright. Now, do you have any significant medical history?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, and broke my arm once, but that was years ago. No surgeries, no chronic illnesses, no allergies… I’m pretty healthy, actually. I try to eat okay, and I walk a lot for work. I don't take any medications regularly, either. Is there something I should be worried about? This is starting to make me nervous.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. McKinnon, given your age and the lack of other symptoms, it’s unlikely to be anything terribly serious. However, we need to rule a few things out. I'm going to do a brief physical exam. It won’t be extensive. We'll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and get back to normal. I’ve got work to do, and I can’t afford to be sidelined. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your reflexes. Please sit here and let your arms relax. Hmm. And now the other side. Okay. Now, please squeeze my hands as hard as you can. Good. And now resist as I try to push your arms down. Alright. And finally, can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Okay, here we go. This is… a little harder than it looks. I feel a little wobbly, to be honest. That feels… different than normal. Is something wrong? I'm not usually this clumsy.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your reflexes are within normal limits, but your muscle strength is slightly diminished in both arms and legs. Your gait is a little unsteady, as you noted. Given your symptoms and these findings, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further investigation. It could be a vitamin deficiency, a mild nerve issue, or something else entirely. We need to run some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, electrolytes, and thyroid function. I'm also going to order a Creatine Kinase test, just to rule out any muscle damage.
PATIENT: Okay. Blood tests. That sounds… reasonable. I guess that's what you need to do. I just hope it’s not something serious, you know? I don't have insurance, so this is already stressful enough. How long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back again? I have a busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, lacking insurance does complicate matters. The lab results typically take about three to five business days. Once I have them, I'll review them and contact you to discuss the findings. We may need to schedule a follow-up appointment, depending on what the results show. If the blood tests are normal, we may need to consider a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but it's best to be thorough. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity, and get some rest. Do you have any allergies to any medications or contrast dyes?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of. I’ve never had any reactions to anything before. And okay, rest and no strenuous activity. I can manage that, I guess. I’ll try to take it easy. Three to five days… that feels like a long time to wait, but I understand. Will someone call me, or should I call the office? I'm just trying to figure out the best way to follow up. And… how much are these blood tests going to cost? I should probably ask that.
DOCTOR: The office will call you with the results, Mr. McKinnon. As for the cost… that is difficult to estimate without knowing the specific tests your insurance would cover. Since you are uninsured, the price will vary depending on the lab. I can give you a referral to a local lab that offers a discount for self-pay patients. I can also provide a printout with a list of resources for financial assistance with medical bills. I'm afraid I cannot give you a precise figure at this time. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay, a discount lab and financial assistance… that’s helpful, thank you. No, I don’t think that’s all for now. I guess I’ll just wait for the call. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. I really appreciate you taking the time to see me, Doctor. I know you're busy. I’ll be on my way then. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. McKinnon. We'll be in touch. .
