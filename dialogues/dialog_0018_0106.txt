DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about my foot. This…sore. Been bothering me for weeks now. It just won't heal. And frankly, I’ve seen enough doctors in my life to know when something’s not right. It's not just a little scrape, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cannington. It's perfectly reasonable to seek another opinion when you're concerned about something that isn’t improving as it should. And you’re right to trust your instincts after having seen many doctors over the years. Could you tell me a little more about this sore on your foot?
PATIENT: It's on the bottom of my left foot, near my heel. Red, and…well, it's open. It gets pus sometimes, and it hurts when I walk. I try to keep it covered, but the bandages stick, and then it pulls when I take them off. Honestly, it's a whole ordeal. And the smell…don't even get me started on the smell. I’ve been using that cream my previous doctor gave me, the one with the…sulfas, I think it was? Didn't do much good.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Ms. Cannington. It sounds quite bothersome, and I appreciate you sharing all of that. The pus and the odor are certainly concerning, and the fact that the cream wasn’t effective is important information. Just to be thorough, could you tell me when you first noticed this sore?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It must have been… around the end of June, maybe the first week of July. I was walking barefoot in the garden, tending to my hibiscus, and I stepped on something. Didn’t think much of it at the time, just a little prick. Then it started to get red, and swollen. It just…kept getting worse. I really should have come in sooner, but I always try to manage things myself. I don’t like bothering people.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to manage things yourself, Ms. Cannington, but you did the right thing coming in now. It's good to know it started after stepping on something in the garden around the end of June or beginning of July. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sore?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my leg has been a little…tingly sometimes. Not all the time, just off and on. And I've been feeling more tired than usual, though at my age, who isn't tired? It’s hard to say if that's related. And my vision... it's been a bit blurry lately, but I’ve been needing new glasses for a while now, so probably just that. No fever or anything like that. Just the sore, the tingling, and general…oldness.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Cannington. The tingling in your leg is good to note, and we'll take everything into consideration. It’s important to differentiate what may be related to the sore and what’s perhaps age-related. Now, do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've had all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. Though I do avoid shellfish. Gives me terrible indigestion. But a true allergy? No. I used to take penicillin when I was younger, and that was fine. I've had reactions to some of the local plants in the Marshall Islands, but that was just a rash. Nothing serious. Honestly, I have a pretty strong constitution. Most things don’t bother me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Cannington. And thank you for clarifying about the shellfish and the reactions to the plants; it’s helpful information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… Just the little white pill for my blood pressure. The doctor gave it to me a few years back. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it’s really acting up. Ibuprofen, I think it is. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills. They just mess you up in the long run. And I don't believe in all those fancy supplements. Just a waste of money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. So, you take a medication for your blood pressure and ibuprofen occasionally for arthritis. That's good to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, that. Yes, well, it runs in the family. They told me about ten years ago, maybe a little longer. I try to watch my sugar, but it's hard. I like my fruit. The doctor put me on something for it, but I stopped taking it. Made me feel…sluggish. I try to control it with diet, mostly. Though I admit, I haven't been very good lately. This foot trouble… it's probably related to that, isn't it? I knew I should have been more careful.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so forthcoming, Ms. Cannington. It's helpful to know about the diabetes diagnosis and that you stopped taking the medication. You are right to suspect a connection between that and your foot trouble. Diabetes can sometimes cause circulation problems and make it harder for wounds to heal. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Years ago, when I was still living in the Marshall Islands, I had my appendix taken out. A simple operation, really. And I had a hysterectomy when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Nothing else, not that I can recall. Oh, and I had a cataract removed from my left eye a few years back. But that wasn't really surgery, was it? Just a little…procedure. Mostly just poking around. Nothing major. I’ve always been quite healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. So, you've had your appendix removed, a hysterectomy, and a cataract removed. That's good to know. Now, can you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had heart trouble. Passed away when she was in her seventies. And my father… he had something with his lungs, I think. Emphysema, maybe? He smoked all his life, poor man. And several of my siblings have diabetes, just like me. And arthritis, too. Seems to run in the family, that one. It’s a terrible thing, arthritis. Makes you feel so old and creaky. Honestly, my family… we weren't exactly known for our good health. Mostly a long line of aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. That's helpful to know about the family history of heart trouble, lung issues, diabetes and arthritis. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I mostly keep to myself. I live in a small house, have a garden I tend to. I don’t get out much anymore. Too much trouble. I used to be very active, traveled all over with my husband when he was in the military. But that was a long time ago. Now I mostly read, watch television, and try to stay out of the sun. I don’t drink or smoke, never have. I try to eat healthy, but like I said, I have a sweet tooth. It's a simple life, really. Nothing exciting. Mostly just…existing.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. That gives me a good understanding of your lifestyle. Now, if you’ll allow me, I’d like to take a look at your foot. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s not a pretty sight. Be warned. I’ve tried to keep it clean, but… it’s not easy. And don't expect me to be graceful about this. These old bones don't bend like they used to. There. Happy now? It's quite the mess, you see. Don’t tell me you haven’t seen worse, though. I've worked in hospitals, you know. I’ve seen things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. I appreciate you letting me examine it. And you’re right, it’s not ideal, but I assure you, I’ve seen many wounds, and I’m not easily surprised. Okay, Ms. Cannington, I see a significant amount of redness and swelling around the sore. There is some pus present, which indicates an infection. Your pulses are present, which is good, but they are a bit diminished compared to your other foot. The tissue around the wound is warm to the touch and tender. It appears to be located on the plantar aspect of your left foot, near the heel. Do you feel any numbness or tingling in your toes?
PATIENT: Ouch! Careful now! Yes, it’s tender. Very tender. And yes, there is a bit of tingling in my toes. Not all the time, just off and on. Especially when I’ve been walking. It feels… prickly. Like pins and needles. And it’s warm, you’re right. Too warm, if you ask me. Like a fever. Honestly, it’s not surprising it's infected. It’s been so long, and it's been so… neglected. I should have come in sooner. But what's done is done, I suppose. What do you think it is, Doctor? Is it serious? Don't sugarcoat it, I want the truth.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. I understand your concern, and I appreciate your honesty. The tingling sensation and warmth are certainly points of concern, especially given your history of diabetes. Based on my examination, it appears you have a foot ulcer that is complicated by an infection, likely cellulitis. The diminished pulses are also concerning, as they could indicate poor circulation, which is common in patients with diabetes. To get a clearer picture of the extent of the infection and to rule out any deeper involvement, I would like to order some laboratory tests. Specifically, I would like to check your blood sugar level, a complete blood count to assess for infection, and an Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate and C-Reactive Protein to measure inflammation. I also recommend obtaining a wound culture to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Tests, tests, always tests. Honestly, at my age, what’s the point? But… fine. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose it can’t hurt. Just get it over with quickly, please. I don’t like being poked and prodded. And explain everything to me afterwards, in plain English. No medical jargon, understand? I want to know what's going on, and what we’re going to do about it. And don’t tell me it's nothing serious if it isn’t. I can handle the truth. Now, where do we go from here? And how long will these tests take? I have a bridge game tomorrow, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cannington, and I assure you, I will explain everything in plain English. We will proceed as efficiently as possible. The tests I’ve ordered will involve a simple blood draw, which should only take a few minutes. The wound culture will involve gently swabbing the sore to collect a sample. Both tests can be performed here in the clinic, and the results should be available within a few days, typically 24 to 48 hours. While we await the results, I recommend keeping your foot elevated as much as possible to reduce swelling, keeping it clean and dry, and avoiding putting any weight on it. We will also need to address the infection. Depending on the severity, this may involve oral antibiotics. We'll discuss the best course of action once we have the lab results. I also want to emphasize the importance of controlling your blood sugar level. High blood sugar can impair your body’s ability to heal and can worsen the infection. Now, do you have any allergies to antibiotics?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… Let me see. I think I had a reaction to penicillin when I was younger. Made me break out in a rash. Not a severe reaction, but uncomfortable nonetheless. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. I’ve had so many medications over the years, it’s hard to keep track. But definitely penicillin. And please, not one of those bitter ones. They upset my stomach terribly. I’m a sensitive woman, you know. What happens if these tests show something… serious? Will I have to go to the hospital? I really don’t want to go to the hospital. It’s full of germs, and the food is awful.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know about the penicillin allergy, Ms. Cannington. We will certainly avoid that medication. And I understand your concerns about a potentially serious diagnosis and the prospect of hospitalization. If the lab results indicate a deep tissue infection or osteomyelitis , hospitalization may be necessary for intravenous antibiotics and potentially surgical debridement . However, let’s not jump to conclusions. The majority of foot ulcers can be successfully treated with oral antibiotics and proper wound care. For now, let's focus on obtaining the lab results and developing a treatment plan based on those findings. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to avoid hospitalization if possible. To reiterate, I'm ordering a complete blood count, blood sugar level, ESR, CRP, and a wound culture. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… hurry it up, please. I have a life to get back to, you know. And make sure the nurse is gentle. I don’t like needles. And explain everything to me afterwards. I want to know what these tests are for, and what the results mean. In plain English, remember? No medical jargon. Honestly, doctors these days… always running tests and talking in circles. Just tell me what’s wrong, and what we’re going to do about it. That’s all I ask. And make sure this nurse knows about my penicillin allergy. I don’t want another rash. Now, go get the nurse. I’m ready to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cannington. I will personally inform the nurse of your penicillin allergy and ensure she explains the purpose of each test clearly. I will also be back to discuss the results as soon as they are available. Nurse Miller, could you please come in and assist Ms. Cannington with some blood work?
PATIENT: .
