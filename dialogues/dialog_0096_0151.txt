DOCTOR: Alright then, Mrs. Uzarski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Burlingham, is it? Yes, well, it’s this tingling. In my hands, mostly. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, I don't even know how long now. A few weeks, maybe? It's just… annoying, really. Feels like pins and needles, you know?
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. Hmm. And is it constant, this tingling?
PATIENT: No, no, not constant. It comes and goes. More when I’m… well, when I’m working, mostly. Delivering the mail. It's a lot of sorting, you know? And holding things... Not all the time though, thankfully. Sometimes it’s just there, even when I’m resting. It’s just… strange. I haven’t done anything to cause it, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Delivering the mail, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, with the Postal Service. Been doing it for… oh, close to thirty years now. It's good work, keeps me moving, usually. But this tingling… it makes me worry. Especially with my hands, you know? Need them for everything. It hasn’t gotten worse worse, but it's definitely not going away on its own.
DOCTOR: Thirty years is a long time to be on your feet. And you haven't noticed any weakness in your hands at all?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. That’s a good question. No, I don’t think so. I can still sort the mail, and I can still carry the bags… they’re not getting any lighter, I’ll tell you that! But sometimes… sometimes I drop things. Not often, and I just figured it was because I was tired. Old age creeping in, you know? It could be that, right? It just feels… clumsy sometimes. Is that weakness? I don't really know.
DOCTOR: Clumsiness can be a sign, yes. Alright. Now, have you noticed this tingling anywhere else besides your hands?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. Sometimes it goes up my arms, a little bit. Not as bad as in my hands, but definitely… a sort of numbness. And… now that you mention it, I’ve felt it in my feet a couple of times too. Just the tops of my feet, and it doesn’t last long. It’s all a bit…scattered, really. Not all at once, you understand. It moves around. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It's… fragmented, you say. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… changed? Let me think. Not really, no. Same routine, same everything. My husband passed away about five years ago, so things are… quiet. No new medications, no new hobbies… oh! Well, my daughter gave me a new chair for the kitchen, a hard one. But I’ve had it for a couple of months now, and I don’t think that's it. Everything else is… just the same. It's been a warm summer though. Maybe it's the heat? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s have a quick look at your hands and feet, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. I’m not much for doctors, to be honest. But I appreciate you seeing me. I just want to get to the bottom of this tingling, you know? It's unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now your feet. Please, if you could just extend your leg... Hmm. Your reflexes seem a little diminished, but not drastically so. Do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, goodness, no. Never. My mother had high blood pressure, but not diabetes. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Lots of soup, you know? And vegetables from the garden when they’re in season. This poking and prodding… it’s not the most comfortable, is it? But I’m glad you’re checking everything. Just tell me what you think is going on.
DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Uzarski, given your symptoms—the tingling, the numbness, the fragmented sensations—and your physical examination findings, it could be peripheral neuropathy. It’s common, especially as we get older. It's damage to the nerves. Now, there are a lot of possible causes. Vitamin deficiencies, certain medications... sometimes it just happens. However, since your reflexes are diminished, we’ll want to rule out a few other things. I'm going to order some bloodwork—a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a vitamin B12 level. And I'd like to do an EMG – electromyography – that’s a nerve conduction study, just to be sure.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All that… bloodwork and a… EMG? Is that… serious? I just thought it was maybe a pinched nerve or something. Damage to the nerves… that sounds scary. Will I be able to keep working? Delivering the mail is… well, it's all I do, really. What exactly causes this… neuropathy? And is there anything I can do now, before the tests, to make it better?
DOCTOR: Now, now, don’t get yourself worked up. It's not necessarily serious. Many people have neuropathy and live perfectly normal lives. The tests are just to determine the cause. As for the cause… it could be a number of things. Sometimes it's simply age-related, sometimes it’s a vitamin deficiency, sometimes it's a side effect of a medication… Or, rarely, it could indicate a more serious underlying condition, which is why we need to investigate. As for now… try to avoid repetitive movements as much as possible. Don’t push yourself too hard with the mail route. And I'll have the nurse give you some information about Vitamin B12 rich foods. If it is a vitamin deficiency, that might help. We'll see what the tests reveal, then we'll discuss further treatment options. Don't worry too much, alright?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, I understand. No pushing myself… and I’ll try to eat more… what was it? B12? It just feels like so much, you know? All these tests… and waiting for the results. Do you think it could just be… this hot weather? It’s been so humid. Maybe that’s all it is? Is there anything else I should be doing? Any creams or something I can rub on my hands?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Uzarski, while the heat could exacerbate the symptoms, it’s unlikely to be the sole cause. We need to rule out more serious possibilities first. As for creams… there are some topical analgesics you can try for temporary relief, but they won't address the underlying problem. I'll write you a prescription for a lidocaine cream. However, don't expect a miracle. The nurse will go over the bloodwork requisition with you, and schedule the EMG. And really, the best thing you can do right now is rest and try not to stress. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… rest, and not stress. Easier said than done, I suppose. Thank you, Doctor Burlingham. I appreciate you seeing me. I just hope it's nothing too serious. I suppose I'll wait for the nurse, then.
