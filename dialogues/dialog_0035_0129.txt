DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Dawnetta. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's probably nothing, but my husband made me come. He worries too much. It’s my… well, my stool. It’s been black. Like, really dark. And I take those pills for my arthritis, the red ones… every day. Been taking them for years, mind you. Not a new thing. But he read something online and got all worked up.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your husband is concerned about the change in your stool color – it’s black, and you’ve noticed this recently?
PATIENT: “Recently”? Goodness, no. It’s come and gone for…oh, I don’t know, maybe a year? Like I said, I take those arthritis pills, the naproxen, every single day. Always have. My mother took them, too, before she… well, never you mind. Point is, it's not new. He just finally decided to bother a doctor about it. Honestly, the fuss he makes...
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s been happening on and off for about a year, and you take naproxen daily for your arthritis. That’s helpful to know. Has anything else changed along with the stool color?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean, “changed”? My bowels are… bowels. They do what they do. I haven’t felt sick, not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t get tired? And I’ve been eating pretty much the same. Meat, potatoes, a bit of gravy… nothing fancy. He keeps asking if I’ve noticed any blood, but there hasn’t been any. Honestly, it feels like he's trying to find something wrong with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits other than the color, no blood in the stool, and you haven't felt generally unwell. And you’ve been eating your usual diet. Let's talk about the naproxen for a moment. Do you take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Just the naproxen. And a little bit of calcium for my bones, but that's it. My doctor – Dr. Hemlock, back in Cedar Creek – he said calcium was important. Nothing else. I don't go for all those fancy vitamins. Waste of money, if you ask me. And I definitely don't "supplement" anything. I eat my dinner!
DOCTOR: Alright, just naproxen and calcium. And no changes to either of those recently?
PATIENT: No! Goodness, no. I take the same pills, same dose, every day. Don’t go changing things just for the sake of it, that’s what I always say. And the calcium is just a couple of those little horse-pills with my breakfast. It’s been years, I tell ya, years! He really is making a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dawnetta. I appreciate you clarifying all of that. It sounds like this has been ongoing for quite some time, and you haven't noticed any other concerning symptoms. Black stool can indicate bleeding in the digestive tract, which is why your husband is rightly concerned, and why we need to investigate. However, it can also be caused by certain medications, like iron supplements, or even certain foods. Since you’re taking naproxen regularly, that’s something we need to consider. I’d like to do a quick physical exam and then order a simple blood test to check your hemoglobin and iron levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: “Investigate”? Oh, for heaven’s sake. Look, I’m telling you, it’s the pills. My mother took those pills, and she… well, she was fine, mostly. And I haven't been feeling sick, you know? But fine, fine. If you have to poke and prod… I suppose so. But don't you go finding something awful. I’ve got a garden to tend. And frankly, I don't have time for a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. I'll listen to your abdomen, check your pulse, and just take a quick look at your overall condition. This will only take a few minutes. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any obvious masses or tenderness. Your bowel sounds are normal. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m going to order those blood tests. They’ll give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you be comfortable with me drawing the blood here in the office, or would you prefer to go to a lab?
PATIENT: Oh, please don't make me go to a lab. I hate those places. All that sterile smell and people poking around… If you can do it here, do it here. The quicker this is over, the better. Just don’t stick me too many times, alright? I bruise easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Dawnetta. We can definitely do it here in the office. And I promise to be very careful. We'll only need a small sample, and I'll be as gentle as possible to avoid bruising. Okay, if you'll just roll up your sleeve... We'll check your hemoglobin and iron levels, and I’ll also add a basic metabolic panel just to get a broader picture of your health. This will give us some information to work with. While the blood is processing, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I eat pretty much everything. Never been one to fuss about food. And I haven’t taken any new medicines in…well, since Dr. Hemlock put me on the naproxen, years ago. Now, are you sure you don’t think it’s just the pills? My husband… he worries too much. Always has.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. Just keep this pressure on for a few minutes. And I understand your concerns, Dawnetta. It's good your husband is looking out for you. While the naproxen can cause black stool, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. We need to be thorough. The lab results should be back within a couple of days. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you notice any significant changes – like severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or bright red blood in your stool – please call us immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have tomatoes that need pruning. And bright red blood, you say? Oh, for goodness sake. This is all so dramatic. Two days, you say? Very well. Just call if it's important, don't bother me with nonsense. Honestly, the fuss…
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Please don't hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good afternoon, and enjoy your gardening.
