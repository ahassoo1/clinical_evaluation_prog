DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it’s… bothersome. My wife, she keeps saying I ask the same questions over and over. And sometimes… I just feel lost. Like I’m not quite here, you know? It’s not all the time, thankfully, but enough to worry her, and frankly, to worry me a little. It's just... confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. Repetitive questioning and feelings of disorientation can certainly be unsettling. It’s good that your wife is observant and you’re addressing this. To get a clearer picture, let’s delve a bit deeper. When did you first start noticing these episodes of asking repeated questions or feeling… “not quite here,” as you put it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... it’s been… probably six, maybe eight months now? It started slowly. Just little things. Asking where I put my glasses when they were on my head, that sort of thing. But it's gotten more frequent, definitely. And the… the lost feeling? That started more recently, maybe three months ago. It's hard to pinpoint, you know? Time just… slips away sometimes. I’m usually very good with dates, always have been, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Very good. So, approximately six to eight months for the repetitive questioning, and three months for the feelings of disorientation. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm. That’s a good question. Not that I’ve noticed, really. It doesn't seem to happen after anything specific. Sometimes it's when I'm tired, maybe. Or if I’m… distracted. But even then, not always. My wife says it sometimes happens when we’re talking about… well, about the family. The kids, the grandkids. She thinks it’s when I’m trying to remember things about them. Which is… well, it's a little insulting, if I'm honest. I do remember my family. Mostly.
DOCTOR: I see. So, potential association with fatigue or distraction, and your wife notes it may be more pronounced when recalling family history. We will certainly consider all of this. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, let's see... I had my prostate taken out, years ago. That was… unpleasant. And I’ve got a touch of arthritis in my knees, that's why I walk a bit slow sometimes. Other than that, not much. I take a little something for the knees, but that’s it. Blood pressure’s usually fine, the doctor at home checks it every year. I don’t have any of this… sugar sickness, or heart trouble. Never have. I eat pretty well, mostly rice and fish. And plenty of vegetables. My wife makes sure of that. She's very health-conscious, always has been.
DOCTOR: Prostatectomy, and arthritis in the knees. Excellent. And no history of diabetes or heart disease. Now, are you currently taking any medications for your arthritis, or any other condition for that matter?
PATIENT: Just the one, for the knees. It's… let me see... Ibuprofen, I think. A small dose, every day. It helps with the pain, mostly. And sometimes, if I’m really hurting, I take an extra one. My wife keeps track of it all, of course. She makes sure I don't take too much. She’s very good with… dosages. I’m terrible at remembering those things, honestly. And I don’t take anything else. Not even vitamins. I always thought those were a waste of money.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, as needed, for knee arthritis. Alright. Now, let’s discuss allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had one. I've eaten everything, traveled everywhere. My wife always worries about that when we go to new restaurants, but I'm always fine. I’ve got a strong stomach, thankfully. Never had a reaction to anything. Not even mosquito bites, and we get plenty of those here. Honestly, I think she worries more about me than I do about myself. Which is… nice, I suppose. But a little unnecessary, sometimes.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Very good. Now, Mr. Lason, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any instances of memory loss or dementia in your family – parents, siblings, aunts, uncles?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a tricky one. My mother… she wasn’t quite herself towards the end. She’d forget things, repeat herself… but we just thought it was old age. She lived a long life, you know? Ninety-two. And my father… he was always a bit… absent-minded. But again, we just chalked it up to his personality. He was a scholar, always lost in his books. No one ever talked about… anything serious. Not like what you’re asking about, anyway. My wife might know more, she remembers these things better than I do. She's got a very good memory for family history.
DOCTOR: Alright. Possible family history of age-related cognitive decline, but no definitive diagnosis. Now, to get a more complete picture, I'd like to perform a brief physical and neurological examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical? Well… alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have a lunch appointment with my wife later, you know. We're meeting the grandkids. And I wouldn't want to miss that. Just… be gentle, Doctor. My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. We'll take things slowly and gently. First, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 138 over 82, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Finally, I’d like to do a very brief cognitive assessment – just a few simple questions to assess your memory and orientation. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Questions, then. As long as it's not too complicated. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a perfectly capable man. I just forget things sometimes, that's all. It doesn't mean my brain is… failing. But go ahead. Let’s get it over with. I have a very important lunch date, you know. The grandkids are expecting me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. Just a few simple questions. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… Hmm. August… August… Is it the 1st? No, no, that was yesterday. It must be the… the 2nd? Yes, the 2nd of August. 2025, of course. I always keep track of the date. Mostly. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Very good. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: City… Well, that's an easy one. We're in… this is… Is it… Riverside? No, that can’t be right. We live near Riverside, but we're not in Riverside. This is… Honestly, Doctor, I know what city I'm in. I just… it's on the tip of my tongue. It's… it’s a big city, a very busy city. Why are you asking me these silly questions?
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, it is alright. These questions are simply to help me get a better understanding of your current cognitive function. I assure you, it's nothing to be concerned about. Do you recall where you were born?
PATIENT: Now you're asking about my birthplace? Really, Doctor? Is this some sort of test? I was born in… Cambodia, of course. Phnom Penh. It was a very different place then. A beautiful city, but… troubled. I left a long time ago, you know. A very long time ago. Is that what you wanted to know? Honestly, I'm starting to feel rather foolish.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you for your patience. Based on our conversation and this brief assessment, it appears you are experiencing some difficulty with recall, specifically with recent memory and orientation. This, combined with your wife’s observations, warrants further investigation. I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. I would also like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Blood work? Honestly, Doctor, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. I just forget things sometimes. It doesn't mean I'm… sick. My wife worries too much, and now you're joining her! But… alright. Fine. If it will appease her, I'll do the blood work. And I suppose I can see a neurologist. But I expect a full explanation, Doctor. And I expect it to be quick. I have a life, you know. I don't have time to spend running around to doctors all day. And please, tell me exactly what you're looking for. I want to know what's going on. I don't like being kept in the dark.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. I understand your concerns, and I assure you we will proceed with all due speed and transparency. The blood work will help us rule out any reversible causes for your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, or thyroid problems. The neurologist will conduct a more in-depth assessment of your cognitive function, including memory, language, and problem-solving skills. This will help determine the underlying cause of your difficulties and guide appropriate treatment, if necessary. I will provide you with a list of labs and a referral to a reputable neurologist in the area. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. What… what if it is something serious? What if it's… you know… what my mother had? I don’t want to end up like her. Losing my mind, forgetting everything… What will happen then? Will I still… will I still be me? I need to know. Be honest with me, Doctor. Don’t sugarcoat it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, it is understandable to be anxious about these possibilities. However, it is important to remember that we do not have enough information yet to make any definitive conclusions. Many things can cause memory difficulties, and not all of them are serious. Even if it were to be something like dementia, there are treatments and therapies available to help manage the symptoms and maintain your quality of life. Furthermore, early detection is key. The sooner we identify the cause, the sooner we can start appropriate interventions. If, after further evaluation, a diagnosis of dementia were to be made, it doesn't necessarily mean losing you. It means adapting to changes, utilizing strategies to compensate for memory loss, and focusing on maintaining your strengths and enjoying the present moment. There is support available for both you and your family to navigate this process. We will take this one step at a time, Mr. Lason. Let's focus on getting the blood work done and seeing the neurologist. Then, we will have a clearer picture and can discuss the best course of action. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Alright. One step at a time, you say. I suppose that's all I can do. Just… please, Doctor. Don't keep me waiting for the results. And make sure the neurologist is someone… someone who understands. Someone who won’t just look at me like I'm… fading away. I need someone who will listen. That’s all I ask. Very well. Let's get this over with. I have a lunch date to get to. The grandkids are expecting me. And I don’t want to forget why.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. I understand completely. I will personally ensure you receive prompt attention and a referral to an excellent neurologist known for their compassionate care. Here are the lab orders and the referral information. My staff will assist you with scheduling the appointments. Please do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you a pleasant lunch with your grandchildren. .
