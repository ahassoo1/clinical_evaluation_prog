DOCTOR: Hi Deloris, welcome to the clinic. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s…well, it’s about a letter. A letter for my…pet. Yes, a pet ownership letter, that’s right. Something about needing it for…somewhere. Honestly, all this paperwork these days! It’s a bit much, don’t you think? I just need it signed, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: A pet ownership letter, okay. That's no problem at all, we can definitely get that sorted for you. Just to be sure I have everything right, what kind of pet do you have, and where will you be needing this letter for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A pet…right. It’s a dog. A small one. A fluffy one. Honestly, I can’t quite remember the breed… a little terrier, maybe? It was…a gift. From my ex, I think. As for where I need the letter… hmm. It's for…the building. Yes, the new building I’m moving into. They have rules, you see. Lots of rules. About pets. It's very…modern. Is that enough information? I’m terrible with details, I really am.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small, fluffy terrier-type dog, and you need the letter for your new apartment building due to their pet policies. No problem at all. Just to confirm for the letter, can you tell me the dog’s name and approximately how old they are?
PATIENT: Oh, the name…that’s a tricky one. Let me think… it’s…a people name, I think. Something common. Margaret? No, that doesn’t sound right. Matilda! Yes, Matilda. That’s it. And how old… honestly, she’s not a puppy anymore, but she’s not old old. Maybe… five? Six? Somewhere around there. I really haven’t kept track, you see. She just… is. It's hard to believe she’s been with me this long, already.
DOCTOR: Matilda, that’s a lovely name! And five or six years old, okay. That’s helpful. Before I finalize the letter, just a few quick questions—routine, you understand—to make sure everything is in order. Have you had any recent vet visits for Matilda?
PATIENT: Vet visits? Oh dear… I… honestly, no. Not recently. She seems perfectly healthy, you know? She eats, she sleeps, she barks at the postman. What more does a dog need? I suppose I should take her, but it’s such a hassle, and she hates the car. And frankly, the vet bills are outrageous these days! Is it necessary? I mean, she’s perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and it’s good that she seems healthy. However, many apartment buildings require proof of a recent vet checkup to ensure the pet is up-to-date on vaccinations and free of any contagious diseases, even if she appears healthy. It’s really for the safety of all the residents and their pets. Would you be open to scheduling a quick check-up for Matilda here at the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More paperwork? And a check-up? Honestly, it sounds like a whole ordeal. I just want the letter, you see. I didn’t realize it would be so… complicated. Is there… any way around it? Perhaps if I just told them she’s been vaccinated? I’m sure they’ll understand. I’m a perfectly responsible pet owner, even if I don’t have all the… documents. It's just a letter, after all!
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Deloris. And I appreciate you being a responsible pet owner—that’s the most important thing. Unfortunately, I can’t ethically provide a letter stating Matilda is vaccinated without a vet's confirmation. It would be a misrepresentation of her health record, and could potentially cause issues for the building and other residents. It doesn't have to be a huge ordeal, though. We could just do a quick exam—check her weight, listen to her heart, make sure she’s not showing any signs of illness. It wouldn’t take long, and it would give you peace of mind, too, knowing she’s in good health. What do you think?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly, it's just a waste of money, isn't it? But… if you insist. Fine. A quick exam, you said? Just a quick one? And I suppose it would be nice to know she’s alright. But I expect a reasonable price, mind you. I'm not made of money, you know. And no unnecessary tests! Just a quick look-over. That’s all. Really. Do you have an appointment slot available today? Because I really don’t want to have to come back.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A quick exam is all we’ll do. No unnecessary tests, I promise. And we'll definitely discuss the cost upfront, so there are no surprises. Let me see… Yes, I have a slot open in about an hour. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: An hour…hmm. Yes, that should do. As long as it doesn't take too long. Honestly, I have things to do, you know? Shopping. And… well, other things. Is there any paperwork I need to fill out before then? Or can I just… bring her in? I really hate forms. They always ask for my mother’s maiden name… it’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No need to worry about forms right now. We can handle all the paperwork here. Just bring Matilda in, and we'll get started. It shouldn’t take long at all. Perhaps while we’re waiting, I can get a better idea of her diet and exercise routine?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. Well, her diet is…dog food. The expensive kind, of course. I want her to have the best. And exercise? She walks around the apartment. And… chases dust bunnies. She’s very active for her age, honestly. She's a little princess, that Matilda is. A little spoiled, perhaps. Now, are you sure there isn't anything I need to do before we start? I just don’t want any surprises, you know. I have a very sensitive constitution.
DOCTOR: No surprises, I promise. Just bring Matilda, and we’ll take good care of her. We'll just discuss her routine during the exam. In the meantime, can you tell me if Matilda has any known allergies or sensitivities?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Honestly, I’ve never really paid attention. She seems to eat anything. Though… she does get a bit itchy sometimes, especially after I vacuum. But that's probably just the dust, isn’t it? She hates the vacuum. Absolutely loathes it. I have to hide when I use it, honestly. She gets very upset. Is it important? Because I really can’t remember if she’s ever had a serious allergic reaction. It's all a bit of a blur, you see.
DOCTOR: It's good to know she gets itchy after vacuuming. That could indicate a mild sensitivity to dust mites or the cleaning products used. We’ll take a closer look at her skin during the exam, just to be safe. Alright, then. Let’s get Matilda checked out. I’ll have the exam room ready for you. If you'll follow me this way…
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Let’s get it over with, then. Honestly, all this fuss for a perfectly healthy dog! But… I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. Lead the way. Just… try not to take too long, alright? I have a luncheon planned, you see. With… friends. Important friends.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll be as quick as possible. And I assure you, we'll do our best to make Matilda comfortable. Here we are. Just have a seat, and we’ll get started when you’re ready.
