DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Yeah, it's nice to meet you too, I guess. My nails. They just... look funny. Not good funny. They changed. That's why I'm here. I don't really do doctors much, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright to not be a frequent visitor to the doctor. We'll take things at your pace. When you say they “changed,” could you describe what you’ve noticed about your nails?
PATIENT: Ugh, it's hard to explain. Like... the color. They're not pink anymore, not really. More... yellowish. And kinda thick, I think. I don't paint them or anything, so it's not that. Just... changed. It's been going on for a while, I don't know, maybe months? I don't keep track of things like that. Does that make sense? It's just...wrong.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Yellowish discoloration and thickening… And is this happening on all of your nails, or just some of them?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Hmm... I think... most of them? Yeah, pretty sure it's most of them. Not every single one, but like, the big ones on my hands, mostly. And maybe some on my feet, I haven't really looked closely at my feet. I wear socks a lot. Don’t really want to look at my feet, if I’m honest. They're feet, you know?
DOCTOR: I completely understand. Feet aren't always the most glamorous topic! Okay, so mostly the fingernails, with a possibility on some toenails. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with the nails?
PATIENT: Nah, no pain. Not really. Maybe a little… awkward, when I try to cut them? They're harder to cut now, that's all. Like I said, they're thicker. It's not hurtin' me, just… annoying. I used to be able to clip 'em easy. It’s just a little thing, really. I probably shouldn't be botherin’ you with this.
DOCTOR: It's good you came in, Ms. Thut. Even small changes can sometimes indicate something we should look into. And you are absolutely not bothering me. Now, let me ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any other skin changes recently – any rashes, itching, or new moles?
PATIENT: Ugh, skin stuff. Let me think... Nope. Not that I've noticed. I mean, I get dry skin in the winter, but that's normal, you know? Old lady problems. No rashes, no bumps, no nothin'. Just the nails. And the dry skin. That's it. I use lotion, though. A good one. Don't really need anything else. I'm pretty good at takin' care of myself, usually.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And lotion is a great habit to have. Now, thinking about your medical history – do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Uhhh... medical history. I don't really… have a medical history. I haven't been sick much. Maybe a cold now and then. I mean, I had a baby a long time ago, but that was normal. And my back hurts sometimes, but that's just… getting old. I don't really go to the doctor, remember? So, no, nothin' really. I don't think. Is that bad? Should I have a medical history?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright if you don't have a long medical history, Ms. Thut. It just helps me get a complete picture. And no, you don’t need a long one! Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Not even for the baby. Everything was fine, quick and easy. Just… the baby. And then I went home. No hospitals, no cuttin' me open, nothin' like that. I'm a pretty healthy person, usually. I eat okay, I sleep okay… mostly. I don't smoke, I don't drink much… just a little wine sometimes. See? Healthy. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That's very good to know. And it sounds like you have a healthy lifestyle overall. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ugh, family. My mom... she had bad knees. Real bad. Always complainin' about 'em. And my uncle, he had… somethin' with his heart, I think? But he didn't take care of himself. Smoked like a chimney, drank all the time. Not like me. I don't really keep up with all that family stuff. It's… complicated. So, yeah, bad knees and a bad heart. That's all I really know. Honestly. It’s not like we all sit around talkin' about our health problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Bad knees and a possible heart condition in the family. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Uhh… let me think. Just… a multivitamin sometimes. You know, one of those old lady ones. Helps with the… you know. Everything. And… sometimes I take something for my back, when it really hurts. But not every day. Just when I need it. It's… a little blue pill. I don't remember the name. It was the doctor’s recommendation a long time ago. That's it, I think. That's really it. Nothing fancy. I don't like takin' pills much, if I can help it. They make me feel weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and a blue pill for back pain when needed. Now, Ms. Thut, I think I have a good understanding of your overall health. I’m going to examine your nails now, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve a quick look at them, and I might ask you a few questions while I’m doing so. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Look at 'em. Whatever. They're ugly, I know. Just get it over with. I have things to do, you know? Not a lot of things, but… things. Just hurry up, if you could. I don't want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick as possible. Okay, I’m looking at some thickening and discoloration, as you mentioned. It appears to be affecting most of your fingernails. There's also some slight pitting on a few of them – those are small, shallow depressions. Is this something you've noticed before, or is the pitting new?
PATIENT: Pitting? What's pitting? I don't know nothin’ about pitting! I just know they look bad. Maybe it was always there? I don’t stare at my nails all day, you know. They’ve been lookin’ funny for a while, like I said. Thick and yellow and… wrong. Is it somethin’ bad? Don't tell me it's somethin' serious. I don't do serious.
DOCTOR: It’s very small, Ms. Thut, these little indentations. You're right, it’s not something you'd necessarily notice right away. And I understand your concern. It’s good you came in to get this checked out. Based on what I'm seeing, this could be a fungal infection of the nails, also known as onychomycosis. It’s quite common. The thickening, discoloration, and pitting are all consistent with that. However, to be sure, we need to do a quick test to confirm. Would you be okay with me taking a small clipping from one of your nails to send to the lab?
PATIENT: Fungus? Like… in my nails? That sounds disgusting! No! No fungus! I keep my hands clean. I wash 'em all the time. I don't want no fungus in my nails! Is it contagious? Will I get it on everything? I don’t want to give it to anyone. And I definitely don't want no clipping taken from my nails! That sounds painful. I don't like that at all. Can't you just tell me it's not fungus? Please?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Thut. It does sound unpleasant, and it’s natural to be worried. But please don’t worry, it’s not as scary as it sounds. It’s not like the kind of fungus you’d get in a dirty bathroom. This type of fungus is very common and often doesn’t cause any other symptoms. And it’s not highly contagious; it’s typically spread through close contact, and it’s unlikely to spread to others. As for the clipping, it’s a very small sample, and it’s not painful at all. It’s the best way to confirm the diagnosis and ensure we get you the right treatment. Without a diagnosis, we can’t be certain what’s causing the changes in your nails. However, if you're truly uncomfortable with the clipping, we can consider starting a topical antifungal treatment as a trial, but it may take several months to see results, and it may not be as effective without knowing for sure if it’s a fungal infection. Would you like me to explain the topical treatment option?
PATIENT: Topical… what? Months? No, no, no. I don't have months to waste on my nails! I just want this to go away. Okay, fine. You can clip a little bit. Just a little bit, you hear? And don't hurt me! And don't tell anyone. I don't want people knowin' I have… nail fungus. It's embarrassing! Just get it over with quickly, please. But if it hurts, I'm pullin' it away. Understand?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Thut. Just a small clipping, and I promise I’ll be very careful. It shouldn’t hurt at all. And of course, your privacy is very important to me. This information will remain confidential. Okay, all done. It was very quick, wasn't it?
PATIENT: Yeah, whatever. It wasn't too bad. Just get it sent away. And tell me when I can expect the results. I don't want to be waitin' forever. And what if it is fungus? What do I have to do? Do I have to take pills? I don't like pills, you know. Is there anything else I can do? Lotion? Special soap? Anything? Just tell me everything, quickly. I have things to do, remember?
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve labeled the sample, and it will be sent to the lab. You should receive the results within 7-10 business days. I’ll call you as soon as they come in. Now, if the results confirm it’s a fungal infection, the treatment options depend on the severity of the infection. For mild cases, topical antifungal medications are often sufficient. These are applied directly to the affected nails, usually daily for several months. As you mentioned, you're not a fan of pills, so we’ll start with the topical option if possible. For more severe cases, oral antifungal medications may be necessary, but we can discuss those options in detail if the topical treatment isn’t effective. As for other things you can do, keeping your nails short and dry can help prevent the fungus from spreading. You can also avoid sharing nail clippers and files. Unfortunately, lotion won’t directly treat the infection, but it can help keep your nails moisturized. I’ll also provide you with a list of over-the-counter antifungal products that you can try, but they’re often not as effective as prescription medications. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, so keep 'em short and dry. No sharin' clippers. And wait for the results. Sounds simple enough. I guess. That list of stuff… you can just give it to me. I'll look at it later. Probably. I don't have a lot of time for lookin' at lists. Just… call me when you know somethin'. And please, don't make me come back here if I don't need to. I really don't like comin' to the doctor. Is that it? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s it for today. I’ll be sure to call you as soon as the lab results are available. And I understand your dislike of coming to the doctor – I'll do my best to minimize any unnecessary visits. Thank you for coming in, Ms. Thut. I hope you have a good day.
PATIENT: Yeah, whatever. You too.
