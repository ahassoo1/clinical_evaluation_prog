DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Honestly, it's a bit silly, really. I just... well, I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “Get Well” or something cheerful. My daughter thinks I need… encouragement. She worries too much, you know? It's not like I'm sick sick. Just a little down, that’s all.
DOCTOR: A card, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a card! Is that so unusual? Honestly, doctors these days... all about pills and tests, never a kind word. My mother always said a nice thought could cure anything. Though, she wasn’t a doctor, of course. She was a sensible woman. Not like some people I know.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your… perspective, Ms. Micucci, my primary role is to address medical concerns. I am a physician, not a greeting card writer. However, it sounds as though you are experiencing some emotional distress, and that is something we can explore. Could you elaborate on what’s been making you feel “down”?
PATIENT: Emotional distress? Oh, don’t use fancy words with me. I'm just… bothered. My grandson started that new school, the one with all the… different children, and it’s just upsetting. He’s a good boy, a very good boy, and I worry about him being influenced. His mother says I shouldn't interfere, but she doesn't understand. It’s a grandmother's job to worry, isn't it? And honestly, the whole thing just feels… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes. Well, Ms. Micucci, with all due respect, worrying about your grandson’s social environment is not typically a matter for a medical consultation. It sounds as though you are experiencing anxiety related to a change in his life. While I understand your concerns as a grandmother, it’s important to differentiate between typical emotional responses and a clinical issue. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this anxiety – perhaps difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, or feelings of hopelessness?
PATIENT: Hopelessness? Goodness, no! I eat perfectly well, thank you very much. My dal bhat is always fresh. And I sleep just fine… well, I wake up once or twice, but that’s just because I’m checking on things, making sure everyone is alright. It’s not hopelessness. It's just… being a responsible person! Honestly, these questions are ridiculous. Do you even listen? I came for a card, not a life story evaluation.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I am attempting to ascertain whether your feelings are within a normal range, or if they are indicative of a more serious condition. Dismissing symptoms as simply “being a responsible person” is not conducive to proper medical care. Perhaps, instead of a card, we could discuss strategies for managing your anxieties. Have you ever considered speaking with a therapist?
PATIENT: A therapist? Oh, don't be absurd. I don't need someone to analyze me. I just want a little pick-me-up, a kind thought from someone respectable. You're a doctor, aren't you? Can’t you just… write something nice? It’s really quite simple. “Thinking of you,” or “Hope things get better,” anything would do! Honestly, this is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, with all due respect, I find your request rather… unusual. My time is valuable, and I have other patients who require legitimate medical attention. However, to address your… emotional state, and to avoid prolonging this consultation unnecessarily, I will ask one final question. Are you experiencing any thoughts of self-harm, or are you having difficulty with basic daily functions, such as eating or bathing?
PATIENT: Self-harm? Goodness gracious, no! What kind of a question is that? I bathe every morning, thank you very much. And I certainly wouldn’t harm myself! I'm a practical woman, I have things to do. This is utterly ridiculous. You are implying… well, I don't even want to know what you're implying! I just wanted a card. Honestly, the younger generation… no common sense, no kindness, just… questions.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I believe we have reached an impasse. It is clear that you do not perceive a medical need for my services, and I am not equipped to fulfill your request for a greeting card. Given your adamant refusal to discuss any potential underlying issues, and the fact that you are functioning independently, I see no clinical indication for further intervention. I will, however, document this consultation for clarity.
PATIENT: Well! That's just… rude. Absolutely rude. I came here seeking a little kindness, a little understanding, and all I get is a lecture and documentation? Honestly, the state of healthcare these days is appalling. Fine. Keep your documentation. I’ll just… go. And I will not be recommending your practice to anyone. Not a single soul. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Micucci. Have a good day. .
