DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Derasmo, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Nani Derasmo. Though, please, call me Nani if you prefer. I do hope this won’t take too long; I have a rather full afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, let’s try to be brief then. So, what brings you in today, Nani?
PATIENT: It’s…difficult to explain, truthfully. A general feeling of…heaviness, I suppose. Not physical, but…inside. I haven’t been feeling myself lately. And my daughter insisted I come. She worries too much, bless her heart. But it’s been going on for a while now, and I thought…well, I thought it best to get it checked.
DOCTOR: “Heaviness.” Right. And how long has this “heaviness” been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. Let me think… It started… maybe six or seven months ago? Around the time the weather really started to turn colder last year. It’s been…gradual, not sudden. It just sort of…settled in. I’ve been trying to push through it, you understand. I’m a very active woman, always have been. Ski patrol doesn’t allow for much moping, you see. But it’s…persistent.
DOCTOR: Ski patrol, hmm. And has this…heaviness…affected your ability to do your ski patrol work?
PATIENT: Yes, it has, actually. Not physically, mind you. I’m still strong enough for the work. But…my focus isn’t what it used to be. I find myself…distracted, easily. And…less enthusiastic, I suppose. It worries me, because I enjoy that work. Always have. And I don’t want to be…a liability. I've made a few…small errors in judgment lately, nothing major, thankfully. But enough to make me concerned.
DOCTOR: “Small errors in judgment.” Can you elaborate on those, please?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s nothing dramatic, truly. Just…forgetting to check equipment twice before a run, things like that. Or…misjudging a distance slightly when assessing a potential hazard. Small things, really. But things that could be bigger, you understand? I’ve been second-guessing myself more and more, which is…not like me at all. I pride myself on my quick thinking. It’s…frustrating, to say the least. And I'm starting to dread going to work, which is a horrible feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this “heaviness” and difficulty with focus?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I haven't been sleeping as well. I fall asleep alright, but I wake up several times during the night. And I rarely feel truly rested, even after a full eight hours. And…my appetite hasn't been great. I’m not losing weight, but I’m not enjoying my food the way I used to. Everything tastes…bland, somehow. And I find myself…withdrawing a bit. Not wanting to socialize as much. I used to love having friends over for tea, but now… I just prefer to be alone. Is that…relevant?
DOCTOR: Relevant. Possibly. Let’s go through some of the basics. Any history of…well, any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, but that was a standard procedure, nothing complicated. And I broke my wrist skiing a few years back, but it healed perfectly. Otherwise…no, nothing major. I’ve always been very healthy, very active. High blood pressure, the doctor said, a few years ago, but it’s been well-managed with medication. I take a small dose every day. That’s it, really. Nothing else to speak of. I've been quite fortunate, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Medication for high blood pressure…and nothing else?
PATIENT: That is correct. Just the medication for my blood pressure. A small, white pill. I take it every morning with my tea. I haven’t changed any medications recently, or started any new ones. I’m very careful about what I put into my body. I don't believe in relying on pills unless absolutely necessary, you understand. I prefer natural remedies when possible. Though, clearly, those aren’t working in this case.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to any medication before. I’ve had a few vaccinations over the years, of course, the usual things. But no allergies. I’m quite fortunate in that regard as well, I suppose. My daughter, on the other hand, is allergic to…well, everything, it seems. But I’ve never had any issues with allergies myself.
DOCTOR: Family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a bit complicated. My mother…she suffered from anxiety, quite badly, towards the end of her life. She was a very…sensitive woman, always worrying about things. And my father…he was a very stoic man, never showed much emotion. He died of a heart attack when I was quite young. As for siblings…I have a younger brother, but we’re not very close. He lives in London, and I haven't seen him in years. He seems…content enough, as far as I know. But I don't really know much about his medical history. Does that help? It's…not a very detailed family history, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: It’s…something. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule things out. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Though, I must say, I feel rather silly standing up in the middle of a conversation about…heaviness. But if you think it's necessary, I'm happy to comply. There, is that alright? Be gentle, my knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little high today. Pulse is regular. Neurological exam is…within normal limits. Reflexes are…a bit diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Listen to your lungs…clear. Heart sounds…normal. No edema in the extremities. Alright. Everything appears normal physically. It’s…probably just stress. Have you been under any unusual stress lately, Nani?
PATIENT: Stress? Hmm. Not that I’m aware of. My divorce was… quite some time ago. The children are grown and doing well. I retired from teaching a few years back, which was a relief, truthfully. I have my ski patrol work, which I enjoy. I have a comfortable life. I suppose…my daughter has been a bit…overbearing lately, constantly worrying about me. But I wouldn’t call that stressful, exactly. Just…annoying, perhaps. I’m a very resilient woman, Doctor. I’ve weathered much worse storms in my life. It’s just…this feeling. This…emptiness. It’s unsettling, to say the least. I'm not usually one to complain, you understand. It just...doesn't feel right. Is there anything else you'd like to know? I'd really like to wrap this up if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, Nani, it’s difficult to pinpoint something when everything is…normal. Given your history and the lack of clear physical findings, I’m going to recommend a trial of…well, an antidepressant. A low dose, to start. It could be a chemical imbalance. It's not uncommon. If it doesn't help, we can explore other options. I'll write you a prescription. Let’s see how you feel in a month. If things don’t improve, I suggest you see a psychiatrist. They're better equipped to deal with these sorts of…emotional issues. Now, is there anything else you want to discuss before I finalize this?
PATIENT: An antidepressant? Oh, goodness. I…I’m not sure I like the sound of that. I’ve always been very cautious about taking medication, as I mentioned. And to think it’s just a “chemical imbalance”? It feels…dismissive, somehow. It feels like you’re not truly listening to me. I thought perhaps there was something else going on. Perhaps a vitamin deficiency? Or…something related to my blood pressure? I’m not opposed to taking medication if it’s truly necessary, but to start with an antidepressant… I'm rather skeptical, to be frank. Is there no other way to approach this? Perhaps some blood tests, to rule things out? I really wasn’t expecting this. It's rather…disappointing, actually.
DOCTOR: Look, Nani, you've had a full physical exam. Your vitals are stable. I’ve listened to your heart and lungs. Everything appears normal. We can do blood tests if it will make you feel better, but I highly doubt they will reveal anything significant. And frankly, I have other patients waiting. Fine. I’ll order a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count. But I still believe an antidepressant is the most appropriate course of action. Here. Get these tests done. Then schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results. And think about the medication. It could really help. Now, if that's all…
PATIENT: Very well. I suppose there’s no harm in getting the tests done. Though, I remain unconvinced. I'll schedule the follow-up appointment, though I doubt it will change anything. It’s…disheartening, to be frank, to feel as though my concerns are being dismissed. I appreciate your time, Doctor, though I must say, this hasn’t been a particularly helpful consultation. Good day. .
