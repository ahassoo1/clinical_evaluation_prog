DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kur. Well, is just... I does be so thirsty all the time, you know? And hungry too. Even after I eat a good plate of food, I still feel like I want more. Is very strange, it is.
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry, even after eating… Alright. And how long has this been going on for, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Is start maybe… about a month now? Maybe a little longer. Is not sudden like, one day it start. It just… get worse and worse over the time. I does drink a lot of water, more than usual. And I eat more too, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. I eat mostly what I always eat. Rice and peas, some chicken or fish, dasheen, callaloo… things like that. My husband does the cooking mostly, and he hasn’t change up nothing. Is the same food, yes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I does feel a little tired sometimes, yes. Not all the time, but more than usual. And I does have to go to the bathroom more often too, to pee. Is not pain or nothing, just… more times in the day. That’s all I could think of right now.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any family history of… well, of diabetes, or any problems with blood sugar?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Hmm… let me see. My mother, she was sick for a long time before she pass. The doctor say something about her sugar, but I don’t really remember what he say. Is a long time ago now. My husband side, I don’t really know much about they sicknesses. They don’t talk about things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any pills or nothing. And I never had any trouble with allergies. I could eat anything, yes. My husband does give me bush tea sometimes, for a cold or something, but that's all. Just regular bush tea, like lemon grass.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Zicarelli. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll feel your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sound alright. Whatever you think is best. Is just I want to know what is causing me to be so thirsty and hungry all the time. It is really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your blood pressure. 148 over 92. A little elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. And now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Not much tenderness, but your abdomen is slightly distended. I'm also going to check your feet for any signs of neuropathy. Sensation seems intact, no obvious sores, but some mild swelling in your ankles. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I’d like to order some blood tests. Specifically, a fasting blood glucose level, a complete metabolic panel, and a hemoglobin A1c. This will help us determine if you have diabetes, and if so, how well controlled it is.
PATIENT: Blood tests? Is going to be painful? I don't like needle, Doctor. And what is all those things you say? Fasting… hemoglobin… Is a lot to remember. You could explain it a little simpler, please?
DOCTOR: No, the blood tests aren’t painful, Ms. Zicarelli. It’s just a quick prick of the needle, and it’s over very quickly. You might feel a little sting, but it shouldn't be bad. As for what they are… “Fasting” means you have to not eat anything for eight to twelve hours before the test. Just water is okay. It helps us get an accurate reading of your blood sugar. “Hemoglobin A1c” is a test that tells us your average blood sugar level over the past two or three months. It gives us a bigger picture than just a single blood sugar reading. The “complete metabolic panel” checks different things in your blood – your kidney function, your electrolytes, your liver function – just to make sure everything else is working okay. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, that is a little better. No eat for a whole night? That is going to be hard. I does get hungry easily, you know? But if is important, I could try. And the needle… is just a little prick, you say? I does worry too much sometimes. My husband say I does think the worst. So, is going to be okay? And when I does get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's just a little prick, Ms. Zicarelli. And yes, it's important. We need to know what's going on. And yes, you'll need to fast overnight. You can drink water, though. The lab will call you with the results, usually within a few days. I’ll also have the results sent to my office, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We'll take it one step at a time. If the tests do show that you have diabetes, there are things we can do to manage it. Diet changes, maybe some medication, but we'll figure it out together. Here's a lab requisition form with the tests I'm ordering. Take this to the lab, and tell them Dr. Kur ordered these tests. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I have the paper. Is say “fasting blood glucose,” and all those other things. Is a lot to remember, yes. I think… I think I understand. No eat, go to the lab, they take some blood, and then I wait for the phone call. Is that right? And then I come back here to see you again? And… is going to cost a lot of money, yes? I don't have insurance, you know. My husband is the one that works, and we don't have the money for all those tests.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. You've got it. And you are correct to be concerned about the cost. Unfortunately, these tests do cost money. Let me see if I can find some resources for you. There are some local programs that offer financial assistance for lab tests, and I can also write you a prescription that might help lower the cost. Here. This list includes some free or low-cost clinics in the area that offer lab services. And I will also write a prescription for the tests, and give you the information for a program called “NeedyMeds” which can help you find coupons or discounts. I understand that not having insurance makes things difficult, Ms. Zicarelli. We’ll do our best to find a solution. But getting these tests is important for your health. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That is very kind of you. You does help a lot. I see some numbers here… I will have to ask my husband to call them. He is better with those things. I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… I hope is not too bad. I does worry too much, you know? Thank you again, Doctor Kur. You is a very good doctor. I will go now and see if my husband can help with the phone calls.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Zicarelli. I understand your concerns, and we’ll take it one step at a time. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or problems scheduling the tests. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll figure this out together. Have a good day, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
