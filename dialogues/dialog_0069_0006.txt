DOCTOR: Good morning, Jeannemarie. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… well, I have been… coughing up some blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come see a doctor right away. It has happened a couple times now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jeannemarie. Coughing up blood is definitely something we need to investigate. A couple of times now… can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. The first time was… maybe three days ago? It was not a lot, just… a little bit mixed with my saliva when I coughed. I thought maybe I scratched my throat, but then it happened again yesterday. A little more yesterday, but still not a huge amount. It is… bright red. Is that… bad? I don't know what is normal.
DOCTOR: It's good you came in to get it checked out. Bright red blood can indicate it's coming from closer in your airway, which is something we want to understand. Okay, so three days ago and yesterday. And you said a little bit mixed with saliva – roughly how much would you estimate each time?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is difficult. Maybe… a teaspoon each time? Perhaps a little more than a teaspoon yesterday, but I really don't know how much a teaspoon is exactly. I am sorry, I am not very good at measuring. It is not enough to worry about right away, I don't think, but it still worried me. It’s just… not normal for me.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, you don't need to be precise. A teaspoon or a little more gives me a good idea. And you're right to be concerned when something isn’t normal for you. Has this been associated with anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I have been feeling… normal, otherwise. No fever, no pain in my chest, no trouble breathing. Just the coughing and the… blood. I have been a little tired lately, but that is usual for me, I think. I lost my husband a few years ago and… it is hard sometimes, and I get tired. But not more tired than usual. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Jeannemarie. I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. Grief can certainly take a toll, and fatigue is a very common symptom. So, no fever, no chest pain, no shortness of breath… just the coughing up blood with no other symptoms. Now, let's talk a little more generally. Have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not recently. I think I had a small cold maybe… a month ago? But it was very mild, and it went away quickly. Just a little sniffle and a sore throat for a couple of days. Nothing like the flu. And I always try to get my flu shot every year. I am very careful about those things. Is that important? Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That is important, and yes, it definitely matters. Getting your flu shot is excellent preventative care. Okay, no recent illness other than a mild cold a month ago. Now, have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I haven't been weighing myself regularly, but my clothes still fit the same. If anything, I have maybe gained a little weight, because I have been… comfort eating a bit, since I am… sad sometimes. It's not a lot, but I haven't lost any weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And thank you for being so open with me, Jeannemarie. It’s important for me to get a complete picture. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, I do not. I have been very healthy, thankfully. My doctor always says my blood pressure is a little high, and she tells me to watch my salt, but that is all. Otherwise, I have not been sick with anything serious. I used to exercise more, but since my husband… it is hard to find the motivation sometimes. But I am otherwise healthy, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. So, slightly elevated blood pressure, but otherwise healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I have not. Never had any surgeries. I have been very lucky, I think. Just a few fillings, if that counts. Nothing major. I am… a little scared now. What could be causing this? Is it… serious? I am sorry, I am probably being silly.
DOCTOR: You're not being silly at all, Jeannemarie. It's perfectly natural to be scared when you're experiencing something concerning. We're going to figure this out together. Let's talk about family history. Has anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, grandparents – had any lung problems, like pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had pneumonia once, a long time ago, when I was a little girl. She recovered from it, thankfully. And my grandfather… he smoked a lot, when he was younger. He died when I was quite young, I don’t remember what he died from exactly. But other than that… no, not that I know of. My father was very healthy, and my sister is healthy too. Is smoking important? I don’t smoke myself, if that matters.
DOCTOR: It does matter, thank you. Smoking is a major risk factor for lung problems. Okay, your mother had pneumonia, and your grandfather smoked. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I am not. I don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that is all. And I haven’t taken anything for the cough, because I didn't know if I should. I didn't want to make it worse, or hide the blood, if you know what I mean. Is that a bad idea? Should I have been taking something?
DOCTOR: That was a very smart decision not to take anything. You're right, it's best not to mask symptoms before we've had a chance to investigate. Okay, no medications or supplements, just a multivitamin occasionally. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, and I have never had a reaction to any medicine. I am very lucky, I think. Is that everything? Are you going to do some tests now? I am a little nervous.
DOCTOR: You are very lucky! And yes, now I'd like to do a physical exam and we'll talk about potential tests. It's perfectly normal to be nervous. Your lymph nodes feel normal, and I’m listening to your lungs now. Your breathing sounds clear, but I do hear some mild wheezing. I'm going to check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger. And your oxygen looks good, at 98%. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. I feel a little pressure, but no pain. It feels… normal. Is wheezing bad? What does that mean? And what kind of tests are you going to do? I am getting a little worried again. I hope it isn't anything serious.
DOCTOR: Wheezing can indicate some narrowing of the airways, but it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. It can be caused by a variety of things, like a mild cold or allergies. Okay, I’m going to listen to your heart now. Your heart sounds regular, and I don't hear any murmurs. Now, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. We may also want to do a sputum test, where you cough up a sample of mucus to check for infection. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. A chest X-ray and a sputum test… okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. I just want to know what is going on. It is just… worrying, you know? I hope it isn’t cancer. I don’t want to worry my family. I don't have much family, but still… My sister lives far away. Is cancer common? I am sorry, I am probably asking silly questions.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking silly questions at all, Jeannemarie. It’s perfectly natural to be concerned about cancer when you're experiencing something like this. We’ll get to the bottom of it. The X-ray and sputum test will help us rule out a lot of potential causes. It's important to remember that coughing up blood doesn’t automatically mean cancer. It can be caused by many things, like bronchitis, pneumonia, or even a minor injury. I’m going to have the nurse come in and take a sample of your sputum now, and then we’ll go to radiology for the X-ray. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. And you have made me feel a little better, even though I am still worried. I will try to stay calm. Thank you for being so patient with me. Do you think I can go home after the X-ray? I have some… errands to run, if I am feeling okay.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. That's what I'm here for. We will take things one step at a time. Yes, you should be able to go home after the X-ray, assuming you’re feeling okay. It typically doesn’t take long. We'll review the results as soon as they’re available and discuss the next steps. “Nurse, could you please come in to collect a sputum sample from Jeannemarie Weichers?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I will just wait here then. I hope everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be right here when the nurse arrives. Just try to relax, and we’ll get through this together. Let me know if you have any questions in the meantime. It will be okay, Jeannemarie. We're going to figure this out.
