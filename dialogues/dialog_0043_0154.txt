DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Kalinski, you say? Yes, well... it's my water. It's been bothering me. Again. It feels... not right. I’ve had this trouble before, lots of times, actually. I just... want it fixed, if that makes sense. I don’t really remember all the details, though. It just hurts when I… go.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wease. It sounds quite uncomfortable, and recurring issues can certainly be frustrating. “Not right” and pain with urination… that’s helpful, thank you. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… a burning. Mostly. A burning feeling. And… a sort of ache, low down. It’s hard to explain, Doctor. It doesn’t last all day, just when… well, you know. When I need to use the restroom. And sometimes, it feels like I haven’t… emptied everything, if you follow. I really don’t like talking about this, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your discomfort, Ms. Wease. It’s perfectly alright to feel uneasy discussing these matters. You’re in a safe and professional environment, and my goal is simply to understand what’s going on so we can find a solution. So, a burning sensation and a low ache with urination, and sometimes a feeling of incomplete emptying. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been building up over time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Building up, I think. It hasn’t been… a sudden thing, no. It comes and goes, really. I had it bad a few years back, and then it quieted down. But lately, it’s been… more frequent. I can’t say exactly when it started again, Doctor. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. I just know it’s been happening more and more often these last few months, perhaps?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Wease – a history of this recurring over time, with increased frequency in the last few months. It sounds like it’s something we need to investigate properly. Now, aside from the pain and incomplete emptying, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think. Hmm. Well… I do feel a bit tired, sometimes. But I'm 66, Doctor! So I assume that’s just… old age. No, I don’t think so… Wait. Sometimes, my water… it smells funny. A bit strong, perhaps? I don’t know if that’s related, though. And… I’ve been going to the restroom more often, I suppose. Even when I don’t need to, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing those details, Ms. Wease. Fatigue, a change in the smell of your urine, and increased frequency – these are all important pieces of the puzzle. The change in urine odor and increased frequency are particularly relevant. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My past medical history… That’s… a long story. I’ve been to doctors a fair bit over the years, naturally. But what exactly for… I honestly can’t recall much. I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… I think I had pneumonia once? I’m not very good at remembering these things. I don’t have any… big illnesses, if that’s what you mean. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Wease. It’s common to not remember every detail, and knowing you had your gallbladder removed and a bout of pneumonia is helpful. We can try to access your records if that's alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me see. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. But… I did get a rash once from some sort of lotion. A very long time ago. But that wasn’t a medicine, was it? I really don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. They always make me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No known drug allergies, and a sensitivity to a lotion in the past. I understand your reluctance to take medication, and we will certainly consider all options. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Just… a little something for my joints. They ache, you see. It's… Ibuprofen, I think? The blue bottle. I take it when they bother me, which is… often. And sometimes, I take something for… constipation. It’s a prune juice, mostly. Does that count? I don't take anything regularly, if that makes sense. Just when I need to.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen as needed for joint pain and prune juice for constipation. Thank you. That is very helpful. Now, Ms. Wease, to get a more complete understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Well, my mother… she lived to be a very old age. A very healthy woman, mostly. My father… he had something with his heart, I think. But I don't really know the details. Lots of my family had… aches and pains, if that counts. It seems to run in the family, unfortunately. I don’t think anyone had anything serious, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That is helpful to know, Ms. Wease. A family history of longevity, heart issues in your father, and a general predisposition to aches and pains. Thank you. Now, lastly, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? Oh dear. What exactly do you mean? I’m… divorced. A long time ago. I live alone. I don’t… go out much anymore. I used to enjoy gardening, but my joints… they don't allow for that these days. I mostly stay at home and watch television. It’s a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Wease. It sounds like you enjoy a peaceful life at home. Now, with all of that information, I’d like to ask if you’re comfortable with me conducting a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam… Well, I suppose so. If you think it's necessary, Doctor. I'm not a fan of doctors, truthfully, but I want this… problem… fixed. Do whatever you need to do. I just hope it doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wease. I'll do my best to be as quick and comfortable as possible. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Finally, I’d like to do a quick neurological exam, just to assess reflexes and sensation. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, if you could lie back for me, I’ll check your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay. I'm noting some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen. Nothing overly concerning at this stage, but we’ll keep that in mind. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you please extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Extending my legs… Yes, here they are. This is… a bit awkward, Doctor. I haven’t had anyone check my legs in a very long time. Just… be gentle, please. My knees aren't what they used to be. I just want to get this sorted out, if possible.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright, Ms. Wease. I am being as gentle as possible. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is not uncommon at your age, but they are symmetrical. I don't see any significant swelling or discoloration. Okay, Ms. Wease. That completes the brief physical exam. Based on your history and the findings of the exam, I suspect we may be dealing with a urinary tract infection, possibly complicated by incomplete bladder emptying. However, to confirm this, I would like to order a urine analysis and a urine culture. We also might want to check a basic metabolic panel to rule out other causes. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests… I just want this… over with. But alright, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. A urine analysis, a urine culture… and something else? I just… hope it doesn’t take too long to get the results. I don’t like being in limbo. And… will these tests be painful?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Wease. The urine analysis and culture are very straightforward, and they aren’t painful at all. You’ll simply need to provide a urine sample. The basic metabolic panel will involve a small blood draw. It’s a quick pinch, and then it’s over. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and collect the urine sample now. Once we have the results, we’ll have a clearer picture of what’s going on and can discuss treatment options. I expect the results to be back within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, which can irritate your bladder. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Drinking fluids… yes, I can manage that. Plenty of fluids, no caffeine or alcohol… Alright, that doesn’t sound too difficult. I’m glad you’re not suggesting anything too complicated. Can the nurse come now? I'd like to get this over with as quickly as possible. I really do appreciate you trying to help, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Wease. I'll let the nurse know to come in right away. She’ll explain the process in detail. I'm happy to help, and I want to assure you we’ll get to the bottom of this. Nurse, could you please come in to room three?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you, Doctor. I’m just… anxious, you see. It's hard getting older. Everything takes so much longer and is… more complicated. I just want to feel like myself again. I do hope they’re gentle.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Wease. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious, and I assure you, we’ll do everything we can to make this as comfortable as possible. The nurse is very experienced and gentle. And remember, we're here to help you feel like yourself again. Now, while we wait for the nurse, do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… questions? Let me think. Hmm. Well, will this… infection… come back? If I get better, will it just… happen again? And will I need to take pills forever? I don’t like taking pills, as I said. It's my biggest worry, really. That I'll be stuck taking medication for the rest of my life.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Ms. Wease. Recurrent UTIs are certainly possible, but we can take steps to minimize that risk. Whether or not you'll need long-term medication depends on the underlying cause of the infection and how frequently it recurs. If it's a one-time occurrence, a short course of antibiotics is usually all that's needed. If it's recurrent, we may consider preventive measures, such as lifestyle modifications or a low-dose antibiotic regimen for a period of time. We'll discuss all of your options thoroughly once we have the lab results. It’s also important to address any underlying issues that might be contributing to the infection, like incomplete bladder emptying, which we suspect might be playing a role in your case. For now, let’s focus on getting the infection treated and then we can talk about preventing future occurrences. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Treat it first, and then worry about preventing it. I can handle that. I just… I don’t want any surprises, if you know what I mean. I want to be prepared. And… thank you for explaining it so clearly, Doctor. It makes me feel a bit better, knowing what to expect. I really do appreciate it. Is the nurse coming soon?
DOCTOR: Yes, she’s just outside the door now. She’ll be right in to explain the process. She’ll also get the orders for the urine analysis, urine culture, and basic metabolic panel. In the meantime, I’ll just make a few notes here. We've covered a lot of ground today, Ms. Wease, and I think we have a good starting point. Remember, I’m here to answer any questions you may have along the way. Don't hesitate to ask. Here's the nurse now. She'll take it from here.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate everything you’ve done so far. Just… please be gentle, dear. I’m a bit nervous, you see.
DOCTOR: Nurse, this is Ms. Wease. She’s a bit anxious about the blood draw and urine sample collection, so if you could take extra care to explain everything thoroughly and be as gentle as possible, I would appreciate it. We suspect a possible UTI and are ordering a CBC, urine analysis, urine culture and basic metabolic panel. I'll step out for a moment and let you get settled with the nurse. I'll be right back after she's finished. .
PATIENT: .
