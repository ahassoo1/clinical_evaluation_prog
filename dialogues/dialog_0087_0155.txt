DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a shaking. In my hands, mostly. Been gettin’ worse, I think. Honestly, time… it kinda slips away, you know? Hard to say when it started, exactly. Just… a shaking. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good place to start. The shaking – can you describe it to me?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like a big tremble, not all the time. More like… a little flutter, sometimes. Other times it’s harder to hold things. Like a cup of coffee. I used to be able to hold anything, steady as a rock. Now… not so much. It’s mostly when I’m trying to do something. When I'm just sitting, it's not so bad. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things these days.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for explaining. It sounds like it's more pronounced with activity, which is helpful to know. And you said it’s been getting worse – over what period of time would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. See, that’s the tricky part. A few months, maybe? Six months? I… I honestly can’t rightly say. Things blur together after a while. I used to work at the water treatment plant, you know. Lots of… fiddly things to do with my hands. Maybe it started then? Before I retired, that is. It's… it's been a slow thing, I think. Not sudden.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slow onset over the past six months, potentially related to your previous work. Have you noticed the shaking in any other parts of your body, or is it primarily in your hands?
PATIENT: Mostly the hands, yeah. Though… sometimes my leg feels a bit… twitchy. Not all the time, and it's not a big shake, just a little… restless feeling. Like I need to tap it, you know? It doesn't bother me too much, but I noticed it. It's hard to say if it’s related to the hands, or just… old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let’s talk a little more broadly. Aside from the shaking and the restless leg, have you experienced any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Well, I get tired easier. Always have been a bit of a napper, but now I need one almost every afternoon. And my balance… it's not what it used to be. I nearly tripped over the rug last week. Nothing serious, just… wobbly. I haven’t been eating much either. Food just doesn't seem to taste like it used to. Is that… important? I don’t want to bother you with old people problems.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Jezik, this is all important information. Please, don't hesitate to share anything you think might be relevant. Fatigue, a change in balance, and decreased appetite are all things we need to consider. Now, let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have a list of any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Not really. I haven't taken anything regularly in years. Maybe some aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. I never was one for pills. Didn’t like the way they made me feel. Used to be healthy as a horse, you know. Then things… well, they changed. I don’t have a list, I’m afraid. Never needed one.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The doctor… back when my wife was still around, he mentioned something about my cholesterol being a bit high. Said I should watch my diet. But I never really paid much attention to it. And… I had a bad knee for a while, from playing soccer when I was young, but that was fixed with surgery a long time ago. That's all I can really remember, honestly. It was years ago. I’m not the best at remembering doctor talk.
DOCTOR: Alright, history of slightly elevated cholesterol and a knee replacement surgery in the past. And you said you had the surgery a long time ago – do you recall roughly when?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Must be… thirty years ago, maybe? More? It was before my wife got sick, definitely. Everything’s a blur. The doctor, he was good. Fixed me right up. I played soccer for a few years after that, but then… well, then my knees started acting up again, and I just gave it up. It doesn't bother me much now. It just aches a bit sometimes, in cold weather.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee replacement approximately 30 years ago. Now, concerning your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like Parkinson's disease, tremors, heart disease, or dementia?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother, she had a bad heart. Passed away when I was still young. And my grandfather… he got real forgetful towards the end. Couldn't remember his own name, they said. Maybe dementia, I don’t know. It was a long time ago. My wife's side… I don’t really know. We didn't talk about that much. She didn’t have any siblings, and her parents… well, they passed away when she was young too. Not much help, I’m afraid. Everyone’s gone now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for sharing what you remember. Okay, before we proceed, would you mind if I take a few moments to review your chart electronically?
PATIENT: Go ahead, Doctor. If you can find anything useful in there, that is. I doubt it. I haven't seen a doctor in years, as I mentioned. But… be my guest. I’ll just sit here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm seeing some records from a previous primary care doctor, but it’s rather limited. It confirms the slightly elevated cholesterol and blood pressure you mentioned. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and assess your balance and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you need to poke and prod, go ahead. I suppose I should expect that. Just… be gentle, if you can. Old bones, you know. And… try not to take too long, if that’s alright. I have… things to do. Not important things, but… things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I will be as gentle as possible. Alright, Mr. Jezik, I’ve completed the exam. I noticed your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your breath sounds are slightly diminished, which could be normal for your age, but something we’ll keep an eye on. I also noted some mild unsteadiness and a slight tremor in your hands, as well as a slightly shuffling gait. Do you notice these things yourself?
PATIENT: Well… the doctor used to say my blood pressure was a bit high. Always told me to watch my salt. And… yes, I suppose I do feel a bit wobbly sometimes. Especially when I try to turn quickly. And… yes, my steps feel a bit… small, I guess. Like I'm dragging my feet a bit. I just figured it was old age, you know? I haven't been as spry lately, that's for sure. It's… annoying, mostly. Makes me feel like I'm falling apart.
DOCTOR: I understand. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, it’s important to consider a few possibilities. The tremor, slowness of movement, unsteadiness, and changes in your gait could be indicative of a condition called Parkinson’s disease. However, it’s also possible that these symptoms are related to other factors, such as normal age-related changes, medication side effects – although you aren’t currently on any – or other underlying medical conditions. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any other potential causes, and I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A neurologist… Another doctor? More tests? Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel normal again. But… if you think it’s necessary… alright. Do what you think is best. I just… hope it’s not something serious. The blood tests… alright. As long as they don’t take too much blood. I get faint easily. I suppose I should ask… what does a neurologist do, exactly? And… what if it is Parkinson’s? Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable question, Mr. Jezik. A neurologist specializes in disorders of the nervous system, which includes conditions like Parkinson’s disease. They will perform a more thorough neurological exam and may order additional tests, such as an MRI of the brain, to help confirm or rule out a diagnosis. As for Parkinson’s disease… it's a progressive condition, meaning the symptoms can worsen over time. However, there are treatments available – primarily medications – that can help manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. It’s not a death sentence, and many people with Parkinson’s live full and active lives. We won't know for sure until we get the results of the tests and the neurologist’s evaluation. But it's best to get a definitive diagnosis so we can develop a plan to address it, if necessary. I’ll order the blood tests now. They’ll check for things like thyroid problems and vitamin deficiencies, which can sometimes mimic Parkinson’s symptoms. I’ll also provide you with a referral to Dr. Anya Petrova, a highly-regarded neurologist in the area. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Alright… Dr. Petrova, you say? Yes, that sounds… okay. As long as she’s nice. Blood tests and a neurologist… it’s a lot. But… I suppose you’re right. Best to know. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for not just dismissing me as an old man with a shaky hand. I appreciate that. Now… how long will the tests take? And when can I expect to hear back? I really just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. I understand this is a lot to take in. The blood tests should take just a few minutes, and the lab results usually come back within 3-5 business days. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. I will also include information about Dr. Petrova’s office and how to schedule an appointment with the referral I will be sending to you electronically. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as increased falls, difficulty speaking or swallowing, or any other new concerns – please don’t hesitate to contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… the tests, then. And I’ll wait to hear about Dr. Petrova. Thank you again. You’ve been very helpful. I suppose I should get going. It’s been a long morning.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
