DOCTOR: Alright. Reneisha Selbitschka, 41. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Memmolo. It’s… well, it’s about my weight. I’ve gained some, and it’s rather sudden. I haven’t changed anything in my diet or exercise routine, and it’s concerning me.
DOCTOR: Sudden weight gain… Right. And how much weight are we talking about, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… approximately 15 pounds in the last two months, perhaps a little more. It’s hard to say exactly, I don’t weigh myself religiously, if you understand. It’s just… noticeable in my clothes. And I feel… heavier, naturally.
DOCTOR: Fifteen pounds… in two months. And no changes to diet or activity. Hmm. Any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, not really. I sleep alright, perhaps a little more tired than usual, but I attribute that to the heat, honestly. My appetite is normal. No… swelling, or… anything like that. Just the weight. It’s… unsettling, as I said. I haven’t a family history of this, either. My mother and grandmother were… slender women.
DOCTOR: Okay. No swelling, normal appetite… slender family history. Have you noticed any changes in your… regular cycle?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, yes, actually. Now that you mention it… it’s been… irregular. A bit later than usual, and the… flow is lighter. I hadn’t really connected it to the weight gain, to be frank. I assumed it was simply… the change of seasons. Is that… relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Irregular cycles… and weight gain. Alright. And your age... 41… Have you ever had any issues with your thyroid?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never been tested for it, and I’ve never experienced any symptoms that would lead me to believe there was an issue. No… nervousness, or… cold sensitivity. Just… this weight. And the cycles, of course. Is something serious happening, Doctor? I confess, I am becoming quite anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then palpate your thyroid and abdomen. Just routine. And we'll need to order some blood work - a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a TSH to rule out thyroid issues. Best to be thorough, you know. Please, have a seat.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Thoroughness is… appreciated. A TSH, you say? I believe my husband mentioned something about that once, regarding his aunt. Is it a common test? I hope this won’t take too long, Doctor. I have a rather pressing engagement this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure when investigating unexplained weight gain and menstrual irregularities. Now, if you could lie back, please. I'll listen to your heart and lungs first. Deep breaths, if you would.
PATIENT: Certainly. Deep breaths. Is everything… normal so far? You don't need to tell me specifics, of course, but just a general reassurance would be… helpful.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your thyroid. This might feel a little strange. Nothing immediately concerning, no obvious nodules or enlargement. Abdomen feels… soft, no palpable masses. Now, let's get those blood tests ordered. The nurse will draw them for you shortly. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Very good. Standard procedure is… reassuring. So, the blood tests will tell us… what exactly? Beyond the thyroid, I mean. Will it show if… something else is amiss? I confess, I am quite anxious about this whole process. Perhaps a cup of tea afterwards would be beneficial.
DOCTOR: The tests will give us a broader picture – check your glucose levels, cholesterol, and basic organ function. We need to rule out any underlying metabolic issues. And yes, the TSH will confirm or deny a thyroid problem. Honestly, it’s likely just hormonal changes associated with your age, but we need to be thorough. The nurse will get the lab requisition. I wouldn't bother with tea right now, best to get this over with. And we'll review the results when they come back.
PATIENT: Hormonal changes… Yes, I suppose that’s… logical. Very well. The blood tests, then. I trust the nurse knows I am… not fond of needles? It’s rather silly, I know, but it’s a long-standing aversion. I do appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. Perhaps you could simply tell me how long the tests will take? And then, I really must be going. I apologize for being… a bit of a worrywart.
DOCTOR: The results usually take 24-48 hours. And the nurse is quite efficient. It’ll be over before you know it. I’ll have her come in now. Just try to relax. She’ll be in shortly.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I trust they have comfortable chairs in the waiting room?
