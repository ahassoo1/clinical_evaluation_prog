DOCTOR: Right. Zoie Stoffregen, 87 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Um… it’s… going to the bathroom. It’s hard now. Not… not easy like before. I have to… push a lot. It’s been going on a little while, I think. Not sure exactly how long. Everything feels a bit blurry these days, you know?
DOCTOR: Blurry, yes. Well, “hard to go to the bathroom.” Is it painful, or just…difficult?
PATIENT: Painful… not really pain, no. More like… stuck. Like it doesn’t want to come out. And then when it does come out, it takes a long time. And I feel like… like I don't get all of it out, sometimes. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, I’m not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: Right. So, straining, incomplete evacuation… and how often are you going?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How often… that’s a good question. Not every day, that I know of. Maybe every other day? Sometimes longer. I drink my tea, you know. A lot of tea. But I don't really keep track, if that makes sense. It just… happens when it happens. I used to go regularly, I think… before. But everything's a bit mixed up now. Is tea bad for this?
DOCTOR: Tea… well, it’s a liquid. Staying hydrated is good. But let’s not focus on the tea right now. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or with wiping?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… no. Not that I remember. I always check, of course, but… no. Everything looks… normal, I suppose. Just… hard to get out. And sometimes, after I go, I still feel… like there's a little bit left. It’s uncomfortable. I hope I’m not being a bother, dear. I just… don't want this to get worse.
DOCTOR: No, no bother. Alright. And any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Changes in appetite…? Hmm. I eat when my husband makes something. He's a good cook, bless his heart. I don’t feel hungry all the time, not like I used to. But I eat enough, I think. Maybe I’m just not as excited about food as before. It all tastes a bit… muted, you know? Not as flavorful. Does that matter? I just figured it was my old age.
DOCTOR: Right. Muted flavors…okay. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no sickness. Not at all. Just… the bathroom problem. And feeling a bit tired, but that’s just… being old, I guess. I sleep a lot during the day now. And my memory… well, you’ve probably noticed. It’s not what it used to be. Everything feels a bit foggy, you know? But no sickness, thankfully. I always thank the Lord for that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I just want to listen to your abdomen and do a rectal exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will give me a better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Oh dear. Well… I don’t know. I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… necessary? I mean, I don’t like doctors poking around down there. But… if it helps, I guess. I trust you, dear. Just… please be gentle, okay? And explain everything first. I get nervous easily. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mrs. Stoffregen. It helps us assess for any abnormalities. It might be slightly uncomfortable, but I’ll be as gentle as possible and explain each step. We’ll use lubricant. I’ll just be feeling for any masses or tenderness. It shouldn't take long. If you’re really uncomfortable, we can stop. Do you want me to proceed?
PATIENT: Oh… well… if you say it’s necessary. And you’ll be gentle? And explain everything? Okay. Yes, I guess so. But please, go slowly. And tell me what you’re doing, okay? I’m a bit worried, you see. My husband always tells me I worry too much. But it's hard not to when things aren’t working right. Just… please be careful. And tell me if you see anything… wrong. I suppose I should just get it over with, right?
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie on your left side with your knees bent. I’ll explain as I go. First, I’ll be lubricating the gloved finger… then gently inserting it into the rectum. I’m assessing the tone of the sphincter, checking for any masses or tenderness…and looking for any blood. Just relax, and breathe normally. I didn't feel any masses, and there was no obvious blood. The tone of your sphincter is a little weak, but that’s not uncommon at your age. It could be contributing to the incomplete evacuation you're experiencing. I also didn’t find any obvious tenderness.
PATIENT: Oh… well. That sounds… good, I suppose. No masses is good, right? And what did you say about the… the weak thing? Is that bad? Will I need… medicine? I just want to be able to go to the bathroom like normal again. It’s embarrassing, you know? Having to strain and push and still feel like there’s something left. It’s just… not dignified. Is it something serious, dear? Please be honest with me. And what do I do now?
DOCTOR: The weak tone isn’t necessarily serious, but it can contribute to your symptoms. It means the muscle that controls bowel movements isn't as strong. We can try a few things. First, I recommend increasing your fiber intake. Plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Also, staying well-hydrated is crucial. And regular exercise, if you're able, can help strengthen those muscles. We can also consider a stool softener, like docusate sodium, over-the-counter. Start with 100-200mg once or twice a day. If that doesn’t help, we can discuss a prescription medication, but let’s try the lifestyle changes and stool softener first. I'll write that down for you. If you experience any rectal bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or significant changes in your bowel habits, contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… fiber… and exercise… and a… stool softener. That sounds like a lot. I’m not very good at remembering things, you know. Will this really help? And what kind of fruits and vegetables? My husband always gets annoyed with me if I bring home the wrong kind. And what is bowel habits? I just… get confused easily. And… should I stop drinking tea? You said something about hydration, but tea is a liquid, isn’t it? I'm sorry, I’m probably being a bother. But all these instructions… it's a bit overwhelming. Maybe my husband should come with me next time? He's good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Look, it’s a simple plan. More fiber, more water, and a stool softener if needed. Fruits like apples, pears, bananas, berries…vegetables like broccoli, spinach, carrots. It doesn’t need to be complicated. Tea is fine, just make sure you're drinking enough plain water as well. Yes, bringing someone with you next time is fine. But I've given you clear instructions. I don't have time to repeat myself. We've covered everything. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. Well, no, I don’t think so. Just… all these things to remember. I’ll try my best, I promise. And I’ll bring my husband next time. He's very good at making lists. Thank you, dear. For… everything. Even though it was a bit… uncomfortable. And confusing. But I appreciate you trying to help. Goodbye. .
