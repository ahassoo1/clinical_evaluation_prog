DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My heart... it feels funny sometimes. Like it's racing, but not a strong race. More like... flapping. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Maybe a month? It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Flapping” is… an interesting description. A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. About a month. Hard to say exactly. I don't keep good track of dates, you know? But it's not every day. Maybe two, three times a week? Sometimes not even that much. It just... happens. Then it stops. It doesn't hurt, just… weird.
DOCTOR: Right. And does anything seem to bring it on?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven't noticed anything. I work with the machines, you know? The chemical stuff? It happens at work, it happens at home... when I'm watching TV with my wife, even. It just... starts. I drink tea, maybe that does something? I drink a lot of tea.
DOCTOR: Tea… alright. And what kind of tea do you typically drink, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: Mostly black tea. Strong black tea with sugar. My wife makes it for me. She likes it strong too. Sometimes with a little milk. I don't know… is tea bad? Should I stop drinking tea?
DOCTOR: Well, it's not necessarily bad, Mr. Puder, but black tea does contain caffeine, which can affect heart rate. We'll get to that. Now, aside from the tea, are you experiencing any other symptoms when this "flapping" occurs?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. I don't feel dizzy. I don't get short of breath. Just the heart thing. Sometimes I feel a little tired after it happens, but I’m always a little tired. It’s hard to say if it’s from that or just… life, you know? I sleep okay, I think. My wife says I snore, but I don't know about that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing. I don't go to the doctor much. I just… try to ignore things. But this heart thing… it's getting a little worrying. My wife told me I have to come. She's a good woman. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my father, he had some problems with his blood pressure, I think. High blood pressure, maybe? He was a farmer, back in Yemen. He passed away a few years ago. My mother is still alive, she's old. She's okay, I think. She lives far away. I don’t see her much. Nobody else… really had heart problems, I don't think.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pills, nothing. I don't like taking pills. They make me feel funny. I prefer just… to deal with things myself. But like I said, this heart thing… it's a little hard to deal with on my own. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Puder, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. It will just take a few minutes. Then we can discuss some possible causes and what we should do next. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just… let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I don't like being poked and prodded too much.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat here, Mr. Puder. I'll need you to remove your shirt, and I'll get the stethoscope. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. Not alarmingly so, but worth noting. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is irregular, as you described. I can hear some extra beats – premature atrial contractions, likely. Lungs are clear. Pulse is also irregular and slightly fast. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing. No pain. Just… feels like you’re touching me. That’s all. You said… premature what-now? Is that bad? Is that what’s making my heart flap? My wife is going to worry so much if it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: "Premature atrial contractions," Mr. Puder, or PACs, are extra beats that originate in the upper chambers of your heart. They are fairly common, and often benign. However, they can sometimes be a sign of underlying issues. The irregularity I'm hearing, combined with your elevated blood pressure, warrants some further investigation. I’d like to order a few tests. An EKG – that’s a simple recording of your heart’s electrical activity. And a basic blood panel to check your electrolytes and thyroid function. We should also do a Holter monitor. That’s a small device you wear for 24 hours that continuously records your heart rate. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… okay. More tests. I don’t like tests, but if you think it’s necessary… yes, okay. A… Holter what-now? Do I have to sleep with it? My wife will make fun of me if I have to sleep with a machine on my chest. But if it helps… yes. What do I have to do with these machines?
DOCTOR: The Holter monitor, Mr. Puder, is a small, portable device—about the size of a deck of cards—that you wear on your chest. It records your heart’s activity continuously for 24 hours. You simply wear it while you go about your normal daily activities, including sleeping. It's painless. You’ll also keep a diary of your activities and any symptoms you experience while wearing it. My nurse will explain the process in detail. As for the blood panel and EKG, we can do those right here in the clinic today. Once we have the results, we can determine the cause of your palpitations and discuss the best course of action. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I can eat anything. My wife makes me try all sorts of things. She likes to cook. But no allergies to pills or anything like that. I don't take them, but I don't react to them if I have to, you know? What kind of action? Do I have to have… surgery? My wife would be very upset if I had to have surgery.
DOCTOR: Surgery is highly unlikely at this point, Mr. Puder. We haven't even determined what's causing your palpitations yet. The tests will help us rule out any serious underlying issues, such as heart disease or thyroid problems. If the tests are normal, it's likely that your palpitations are benign—perhaps related to stress, caffeine intake, or even just anxiety. In that case, we may recommend lifestyle changes, such as reducing your tea consumption and managing your stress levels. But let's not jump to conclusions. First, we need to get these tests done. My nurse, Fatima, will be in shortly to explain the procedure and schedule everything. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I understand. Tests, then we see. No surgery… that’s good. I will try to drink less tea, maybe. My wife will be happy about that. She always says I drink too much. Just… please don’t make me wear too many machines. That’s all. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Puder. Fatima will be with you shortly. .
