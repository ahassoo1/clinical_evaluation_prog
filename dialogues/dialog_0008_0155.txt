DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I'm Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Tremor, that's what the nice lady on the phone said I was here for. Honestly, it's…well, it's hard to say exactly when it started. Just…happens sometimes. My hands shake. It's not constant, thankfully. Not a big deal, usually. Just wanted to get it checked, you know? Old age creeping in, probably.
DOCTOR: Right, a tremor. Okay. And you said it's not constant?
PATIENT: No, no. Not all the time. More when I’m…trying to do something. Like, holding a cup of coffee. Or…writing. Though I don't write much these days. Used to, back when I was working at the plant. Lots of reports. It's…worse when I'm stressed, I think. Or tired. Hard to tell the difference sometimes, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be exacerbated by activity, and potentially stress or fatigue. Can you tell me a bit more about where you feel the tremor?
PATIENT: Well, mostly in my hands. My right hand, I think, is worse. Sometimes it goes up my arm a little. Not my whole arm, just…the forearm, maybe? And…it’s hard to explain. Sometimes I feel it in my…shoulder a bit? It's not painful, you know? Just…shaky. Not a pleasant feeling, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily in the right hand, potentially extending up the forearm and occasionally to the shoulder. No pain, just the shaking sensation. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tremor?
PATIENT: Hmm…other symptoms? Let me think… I’ve been a bit…forgetful lately, if that counts. But I’m an old man, Doctor! Everyone forgets things when they get to my age. It's not…new, exactly. Just…maybe a bit worse. And I get tired easily, I suppose. But I always have. I used to be able to work all day at the plant, no problem. Now I nap in the afternoon. But that's just old age, right?
DOCTOR: Right. Forgetfulness and fatigue. And you feel these have gradually worsened over time?
PATIENT: Gradually…yes, I think so. It's not like it happened overnight. More like…slowly getting worse. Like a leaky faucet, just dripping, dripping, dripping. I can't remember when I first noticed the tiredness, to be honest. It's just…always been there. The tremor…that I think I noticed more recently. Maybe a few months ago? A few years ago? It’s all a bit of a blur, if I’m honest with you.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the tremor you've noticed more recently – possibly a few months to a few years – and the fatigue and forgetfulness have been more gradual. Now, have you noticed any stiffness or slowness in your movements, besides the tremor?
PATIENT: Stiffness…hmm. Sometimes, yeah. My hands feel a little stiff in the morning. Not terrible, but…not as nimble as they used to be. I used to be good with my hands, fixing things around the house. Now…it's harder. Everything's harder. I don’t know if that's the stiffness, or just…age. And I wouldn’t say I’m slow, exactly…but maybe I take my time a bit more now. Is that what you’re asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Stiffness in the mornings, some difficulty with fine motor skills. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had…high blood pressure, I think. Years ago. They put me on some pills for it, but…I stopped taking them. Didn't feel like they were doing much, and I didn't like the side effects. And my knees bother me, sometimes. Arthritis, I think the doctor said. But mostly just aches and pains. I haven't been to a doctor in…a long time, honestly. I don’t like going to doctors.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure – which you are no longer taking medication for – and arthritis in the knees. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And…I broke my arm once, falling off a roof when I was fixing it. But that was…years and years ago. No hospitalizations, I don’t think. Just…the doctor fixed my arm and that was it. Nothing serious. Does that help? I'm not very good at remembering things like that, you know.
DOCTOR: It does help, thank you. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother…she had some trouble with her hands when she got older. Shaking, like me. But I don't remember what the doctor said it was. Something…neurological, maybe? My father…he was healthy as a horse, to be honest. Worked in a factory his whole life. And… I had a sister, but she passed away a long time ago. Young. Didn’t have much to do with her, if I'm being honest. It's hard to say. Not much of a family person, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, some family history of tremor, but not a lot of specific information. Now, do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Not currently. I used to take something for my knees, an over-the-counter pain reliever. But it didn’t really help, so I stopped. And…sometimes I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but that's it. I try to eat healthy, mostly. It's hard when you live alone, you know? I don't really take much of anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional vitamin D. Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll check your reflexes, coordination, and look at your hands a little more closely. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Get it over with, if you don't mind. I’ve got things to do this afternoon. Not important things, but…things. Just want to get this sorted out and get on with it, you know? I don't like being fussed over, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll take a look at your hands and do a few neurological tests. Please relax your arms at your sides. Blood pressure is 145/90. Pulse is 78. A little elevated, but not overly concerning. Now, let's look at your hands. I see a slight tremor in your right hand, which is more noticeable when you extend your arms. No rigidity or muscle twitching that I can see. Could you please reach out and touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Here. It's a little harder than it used to be, you know? My coordination isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see a slight difficulty with coordination. Now, can you tap your fingers together, and then alternate tapping each finger on your hand?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s…slower than it used to be. I used to be able to do this without even thinking about it. My hands just don’t seem to want to cooperate today. Honestly, Doctor, I’m probably just getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, thank you. And just one last quick test. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Like this? It's a bit wobbly, you know? Not as steady on my feet as I used to be. My knees bother me a bit, too. I don’t like walking much anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Jezik. Okay, based on what you've told me and the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. You're experiencing a tremor, some slowness in movement, and some difficulty with coordination. The forgetfulness and fatigue could be related, or they could be due to other factors. One possibility is essential tremor. This is a common condition that causes a tremor, usually in the hands, and can worsen with age. However, given your slowness in movement and difficulty with coordination, we also need to consider Parkinson’s disease. To help us figure out what's going on, I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out other possible causes. And I’m going to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. They can do some imaging tests of your brain and perform more detailed neurological tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Neurologist…imaging tests… Oh dear. That sounds…serious. Parkinson’s…isn’t that what Michael J. Fox has? Blood tests are fine, I suppose. But…I don't want to go through a lot of tests if it's just…old age. I just wanted someone to tell me it’s nothing serious, you know? Honestly, I’m not sure I want to know if it’s something bad. But…if you think it's necessary…I suppose I’ll do the tests. But please, try not to worry me too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik. I understand your concerns, and I'll do my best to keep you informed every step of the way. It’s important to get a proper diagnosis so we can determine the best course of action, if any is needed. It doesn't necessarily mean it is Parkinson's. We need to rule out other possibilities first. The blood tests will help with that. I’ll send the order for the blood tests to the lab right away. I'll also prepare a referral for Dr. Anya Volkov, a neurologist I work with frequently. She's very thorough and compassionate. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on maintaining a healthy lifestyle: a balanced diet, regular exercise – even just a short walk each day – and getting enough sleep. And please, don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No…I don’t think so. Just…please, don’t make me worry too much. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I don’t want to spend my last years worrying about…things. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll do it. And…thank you. For…everything. I suppose I’ll go home now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. I understand. I will certainly keep that in mind. We'll take things one step at a time. I’ll have the nurse give you the lab order and information about Dr. Volkov before you leave. Please, focus on taking care of yourself. And remember, my office is always here if you need anything. Have a good day, Mr. Jezik, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
