DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Courtnye Hainley. It's… well, it's about my bruising. It's been getting worse, and I'm on blood thinners, so… yeah. It's a bit worrying. I'd like to get it checked out, if you don't mind. I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Certainly not wasting my time at all, Ms. Hainley. Bruising, especially with being on blood thinners, is absolutely something we should investigate. To get a better understanding, could you tell me more about the bruising?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… it started, I guess, maybe a couple of weeks ago? Small ones, on my arms mostly. I figured it was just… being clumsy, you know? But then they started popping up on my legs, and they're bigger now. And they last longer. Like, a bump I got yesterday is still pretty dark. I haven’t changed anything I'm doing, not really. I just… keep noticing more. It’s kinda all over, not just one spot. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Hainley. So, bruising appearing more frequently, larger in size, and persisting longer than usual, and it’s fairly widespread. That is certainly worth looking into. Before we move forward, could you please remind me what blood thinner you are currently taking, and what is the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Sorry, I should have said that first. It’s… Warfarin. Five milligrams, once a day. Doctor Patel prescribed it about six months ago, after… well, after the DVT. I try to be really good about taking it at the same time every evening. I have all my pills in a little organizer, so I don’t mess up. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Ms. Hainley. Warfarin, five milligrams daily, prescribed for a deep vein thrombosis six months ago. And you’re diligent about taking it consistently, which is excellent. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Not really. No, not that I’ve noticed. No dizziness, no bleeding gums when I brush my teeth, no… weird smells or anything. Just the bruising. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but honestly, who doesn’t feel tired? I work a lot. I guess… maybe a little bit of aching in my legs, but that could just be from being on my feet all day. Nothing major, definitely not new.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hainley. No dizziness, no bleeding from gums or nose, no unusual smells, and only mild fatigue and leg aching that you attribute to work. That’s good to know. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on, so the sooner we get it done, the better. I've got a meeting at three, but I can probably rearrange things if I need to.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you for your flexibility. If you could please have a seat on the table, we’ll start with a visual inspection of the bruising. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Just to rule out anything obvious. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m observing several ecchymoses on your bilateral upper and lower extremities, varying in size from approximately 1 to 5 centimeters in diameter. The coloration ranges from reddish-purple to a darker, almost brownish hue, consistent with bruising at different stages of healing. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. I don’t detect any masses or organomegaly upon palpation.
PATIENT: Okay. That… doesn’t sound too bad, does it? I mean, I figured you’d find something awful. Is it… is it the Warfarin? Should I stop taking it? I don’t want to have another DVT, but this bruising is really worrying me. I haven’t hit my head or anything, it’s just… appearing. I keep checking myself, it's kinda ridiculous.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Ms. Hainley, and it's good you're being proactive. It's not necessarily pointing to something awful, but the bruising is significant enough that we need to investigate further, especially given your medication. Stopping the Warfarin abruptly is not recommended, as that would increase your risk of another DVT. We need to understand the cause of the bruising before making any changes to your treatment plan. To help determine the cause, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will include a complete blood count to assess your platelet count and look for any signs of anemia, a prothrombin time to check how well your Warfarin is working, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to evaluate your liver and kidney function. We'll also check a D-dimer to assess for ongoing clotting. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Blood tests sound… good. Better than just guessing, I guess. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what's going on. And… how long do the results take? I've got that meeting this afternoon, and I don't want to be… distracted all day worrying. And… is it going to be expensive? I don't have insurance, and… well, it adds up.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Ms. Hainley. Knowing what's going on is the priority, and you're right, guessing won't help. The blood tests should be processed fairly quickly. I anticipate we’ll have the results back by tomorrow afternoon, at the latest. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they are available. Regarding the cost, I'll be frank. Without insurance, these tests can be expensive. I'll have the billing department provide you with an estimate, and we can discuss potential options, such as a payment plan. I can also explore whether there are any assistance programs available in the area that might help offset the costs. I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to make this manageable. In the meantime, if you notice any new symptoms, such as bleeding from any site, severe headaches, dizziness, or shortness of breath, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else?
PATIENT: Okay, that's… good to know. Tomorrow afternoon is better than nothing. And I appreciate you looking into the cost, honestly. It’s a worry. No, I don’t think that's any questions right now. Just… get the results, and call me. And I'll watch for those symptoms. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I guess… that’s all for now. Is there anything you need from me? A list of medications, or…? I have a pretty good memory, but… you know. Just in case.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Hainley. I am glad I could address your concerns. While you have a good memory, it’s always best to have a complete list of your medications, allergies, and any previous surgeries on file. If you can gather that information, it would be helpful, but it’s not urgent. We can obtain it from your previous medical records if needed. For now, simply focusing on watching for those new symptoms and awaiting the test results is sufficient. I will have my nurse call you as soon as they are available. Thank you for your patience and cooperation. If anything changes or you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day, Ms. Hainley.
