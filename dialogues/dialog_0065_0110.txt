DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I’m Dr. Duplichan. It says here you're 87 years old. That's wonderful. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 87 years, give or take a few days! Well, to be quite honest, I feel…a little worn out. Not sick, mind you. Just…not as spry as I used to be. I’m hoping you can help me get a bit of a “reset,” a jumpstart, if you will, to feeling better. I want to keep going, you see. Keep doing things.
DOCTOR: A “reset,” hmm. I understand wanting to maintain your activity level. It’s good you’re proactive. When did you first start noticing this…loss of energy, Ms. McNabb?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It didn't happen suddenly, you see. It’s been…gradual. Maybe the last six months or so? It’s hard to say exactly. I used to walk every morning, down to the market and back, no problem at all. Now… Now I find myself needing to sit down halfway through, and sometimes even then, it’s a struggle. And I just don’t have the same…enthusiasm for things, you know?
DOCTOR: Six months… a gradual decline in energy and stamina. And you've noticed it specifically with your walks to the market. Do you experience this fatigue at other times of the day, or is it primarily when you’re being physically active?
PATIENT: It’s definitely worse with the walking, yes. But I do find myself…sleepier during the day. Not constantly, but…more often than I used to. And I don't seem to have as much strength for…well, for things around the house. Little things, you know? Like carrying groceries or gardening. It’s just…not as easy anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. Fatigue, increased daytime sleepiness, and decreased strength with everyday activities. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I have been a little more forgetful lately, but I always figured that just comes with age, you know? And…oh dear, sometimes my hands feel a bit…numb. Not all the time, but occasionally, especially in the mornings. It doesn’t hurt, just…tingly and numb. Is that…something to worry about?
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness is common, certainly, but we need to document everything. And the numbness in your hands…when you say mornings, is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Mostly in the mornings, like I said. It doesn’t last long, maybe ten or fifteen minutes, then it fades. It’s not terribly bothersome, honestly, but I thought I should mention it. I try to remember everything, but sometimes things just slip my mind these days!
DOCTOR: Right. Intermittent numbness in the mornings. And you've noticed some general forgetfulness. Now, Ms. McNabb, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had a touch of arthritis in my knees years ago, but it doesn’t bother me much anymore. And my blood pressure has been a little high on occasion, but I've been managing it with medication for quite some time now. Dr. Ramirez, bless his heart, used to be my doctor, but he retired a few years back. I’m with a new doctor now, but I haven’t seen him much. Other than that, I’ve been fairly healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Arthritis and hypertension, managed with medication. Do you recall the name of the medication you're taking for your blood pressure, Ms. McNabb?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a good question! I believe it's…lisinopril? Yes, that sounds right. A small white pill. I take one every morning. But honestly, Doctor, I leave most of that to my daughter. She helps me with my pills and keeps track of everything.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril. And your daughter assists with medication management. Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Not to food, not to medicine… nothing. I've always been a pretty lucky person, you see. I can eat anything, and I've never had a bad reaction to a pill or anything. Lucky, that's what my husband used to say.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. And you said your husband…is he still living?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. My husband, George, passed away… almost ten years ago now. It was a shock, you see. He was a good man. A very good man. It’s been quiet since then.
DOCTOR: Passed away ten years ago. And finally, Ms. McNabb, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes. I had my gallbladder removed years ago. And…and I had a hysterectomy when I was younger, back when I was still raising my children. Other than that…no, I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. It was a long time ago, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Cholecystectomy and hysterectomy. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your hands and feet. That is standard procedure, of course. Please relax.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’ll just… You just let me know if you need me to do anything. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths for me. Heart rate is regular, but somewhat diminished. Breath sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally, but no wheezing or crackles auscultated. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please extend your arms. Reflexes are slightly diminished in both upper extremities. Reflexes are also diminished in lower extremities. Now, let me examine your hands and feet. Skin is thin with some age spots. No edema noted. Capillary refill is slightly delayed, approximately three seconds. Similar findings in the feet. Alright. That concludes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't too bad. Everything feels…a bit wobbly now, but I suppose that’s to be expected. What did you find, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Your examination reveals some expected findings for your age—diminished reflexes and slightly delayed capillary refill, for example. However, the diminished breath sounds and overall weakness are concerning. Based on your symptoms and the examination, it appears you may be experiencing early signs of generalized frailty, potentially exacerbated by vitamin deficiencies and decreased muscle mass. We will need to rule out other possible causes, of course. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a vitamin D level, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. These will give us a clearer picture of your overall health.
PATIENT: Frailty? Vitamin deficiencies? Oh dear. I do try to eat well, but sometimes it’s just…easier to have something quick. And I haven't been out in the sun much lately. What does this mean, Doctor? Will I…will I need to be hospitalized? And what can I do about it? I really just want to feel like myself again, you see.
DOCTOR: Hospitalization is not indicated at this time, Ms. McNabb. However, ignoring these findings could lead to a decline in your functional status, potentially increasing your risk of falls and other complications. The blood tests will help us determine if you have any underlying deficiencies or medical conditions contributing to your symptoms. In the meantime, I recommend a referral to a physical therapist for a strength and balance evaluation. They can develop a personalized exercise program to help improve your muscle mass and stability. Additionally, I advise you to increase your intake of vitamin D-rich foods, such as fatty fish and fortified dairy products. If you are unable to obtain adequate vitamin D through diet alone, we can discuss supplementation. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… that sounds…tiring. But I suppose if it helps, I can try. And vitamin D…I do like a glass of milk with my breakfast. Will this be expensive, Doctor? I’m on a fixed income, you see. And…will the physical therapy be at your office? I don't drive anymore, and my daughter is very busy.
DOCTOR: The cost of physical therapy will depend on your insurance coverage, Ms. McNabb. I will have my staff assist you with verifying your benefits and estimating your out-of-pocket expenses. As for location, the physical therapy clinic I recommend is located near the hospital, and they do offer transportation assistance for patients with mobility limitations. However, it’s crucial that you adhere to the prescribed exercise program. Consistency is key to improving your strength and balance. Skipping appointments or neglecting your exercises will negate the benefits of treatment. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Transportation assistance…that would be very helpful. And I’ll try to be consistent, I promise. It’s just…sometimes it’s hard to motivate myself. My daughter, Elena, she’s very good at keeping me on track. Perhaps she can come with me to the first appointment. When will the results of the blood tests be back? And will someone call me to schedule the physical therapy?
DOCTOR: The blood test results should be available within 3-5 business days, Ms. McNabb. My staff will contact you by phone to schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are in. They will also assist you with coordinating the physical therapy referral and transportation arrangements. I’m also going to prescribe a daily vitamin D supplement, 2000 IU, to address your potential deficiency. It’s important to take this supplement as directed, even after you begin physical therapy. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and not just…dismissing me as an old woman. I’ll just…wait for my daughter to call and schedule everything. And I’ll try my best to be a good patient.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. McNabb. I expect you to. My staff will be in touch shortly. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. You may get dressed, and we'll see you again soon. .
PATIENT: .
