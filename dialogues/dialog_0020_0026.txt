DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just dreadful, it is. I feel like I’ve been run over by a truck some days. My husband, Tenzin, he keeps saying I need to rest more, but honestly, I haven’t been doing much differently. And the young man at the lab said something about… creatine? Sounds foreign. What is creatine, anyway?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness… that’s certainly something we can look into. And Tenzin sounds like a good man, looking out for you. Creatine kinase, or CK, is an enzyme released when muscle tissue breaks down. It’s good you mentioned that the lab spoke with you about it. It can be elevated for a number of reasons – sometimes just from normal activity, but it can also indicate something else is going on. To get a better idea of what’s causing your tiredness and the elevated CK, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Muscles breaking down? That sounds… alarming. I haven’t been doing anything strenuous, I assure you. Just the usual pottering about the house, a bit of gardening… although, now that you mention it, my arms were a bit sore after pruning the roses last week. But that’s just roses, isn’t it? I’ve been doing that for years. Honestly, dear, I feel like a right hypochondriac even coming here. Tenzin fussed so much about it, though. He always worries. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's good that you mentioned the rose pruning. And no, coming to see me isn’t being a hypochondriac at all – it’s smart to check things out when you’re feeling unwell, and Tenzin sounds like a caring husband. Muscle soreness after gardening can sometimes cause a temporary rise in CK, yes. But we need to rule out other possibilities. To help me do that, let’s talk a bit more about your tiredness. When did it start?
PATIENT: Oh, well… that’s a tricky one. It didn’t just start suddenly, you see. It’s been… creeping up on me, I suppose. Maybe a few months now? At first, I just thought I was getting older, you know? A bit more tired than usual. But it’s gotten worse lately. I used to be able to get through the whole day without a nap, but now… now I need to lie down for an hour or so in the afternoon, just to recover. And even then, I don’t feel quite right. It’s… draining, dear. Just draining. Do you understand? I feel like all the energy’s been sucked out of me.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Ardelle. That sounds very tiring, and it’s good you’re recognizing that this is more than just feeling a little older. It sounds like this has been gradually worsening over several months. Aside from the tiredness and the muscle soreness after gardening, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms. Let me think. My legs have been a bit… achy, sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. More in the evenings, I think. And I’ve been feeling a bit… well, clumsy. I nearly tripped over the rug yesterday, which isn't like me. And… oh, dear, this is awful, isn't it? I’m just a catalogue of complaints. But I have been feeling a bit… foggy-headed, if you know what I mean. Like I can’t quite concentrate. Tenzin says I repeat myself sometimes, too, but he always teases me about my memory. He says it's a woman's prerogative. Is that the right word? Prerogative?
DOCTOR: "Prerogative" is perfectly fine, Ardelle. And no, you’re not a catalogue of complaints at all. You’re giving me helpful information so I can understand what's going on. Leg aches, clumsiness, and feeling foggy-headed… those are all things we should consider. Has there been any change in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… well, it’s been a bit off, I suppose. Not that I’m not eating, you understand. Tenzin makes a lovely dhal, and I always have a good appetite for that. But I don’t crave things the way I used to. And I find I get full very quickly. It’s… peculiar. I used to enjoy a good second helping of everything, but now… now I just can’t manage it. Sometimes, I just don’t feel like eating at all. It’s as if… as if the joy has gone out of it, if you know what I mean. I try to eat, for Tenzin's sake, but it’s a bit of a chore, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's helpful, Ardelle. Loss of appetite and decreased enjoyment of food… We’re building a clearer picture now. Now, I’m going to ask some more general questions, just to get a full understanding of your health. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. Nothing serious, dear. I had a little sniffle back in… March, I think? Just a common cold. Tenzin fussed over me, made me hot lemon and ginger. It cleared up quickly, though. Nothing to write home about, certainly. And before that… I honestly can’t recall. I’ve always been quite healthy, you know. I eat my vegetables, I get plenty of rest… well, I used to get plenty of rest. And I don’t go out much, so I don't catch anything. I think I had a bit of a tummy upset last year, but that was just from something I ate, I expect. It wasn’t serious. Honestly, I can’t think of anything else. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older. Is that helpful, dear? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ardelle, that is helpful. And don't worry about your memory; it's perfectly normal for things to be a little less clear as we get older. You've had a mild cold recently and a tummy upset last year – that's good to know. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. Well, I take a little something for my arthritis in my hands, you know? Just to keep the swelling down. It’s… naproxen, I think? Or something like that. Tenzin gets it for me. And I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because the doctor said I wasn't getting enough sun. That’s about it, dear. Nothing else. I don’t believe in taking too many pills, you know? Let nature take its course, that’s what I always say. And Tenzin makes me a lovely ginger tea, which is good for everything, he says. Is that all you need to know, dear? I hope I'm not being a bother.
DOCTOR: No, you're not being a bother at all, Ardelle. Naproxen for arthritis and vitamin D in the winter – good to know. Now, I'm going to ask about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. Not that I know of, dear. I've never had a reaction to anything. Tenzin always checks before giving me anything new, though. He’s very careful, you see. I don’t think I’ve ever had a problem with food either. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I don’t particularly care for okra, but that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. And I’ve never been stung by a bee or anything like that. I’ve always been quite lucky, you know. No allergies at all, as far as I know. Honestly, I can't think of anything else. Is that helpful, dear? I hope I’m not forgetting anything important. My mind is a bit of a blank, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Ardelle. No known allergies – that’s good to know. And don’t worry about forgetting things; we can always revisit questions if we need to. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tricky one, dear. My family… well, we didn’t talk about these things much when I was growing up. It wasn’t considered polite, you see. My mother… she had arthritis, I think. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I believe. But honestly, I don’t know much more than that. They both lived to a good old age, though. My mother was 85, and my father was 90. So, I suppose they weren’t too badly off. And my brother… he was always very healthy. He passed away a few years ago, sadly, but it was a sudden thing. A heart attack, I think. It wasn't something he’d been warned about. Honestly, I’m not very good with these things. I don’t keep track of these things, you see. Is that helpful, dear? I hope I’m not forgetting anything important. My mind is a bit of a blank, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ardelle. Arthritis and high blood pressure in your parents, and a heart attack in your brother – thank you for sharing that. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, dear. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were dreadful for you, and I always listened to my mother. And alcohol… well, I might have a sip of wine on special occasions, like Christmas or a birthday. But that's about it. I don't drink regularly. I prefer a nice cup of ginger tea, you see. Tenzin enjoys a beer sometimes, but he doesn't overdo it. He's a very sensible man. Honestly, I don’t believe in these vices, you see. They're no good for you. Is that helpful, dear? I hope I'm not being a bother. My mind is a bit of a blank, you see.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being a bother at all, Ardelle. That's good to know. No smoking and very limited alcohol consumption. Now, finally, can you tell me a little bit about your daily activities?
PATIENT: Oh, my daily activities… well, it's not very exciting, dear. I mostly potter about the house, you see. I do the cooking, the cleaning, the gardening. I enjoy looking after the roses, they’re my pride and joy. I read a bit, mostly historical novels. I watch a bit of television in the evenings, mostly news and documentaries. And I go for a short walk in the park sometimes, when the weather is nice. But I don't get out much, to be honest. I prefer the comfort of my own home. And I have Tenzin, of course. We mostly just enjoy each other's company. It's a quiet life, but it's a good life. I suppose it's getting harder, though. The tiredness makes everything a bit more difficult. Is that helpful, dear? I hope I’m not being a bother. My mind is a bit of a blank, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ardelle, that's very helpful. It sounds like you live a full and active life, despite the tiredness. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a quick look at your hands and feet. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. If you think it's necessary. I don't mind a bit of poking and prodding. Just be gentle with my hands, you see. They're a bit arthritic, as I mentioned. And I hope you don't find anything too dreadful. I do worry, you know. I’m not as strong as I used to be. But do what you need to do, dear. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, please. And let me know if you find anything worrying. I’m not very good with medical things, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. I’ll be very gentle. Let’s start with listening to your heart and lungs. Okay. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit quiet. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which can be normal with age, but we’ll keep an eye on that. I see some swelling and tenderness in your hands, consistent with arthritis. And your feet look good. No swelling or redness. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Now, based on everything you've told me and the physical exam, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us to get a clearer picture of what's going on and rule out any underlying conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Blood tests… I don’t particularly like blood tests, but if you think it’s necessary, then do what you need to do. I hope they don’t take too much. I get a bit faint, you see. And I hope the results aren't too dreadful. What are you looking for, dear? Is it something serious? I do worry, you know. But do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know when they’ll have the results. And I hope it doesn’t take too long. I’m not very patient, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ardelle. We'll take it slowly and try to make it as comfortable as possible. We’ll only take a small amount of blood, and a nurse will be right there to help. The tests will help us to check your complete blood count, kidney and liver function, thyroid levels, vitamin D levels, and a few other things. We'll also check your creatine kinase level again, just to see if it has changed. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but it's best to rule out any underlying causes for your tiredness and muscle aches. The results usually take a few days to come back. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, and we can discuss them in more detail then. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant weakness, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. That sounds… sensible. Checking everything, that’s a good idea. And I’ll try to remember all of those things you said. Shortness of breath, chest pain, weakness… I hope I don't get any of those. I’m not very good at remembering things, you see. But I’ll do my best. And I’ll wait for your call. A few days, you said? I hope it doesn’t take too long. I’m not very patient, you see. But I trust your judgment. Thank you, dear. You’ve been very kind. Now, can I go home? I’m feeling a bit tired, you see. All of this talking has been exhausting.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ardelle, you can absolutely go home. I understand it's tiring being a patient. I’ll have the nurse come in and give you the lab order and instructions for the blood tests. And please, don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Thank you for coming in today. And please, try to rest and take it easy. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. You’ve been very kind. And thank you for your help. I do appreciate it. I’ll try to rest, as you said. And I’ll wait for your call. I’m feeling a bit better now, just knowing that you’re looking into things. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll go home and lie down. It’s been a long morning. Thank you again, dear. And goodbye.
DOCTOR: You take care, Ardelle. Goodbye. .
