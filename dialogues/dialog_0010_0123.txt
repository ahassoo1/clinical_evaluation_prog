DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It’s driving me crazy, honestly. Just… all over, really. Not like a rash, just… itchy. It started a few weeks ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, "itchy all over" that started a few weeks ago. I understand. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. It's not always itchy, thank goodness. But when it is itchy, it really gets bad. Especially at night, I think. That's when it keeps me up. It’s just… uncomfortable, you know? I’ve tried lotion, but it doesn't really help for very long.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It's frustrating when something like that disrupts your sleep. Lotion can provide temporary relief, but it sounds like we need to figure out what's causing the itch. Before we go further, are there any areas that are more itchy than others?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's pretty even, I'd say. But maybe my back is the worst? It's hard to reach, so I probably don't put lotion on there enough. And my shoulders, too. Those are a little harder to get to myself. But really, it's all over, like I said. Not one specific spot, just… general itchiness. It's just… annoying!
DOCTOR: "General itchiness" that's worse on your back and shoulders… alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… not really, I don’t think. I haven’t changed my laundry detergent or anything like that. I've been eating pretty much the same things. My grandson came to visit last month… he has allergies, but I didn’t hug him too close or anything. I don't know… nothing obvious, really. It just started one day. It's a little strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent changes in detergent, diet, or exposure to allergens… That's helpful. Now, let’s talk a little more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the itchiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever or anything like that. No… bumps, like a rash. Just the itch. Maybe… I have been a little tired lately, but I’m 70 years old! So, that’s probably just old age, right? I don’t know if that’s related, but that's the only other thing I can think of. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. Fatigue is something to note. Now, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, really. I take a little bit of something for my blood pressure, but that's it. My regular doctor prescribed it. And like I said, I don’t have any food allergies. I eat pretty much anything. I used to love a good arroz con gandules, but that's beside the point! I’ve never had to go to the hospital for allergies or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies, and you're only taking medication for blood pressure. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. I had high cholesterol for a while, but that's under control with diet and a little pill. And, oh! I had a hysterectomy many years ago, when I was younger. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major. My blood pressure is usually pretty good, like I said. I try to eat healthy, mostly. I see my regular doctor every year for a checkup. She always says I’m doing pretty well for my age, knock on wood!
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of high cholesterol – currently controlled – and a hysterectomy in the past. That’s helpful. And just to be thorough, has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, or severe allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, good question! Let me see... My mother had dry skin, always complaining about it. And my grandmother… she had something on her hands, I think. A rash, maybe? She used a lot of creams. It wasn’t anything too serious, as far as I know. My father and brother were pretty healthy, never had any skin problems. I don't remember anything else, really. My family wasn't big on talking about medical things, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. Okay, some family history of dry skin and a rash on your grandmother’s hands. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, one last question. Have you been experiencing any unexplained weight loss, night sweats, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No weight loss, I actually think I've gained a little weight! No night sweats, thankfully. And my… you know… bowel habits are perfectly normal. Everything is working as it should, thank goodness. I'm just really bothered by this itch, that's all. It’s just… driving me crazy!
DOCTOR: Okay, no unexplained weight loss, night sweats, or changes in bowel habits. That’s all very helpful information. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to take a look at your skin and see if anything obvious stands out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this itch figured out. It's been so annoying! I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m looking closely at your skin now. I notice some areas of dryness, particularly on your forearms, and a few faint scratches, consistent with itching. There are no obvious rashes, hives, or lesions. Your skin feels warm to the touch, and there is no significant swelling. Okay, everything looks fairly normal visually, though the dryness and scratches are consistent with your complaint of itchiness. I don’t see anything alarming. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. I'm glad you're being thorough. It's just… it's so relentless! I try to ignore it, but it’s hard. Listening to my heart and lungs sounds sensible. I always worry a little about my heart, you know, being my age.
DOCTOR: Alright, your heart and lungs sound good. Regular rhythm, clear breath sounds. No immediate concerns there. Given everything you've told me, and the findings of the exam, I suspect this could be dry skin exacerbated by… well, just age. As we get older, our skin tends to lose moisture more easily. But, given the relentless nature of the itch, and to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few blood tests. Specifically, I’m thinking a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. These will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the itch. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. If it rules things out, that's good. I'd rather be safe than sorry, you know? Blood tests sound… fine. I'm not a big fan of needles, but if it's necessary, it's necessary. So, yes. Let's do the blood tests. Do I need to fast for any of them?
DOCTOR: Yes, good. Fasting is required for the comprehensive metabolic panel. That means no food or drink – except water – for at least 8-12 hours before the test. We can schedule those for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. The complete blood count and thyroid test don’t require fasting, so we can do those whenever is convenient. While we wait for the results, I'm going to recommend a few things you can do at home. First, use a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day, especially after showering. Second, avoid hot showers or baths, as these can dry out your skin. And third, try to wear loose-fitting, cotton clothing. I'm also going to prescribe a mild topical corticosteroid cream to help relieve the itch. It's a low-strength cream, so it shouldn’t have any significant side effects, but be sure to follow the instructions carefully. Does that all sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Thank you. Fragrance-free moisturizer, cooler showers, cotton clothing… I can definitely do that. And I’ll be careful with the cream. Tomorrow morning for the blood tests is fine. I’ll make sure to fast. It’s a little annoying, but I’d rather do it right. Thank you for being so thorough. Hopefully, it’s just dry skin, but I feel better knowing we’re checking everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m glad I could help. It’s always best to be thorough. I’ll have the lab order sent to the lab, and my nurse will give you the instructions for the blood tests before you leave. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they come back, usually within a few days. In the meantime, if the itch becomes significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms, such as fever, rash, or swelling, please don’t hesitate to call us right away. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful and explained everything clearly. I feel much better now, and I’ll follow your instructions. Thank you again. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m glad I could ease your mind. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. My nurse will be with you shortly to go over the lab instructions. .
PATIENT:
