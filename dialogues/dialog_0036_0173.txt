DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been getting chills, and it’s a little worrying. Not like a fever chill, just… cold. It's been going on for a few days now.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills for a few days. That is worth looking into. Can you tell me a little more about these chills?
PATIENT: Hmm, okay. Well, they don't really come and go with anything specific, you know? Like, it’s not after being cold or anything. They just… happen. Sometimes they’re really noticeable, like a proper shiver, and other times it’s just a feeling of being cold, even when I’m not. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Jailenne. Don't worry about explaining perfectly; I'll ask clarifying questions. So, these chills happen randomly, regardless of your temperature or activity level. And you said they vary in intensity – sometimes a full shiver, sometimes just a feeling of coldness. Are you experiencing anything else along with these chills?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sums it up pretty well. And… now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit tired, more than usual. Not like, can't-get-out-of-bed tired, but just… worn out. And maybe a little achy? Like my muscles feel a bit sore, but nothing major. I just figured it was from walking so much, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some muscle aches along with the chills. That’s helpful. When did you start noticing the fatigue and aches?
PATIENT: Umm… probably around the same time as the chills, so… maybe three or four days ago? It’s all kind of blending together, to be honest. I didn’t really think much of it at first, just figured I was pushing myself too hard with work. But the chills are what really made me want to come in.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, the fatigue and muscle aches started around the same time as the chills, roughly three to four days ago. And it was the chills that prompted you to schedule an appointment. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm, not really. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, ages ago. And I get the usual colds and flu like everyone else, but nothing major. No serious illnesses or anything. I’m usually pretty healthy, which is why this is a bit worrying. Oh! And I had a bad case of the flu a couple of years ago, but that's it, I think. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Jailenne. Appendix removal as a child, typical colds and flu, and a more significant flu a couple of years ago. No other major medical issues. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Let me think… my mom has high blood pressure, and my dad has diabetes, but other than that, everyone’s pretty healthy too. No history of anything weird or anything like autoimmune diseases or anything, if that's what you mean? I’m not sure if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, so thank you for sharing that. So, your mom has high blood pressure and your dad has diabetes, but no significant family history of autoimmune diseases or other major illnesses. Now, can you tell me a little about what you do?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. I’m a Health Education Specialist. Basically, I teach people about staying healthy – ironic, right? I work at a community center, doing workshops and stuff. It’s a pretty active job, lots of walking and talking. And sometimes it’s stressful, trying to get people motivated.
DOCTOR: It is a bit ironic, yes, but it sounds like very important work! A lot of walking, talking, and potentially some stress. That's helpful to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s quickly cover allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no allergies at all! And I don't take any medications regularly. Just over-the-counter stuff when I have a headache or something. Nothing prescribed, definitely. I'm pretty lucky on that front.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies and no regular medications. That simplifies things nicely. Okay, Jailenne, I’d like to do a quick physical exam now. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, take your temperature, check your throat, and feel your lymph nodes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Sounds good. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart rate is 78 beats per minute, which is normal. Rhythm is regular. Your lungs sound clear; no wheezing or crackles that I can detect. Your throat looks a little red, but no obvious signs of infection like white patches. Your lymph nodes are slightly tender, but not significantly enlarged. Your temperature is 99.1 Fahrenheit – a little elevated, but not a high fever. So, a slightly elevated temperature, a little redness in your throat, and slightly tender lymph nodes. Everything else seems normal at this point.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… not too bad? Is that what that means? I'm just trying to figure out if I should be panicking or not. Honestly, I’ve been a bit stressed lately, so maybe the lymph nodes are just reacting to that?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, and a good observation about the stress. It's good you're aware of that. The findings aren't alarming, Jailenne, but they do warrant further investigation to rule out potential causes. The slight elevation in temperature, redness in your throat, and tender lymph nodes could be indicative of a viral infection – like a common cold – but we need to be sure. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a rapid strep test. The CBC will help us look for signs of infection, and the rapid strep test will rule out strep throat. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds… sensible. Definitely. If that's what you think is best, then yes, please. I’d rather know for sure. A CBC and a strep test… got it. How long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Great. A CBC and a rapid strep test it is. The rapid strep test should be back within a few minutes, while the CBC will take a little longer – usually around 24 to 48 hours. The lab will send the results directly to my office. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids, and taking an over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen or ibuprofen for any discomfort. Do you have any questions for me while we wait for the strep test result?
PATIENT: Okay, 24 to 48 hours for the CBC, got it. And rest and fluids… that’s manageable. Um… If it is strep, is that serious? I mean, I know I need antibiotics, but… is it something I should be really worried about? I’ve heard horror stories.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, and I understand your concern. Strep throat, if left untreated, can lead to complications, but those are relatively rare these days with prompt diagnosis and treatment. The most common complication is rheumatic fever, which can affect the heart, but again, that’s much less common with antibiotics. We’ll know very soon if it’s strep, and if it is, we’ll start you on antibiotics immediately. If it’s not strep, it’s likely a viral infection, which will resolve on its own with supportive care – rest, fluids, and pain relief. Let’s focus on getting the test results first, and then we’ll address any further concerns. The nurse will be in shortly to draw some blood for the CBC. In the meantime, I’m going to go check on another patient, but I’ll be right back once the strep test results are available. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds alright. And thanks for explaining everything. It makes me feel a little better, honestly. Just… waiting is the worst part. I’ll try to relax while I wait.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. Waiting is the hardest part, I agree. I'll be back as soon as I have the results. Please don’t hesitate to let the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns while I'm away.
PATIENT: Okay, will do. Thank you, Doctor.
