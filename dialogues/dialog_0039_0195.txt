DOCTOR: Hello Janeth, welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… alright to meet you. I just… well, it's a bit silly, really. I need a card. A “Get Well” card, or maybe one with some encouragement. You know, from a real doctor. Not one of those printed things my daughter sends. It just feels… more official, coming from you.
DOCTOR: Well, that’s… a unique request, Janeth! I haven’t had anyone ask for that before, but certainly not silly at all. I completely understand wanting something a bit more personal. Let me just… pause for a moment. Before I write anything, just so I can get a little context, is this card for you, or are you hoping to send it to someone else?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s for me, Doctor. Yes, for me. My daughter, she means well, bless her, but she just doesn't understand. She thinks a little rest and some herbal tea will fix everything. Like it’s that simple! It’s… a bit more complicated than that, you see. And a card from a proper doctor… well, it would just be… reassuring.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re feeling a bit dismissed, and you’d like a little validation. That’s perfectly reasonable, Janeth. It’s important to have your concerns taken seriously. Before I write anything on a card, could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… everything, really. The aches, the tiredness… just feeling old, I suppose. My joints, they creak like an old door. And I don’t have the energy I used to. It's not like I'm expecting a miracle, Doctor. I just… I want someone to acknowledge that getting old isn’t exactly a picnic. My daughter, she says I just need to “stay positive.” Honestly, sometimes I think she just wants me to be quiet.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot, Janeth. And it's frustrating when people don't quite understand what you're going through. It is hard getting older, and it's okay to not feel okay. When did these aches and tiredness start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been… a slow creep, really. Not something that happened overnight. Probably… oh, a year or so ago. At first, it was just a little stiffness in the mornings. I thought it was the weather. But then it started lasting longer, and spreading… You know, to my knees, my back… even my hands. Now, it’s just… most of the time. And the tiredness… well, that's always there, it feels like.
DOCTOR: A year ago, starting with morning stiffness that's gradually worsened and spread… and consistent tiredness. Okay. And is the stiffness worse at any particular time of day, or after certain activities?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely worse in the mornings. It takes ages to get going. I feel like an eighty-year-old trying to get out of bed. And after I’ve been… doing things. Even just gardening, you know? I like to potter about in the garden, but afterwards… ooh, the pain. It's a shame, really. I used to be able to do so much more.
DOCTOR: Worse in the mornings, and after activity…gardening specifically. Okay. And on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you say your pain is on a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, zero to ten, you say? Hmm… well, it's rarely a ten. I don’t think I’ve ever had a proper ten. But… on a typical day? Probably a five or six, I’d say. Sometimes it dips down to a four, if I’ve been resting. But more often it’s a five or six. It's just… there. A dull ache, mostly. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, but it makes them… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: A five or six, mostly a dull ache, interfering with your daily activities… I understand. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the aches and tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… well, I’ve been a bit… forgetful lately. Nothing serious, mind you. Just… misplacing things. My glasses, mostly. And sometimes I struggle to find the right word. My daughter says it’s just age, but… it does worry me a bit. And my sleep hasn't been great. I wake up a lot during the night.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness and disrupted sleep… Okay. And do you experience any swelling or redness in your joints?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no swelling. Not that I've noticed. They don't look any different, just… achey. And no redness, either. Just… old. That's the best way to describe it, I think. Just… everything feels old and worn out.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, years ago, when my daughter was little, I had… what was it… high blood pressure, they said. But they gave me some pills, and it went away. And I had a bit of trouble with my gallbladder once, but they took it out. Other than that… nothing much. I’ve always been a healthy person, really. Until now, of course.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in the past, managed with medication, gallbladder removed…Okay. Are you currently taking any medications for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not currently. They took me off the blood pressure pills years ago. I haven’t needed anything since, until… well, now, perhaps. I don’t really want to take pills, you know? They always make me feel… sluggish.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no allergies. I eat everything. My daughter always worries about me trying new foods, but I've never had a problem. Honestly, I think she worries too much. She thinks I'm made of glass. But I'm a sturdy woman, I assure you. I’ve lived a long life, and I've never had any allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, before we go any further, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your joints, listen to your heart and lungs, and get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it's necessary. I don’t really like being poked and prodded, but I suppose it's part of being a doctor. Just… be gentle, please. And don't take too long. I have a bit of gardening I need to do later, if my joints will allow it.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be as gentle as possible. It won't take long. If you could just sit here for me, and we’ll get started. Alright, I’m checking your range of motion in your shoulders, elbows, wrists, and knees… There’s some mild crepitus in your knees, and slightly limited range of motion in both hands. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I’m palpating your joints… there’s no significant swelling or redness, but there is some tenderness to the touch in your knees and hands. Okay, that’s all for now. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing osteoarthritis, also known as wear-and-tear arthritis. It’s very common as people get older. The aches, stiffness, tiredness, and crepitus in your knees are all consistent with this. However, to be sure, I’d like to order some blood work and an X-ray of your knees to rule out other possibilities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, arthritis, you say? That sounds… unpleasant. My mother had something similar, I think. A lot of pain, she had. Blood work and an X-ray… alright, if you think it's necessary. I still don't really like being poked and prodded, but I suppose it's better to know what I'm dealing with. Will it take long? I really would like to get back to my garden, if possible. And… will it be expensive? I don't have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Janeth. It’s good that we're getting to the bottom of this. Arthritis can be managed, and we can explore different options to help you feel better. The blood work is fairly straightforward, and the X-ray will only take a few minutes. We can get those ordered today. As for the cost… Let me see… the blood work will be around $75, and the X-ray around $120. I know that’s not ideal without insurance. We do have a payment plan option available, and I can also discuss some lower-cost resources in the area that might be able to help. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I recommend trying some over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, and gentle exercises to keep your joints moving. Avoid activities that aggravate your pain, and consider using a warm compress to help soothe your joints. Does that sound alright for now?
PATIENT: Oh, $195… well, that's… a bit steep. But I suppose it’s better than being in pain. A payment plan would be helpful, yes, very helpful. And ibuprofen… I’ve used that before, for headaches. Gentle exercises… alright, I can try that. Though my daughter says I overdo things. Now, about that card… you haven't forgotten about the card, have you? I was hoping you might be able to write something… reassuring. Something a proper doctor would say. Perhaps about taking care of oneself? Or… about arthritis?
DOCTOR: Of course not, Janeth, I haven't forgotten about the card. That was the reason for your visit, after all! And I apologize for getting so caught up in the medical details that I neglected that request. Let me see… how about this?
PATIENT: Oh, do go on. I’m quite eager to see what a proper doctor would write. It’s the thought that counts, you know. A few kind words can make all the difference.
DOCTOR: "Dear Janeth, It was a pleasure meeting you today. Remember that taking care of yourself – both physically and emotionally – is the most important thing you can do. It's okay to acknowledge when things are difficult, and to seek help when you need it. We're working to understand what’s going on, and we'll create a plan to help you feel your best. Please be kind to yourself, and remember that you are not alone. Small steps each day can make a big difference. Wishing you strength and comfort. Sincerely, Voula Kamahele, MD" How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, that’s… very nice. Very kind, indeed. “Small steps each day”… that’s good advice. And “be kind to yourself”… I suppose I haven't been doing enough of that lately. Thank you. That’s… exactly what I needed to hear. Perhaps I will try those small steps, and be a little kinder to myself. And perhaps, just perhaps, I will go back to my garden.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janeth. I’m glad I could help. Remember, I’m here for you. We’ll take things one step at a time. And please, do go back to your garden. Gentle activity can be very therapeutic, as long as you listen to your body. Now, let’s get those blood work and X-ray orders scheduled for you. And we’ll discuss the payment plan options after that. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Let’s get those orders done. And thank you again for the card… it’s more than just a piece of paper, you know. It’s… reassurance. And that’s very valuable.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janeth. I’m happy to help. Alright, let’s get this started. I'll need a little bit of information from you… just your date of birth and a current address for the billing.
