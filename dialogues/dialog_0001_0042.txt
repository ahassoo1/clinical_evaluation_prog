DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammann, let's get this over with. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doc, Audel, right? Heard good things about you settling in here. What brings me in… well, I reckon I'm gettin' on in years, and want to keep myself goin’ as long as I can. Just feelin' like maybe I could use a little… tune-up, I guess you'd call it. Men’s health, that’s what the lady on the phone said. Keepin' things workin' properly, you know?
DOCTOR: "Tune-up," huh?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds silly when I say it out loud, don’t it? But my son, he’s real good with cars, always talkin’ about maintainin’ things. Figured it couldn't hurt to think of myself the same way. I just want to feel… strong, I guess. And keep bein’ able to do things around the house. I still do all my own etchings, you know. That takes a bit of muscle.
DOCTOR: Etchings... Right. Look, Mr. Kammann, I appreciate you comin' in, but "feeling strong" isn't exactly a medical complaint. We gotta be specific here. Are you havin' any actual problems?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ actual, not that I can put my finger on. I sleep alright, eat pretty good – mostly. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn’t? I just… well, I worry about things slowin’ down, you know? Like my energy. And… things just aren’t as sharp as they used to be, mentally. It’s subtle, but it's there. I don’t want to be a burden on folks. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: So, vague fatigue and… diminished mental acuity. Alright. Let’s try this. Any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Not really. I still enjoy a good meal. Maybe I don't crave things quite as much as I used to, but I eat when I'm hungry. Mostly traditional Cherokee foods, when I can get 'em. Wild rice, beans, squash... things like that. And I do enjoy a good piece of frybread now and then, even though my daughter tells me I shouldn’t. But no, doc, I ain’t lost my appetite.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about… bowel movements?
PATIENT: Well, now that's a question. Seems personal, don't it? They're… regular enough. Not perfect, mind you. Sometimes a little slow, sometimes a little… quicker than I'd like. But nothin’ drastic. No blood, no pain, nothin’ like that. Just… old man stuff, I reckon. Is this somethin’ you ask everybody?
DOCTOR: It's a standard part of the exam, Mr. Kammann. We gotta rule things out. Alright. Any trouble urinating?
PATIENT: No trouble at all. Actually, maybe a little more frequent than it used to be, now that I think about it. Especially at night. I might get up once or twice, but I don't mind too much. Just… part of gettin' older, I always figured. I ain't feelin' any burnin' or discomfort, nothin' like that. Just… gotta go a little more often. Is that somethin' to worry about?
DOCTOR: Increased nighttime urination… Alright. Let's move on. Any history of diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Now, that's a good question. Let me think… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she got real sick towards the end. I don’t rightly recall the name of it, but the doctor said it was somethin’ to do with sugar. She was always thirsty, and tired. She passed when I was just a boy, so I don't remember a whole lot. My father’s side… not that I know of. We didn't talk much about health problems back then. It wasn’t somethin’ folks dwelled on. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… Hmm. My son, Dale, he's real particular about me checkin’ it at the drugstore. He worries. I try to go every couple of months, and it's usually a little high, but not too bad. The pharmacist always says to watch my salt intake. I reckon I eat a bit too much bacon. I don’t think anyone else in the family ever had it, not that I know of. But Dale’s always on me about it, so I try to keep an eye on it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis in my hands. Doctor gave it to me a few years back. Celecoxib, I think it’s called. Helps with the stiffness, mostly. And I take a multivitamin every day. Dale made me get that one too. He’s a good boy, always lookin’ out for me. That’s about it. Nothin' else. I try to stay away from too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammann. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Just need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and maybe a quick prostate exam.
PATIENT: A prostate exam, you say? Well now… I reckon I was hopin’ to avoid somethin’ like that, Doc. Is that really necessary? I ain't feelin’ any… discomfort down there, nothin’ that would suggest somethin’s wrong. But, if you think it's important… I suppose I trust your judgment. Just… try to be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Kammann. We need to rule things out. It'll only take a moment. Just try to relax.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it over with. I'm a tough old Cherokee, Doc. I've seen worse. But… maybe you could tell me what you're lookin' for while you're doin' it? Just to put my mind at ease. What kinda problems would show up in somethin' like this?
DOCTOR: We're checkin’ for enlargement, tenderness, and any irregularities. Enlargement could indicate an enlarged prostate, which is common with age. Tenderness could suggest infection or inflammation. Irregularities could be a sign of something more serious. It’s mostly just a feelin’ thing. Everything feels normal so far. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Well, that weren't as bad as I was expectin'. Glad to hear everything feels normal, Doc. Thanks for bein' gentle. Go ahead then. Just let me know if you hear somethin' you don't like, alright? I'm a pretty open book, Doc. Anything you need to know, just ask. I've lived a long life, seen a lot of changes. Hopefully, my insides are still holdin’ up alright.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear, with some mild wheezing. Not particularly concerning for your age, but we should keep an eye on it. Blood pressure is 142/88. Elevated, as expected. Alright, Mr. Kammann. Based on what you've told me and the preliminary exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some age-related changes. Fatigue, mild wheezing, slightly elevated blood pressure, and possible prostate enlargement. Nothing immediately alarming, but we need to address it. I recommend a complete blood count, a lipid panel, and a prostate-specific antigen test. We’ll also need to monitor your blood pressure regularly. I’m also going to prescribe a low-dose diuretic to help with your blood pressure. And I strongly recommend you cut back on your salt intake. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in six weeks to discuss the lab results and assess your progress. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Well, that's… a lot to take in, Doc. A diuretic, huh? I've heard those can make you… frequent. I was just complainin' about that earlier! And a lipid panel… what exactly is that checkin' for? And what about the prostate test? Is that somethin’ serious? You said nothin’ was alarmingly wrong, but now you’re doin’ more tests… It's kinda confusing, Doc. I'm just tryin' to understand what's goin' on with my body. I don't want a lot of fancy words, just… plain English. Are these tests gonna tell you if somethin' is really wrong? And if they do… what happens next?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammann, let me explain this in simple terms. A lipid panel checks your cholesterol levels. High cholesterol can lead to heart disease, so it's important to monitor it. The prostate test checks for elevated levels of prostate-specific antigen, which can indicate prostate cancer. It doesn't necessarily mean you have cancer. It just means we need to investigate further if the levels are elevated. We'll do more tests if that happens. The diuretic will help lower your blood pressure by making you urinate more frequently. It's a common side effect. You'll need to adjust your fluid intake accordingly. Look, Mr. Kammann, I've explained everything as clearly as I can. We're just being proactive. These tests will give us a better understanding of your overall health. If anything is seriously wrong, we'll discuss treatment options. But right now, there's no need to panic. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: I reckon I understand a little better now, Doc. But… what if the tests do show somethin’ wrong? What kinda treatment options are we talkin' about? For the cholesterol, and… and if it’s somethin' with the prostate? I'm a simple man, Doc, and I don’t want to be burdened with too much worry. I've lived a good life, Doc, but I'd like to keep livin' it for as long as I can. I just want to know what I'm lookin' at, if somethin' bad turns up. Are we talkin' surgery? Radiation? Or just… more pills? And… will these tests interfere with my etchings? I need a steady hand, Doc. That's important to me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammann, let's not get ahead of ourselves. If your cholesterol levels are elevated, treatment options include lifestyle changes – diet and exercise – and medication, like statins. Statins have some side effects, but they're generally well-tolerated. If the prostate test is elevated, we'll need to do a biopsy to determine if you have cancer. If you do have cancer, treatment options depend on the stage and grade of the cancer. They can include surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy. As for your etchings… I doubt any of these tests will interfere with your ability to create art. But if you experience any side effects from the treatment, like tremors or fatigue, you may need to adjust your activities accordingly. Look, Mr. Kammann, I've given you a general overview of the potential treatment options. But it's too early to say anything for sure. We need to wait for the lab results before we can make any decisions. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doc… I reckon that’s enough for now. Too much to take in, too much worry. I'll… I'll get the tests done. And I'll see you in six weeks. Thank you, Doc. I appreciate you takin' the time to explain things… even if I didn’t understand all of it. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Get the tests done as soon as possible. And try not to worry. Good day. .
