DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Mitchell. It’s nice to meet you too. I have… a headache. In the back of my head. It’s been there for… a little while now. Not a bad pain, but… constant.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mitchell. A constant headache, you say, located at the back of your head. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, constant. Like… a weight. Not sharp, not pounding. Just… there. Been maybe… two weeks now? Hard to say exactly, time goes. I mostly feel it when I stand up. Or when I’ve been… thinking hard about things. Like work. I used to work with the trains, you know. Rail yard. Lots of… moving things around. Now I mostly just… sit. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mitchell. A constant, weighted sensation at the back of your head for approximately two weeks, and it seems to be exacerbated by standing or mental exertion. To help me understand this better, could you rate the pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… hmm. Worst pain… I broke my arm once, falling off a… well, never mind. This isn’t that bad. I’d say… a three? Maybe a four on a bad day. Most of the time, it’s more like a two. It doesn't stop me from doing things, but… it’s annoying. And sometimes it makes it hard to… focus.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mitchell. A three to four out of ten, primarily a two, with some difficulty focusing. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. Sometimes… my vision gets a little blurry. Just for a second, when I stand up too fast. And… oh! My neck feels a little stiff. Not always, but sometimes. Especially in the morning. I don't know if that's the headache or… just old age, maybe? I'm ninety years old, you know. Things break.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mitchell. Blurry vision upon standing, and some neck stiffness, especially in the mornings. We’ll certainly consider all of that. Now, regarding your past medical history, do you have any known medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor told me once, a long time ago, to watch my salt. But I don't remember ever taking pills for it. Diabetes… no. Never been told that. Heart problems… I get a little short of breath sometimes when I walk up the stairs, but I figured that was just… the age again. I worked hard my whole life, you know. Rail yard work is not easy. I don't really have a history, if that makes sense. Never been to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mitchell. It sounds like you haven't had extensive medical care in the past, and that's perfectly alright. You mentioned being advised to watch your salt intake for possible high blood pressure, and experiencing some shortness of breath. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was… a long time ago. And… I broke my arm, like I said. Falling off the truck. They set it in a cast. That was all. No other surgeries. And I've never been in the hospital except for that. Just the doctor's office now and then. A check-up here and there. Mostly just trying to keep going, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mitchell. An appendectomy and a broken arm in the past, with no other surgical history or hospitalizations. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't take anything. Not even vitamins. I always figured… good food and hard work were enough. My wife, she used to take something for her… arthritis, I think. But she passed away five years ago. I haven’t really gotten around to… needing anything, if you understand. I just… drink my coffee and try to stay warm.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mitchell. No current medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything. My wife, she was careful about peanuts. But I never had a problem. Never had a rash or… trouble breathing or anything. Just… normal. I don't think I'm allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Very good. And finally, regarding your family history, do you know of any relatives who have had similar headaches, neurological problems, or other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a hard one. My mother… she complained about headaches a lot. Just… tension headaches, I think. From worrying. My brother… he had… problems with his stomach. But not headaches. My wife’s family… I don’t really know much about them. They lived far away. They mostly had… normal problems, I guess. Old age problems. But no one that I remember ever had headaches like this. Constant, you know? Just… regular headaches, from time to time. Not like this one.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mitchell. That gives me a good understanding of your medical background. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination to get a better sense of what might be causing your headache. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are. I just want to… feel better. This headache is… bothersome, you know? Not terrible, but… constant. So whatever you need to do, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'd like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll do a neurological exam, checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything feels painful. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are normal, but I do hear a little bit of crackling in your lungs. This could be due to several things, and we'll need to investigate further. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Your reflexes are a bit slow, and your coordination is a little off, but nothing too concerning at this point. Do you feel any dizziness or weakness?
PATIENT: No dizziness, Doctor. Not really. And no weakness either. I just… sometimes I feel a little clumsy. Like I can’t move as fast as I used to. But I'm ninety years old, you know? I expect to be a little clumsy. Everything slows down eventually. That crackling in your lungs though… that doesn’t sound good. Is that bad? I didn’t know I had crackling in my lungs.
DOCTOR: You are right to be concerned about the crackling in your lungs, Mitchell. It could indicate a few things, such as fluid buildup or early signs of pneumonia. But it's not necessarily serious. Given your age and the history of shortness of breath, it’s something we need to investigate further. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, I would like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. I also recommend a blood test to check for infection and rule out other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If you think it's best to take a picture of my lungs and check the blood, then do it. I just want to know what's going on. And… if it’s not too much trouble, could you tell me what those things might mean? If it is pneumonia, or… something else? I don't like surprises. Just… tell me straight, if you can. I'm an old man, I can handle it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mitchell. I understand your desire to know what's going on. A chest X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and identify any potential problems, such as fluid buildup, infection, or other abnormalities. The blood test will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions that could be causing your symptoms. If the X-ray reveals pneumonia, it means there is an infection in your lungs. This can cause shortness of breath, cough, and fever. It’s typically treated with antibiotics. If there's fluid buildup, it could be due to heart failure or other conditions, and we'll need to investigate further. I want to assure you that we'll take a step-by-step approach to diagnose and treat your condition. We’ll review the results of the tests as soon as they’re available and discuss the best course of action. I’ll also coordinate with a pulmonologist, a lung specialist, if necessary. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very thorough. Pneumonia, heart problems… whatever it is, I appreciate you explaining it to me. And a specialist… that's good too. Lots of different eyes looking at it. So… where do we go for the picture and the blood? And how long will it take? I don’t want to be a bother, you know? I’m an old man, and I don’t move as fast as I used to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mitchell. We can get the X-ray and blood tests done right here in the clinic. The lab technician is available now, and the radiology department is just down the hall. The blood draw will only take a few minutes, and the X-ray should be completed within 15-20 minutes. The results will typically be available within a few hours, but it can sometimes take longer depending on the lab’s workload. I will call you as soon as they are available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood first, then we’ll go for the X-ray. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I'm ready. Let's get the blood taken first then. I just… hope it doesn’t hurt too much. My veins… they're not what they used to be. But thank you. You’ve been very patient with an old man like me. And very… kind. I appreciate that. Let’s go.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mitchell. It's my pleasure. And don't worry about the blood draw – we have experienced nurses who are skilled at finding veins. Let's head to the lab. The nurse, Sarah, is expecting us. She'll take excellent care of you.
