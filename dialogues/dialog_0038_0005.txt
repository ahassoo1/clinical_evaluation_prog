DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you too. My name is Lennie Tkac. I am here, well, to get a look-over, if you will. To be cleared for a senior living facility. A nice place opened up, and they require a doctor’s say-so before I can move in. I understand that is how it works.
DOCTOR: Right, absolutely. A pre-admission physical is standard procedure, and a good idea to make sure everything is as it should be before a transition like that. So, we’ll do a full check-up. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’ve been… fairly lucky, all things considered. I'm 81 years old, you see. I bake, mostly. Have for… well, a very long time. Keeps me busy, keeps my hands moving. I have a bit of trouble with my knees now and again, old injuries, but nothing that stops me completely. I eat fairly well, though I do have a sweet tooth, I confess. And I sleep alright, most nights. Is there anything specific you would like to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Tkac. Baking sounds wonderful – a very active hobby! And it’s helpful to know about the knee trouble. Let's delve a bit deeper. When you say "trouble with your knees," can you describe that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a sharp pain, Doctor. More of an ache, really. Especially when the weather changes. Damp days are the worst. And if I stand for too long, or try to do too much at once… they get stiff. Not all the time, mind you. Some days they’re perfectly fine. It’s just… they aren’t what they used to be. I used to be quite the dancer, you know. But that was a long time ago. It doesn't keep me from baking, thankfully. I can sit while I work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. An ache that's worse with weather and prolonged standing… sounds like it could be some osteoarthritis, but we’ll take a closer look. Would you mind stepping onto the table so I can examine your knees?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Perfectly alright. Though, if you don't mind, perhaps a small stool? My balance isn't quite what it once was, and I wouldn't want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tkac. Absolutely no trouble at all. Please, take your time getting up and onto the table. We'll go slow. I want you to be comfortable. And feel free to let me know if anything feels unstable or painful.
PATIENT: Thank you kindly, Doctor. That is very thoughtful of you. There. That is much better. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Tkac. My pleasure. Alright, let’s start with this knee. Does this feel tender?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t bother me any. A little cool to the touch, perhaps, but no pain. Is there a particular spot you are looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And this area?
PATIENT: No, that feels the same. Not uncomfortable, just… normal, I suppose. It’s mostly when I move it that I feel anything, not when you touch it. It’s a bit stiff, if you try to bend it too far.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm noticing a bit of crepitus with movement, and your range of motion is a little limited, but nothing drastic. No significant swelling that I can detect. Now, let’s check the other knee. Does this knee feel any different than the other?
PATIENT: It feels… similar, Doctor. Perhaps a touch more ache on this side, but it's hard to say. It's hard to tell them apart after so many years, you know. It's mostly the stiffness that bothers me, regardless of which knee you are looking at.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Just going to take a quick look at your ankles and feet now. Any history of problems with these?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. My feet have held up alright, all things considered. A little tired at the end of the day, after standing, but no pain or swelling. My ankles… well, I twisted one once, a long time ago, but it healed up fine. They get a bit cold in the winter, if that counts as a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let’s just check your reflexes quickly. And can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. A bit of a tap, certainly. It didn't hurt, though. Everything feels normal down there, as far as I can tell. I hope I'm not taking up too much of your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Tkac. You're doing great. Just going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Take a nice, deep breath for me.
PATIENT: There. Is everything alright? I used to get a bit of a cough in the winter, but it hasn't bothered me lately.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds clear, Mr. Tkac. No wheezing or crackles that I can detect. Heart sounds are regular. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but within a reasonable range for your age. Pulse is good and steady. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… the doctor once told me my cholesterol was a little high, years ago. He put me on something for it, but I stopped taking it after a while. It didn’t seem to be doing much, and I didn't like the way it made me feel. Aside from that… nothing major, really. I’ve been fairly lucky, as I said before. I've had the usual colds and flu, but nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart trouble… at least, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I can take most anything, as far as I know. I haven't had any bad reactions to medicine in the past. I’m not a fan of taking pills, so I try to avoid it whenever possible, but I haven’t had any problems when I do need to take something.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. And currently, are you taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a single one. I take a multivitamin now and then, but that's about it. I try to get everything I need from my food, you see. I prefer it that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. So, to summarize, you're 81 years old, generally healthy, with some knee discomfort, a history of high cholesterol, no known allergies, and not currently taking any medications. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly accurate. You have a good memory! Knee discomfort is the main thing, really. It doesn't stop me from living my life, but it's there. And the cholesterol… well, that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on my examination today, and your medical history, it sounds like you're in reasonably good health for your age. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your reflexes are normal. The knee discomfort is likely osteoarthritis, which is common at your age. The elevation in blood pressure is something we'll want to monitor, but it’s not dramatically high. Before we discuss a plan for the senior living facility, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That is… very reassuring, Doctor. Thank you. No, I don’t think so, not at the moment. I suppose I was worried there was something seriously wrong with me. To hear that it’s mostly just… getting older… is a comfort. Perhaps you could tell me… what would you recommend for the knees? Is there anything I can do to make them feel better? That's probably my biggest concern, really.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tkac. For the osteoarthritis in your knees, there are several things we can try. First, maintaining a healthy weight is important to reduce stress on your joints. You mentioned you eat well, which is excellent. Regular, low-impact exercise, like walking or swimming, can also help strengthen the muscles around your knees and improve your range of motion. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can help manage pain and inflammation. However, it’s important to use them as directed and be aware of potential side effects. We can also explore physical therapy to learn specific exercises to strengthen your knees and improve your mobility. For the blood pressure, I’d like to monitor that for a few weeks, and we can discuss lifestyle modifications if needed. Do any of those options sound appealing to you?
PATIENT: That all sounds… very reasonable, Doctor. I think I could manage some more walking, perhaps. And I’ve always enjoyed swimming. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible, so I’d prefer to start with the exercise. Physical therapy… well, I’m not sure about that. It sounds like a lot of work. But I am willing to consider it if it would help. I’d like to try the exercise first, and see if that makes a difference. Would that be alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Tkac. That sounds like a perfectly reasonable plan. Let’s start with increasing your walking and incorporating some swimming. I’m going to write you a prescription for a physical therapy evaluation. You can schedule an appointment at your convenience. They’ll assess your knees and develop a personalized exercise program for you. It's also important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. If you experience any pain, stop and rest. As for the senior living facility, based on my examination today, I don’t see any medical reasons why you shouldn’t be able to transition there. Do you have any forms from the facility that I need to complete?
PATIENT: That is… wonderful, Doctor. Thank you. A physical therapy evaluation sounds good. I appreciate you not pushing me into anything I’m not comfortable with. Yes, I do. Here. They gave me a stack of forms. I believe this one is the medical evaluation. And this one… I think this one is for medication list, which I won’t have much to write on.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s see… Just confirming your date of birth and… No significant medical conditions, minor knee discomfort consistent with osteoarthritis, no allergies… Alright, here you go. I’ve completed these forms to the best of my ability. You can return these to the senior living facility. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: That is… perfect, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and your patience. You have put my mind at ease. No, I don’t think so. That will be all. I appreciate you not dismissing me as just an old man with aches and pains. I will schedule the physical therapy evaluation as soon as possible. And I will return these forms to the facility. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. It was my pleasure. Please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. And I wish you all the best with your transition to the senior living facility. Take care of yourself, and enjoy your baking!
PATIENT: It was very kind of you, Doctor. I certainly will. And I hope you have a wonderful day. Thank you again.
