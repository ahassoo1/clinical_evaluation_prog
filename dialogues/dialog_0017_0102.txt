DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vanthine. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste time. You’re eighty years old, which, frankly, is quite a feat these days. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Blim, is it? Yes, eighty… feels like yesterday, and feels like a lifetime ago, both at once, you know? Well, I… I’ve been sighing a lot lately. Deep breaths, mostly. My wife… she would always tell me when I was doing it. She’s gone now, though. A long time ago. It just… happens more now, I guess. I don’t know why.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, grief is… unfortunate. However, excessive sighing, while possibly emotional in origin, could indicate a number of things. Let's focus on the physical aspects. When you say “a lot,” can you quantify that for me?
PATIENT: Quantify… oh dear. That’s a fancy word, isn't it? Let me think. Hmm. It’s not every breath, Doctor, certainly not. But… maybe a dozen times an hour? More when I’m… remembering things. Or when it’s quiet. I used to work, you know. Police work. A lot of… stressful situations. Not that I remember all the details anymore. Does that make sense? It’s hard to say exactly. I just… feel it. A heaviness, and then whoosh. A sigh.
DOCTOR: A dozen times an hour… Alright. And is this accompanied by any… other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… oh, goodness. Let me see. Well, I get a little… tired, I suppose. Old age, right? Everything feels a little slower. My bones ache sometimes, especially when the weather changes. And… I forget things. A lot of things. Names, mostly. And where I put my glasses. Though, to be fair, I always forget where I put my glasses. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Mr. Vanthine, nearly everyone forgets things at your age. Now, let's try to be precise. Are you experiencing any shortness of breath with these sighs?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… hmm. Not exactly short, Doctor. More like… a feeling of not getting enough air, maybe? Just for a moment. Like a little… emptiness in my chest. It doesn't happen every time I sigh, though. Sometimes it's just the sigh. Does that make any sense? It's hard to explain. It’s just… uncomfortable. A little bit scary, sometimes. Not often, but… yes. A little scary.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this "emptiness," as you call it, been getting worse lately?
PATIENT: Worse… now that you mention it… yes, I think it has. Not a lot, but… a little. It feels like it takes a bigger effort to take a full breath sometimes. And… I've been feeling a bit… anxious, I suppose. Just a general… unease. I haven't been sleeping as well either. I wake up in the middle of the night and just… sit there. Thinking. Mostly about… well, things. Old things. It's probably just old age, though. Isn't it?
DOCTOR: You have no recent pulmonary function tests on file. Let's conduct a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam? Yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I don't mind. I… trust your judgement. Just let me know if it will be… uncomfortable. My bones aren't what they used to be, you know. What exactly will you be doing? Just so I know what to expect. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: I will listen to your lungs and heart, check your oxygen saturation, and assess your overall respiratory effort. Simple enough. Please take a deep breath and exhale slowly. Breathe normally now. A little wheezing on auscultation bilaterally… and slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. Oxygen saturation is 92% on room air, which is… acceptable, but not ideal. Now, I’d like to check your heart rate and blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh… wheezing? Is that bad, Doctor? My wife, she used to get wheezing sometimes… she needed an inhaler. Is this… something like that? And 92%… is that a low number? I don't understand percentages very well. I'm sorry. My heart… it feels okay, I think. A little fluttery sometimes, but… I'm an old man, right? Fluttery is normal?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. As for the wheezing… it can be indicative of several things, including mild asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The 92% saturation is below optimal; ideally, it should be above 95%. Given your age, history of sighing, and diminished breath sounds, I suspect mild COPD is the most likely explanation. However, to confirm this, we will need a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: COPD? Oh dear. Is that… serious, Doctor? I don't think I've ever heard of that. Will I need… an inhaler? My wife… she hated those things. They made her feel… shaky. A chest X-ray… will that hurt? I don't like radiation. Is there a lot of radiation? And… what does this mean? Will I be able to… still walk? Still visit my grandchildren? I just want to be able to… breathe normally. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Vanthine, COPD is a common condition in long-term smokers, but it can occur in non-smokers as well. It’s a progressive lung disease that makes it difficult to breathe. The severity varies. An inhaler may be necessary to help open your airways. The radiation from a chest X-ray is minimal—less than you get from a cross-country flight. We need to rule out other possibilities, and the X-ray will help us with that. As for your ability to walk and visit your grandchildren… that depends on the severity of the condition. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I'm ordering a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. Return to the clinic in three days to discuss the results. Do you have any further questions… before I have to attend to other patients?
PATIENT: Oh… a complete blood count too? That sounds… complicated. Three days… that feels like a long time to wait. I don't like waiting when I'm worried. So, you think it’s serious? This COPD… will it… will it be painful? And the inhaler… is it just for when I’m having trouble breathing, or do I have to take it all the time? I… I just want to understand. And… will I still be able to… you know… enjoy my life? That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vanthine, I understand your anxiety. However, it’s too early to draw any definitive conclusions. We need the test results first. The inhaler would be as needed, pending the diagnosis. Now, I have other patients waiting. The X-ray order will be sent to the radiology department. Schedule the appointment immediately. Good day.
