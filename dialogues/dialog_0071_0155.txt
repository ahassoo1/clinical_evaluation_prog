DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Or... is it Lyman?
PATIENT: Yes, Lyman is fine. Morning to you too, Doctor… Galena, right? Look, if we could just get this over with… I have things to do. Not feeling terribly well, you see. This shaking… it’s been bothering me.
DOCTOR: Right, yes, Galena. And… shaking, you say?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my hands. Though sometimes… I think it’s in my leg, but maybe that’s just… old age. It’s hard to say, really. Started a few months back, I suppose. Not sure exactly when. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A few months... comes and goes. Okay. Is it constant when it is happening, or more… brief moments?
PATIENT: Brief moments, mostly. Like… a little flutter, then gone. Though sometimes, when I’m trying to do something… you know, with my hands… it’s harder to stop. I used to be good with tools, fixing things around the house… now it's… tricky. I haven't really been doing much fixing lately, though.
DOCTOR: Right. And does anything seem to bring it on?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Honestly? Not that I’ve noticed. I used to work at the water treatment plant… always busy, lots of moving around. It didn’t bother me then. Now… well, I’m retired. Mostly just sit around. Maybe that’s it? I don't know. It’s just… there, sometimes. Annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you notice any other symptoms alongside the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Well, I’ve been a bit… tired lately. But who isn't at my age? And my memory… isn’t what it used to be, but that’s hardly new. I forget where I put things… names, sometimes. Though, I always forget names. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Any changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Weight? Heavens, no. I think I’ve actually lost a bit. Not intentionally. The wife… my ex-wife… always said I ate too much. She was probably right, but that was a long time ago. I haven't really been keeping track.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you noticed any stiffness or pain in your joints?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Sometimes a little creaky in the mornings, but that's just getting old, isn't it? Like a rusty door. Nothing to complain about, really. I mean, I am complaining now, but… you asked.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Medications? No, no. I try to stay away from those things if I can. Never been a big fan of pills. A little something for the blood pressure a while back, but the doctor took me off it. Said it wasn't doing much good, and frankly, I didn’t notice a difference either way.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. My ex-wife used to say I had the stomach of a goat, and she wasn’t wrong. Never had any bad reactions to anything, not that I recall.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to confirm, you said you were at the water treatment plant?
PATIENT: Yes, I was. For… a long time. Years. Water and Wastewater, all of it. Though I’m retired now, as I mentioned. It was… a good job. Kept busy. Don’t do much these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Just a beer now and then, with dinner sometimes. Nothing heavy. Smoked for a while when I was younger, foolish thing. Quit years ago, though. Good riddance. No other substances, no. Never been one for that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It’ll help me get a better idea of what’s going on. I'll check your reflexes, coordination, and listen to your heart and lungs. Just a quick look. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know. Just... don't poke me too much. I'm a bit sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here for me. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a nice deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds are regular, a little faint. Lungs are clear, no wheezing that I can detect. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are… a little diminished. And let’s see your hands… I do notice a slight tremor in your hands when they’re at rest. It's subtle, but it's there. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: I… I think so. It's a bit blurry these days. My vision isn't what it used to be, Doctor. Everything seems to… wobble a little.
DOCTOR: Alright. Can you try and touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is… harder than it looks. I used to be so good with my hands. I built… well, never mind. It’s just… off today, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I want to see you walk a few steps for me. Just a normal walk, nice and steady. Alright, a little unsteady, but manageable. Alright, Mr. Jezik. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick examination… It sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of a mild essential tremor. This is a neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking, often in the hands. It becomes more common with age. The slight unsteadiness could be related, or just a normal part of aging.
PATIENT: Essential tremor, you say? Sounds… fancy. Is that… bad? Will I fall down and break something? Look, I appreciate you telling me what it is, but what does that mean for me? Will I need pills? I really don't want pills.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily "bad", Mr. Jezik. Many people live full and active lives with essential tremor. It's usually progressive, meaning it can worsen over time, but the rate varies. As for falling, it's possible, but unlikely with mild symptoms like yours. We'll work to minimize that risk. Regarding pills, not necessarily. We can often manage mild tremors with lifestyle adjustments, physical therapy, and occupational therapy to help improve coordination and strengthen muscles. We can also discuss options like weighted utensils or adaptive equipment if it becomes harder to perform daily tasks. If it progresses and significantly impacts your quality of life, then we can consider medication. But let's start with the conservative approach. I’m going to order some blood work to rule out other potential causes for the tremor. And I’d like you to see a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation and to confirm the diagnosis. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: A neurologist? More doctors… Oh, dear. Look, as long as it doesn’t involve a lot of poking and prodding, and I don’t have to take any pills, I suppose so. Blood work is fine, I guess. As long as it doesn't take all day. Just… please, no unnecessary tests. I'm an old man, I haven’t got a lot of time left.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. I understand. We'll keep it as straightforward as possible. I’ll write you a referral to a neurologist in the area. They'll be able to assess the tremor more thoroughly and determine the best course of action. I'll also order the blood work. It's just a routine check to rule out other possibilities. I’ll have the nurse come in and explain the blood work process and schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results and the neurologist’s recommendations. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, no. I think that’s all. Just… get it over with, and let me go home. My chair isn’t getting any softer. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. The nurse will be with you shortly. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
PATIENT: .
