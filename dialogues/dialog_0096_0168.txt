DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pandolfi. Good morning. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit… delicate, honestly. I’ve recently begun seeing someone, and I thought it prudent to have a check-up before things… progress. One must be sensible, you understand. It’s not every man who understands the importance of… preventative measures.
DOCTOR: Sensible, yes. Very sensible. Though frankly, I wish more patients came in before making life choices, not afterwards. Still, better late than never, I suppose. So, this check-up… is there anything specific you're concerned about?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not concerns, precisely. I simply want to ensure… compatibility, shall we say? I’ve always been meticulous about my health, and one doesn’t want any… surprises. I maintain a very active lifestyle, and I expect my… companion to be equally conscientious. It's just good housekeeping, really. Are we looking at a full panel? I do have Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: “Good housekeeping,” hmm?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. One must be… thorough. I wouldn’t want to introduce any…unforeseen elements into the equation. I’ve always believed a lady should be prepared for anything. And frankly, I’ve heard… stories. One can never be too careful, especially in these modern times. It's about peace of mind, truly. Is that not what we all strive for? A little reassurance never hurt anyone.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Pandolfi, let's be direct. You're requesting a check-up, ostensibly for "compatibility," and seem… focused on sexually transmitted infections. Is that a fair assessment?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. Such bluntness. It's… unbecoming. However, since you ask… yes. It would be… imprudent not to consider such things. I simply prefer to be… proactive. And frankly, I’m not entirely confident in his… lifestyle choices prior to our acquaintance. Discretion is paramount, naturally. It’s not a reflection on me, you understand. Just… responsible planning.
DOCTOR: “Responsible planning.” Very well. We’ll proceed accordingly. I’m going to ask you a few questions, and I need you to be completely honest with me, alright?
PATIENT: Perfectly. Honesty is, of course, the cornerstone of any reputable relationship. And I pride myself on my forthrightness. Ask away, Doctor. Though I do hope we can avoid unnecessarily… graphic details. I have a delicate constitution.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. I maintain a very healthy diet – lots of greens, lean protein, and I walk at least three miles a day. And I’ve always been blessed with excellent… constitution. My mother always said I had strong blood. No history of anything like those… unpleasant ailments in my family, thank goodness. Are you making a note of all this, Doctor? It’s important to establish a baseline, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pandolfi, I am noting everything. And that’s good to hear. Now, have you ever been tested for sexually transmitted infections before?
PATIENT: Well… that is a rather personal question, isn't it? I… believe I had a rather cursory examination several years ago, during a previous… engagement. But it wasn’t particularly thorough, I must confess. He wasn’t the most… meticulous of men. It was more a formality, really. Are you implying something, Doctor? I assure you, I’ve always been… discreet.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Pandolfi, I’m not implying anything. However, a “cursory examination” several years ago is not sufficient for current screening recommendations. Things change. People change. It’s important we have a comprehensive understanding of your history. So, to be clear, have you ever been diagnosed with chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes, HIV, or any other sexually transmitted infection?
PATIENT: Doctor, I find your questioning rather… intrusive. I came here for peace of mind, not an interrogation. However… and I’m only telling you this because you insist… there was a… minor incident several years ago. A false positive, I believe. It was quickly resolved and… I haven’t concerned myself with it since. It was before I met my current… companion, naturally. And frankly, it was quite distressing at the time. Do you have any other… unpleasant questions? I’m beginning to feel quite uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: A “minor incident” and a “false positive” are not details to be glossed over, Ms. Pandolfi. And frankly, your reluctance to provide specifics is concerning. Let’s be absolutely clear. I need to know what infection you were tested for, when you were tested, and what the results were. Knowing only that it was a “false positive” doesn’t allow me to assess your current risk or provide appropriate care. And for the record, I'm asking these questions to protect your health. Now, please, tell me the details.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you must know… it was approximately eight years ago. Before my marriage. He… insisted on a full panel. I hadn’t even considered such things before. It came back… slightly elevated for… chlamydia, I believe. But the doctor said it was likely a false positive, due to… stress. I was rather preoccupied at the time. He retested me a month later, and it was negative. Perfectly negative. I haven't had any further testing since. It was a very… unfortunate episode, and I prefer not to dwell on it. Are you satisfied now, Doctor? I truly do wish we could move on. This is quite upsetting.
DOCTOR: “Slightly elevated” is not a sufficient description, Ms. Pandolfi. And eight years is a significant amount of time. Given the history of a positive test – even if you believe it was a false positive – and the potential for reinfection, we need to conduct a comprehensive STI screening today. I’m going to order tests for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, and herpes. We will also need a complete blood count and a metabolic panel to assess your overall health. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I will not be subjected to a battery of tests based on a single, questionable result from a man I barely remember. It's… scandalous. And frankly, it’s a waste of Medicare funds. I came here for reassurance, not a medical inquisition. However… if you insist… I have a mild allergy to penicillin. It causes a… slight rash. But it’s hardly relevant. This is becoming quite preposterous. I think I would like a second opinion. And perhaps a different doctor. This conversation is… deeply unsettling.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, with all due respect, your reluctance to address a potential health risk, coupled with your dismissive attitude towards established medical guidelines, is… frankly, alarming. A history of a positive STI test, regardless of whether you believe it was a “false positive,” requires thorough investigation. Penicillin allergy is highly relevant, as it impacts treatment options. I understand you’re uncomfortable. However, I am obligated to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes comprehensive STI screening and appropriate follow-up. I will honor your request for a second opinion, but I strongly recommend you reconsider. I have already documented your concerns and the details of our conversation. Before you leave, can you at least tell me if you are currently sexually active?
PATIENT: That is… exceedingly personal, Doctor. And quite unnecessary. I think I’ve said quite enough. I will be seeking a second opinion, and I suggest you refrain from asking any further… intrusive questions. Good day. .
