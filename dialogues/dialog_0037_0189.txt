DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Pleasure’s all yours, I suppose. Name’s Arbie Rowbottom. Look, I’m not one for beating around the bush. Been… noticing a bit of red when I go to the bathroom. Not a pretty sight, let me tell you. And frankly, at my age, I don’t need this on top of everything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand. Seeing blood can be concerning, and you’re right to get it checked out. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? What more is there to say? It’s blood! Like I said. It’s not… a trickle, mind you. It’s… noticeable. And it’s been happening for… well, a few days now. Three, maybe four? Honestly, I lose track. Everything blurs together after a while. Though I can assure you, it wasn't there before. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand. Three or four days of noticing blood is good information. And you're right to be concerned with a new symptom like this. To clarify, is the blood bright red, or darker in color?
PATIENT: Bright red, definitely bright red. Not… congealed or anything. Fresh, you might say. Though, honestly, I try not to look too closely. Makes my breakfast want to come back up. It's… well, it's unpleasant. I used to have a stronger stomach, you know. Flying did that to you. All the turbulence and… never mind. Point is, it’s red. Very red.
DOCTOR: Okay, bright red blood is helpful to know. And you mentioned you used to fly – that's interesting. We can talk more about that later if you'd like. For now, let's focus on the blood. Is it mixed in with your stool, or is it separate – do you notice it coating the stool, or is it in the water after you flush?
PATIENT: Mixed in, mostly. Not… floating around like a separate thing. It’s in it. Part of it, if you must know. It’s not like there’s a clear separation, if that makes any sense. And I certainly don’t go poking around afterwards. Too much information for one day, if you ask me. Honestly, I just want to know what’s causing it and get it fixed. Don’t need any… surprises at my age.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Rowbottom. It sounds unpleasant, and you're right, we want to get to the bottom of this. To help me get a clearer picture, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits along with the blood?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, everything's slower these days, if that's what you mean. Getting old isn’t for the faint of heart, you know. But… now that you mention it, I’ve been a bit… more frequent, perhaps. Not a massive change, but I'm going more often than usual. And it's… a bit looser than it used to be, if you catch my drift. Nothing drastic, mind you. Just… not as firm.
DOCTOR: Okay, more frequent and looser stools along with the blood. That’s helpful information. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, cramping, or any feeling of fullness or bloating?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain… hmm. Not pain, exactly. More of a… discomfort. A dull ache, here and there. Nothing that would send me to the hospital, mind you. Just… a bit of grumbling in the middle. And yes, a bit of bloating, now that you ask. Like I’ve eaten too much, but I haven't. Just… uncomfortable. It comes and goes, really. Nothing I'd write home about, but it's there.
DOCTOR: Alright, discomfort and bloating alongside the other symptoms. Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Rowbottom. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or hemorrhoids?
PATIENT: Hemorrhoids, maybe. A long time ago. When I was younger, still flying. Lots of sitting. The doctor gave me some ointment, and it cleared up. But that was… decades ago. As for the other things – diverti-whatsit and inflamma-whatever – no. Never been diagnosed with anything serious. I was a healthy man. Still am, mostly. Flying kept me in shape, you know. Strong heart, strong lungs. Though, admittedly, the sitting wasn’t ideal.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of hemorrhoids treated with ointment a long time ago, and no other diagnosed conditions. That's good to know. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis. Keeps the joints from locking up, you understand. A small blue pill, once a day. And… sometimes, I take something for indigestion. When I eat something that doesn’t sit right. Just a couple of those little pink ones. Nothing major, mind you. Old man stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blue pill for arthritis and pink pills for indigestion as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergy in my life. Lucky, I suppose. Though I did have a bad reaction to a bee sting once, as a boy, but that wasn’t a medication. Just a bee. Nasty little bugger. But no allergies to pills or anything like that. Clear as a bell.
DOCTOR: Good to know, no allergies. And finally, do you have a family history of any digestive issues, such as colon cancer, Crohn’s disease, or ulcerative colitis?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she had some trouble with her stomach, as she got older. Always complaining about… well, everything, really. But nothing specific. Never went to the doctor much, if I recall correctly. Just… old age. My father was as strong as an ox, though. Never a sick day in his life. So, not really. No specific history of anything serious, if that’s what you mean. Just… mothers. They worry about everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no specific family history of digestive issues. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Mr. Rowbottom. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen, and I’d also like to do a rectal exam. This will help me to assess the situation further. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Now hold on just a minute. I’m not thrilled with the idea, I’ll be honest. Not at my age. Isn’t there something else you can do? A blood test, perhaps? I don’t see the need for… poking around. It feels… invasive. And frankly, unnecessary. I've lived a long life, you know. I'm not one for strangers fiddling around down there.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s a perfectly reasonable concern, and I wouldn't push you to do anything you're not comfortable with. A rectal exam is often the most reliable way to assess for any abnormalities in the rectum and lower colon, and given the symptoms you're describing – the bright red blood and changes in your bowel habits – it would be the most thorough next step. However, we can start with a blood test. It won't be as definitive, but it can help rule out some other possibilities and give us a bit more information. It would check your hemoglobin levels to see if you're anemic from any blood loss. If the blood test comes back concerning, or if your symptoms worsen, I would strongly recommend reconsidering the rectal exam. It’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on. Would you be comfortable with starting with the blood test?
PATIENT: A blood test… alright. That sounds… reasonable. Less intrusive, certainly. Hemoglo-whatsit levels, you say? If it shows something, then we can talk. But no poking around unless absolutely necessary. Understand? I'm not getting any younger, and I've got a right to some dignity. So, yes. Let's do the blood test. And make it quick, if you don’t mind. I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. Your comfort and dignity are my priority. We'll definitely start with the blood test. I'll order it right away, and the lab technician will draw a sample. It shouldn't take too long. While we're waiting for the results, is there anything else you’d like to discuss, or any other symptoms you’ve noticed that I haven’t asked about?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, I think that covers it. Just… a bit tired lately. More so than usual, but that’s probably just age. And… my appetite hasn't been what it used to be. But that’s likely the arthritis, makes it hard to get around, so cooking feels like a chore. Nothing major. Just… old man things. I just want to get to the bottom of this blood situation. That's what's bothering me the most.
DOCTOR: I understand. Fatigue and decreased appetite can certainly be related to age and arthritis, and it’s good you're aware of those factors. We’ll keep those in mind as we investigate the blood issue. Alright, Mr. Rowbottom, I’ve ordered the blood test, and the lab technician will be in to draw a sample shortly. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, if you notice any significant changes in your symptoms—increased bleeding, severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or weakness—please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before I leave the room?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've covered everything. Just get it over with, and let me know what you find. I’ve got a life to get back to, you know. Don’t keep me waiting too long. And thank you… I suppose.
