DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Engelhaupt, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Batara. Now, you’re 79, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Though, frankly, I find it rather… unnecessary to state the obvious. I assure you, I am aware of my age. Let’s get this over with, shall we? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Right. Of course. Well, let’s not waste time then. So, what brings you in today, Mrs. Engelhaupt?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… this new Medicare business. And being new to the area. Honestly, the paperwork is simply dreadful. I’m told I need to… establish care? It all seems rather excessive. I just want to ensure everything is in order so I don’t receive any… unpleasant surprises.
DOCTOR: Medicare… yes. It is a nuisance, isn’t it?
PATIENT: A nuisance is putting it mildly, Doctor. It’s a complete and utter… muddle. And I haven’t the patience for it. Is this what you do all day? Sort through bureaucratic… things? It sounds rather dreadful.
DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Engelhaupt, while establishing care does involve some paperwork, it’s primarily about getting a comprehensive understanding of your health history and current condition. It allows me to provide you with the best possible care, should you need it. Now, let’s start with your medical history. Have you been seeing a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I've always been perfectly healthy. A bit of this and that, naturally, as one gets older, but nothing requiring constant… attention. I had a doctor back in… well, somewhere. A very nice man, but I can't quite recall his name. It was a long time ago. And frankly, I doubt anything’s changed significantly since then. Is this absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Engelhaupt, with all due respect, “perfectly healthy” is rarely the case at 79. Things do change. We need to establish a baseline. Have you had any major illnesses?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Oh dear. Let me see… There was a touch of the flu, years ago. And a rather nasty bout of indigestion once. But major illnesses? No, I don’t believe so. My husband, bless his soul, he was the one who was always… ailing. I was always the strong one. This is all terribly tedious, isn't it? Are you quite certain you can't simply wave a magic wand and declare me fit as a fiddle?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Mrs. Engelhaupt, I do not possess a magic wand. And while I appreciate your… resilience, we still need to go through a basic review of systems. Just to be thorough. Have you experienced any recent changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Recent changes? Well, my cook has been experimenting with new recipes, some more successful than others, I must say. And I suppose… I haven’t been quite as enthusiastic about dessert lately. But that’s hardly a medical crisis, is it? I maintain a perfectly respectable weight, thank you very much. It’s all rather… insulting. Perhaps I should find another doctor. One who understands a woman of my… standing.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Engelhaupt, are you implying I am not providing adequate care?
PATIENT: Adequate? Well, let's just say this entire process is… less than efficient. And rather… intrusive. I came here to establish care, not to be interrogated about my dessert preferences! I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly capable of managing my own well-being. I simply require a signature on a form or two to appease the Medicare bureaucracy. Is that truly beyond your capabilities? Frankly, I find this whole conversation quite… demeaning.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Engelhaupt. If you are so certain of your health, I will simply document that you declined a thorough assessment. However, I must advise you that this practice will not be responsible for any future complications. Here is the form. Sign it at your own risk. I have other patients waiting.
