DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Pipkorn. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about… how to be more present, I guess. I’m interested in learning about mindfulness or meditation. I hear it can be helpful with… well, just generally feeling calmer and less stressed. It’s something I’ve never really tried before, but I thought I’d see if it might be a good fit for me.
DOCTOR: I see. While I appreciate you seeking preventative measures for your well-being, Ms. Sugino, this clinic specializes in medical care. Mindfulness and meditation, while potentially useful for some, fall outside of my scope of practice. Perhaps a therapist or wellness center would be a more appropriate resource for you. However, if you are experiencing significant stress that is manifesting as physical symptoms – headaches, digestive issues, sleep disturbances – then we can certainly explore those avenues. Are you currently experiencing any such symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. I hadn't really thought about it that way, focusing on the medical side. You're right, it’s probably not the best place for just… learning to meditate. No, not significant symptoms, exactly. I sleep alright, and no headaches. My digestion… well, it's okay. Sometimes a little off, but I think that’s just getting older! I just… I feel a bit scattered, if that makes sense. Easily distracted, and I want to be better at focusing. Is that something you could maybe help with, even if it's not directly meditation-related?
DOCTOR: "Scattered" is rather vague, Ms. Sugino. While I understand you’re not presenting with acute complaints, persistent difficulty with concentration can be indicative of underlying issues. It could be anything from simple fatigue to… other possibilities. Let’s start with a thorough review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I had a bout of bronchitis a few years back, but that cleared up completely. And I had my gallbladder removed when I was younger, but that was… oh, goodness, over twenty years ago now. Other than that, I’ve been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I do have slightly high blood pressure, the doctor told me, but it’s managed with medication. Nothing major, honestly. I take Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, yes. And you said the gallbladder removal was over twenty years ago?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Twenty-two years, to be exact. It was in 2003. I remember it vividly – it was right after my mother passed away. It was a difficult time. But the surgery went well, no complications. I’ve had regular check-ups since then, and everything’s always been fine.
DOCTOR: Very good. And any family history of significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… My mother had diabetes, type 2, I think. And my father… he had heart problems. He had a stroke when he was in his seventies. And my sister… she’s always been prone to anxiety, but it’s never been officially diagnosed. Does that help? It's hard to remember everything, sometimes. They're all gone now, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a history of diabetes, cardiovascular issues, and anxiety within the family. And you mentioned you’re currently taking Lisinopril for high blood pressure. Do you take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements on a regular basis?
PATIENT: No, just the Lisinopril. I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a while back. I figured if I was eating reasonably well, it wasn't really necessary. And I don't really believe in all those fancy supplements, to be honest. Just plain old food and water, mostly. Although, I do enjoy a good cup of herbal tea now and then. Chamomile, usually, when I can’t sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I've eaten all sorts of things throughout my life, traveled a bit… nothing's ever bothered me. Unless you count dust, maybe? I sneeze a lot in dusty places, but I don’t think that’s a true allergy. Just a sensitive nose, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Sugino, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Not at all. Never smoked a day in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I stopped that a few years ago. It wasn't really doing me any good. And recreational drugs… absolutely not. I’m a simple woman, Dr. Pipkorn. I prefer a good book and a quiet evening. Is that alright? I know these are personal questions.
DOCTOR: It is… adequate. Now, can you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Oh, well, let’s see. I usually wake up around 6:30, although sometimes earlier if the neighbors are making noise. I have a cup of coffee and a piece of toast, then I get ready for work. I’m a signal and track switch repairer, so I spend most of my day outdoors, checking and maintaining the railway lines. It's physical work, but I enjoy being outside, fresh air and all that. I usually get home around 5:00, make dinner, and then… well, that depends. Sometimes I watch the news, sometimes I read, sometimes I call my friends. It’s a pretty quiet life, but it suits me. Do you need more details? I can tell you all about the different types of switches if you’d like!
DOCTOR: No, that will suffice. Now, Ms. Sugino, let's move on to the present issue. You mentioned feeling “scattered” and having difficulty focusing. Can you describe this further?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I can't do things, you understand. I can still do my job perfectly fine, and I manage my household. It’s just… my mind wanders a lot. I’ll be talking to someone, and I’ll suddenly realize I haven’t heard a word they said. Or I’ll be reading, and I’ll have to go back and reread the same paragraph three times. It’s more like a… a lack of mental clarity, I suppose. And I find myself forgetting little things, like where I put my keys or why I walked into a room. It’s frustrating, honestly. It's like my brain is a radio, constantly switching stations. It's not debilitating, but it's… unsettling. Does that make sense? I'm probably not explaining it very well.
DOCTOR: It is… vaguely descriptive. And when did you first start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… It’s hard to say exactly. It’s been gradual, really. But I think it started getting noticeable about six months ago, maybe a little longer. It coincided with my retirement, actually. I used to work long hours, very demanding job, always busy, always focused. And then suddenly… nothing. A lot of free time. I thought it was just the change in routine, but it hasn’t really gotten any better. It’s almost like my brain needs… something to focus on, to keep it occupied. Does that sound silly? I’m probably rambling now.
DOCTOR: It is… not entirely illogical. Alright, Ms. Sugino. I am going to perform a brief neurological examination. This will help me assess your cognitive function and rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Absolutely. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Pipkorn. I trust your judgment. Just tell me what I need to do. I'm a bit nervous, to be honest, but I understand it’s important.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow my finger with your eyes, but do not move your head. Keep your gaze fixed on the pen.
PATIENT: Okay, I'm following it. Is this alright? Am I doing it correctly? It's a little hard to focus on just one thing, if you don’t mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Today is August 2nd, 2025. Is that correct? I try to keep track of the days, even in retirement. It’s important, you know. Keeps the mind sharp.
DOCTOR: And can you spell “world” backwards for me?
PATIENT: Let me see… d-l-r-o-w. Is that correct? It’s been a while since I had to spell things backwards. My job didn’t require much spelling, mostly technical terms and regulations. I hope I got it right.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, I am going to ask you to repeat three words that I will say. Please try to remember them. The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me after I finish. Apple, table, penny.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Okay, I’ve got them. Apple, table, penny. Is that right? I’m pretty good at remembering things, usually.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, can you describe the difference between an apple and a table?
PATIENT: Well, an apple is a fruit, you can eat it. It grows on a tree, it’s usually red or green, sometimes yellow. A table… is a piece of furniture. It has legs, and a flat surface. You put things on a table. You don't eat a table, although I suppose you could if you were very desperate. It’s a silly question, really.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, Ms. Sugino, based on this brief examination, your cognitive function appears to be… relatively intact. However, your complaints of difficulty concentrating and forgetfulness are concerning. Given your age and medical history, and the gradual onset of these symptoms, I recommend further investigation. I am going to order a comprehensive blood panel, including a thyroid function test and vitamin B12 levels. We will also perform a magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would you be amenable to these tests?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Pipkorn. I understand it's important to rule things out. An MRI… that sounds a bit scary, but I suppose I can handle it. Blood tests are no problem at all. You don’t think it’s anything serious, do you? Like… dementia or something? I’ve been a bit worried about that lately, with my memory being a bit patchy.
DOCTOR: It is… premature to speculate, Ms. Sugino. Many factors can contribute to cognitive changes, and these tests will help us determine the underlying cause. It is equally likely to be a vitamin deficiency, a thyroid issue, or simply the normal effects of aging. We are being proactive, not presumptive. I will have my nurse schedule these tests for you. Please note that the MRI will require you to abstain from any metallic objects, and you may need to arrange transportation. In the meantime, I recommend you maintain a healthy lifestyle—adequate sleep, regular exercise, and a balanced diet. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Dr. Pipkorn. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for ordering the tests. I appreciate your thoroughness, even if it’s a bit unsettling. I'll try not to worry too much. Just… let me know as soon as you have the results, please? Hopefully it's nothing serious. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will contact you to schedule the tests and discuss the results. Do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. I will see you again once we have the results, Ms. Sugino. Have a pleasant day.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Dr. Pipkorn. You too. Goodbye.
