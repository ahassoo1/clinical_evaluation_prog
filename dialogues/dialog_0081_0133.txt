DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tippens. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be quick about it, I just need some papers signed. Some forms for… well, for things. Health things. I don't really understand them all myself, to be honest. I just need someone to say they’re real, you know? A notary, I think is what they said.
DOCTOR: Papers, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, papers. Here they are. They sent 'em in the mail. Said I needed a doctor to… verify them. Something about needing them for… well, it doesn't matter. Can you just look at them and sign if everything’s alright? I haven’t got all day, dear.
DOCTOR: "Verify forms." Right. And what exactly are these forms for, Ms. Tippens?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… It says… “Supplemental Assistance Application.” It’s for… help with things. With, you know, living. I haven’t been able to work much lately, and my savings… well, they’re pretty much gone. That's what these are for. Is that alright to say? I just want to get this over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: So, you’re applying for public assistance and expect me to simply sign off on these without any understanding of your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I didn’t expect anything, dear. I just thought that’s what doctors do. They look at papers and make sure they're real, right? I figured if it said “health forms” that’s enough. I haven’t got a regular doctor, see. I mostly just… manage. I don't really have a medical history to speak of. Just the usual aches and pains for an old woman. Is this going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: "Just the usual aches and pains." Ms. Tippens, these forms require a detailed medical assessment. I can’t ethically sign off on an application without knowing anything about your current health status, past illnesses, medications… frankly, it's irresponsible. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Allergies… Let me think… I used to be allergic to bee stings, when I was a little girl. But that was a long time ago! I don’t think I’m allergic to anything now. Maybe a little bit to dust, sometimes, but who isn’t? Honestly, Doctor, is this going to take long? I really need to get going. It's a long drive back to the farm.
DOCTOR: “A long drive to the farm.” Ms. Tippens, you present as underweight. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, yes, actually. A little. I haven’t been eating as much lately. Things have been… tight, you know? It's hard to afford good food when you’re on a fixed income. But it's not anything serious, Doctor. I just haven’t had much appetite. Is that something I need to worry about? I just need these papers signed, if you could…
DOCTOR: “Not something to worry about.” Ms. Tippens, unintentional weight loss, especially at your age, is something to worry about. It could indicate a number of serious underlying conditions. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… now you’re asking things. I… I haven't really paid much attention, Doctor. Old people things, you know? Everything slows down. It’s just… different. I really don’t understand all the medical questions. Can we just skip this part? I just need you to say these forms are real so I can get my assistance. I promise I'm okay. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, I cannot in good conscience sign these forms without a proper assessment. Your age and recent weight loss necessitate further investigation. Have you experienced any fatigue, weakness, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Oh, dear Lord. Well, yes. I am tired all the time. Always have been, really. But it's just old age, Doctor! I work on the farm, you know? It's hard work. And the nights... sometimes I wake up sweating. But it's the weather, I think. It’s been so humid lately. Look, I appreciate you trying to help, but I really just need these papers signed. I can't keep doing this. I don't have the energy for a whole medical exam. It’s just… too much. Is there anything you can do?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Tippens. I will sign the forms, but I must insist you schedule an appointment with a specialist for a thorough evaluation. I’m concerned about your weight loss and fatigue. I'll document my concerns and recommend a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. I will also include a referral to a gastroenterologist, given your… lack of detailed information regarding bowel habits. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. That sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. Truly, thank you. I’ll… I’ll schedule something. As soon as I can. It’s just… finding the time, and the money… but I will. Thank you. Are you finished with these, then? I really need to get going. It’s a long drive. .
DOCTOR: Yes, take them. And please, Ms. Tippens, do not delay in seeking further evaluation. Documenting concerns regarding unexplained weight loss, fatigue and refusal of detailed ROS. Next patient. .
