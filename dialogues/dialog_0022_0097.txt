DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I received a letter suggesting I inquire about these… Advance Directive forms, or perhaps a POLST. My husband thought it prudent. Frankly, I find the entire notion a bit… morbid, but he insisted. I suppose it’s best to be prepared, although I do believe a healthy lifestyle is the best preparation one can have.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Marija. It can feel a bit daunting to think about these things, even when you're feeling healthy. It's very responsible of you and your husband to be proactive, though. It’s less about expecting anything to happen, and more about ensuring your wishes are known should the unexpected occur. So, to clarify, you received a letter from us regarding Advance Directives and POLST forms, and your husband encouraged you to look into them. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly accurate. Though, I must confess, I haven’t quite grasped the difference between the two. The letter was… rather vague, and honestly, I haven’t had the time to research it myself. One has obligations, you see. Teaching requires a certain… dedication. Is one more… binding than the other? Or is it simply a matter of preference? I’d prefer not to fill out excessive paperwork if it isn’t absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, and you’re right to ask for clarification. It's important to understand the difference. An Advance Directive – that’s the broader term – can include a Living Will and a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare. The Living Will outlines what kind of medical care you want if you’re unable to speak for yourself, and the Durable Power of Attorney names someone to make those decisions for you. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a more specific document. It's for people with a serious illness or frailty, and it translates your wishes into medical orders a doctor can follow right now. It’s generally used when someone is nearing the end of life, or has a condition where these decisions need to be clearly documented. Generally, a POLST is more binding in the immediate sense, as it's a direct medical order. The Advance Directive is more about guiding future decisions. Given your situation, it sounds like starting with an Advance Directive – specifically the Living Will and Durable Power of Attorney – would be the most appropriate step. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… marginally clearer. But I confess, the terminology is still rather… American. A “Living Will”? It sounds quite dramatic. And naming someone to make decisions for me? I am perfectly capable of making my own decisions, thank you very much. Though, I suppose in the event of… incapacitation… it’s a sensible precaution. My husband, Pierre, would naturally be the one. He is a very… practical man. But honestly, Doctor, I still feel this is all rather unnecessary. I eat well, I exercise, I lead a very balanced life. What sort of scenarios are we even preparing for? I haven't been seriously ill a day in my life.
DOCTOR: I understand your reservations completely, Marija. It does sound dramatic, and it's perfectly natural to feel like it's unnecessary when you're feeling healthy. It’s not about anticipating illness, it's about preparing for any situation where you might be unable to communicate your wishes. That could be a sudden accident, a stroke, or even a severe reaction to medication. Think of it less as planning for the worst, and more as ensuring your voice is still heard, even if you can't speak for yourself. It’s about empowering Pierre to advocate for your preferences, based on what you tell him now. To help me understand your perspective better, and to see if an Advance Directive is the right step, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Doctor, I assure you, my health is excellent. I maintain a rigorous schedule. I teach French Literature at the university – a rather demanding position, I might add. It requires considerable mental acuity. I walk at least five kilometers every morning, I eat a Mediterranean diet, and I haven’t had so much as a cold in years. I am, frankly, the picture of health. My annual check-ups are always… glowing. I fail to see how this… morbid paperwork is relevant to my situation. But if you insist, I suppose I can list my allergies: pollen, and certain types of shellfish. Though, I avoid those, naturally. Is that sufficient? Or are you hoping for a detailed medical history? Because frankly, it will be a rather short one.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Marija. That’s very good to know, and I appreciate you sharing that. It is excellent that you’re so proactive about your health. And you're right – a short medical history is perfectly fine! Knowing about the pollen and shellfish allergies is helpful. Just to be thorough, have you ever been hospitalized for anything, even as a child?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… well, when I was a child, back in Morocco, I had a rather unpleasant bout of tonsillitis. I was perhaps eight or nine years old. It required a minor surgical procedure, a tonsillectomy. But it was a very long time ago, a primitive facility, I assure you. Certainly not comparable to the standards here. And I haven't been hospitalized since. A minor fracture of my wrist when I was a teenager, but it was treated at home. That is all. Really, Doctor, I am a remarkably healthy individual. I suspect this is a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Marija. So, tonsillectomy as a child and a wrist fracture treated at home – good to know. And you’re right, it does sound like you have a very healthy history. Just a few more quick questions, and then we can discuss if pursuing an Advance Directive is right for you. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. I lead a very healthy lifestyle. Do I look like someone who requires medication? I take a multivitamin occasionally, during the winter months. And perhaps an antacid, if I indulge in something… rich. But that is all. I pride myself on maintaining my health through natural means. I find pharmaceuticals… barbaric, frankly. They merely mask the symptoms, they do not address the root cause. I prefer a holistic approach. Is this truly relevant, Doctor? Or are you simply adhering to a checklist?
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective completely, Marija. And you're right to question the relevance. I assure you, I am not simply adhering to a checklist. I'm trying to get a complete picture of your overall health to ensure we make the best decision for you. And it's good to know about the multivitamin and occasional antacid. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: My family history… Well, my mother lived to a respectable age, though she suffered from arthritis in her later years. My father was a fisherman, a robust man, but he passed away relatively young from… a heart ailment, I believe. Nothing particularly remarkable. My siblings are all healthy, as far as I know. Though we are not particularly close. We have all led rather independent lives. Honestly, Doctor, I fail to see how any of this is pertinent. I suspect we could conclude this consultation now. I have a lecture to prepare, and I am wasting valuable time. Are you simply trying to ascertain if I am likely to succumb to some dreadful hereditary illness? Because I assure you, I have no such predisposition. I am perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Marija. That's helpful to know. It sounds like your family history is relatively unremarkable, and you’ve clearly prioritized your health. Based on everything you've told me – your excellent health, active lifestyle, unremarkable medical and family history – it sounds like an Advance Directive might not be necessary at this time. However, given your husband's concern, and the fact that it's always good to be prepared, we could simply discuss naming him as your Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, without necessarily completing a full Living Will. That would ensure he's authorized to make decisions for you should the unexpected occur, without requiring you to outline specific wishes. Would that be something you’d be comfortable considering?
PATIENT: Well… that is… marginally more acceptable. Simply authorizing Pierre to make decisions… without the dramatics of outlining every possible scenario. Yes, I suppose I could agree to that. He is a very practical man. And it would likely appease my husband. But I want it clearly understood: this is not an admission of any impending illness. It is merely a precautionary measure, for peace of mind. And I reserve the right to revoke this authorization at any time. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Perfectly, Marija. I understand completely. This is absolutely not an admission of any illness, and you have the full right to revoke the authorization at any time. We’re simply planning ahead, for peace of mind. Okay, so we’ll complete the Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare form, naming Pierre as your representative. It’s a relatively simple document. I’ll have my assistant bring it in, and we can review it together. It requires your signature and a witness. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything. I trust this will be a swift process. I have a considerable amount of work to complete. I appreciate you… indulging my husband’s anxieties, Doctor. But I must reiterate: I am perfectly healthy. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. I understand completely. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad we could address your husband’s concerns. My assistant will be right in with the form. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions. And I wish you all the best with your preparations for your lecture. .
