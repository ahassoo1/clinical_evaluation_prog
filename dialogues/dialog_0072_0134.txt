DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's been… a bit of a struggle lately. I just haven't been able to keep much food down, and I get full awful quick. It's not like a sharp pain or anything, just… uncomfortable. And it happens pretty often now. I don't rightly remember when it started, to be honest. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're experiencing early satiety – feeling full quickly – and difficulty keeping food down. And you say this has been happening “often now,” but you’re having trouble pinpointing exactly when it began. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right, Doctor. “Often” is probably a good way to put it. It’s not every meal, but… more often than it used to be, that's for sure. And you're right, pinpointing when it started… that's hard. Everything just sort of… blended together after… well, after my husband passed. It's been a few years now, though. A good while.
DOCTOR: I understand. Grief can certainly affect many aspects of one’s health and memory. A few years, you say. And besides the feeling of fullness and difficulty keeping food down, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I get tired easier, I suppose. More tired than usual. And sometimes… a little queasy, even when I haven't eaten. Not dizzy, just… unsettled. Oh! And I haven't been… regular, if you know what I mean. Bowel movements, that is. They've been… infrequent. Does that make sense? I’m sorry if I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Ms. Kelder. It's helpful to have a complete picture. Fatigue, nausea even without eating, and changes in your bowel habits – specifically, infrequent movements. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… I… I suppose so. My clothes feel a little looser than they used to. But I haven't been weighing myself regularly. I used to, when I was younger, but… it just hasn't been a habit lately. I mostly just notice things don't fit quite the same. I don't know how much, exactly. It’s probably not a lot. I still eat, when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And to clarify, you’ve mentioned difficulty keeping food down and feeling full quickly. Is this with all foods, or are there specific things that seem to trigger it more?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. I think… it's worse with heavier foods. Like, a big pot roast or something rich and creamy. Lighter things… soup, toast… those stay down a little easier. But even those don't always sit right. It's just… unpredictable, really. And sometimes it doesn’t matter what I eat, it just comes up anyway. It’s very frustrating, honestly. It makes me not want to eat at all.
DOCTOR: I see. So, heavier, richer foods seem to exacerbate the symptoms, but it's not entirely predictable. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions that you're aware of, such as diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I had my gallbladder out years ago. A long time ago. And I've always had a little trouble with my blood pressure, it runs in the family. The doctor put me on a little pill for it, but I don't remember the name. I take it every day, though. Other than that… not really. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. I've been lucky. But I do remember being told, a while back, about something… something about a spot. On one of my scans, I think. But it didn’t seem serious then. I can't recall what they said, exactly. It was years ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. You had your gallbladder removed some time ago and are currently taking medication for high blood pressure—do you know the dosage of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I don’t, Doctor. I just take the little white pill every morning. My daughter used to refill it for me, but she moved away… And I don’t remember the doctor telling me the amount. I just take it like they told me to. I wish I was more helpful. I’m so sorry. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be. But about that spot… did they ever tell me what it was?
DOCTOR: We can certainly look into the medication dosage later. It’s important to know those details. As for the spot… I’ll need to review your previous scans to see what was documented. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. I take a calcium pill, I think. For my bones. And sometimes, when my joints are aching, I take something… an over-the-counter thing. It’s got glucosamine in it, I think. And… oh, yes! A little vitamin D. The doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. That's about it, I believe. I try to keep things simple. I don’t want to take a lot of pills, if I can help it. Is that okay, Doctor? Am I forgetting something?
DOCTOR: Alright, calcium, glucosamine, and Vitamin D. Now, Ms. Kelder, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. It will involve listening to your abdomen, palpating your stomach, and checking your reflexes. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle. My stomach’s been a little tender lately. And I get nervous around doctors, if I’m being honest. It reminds me of… well, never mind. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Please lie back on the examination table. I’m listening to your bowel sounds now. They seem… somewhat diminished. And I'm palpating your abdomen. There’s some mild tenderness in the epigastric region – that's the upper middle part of your stomach. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. Your reflexes are within normal limits. Overall, the physical exam is relatively unremarkable, aside from mild tenderness upon palpation of the upper abdomen and diminished bowel sounds. Now, given your symptoms and the physical findings, I think it’s prudent to order some laboratory tests and a diagnostic scan.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary. Will they be… painful? And what are you looking for, exactly? I don’t want to be a bother, but I just like to know what’s going on. I get anxious when I don’t understand things. It's probably silly of me. But… is it something serious, do you think? I just… my daughter always handled these things before… she was very good at it.
DOCTOR: No, the tests themselves shouldn’t be painful, Ms. Kelder. We’ll start with a complete blood count to check for anemia or infection, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a stool test to rule out any gastrointestinal issues. As for the scan, we’ll order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. This will give us a more detailed view of your organs and help us identify any potential abnormalities. It's difficult to say definitively whether it's something serious at this point. The symptoms you're experiencing could be caused by a variety of factors, ranging from relatively benign conditions like gastritis or a slow-digesting stomach to more concerning possibilities. The scan will help us rule out anything serious and determine the underlying cause. We’ll also check for any signs of malignancy, but that doesn’t mean that’s what we’re expecting. It’s simply a precaution. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Gastritis… malignancy… It all sounds very… frightening, Doctor. I… I don’t understand much of it, to be honest. My daughter always explained things so clearly. So, you’re just… checking to see if something is wrong? And the scan will show you what it is? Is it… expensive? I'm on a fixed income, you know. And Medicare… sometimes it doesn't cover everything. I don't want to be a burden. But... if it's serious, then I suppose I’ll have to figure something out. But… is it likely to be serious? I just… I just want to know. Even if it's bad news, I'd rather know. It's probably silly of me, but I've always been one to face things head-on.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kelder, it’s not silly at all to want to understand what’s going on. I understand your anxiety, and I'll do my best to explain everything clearly. The tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms, and while I can’t definitively say whether it’s serious at this point, we need to rule out any potential concerns. As for the cost, Medicare should cover the majority of the tests, but there may be some co-pays or deductibles. The billing department can provide you with a detailed estimate. I want to be clear: I am not suggesting that you have anything serious. However, given your symptoms – early satiety, nausea, changes in bowel habits, weight loss, and diminished bowel sounds – it’s important to investigate thoroughly. The scan is simply a precautionary measure. We'll start with the blood tests today, and schedule the CT scan as soon as possible. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them in detail and formulate a treatment plan. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers it, Doctor. Blood tests today, and a scan soon. And the billing department will help with the costs. Thank you. You’ve been very patient with me. I just… it’s hard, you know? Losing my husband, and now this… it all feels a bit overwhelming. I don't know what I'd do without Medicare, honestly. And my daughter… she's very busy with her own life. I don’t want to bother her with all this. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results, will you? Even if it's not good news. I'd rather know sooner than later. That’s all. I suppose I should get those blood tests done then. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kelder. The nurse will escort you to the lab right away. They’ll draw the necessary blood samples. Once those are completed, you’re free to go. We'll contact you as soon as the results are available, and schedule the CT scan at that time. Here’s the number for the billing department, should you have any questions. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. And rest assured, we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. The nurse is just outside the door. I’ll speak with you soon.
PATIENT: .
