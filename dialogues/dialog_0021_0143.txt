DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Verrall, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Smith Verrall. It's... nice to meet you, Doctor? I forget names easily, you see. Sorry about that.
DOCTOR: Havird. Doctor Havird. It's alright, people forget. Honestly, it's usually better that they do. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, um… it’s a bit… complicated. A friend suggested I come. Something about… getting ready? Before… well, before things happen. I'm not really sure what it’s all about, to be honest. Something about a baby, maybe? I just want to make sure everything is… okay. If that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A baby?
PATIENT: Yes. Or… the possibility of one. My friend, she thinks it's a good idea to… check things first. Before… trying. I don't really understand all the details. I'm a bit older, you see, and… well, things aren’t always what they used to be. I just want to be sure I'm… fit enough, if that makes sense. Is that what this is about? Making sure I can… you know?
DOCTOR: Right. So, you're thinking about starting a family, and you want a check-up to assess your overall health and… fertility?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Fertility… that’s the word. It feels strange to talk about it at my age, but yes. That's it. A check-up. To see if… if everything is still working. And if not… well, I guess I need to know that too. Is that… a lot to ask? I'm sorry, I don't mean to be difficult.
DOCTOR: No, it's not difficult. It’s just… unusual. Alright. Let's start with some basics. Have you ever been… investigated for fertility issues before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is the first time. I've… I've always just sort of assumed things would… happen if they were going to. I wasn’t really planning on… this, to be honest. It just… came up. And my friend, she said it was best to be safe. She's a very sensible woman. So, no, never investigated. Just… hoping for the best, really. Is there something wrong with asking about it at my age? I feel like I’m bothering you.
DOCTOR: It's not a bother, Mr. Verrall. It's just... the older one gets, the more things can affect these matters. Alright. Let's get some history. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And… I have a bit of trouble with my knees these days, but that’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing serious. Oh! And I had a bad flu last winter, but I recovered. Other than that… I don't really… I haven't been to a doctor in years, to be honest. Do you need me to remember anything specific? I’m terrible with dates and things.
DOCTOR: Appendix removed, knee trouble, flu last winter. Okay. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've taken… paracetamol for headaches, sometimes. And… I think I had an antibiotic once, a long time ago. But I didn't have any reaction to it, as far as I remember. I’m not a big fan of taking pills, so I usually try to avoid it if I can. Is that helpful? I’m trying to think, but my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Just… vitamins, sometimes. A multivitamin. Just to keep things… regular, you know? Nothing prescribed by a doctor. Just… over the counter. I try to eat well, but sometimes you need a little help. Do you want to know what brand I take? It's not important, probably. I’m just trying to answer your questions, I hope I’m not being a nuisance.
DOCTOR: No, the brand isn’t necessary. Okay. Let’s move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My father… he had heart problems. He died when I was young. And my mother… she had arthritis, I think. Badly, towards the end. And… I have an uncle, on my wife’s side, he had diabetes, but I don’t really know much about it. It was a long time ago. We didn’t see them much. Is that helpful? Family history… I never really paid much attention to it, to be honest. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm accessing your EHR information now. It seems there are minimal records available… typical for a rural clinic. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. Just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just… give me a moment. My knees aren’t what they used to be, you see. I’ll try my best. Is there anything specific you're looking for? I’m a bit nervous, I must admit. This is all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Just assessing your general mobility and looking for any obvious signs of discomfort. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. 148 over 92. A little elevated. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear, but breathing is a little labored. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Okay. Finally, I’m just going to palpate your abdomen. Soft, non-tender. No masses detected. Alright. Everything seems… reasonably normal, considering. But we need some blood work to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, that sounds sensible. Is the… murmur bad? My father had heart problems, you see. I’m getting a bit anxious now, to be honest. What does it mean? And… what kind of blood work do I need? Is it going to be painful? I don't like needles, you see. I’m sorry, I’m being a bit of a bother, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: The murmur is likely benign, Mr. Verrall. Many people have innocent heart murmurs. However, we need blood work to rule out anything more serious. We'll need a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a prostate-specific antigen test, given your age. It's standard procedure. And no, it won’t be overly painful. Just a quick prick. A small price to pay for peace of mind. I’ll write you a requisition. The lab is just down the hall. Do you need assistance getting there?
PATIENT: A requisition… yes, that sounds good. Down the hall… yes, I think I can manage. I’m… reasonably mobile. A prick… alright. I’ll try not to faint. Peace of mind… yes, that's what I want. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. I'm… just a bit worried, you see. About everything. Is there anything else I should be doing? Before… you know. Before trying? Any vitamins or… anything? I’m sorry to keep asking questions.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Verrall, you’re not a bother, but we need the blood work results first. Until then, there’s no point in speculating. For now, try to maintain a healthy diet, get regular exercise, and manage any stress you may be experiencing. Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. And… honestly, try not to worry too much until we have more information. I’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. Here. The lab technician will explain everything. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to see.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Healthy diet, exercise… avoid stress. Easier said than done, but I’ll try my best. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time. One more thing… if everything is okay with the blood work… what are the chances… at my age? It's a silly question, I know.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Verrall, I don’t deal in probabilities. It depends on a lot of factors, and frankly, your overall health. Let's get the results first, then we’ll talk about possibilities. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
