DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Or... is it Colt?
PATIENT: Colt. Just Colt is fine. And good morning to you too, Doctor… Galena, right? I remember you saying your name when the nurse called it. I have a good memory, you see. It's just… other things I seem to be forgetting lately. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Yes, Matthias Galena. It’s good to meet you, Colt. And don’t worry about the forgetting – it's perfectly alright. Lots of things can cause that. So, you said you’re here because of some memory issues?
PATIENT: Issues is putting it mildly. Episodes, I’d call them. Like… blank spots. Just… gone. And it’s not like I’m losing my keys, Doctor. This is… important things. Names of people I should remember. What day it is, sometimes. It’s unsettling, to say the least. My wife, Srey, she’s been very patient, but even she’s starting to get worried.
DOCTOR: I understand. Blank spots, forgetting important things... that is concerning, and it's good you're addressing it. And it's wise of Srey to encourage you to come in. Let’s try to get a better picture of what's going on. When did these episodes start?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It wasn’t sudden, not like a light switch. More like… a gradual dimming. Probably started… six, maybe eight months ago? At first it was just little things. Misplacing my tools – though I always know where my tools are! – or forgetting what I had for breakfast. But it’s gotten… worse. More frequent, and… bigger gaps. It’s hard to pinpoint an exact date, honestly. It just… crept up on me. Is that helpful? I try to be precise, but with this… it's difficult.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, actually. Gradual onset is important information. And it’s perfectly alright that pinpointing a date is difficult; memory issues can make that tough. So, roughly six to eight months ago, it started with small things and has progressed to bigger gaps. Are these gaps happening at specific times of day, or is it random?
PATIENT: Random, mostly. That’s the frustrating part. It’s not like it happens after lunch, or when I'm tired, or anything predictable like that. Sometimes it’s first thing in the morning, other times it's mid-afternoon when I’m working on a job. Just… pops up when it wants to, I suppose. Though, now that I think about it… it seems to happen more when I'm… stressed. A difficult tile job, a problem with a customer… those kinds of things. But even then, not always. It’s just… confusing. Honestly, Doctor, it’s enough to make a man crazy.
DOCTOR: I can understand how unsettling that would be, Colt. Stress seems to be a factor, but not consistently, which makes things trickier. Alright. Let's talk a little about the gaps themselves. When you have one of these episodes, what exactly do you experience?
PATIENT: Well… it's not like my mind just goes blank, exactly. It’s more like… a disconnection. I’m talking to someone, or working, and then… it's like a piece of tape over a part of my memory. I know something happened, I know I was doing something, but I can’t… access it. It’s very… frustrating. I feel… lost, I guess. And sometimes, I’ll ask Srey, and she’ll fill in the blanks, and I’ll think, “Oh, that’s what happened.” But I have no recollection of it myself. It's like watching a video of someone else’s life. Does that make sense? I’m not explaining this very well, am I? I’m usually quite articulate.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining it perfectly well, Colt. “A piece of tape over a memory,” that’s a very good way to describe it. And the feeling of watching a video… I understand completely. It sounds like you're experiencing some degree of amnesia, and it's good you have Srey to help fill in the gaps. Now, let’s move on to some other things. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Not really… not anything obvious. I haven’t been dizzy or had any headaches. I sleep alright, though I do wake up a couple times a night, but that's just getting old, I figure. I've been a little more irritable, maybe. Snapping at Srey more than usual, which I feel terrible about. But she says it’s probably just the stress of this whole… situation. I haven't noticed any weakness or changes in my vision or anything like that. Just… the memory thing, and the irritability, I suppose. Though, honestly, who wouldn’t be irritable in this situation? It’s very unnerving, Doctor. It really is.
DOCTOR: Alright, no dizziness, headaches, or significant physical symptoms. Increased irritability, likely related to the stress. That’s good to know. Now, a bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my prostate looked at a few years back, a common thing for a man my age, I understand. Nothing serious came of it. And I broke my wrist when I was younger, falling off a motorbike, but that healed properly. Aside from that, I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. I eat reasonably well, though Srey always says I could eat more vegetables. I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. No smoking. I take a few vitamins, a multi-vitamin and something for my joints. Other than that… no. Nothing major. I’ve always been a strong man, you see. Always kept active. This whole thing is… unexpected. I’ve never been one to complain of aches and pains, so this is… new territory for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so prostate check a few years ago, no complications. Broken wrist in the past, healed well. Otherwise, generally healthy, good diet, minimal alcohol, no smoking, multi-vitamin and joint supplement. Alright. Any family history of memory problems, dementia, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Now, let me think. My mother… she got a little confused towards the end of her life, but we just put it down to old age, you see? She wasn’t particularly sharp anyway. And my father… he was a very practical man, not one for remembering dates or names. He was always perfectly functional, though. As far as I know, no one in the family had… what do you call it? Dementia? Or Alzheimer’s? No, I don’t think so. Though, honestly, my family doesn’t talk much about these things. It’s considered… impolite, I suppose. So, I can’t say for certain. But no, as far as I’m aware, no history of significant memory problems. Though my aunt, on my mother’s side… she was a bit eccentric, always forgetting where she put her things, but that was just her personality, you see? A bit of a scatterbrain. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Colt, even the details about personality. A family history of some degree of forgetfulness, but no confirmed dementia or Alzheimer's. Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just the vitamins I mentioned, Doctor. A multi-vitamin and something for my joints, glucosamine and chondroitin, I think it’s called. Srey buys them for me, so I don’t pay much attention to the specifics. No prescription medications, no. I pride myself on being a healthy man, not reliant on pills and potions. That’s why this whole thing is so… unsettling. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, haven’t started any new medications or anything like that. It just… came on gradually, as I said. It’s… worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright, Colt. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It's routine, and might help us narrow things down. Can you follow me into the exam room?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Lead the way, Doctor. I’m ready whenever you are. Though I do warn you, I haven't been this thoroughly examined in years. Srey is usually the one who insists on these things, and even then, it's just a quick check of my blood pressure. I hope I don't disappoint. I always considered myself a rather robust specimen, all things considered. But I understand it’s necessary, and I’m willing to do whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just have a seat here on the exam table, and we'll get started. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Right then. As you wish, Doctor. I haven’t been on one of these tables in… well, a very long time. I trust you'll be gentle? I’m not as nimble as I used to be. And please, don’t be alarmed if you hear a little creaking. It’s just my joints. They aren’t what they used to be, you see. But I assure you, my heart is still strong. A strong heart, and a clear conscience, that’s what I always tell Srey. Though I suppose a clear conscience doesn’t help much with memory problems, does it?
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is a bit elevated but not overly concerning. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Could you please extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: As you wish, Doctor. A little stiff, mind you. Years of working with tile, you see. It’s hard work on the knees and legs. Not what they used to be. But they still get me around, thankfully. Srey says I walk with a bit of a limp, but I don’t notice it myself. Are you looking for anything in particular? I always thought reflexes were for youngsters, not old men like me. Though I suppose it’s good to check everything, just to be safe. Just let me know if it’s going to sting. I have a rather low tolerance for pain these days.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… slightly diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, let's check your cranial nerves. I’m just going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don't blink, if you can help it. Look to your right… now look to your left… good. Now, I’d like to check your speech. Can you repeat this phrase for me: “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can do that. It’s a bit of a mouthful, isn’t it? Always thought that phrase was rather silly. “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.” Perfectly. Though I haven't said that in… well, I can't even remember the last time. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. But I assure you, I can still speak clearly. And I can still understand everything you’re saying. Though I may need you to repeat it sometimes. Just to be sure, you understand? It's not a reflection on your speech, of course. It's just… this whole thing has me a bit rattled. Are you satisfied with my speech? Is it clear enough? I can try again if you’d like.
DOCTOR: Yes, your speech is perfectly clear. Excellent. Now, a final check. Can you tell me the current year?
PATIENT: The current year…? Hmm. That's a… trick question, isn't it? Is it not 2024? I always get the years muddled, you see. Srey keeps telling me. But I believe it's 2024. No, wait… 2025? Is it 2025? Oh dear. It’s August, isn’t it? That helps a little. But the year… it escapes me. I apologize, Doctor. I'm usually quite sharp. But this whole situation… it’s playing havoc with my mind. I know it’s something… five. Is it 2025? I really can't be certain.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Colt. It's August 2nd, 2025. No need to apologize. Now, let's discuss the next steps. Based on what you've told me, and the brief exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some cognitive impairment. It could be due to a number of factors, ranging from stress and mild forgetfulness, to something more significant. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work, just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And I think it would be beneficial to get a cognitive assessment, to evaluate your memory and thinking skills in more detail. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… a cognitive assessment… Yes, yes, I suppose that’s… sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Though frankly, I suspect I know what you’ll find. It’s not a pleasant thought, but I’d rather know the truth, whatever it may be. Srey will be relieved, I think. She’s been worried sick. So, yes. Order whatever tests you deem necessary. I just… hope it’s not something too serious. And I hope it’s not something that will… change things too much. But I’m willing to do whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. Just please, keep me informed. I don’t like being kept in the dark. And please, explain everything in plain language. I don’t understand all the medical jargon. Are you certain these tests won’t be too… invasive? I’m not a fan of needles.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Colt. The blood work is very routine – just a small sample taken from your arm. And the cognitive assessment is non-invasive – it involves a series of simple questions and tasks to evaluate your memory and thinking. Nothing to worry about at all. I'll explain everything in plain language, and I’ll keep you informed every step of the way. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and then we’ll schedule you for the cognitive assessment next week. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Let's get it over with. The sooner we know, the sooner we can… deal with it. Yes, next week is fine. Anything to get this… uncertainty out of the way. Please, just be gentle with the needle. And try not to take too much blood. I’m a bit of a faint heart, you see. And I don’t want to cause too much of a fuss. I trust your nurse is competent? I’ve always had a bit of a… fear of hospitals. But I suppose I can manage. Just let me know when you’re ready. And please, explain everything again before you start. I like to be prepared. Thank you, Doctor. For your patience, and your kindness. It means a lot. Now, let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Colt. I'll speak with the nurse and ensure everything is explained thoroughly. I'll be right back. And don’t worry, we'll take it one step at a time.
