DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um... well, my tummy feels... big. And I don't want to eat much anymore. It's just... not feeling right, you know? I don't remember when it started, exactly. A little bit at a time, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. Your tummy feels full and you’ve noticed a decrease in your appetite. And it’s been happening gradually, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, gradually. Like... a balloon, maybe? Filling up slow. I used to love my soups, you know. Big bowls of borscht. Now… not so much. It just doesn't taste good anymore, and makes my tummy feel worse. Though, maybe it is the soup? I don’t know anymore. Everything feels a bit mixed up these days.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you've noticed a change in your enjoyment of foods you used to like, specifically your borscht, and that’s accompanied by some discomfort. That's helpful to know. When you say "discomfort", can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Oh, um... it's not really pain, not sharp. More… heavy? Like someone put a rock in there. And sometimes… bubbly? It feels like bubbles moving around. I don’t know if that makes sense. Old lady problems, probably. I get things all mixed up, you know. What year is it again?
DOCTOR: It is 2025, Soila. And it absolutely makes sense. There's no shame in feeling confused at times. It's perfectly alright to ask. Now, regarding the heaviness and bubbles… does this feeling come after you eat, or is it there even when you haven’t eaten for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, 2025! So it has been a while... Yes. Um… it’s there mostly after I eat. Not right during, but maybe an hour later? It just… gets bigger. And heavier. Sometimes I have to lie down. My daughter, she worries, you know. Always asking if I'm okay. She makes good kasha, though. But even that… doesn't feel good these days. Is this something bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like the discomfort develops an hour or so after eating and is becoming more noticeable. You're right to ask if it's something to worry about, and that's why you're here, and I'm glad you came in. To get a better understanding, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, um… other symptoms? Let me think… I get tired very easily now. Used to be able to garden all day, you know. Now, just a little bit and I have to sit down. And… sometimes I feel a bit… dizzy? But that might be my blood pressure. The nurse checked it last time, said it was a little low. I forget what she said exactly. Everything is a bit… foggy. I’ve also been going to the bathroom more, but that's probably just old age, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, some dizziness, and increased frequency of urination. You're right, those symptoms can have many causes, and it’s good we are exploring them. Your nurse mentioned low blood pressure, which can definitely contribute to dizziness. Now, regarding the increased urination, is that happening during the day, at night, or both?
PATIENT: Oh, both, I think. Mostly at night, though. I have to get up… two, maybe three times? It’s a bother, you know. And it makes me tired, of course. My daughter says I shouldn't drink so much tea before bed, but I like my tea! It’s chamomile, though. Supposed to be calming. But it doesn't seem to be helping much with the… everything. Everything feels a bit… wobbly. Like an old building, maybe? Is that a silly thing to say, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Soila. An old building is a very good way to describe it. We’re gathering a lot of good information here. So, increased urination both day and night, with it being more frequent at night, despite drinking chamomile tea. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Doctor said my heart was a little… big, a long time ago. But that was years and years ago. And something about my… cholesterol? It was high. But I don’t really remember what that means. They gave me pills, but I stopped taking them. They didn't seem to do much, and I didn't like how they made me feel. I don't have… what do you call it… the sugar sickness? My sister had that. But I don’t think I do. Everything is just… a jumble, you know? I have trouble remembering things. Especially names and… pills. What was I saying?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Soila. It's very common to have trouble remembering things, and we can take our time. So, a history of an enlarged heart, high cholesterol, and you’ve ruled out diabetes. You stopped taking the cholesterol medication due to side effects, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The pills… they made me feel strange. Fuzzy. And I didn’t really see a difference, so I stopped. My daughter, she gets upset. She says I need to take my medicine. But… I just don't like it. And everything feels so… mixed up, like I said. I don't even remember what year I started gardening! It's a shame, really. I used to have such a beautiful garden. Tomatoes, cucumbers… everything. Now… I just feel tired. And… wobbly. And my tummy feels like a balloon. Is this going to get worse, Doctor? Will I have to go to the hospital? I don't like hospitals.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re concerned about this getting worse and the possibility of needing to go to the hospital, and it's good you're sharing your concerns with me. We’ll work together to figure out what's going on and what the best course of action is. Before we move on, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, even over-the-counter ones, or any supplements you might be using?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Just the chamomile tea, I think. Sometimes I take a little something for my… aches and pains. But just when they’re really bad. It's an over-the-counter one, the kind you get at the drugstore. Ibuprofen, I think? But not every day. And… sometimes a little something for my… nerves. My daughter brings it. It's a small white pill, but I don't remember the name. She says it helps me sleep. But… everything is so blurry, Doctor. It's hard to keep track. I just want to feel better. And not have my tummy feel like a balloon. It’s a silly worry, I suppose. But it’s making me very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: It's not a silly worry at all, Soila. Your comfort is the most important thing. So, you take chamomile tea, ibuprofen occasionally for aches and pains, and a small white pill for sleep that your daughter provides. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itch sometimes, but nothing serious. I used to love cats, but I can’t have them anymore because I get a bit… sniffly. But that’s not really an allergy, is it? Just a bit of a runny nose. My daughter says I’m sensitive to dust, but I don’t really notice it. Everything is just… a bit fuzzy, you know? I just want to feel like myself again. And not have to worry about my tummy. And not have to remember so many pills! It’s exhausting. Is this going to take a long time, Doctor? I don’t have much energy these days.
DOCTOR: No, it’s alright. It's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. So, no known drug allergies, and a sensitivity to cats and perhaps some dust. Now, to get a better picture of what's going on, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? What does that involve? Will it hurt? I don't like being poked and prodded. My bones are a bit… creaky, you know. And I’m a bit sensitive. Is it very long? I don’t have a lot of… patience these days. My daughter says I get easily flustered. But I want to feel better. If it will help, I suppose I can… try. But please be gentle. And not too much poking. Is that alright, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. Absolutely. It will be very gentle, I promise. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen to see if anything feels unusual, checking your reflexes, and taking your blood pressure. It shouldn't hurt at all, and we'll take it at your pace. We can stop at any time if you’re feeling uncomfortable. It will probably take about 10-15 minutes. Would you like me to explain anything further before we begin?
PATIENT: Oh… 10-15 minutes. That doesn’t sound too bad. Listening to my heart… I had that done before. And feeling my tummy… I suppose that’s alright. I don’t like the idea of someone poking around, but if it will help… alright. But please be gentle. And tell me if you find anything unusual. I don’t like surprises. And… can I lie down? My back is a bit… achy today. Is that alright, Doctor? I just want to feel better. And not have my tummy feel like a balloon. It’s a silly worry, I know. But it’s making me very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. We can absolutely have you lie down. That will be much more comfortable. And I will explain everything as I go, and let you know if I find anything unusual. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds a bit… regular, but a little bit distant. I’m also hearing some slightly diminished breath sounds on both sides of your lungs. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender or uncomfortable. Your abdomen is… soft, but there is some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, towards the left side. And I do feel a slight fullness. It’s not anything alarming, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Now, I'll check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh… reflexes? What does that involve? Will you hit my knees with something? I don’t like being hit. My bones are a bit… fragile these days. And I get easily flustered. Is it very long? My tummy feels a bit… funny now. Is that normal? I just want to feel better. And not have my tummy feel like a balloon. It’s a silly worry, I know. But it’s making me very uncomfortable. And… can I have a glass of water? My mouth is a bit dry. Is that alright, Doctor? I just want to feel better. And not have to worry about everything.
DOCTOR: No, I absolutely won't hit your knees! That’s a common misconception. Checking your reflexes involves lightly tapping your tendons with a small hammer. It helps me assess your nerve function. It shouldn’t be painful at all. We can skip that part if you’re uncomfortable. I also understand your mouth is dry, and I will get you a glass of water right away. While we wait for the water, let's talk about your symptoms again. You mentioned fatigue, decreased appetite, dizziness, increased urination, and a fullness in your abdomen. You also mentioned feeling “wobbly” and like your tummy feels like a balloon. And you've been having trouble with your memory. Is that all correct?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, that’s all correct. Fatigue, no appetite, dizziness… the wobbly feeling… and the tummy. Like a balloon. And the… fuzziness. It’s like… everything is a bit blurry. And I keep forgetting things. My daughter gets upset. She says I need to remember my pills. But I just… can’t. It’s exhausting. And my back is a bit achy today. Is it something serious, Doctor? Will I have to go to the hospital? I don’t like hospitals. It’s a silly worry, I know. But I just want to feel better. And not have to worry about everything. And… is it my age? Is this just… old age? Is that what's happening?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Soila, and it’s perfectly okay to ask those questions. It's not silly at all. Let me assure you, we're going to investigate this thoroughly and figure out what’s going on. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The fullness in your abdomen, combined with the decreased appetite and fatigue, could indicate a few different things. It could be related to your age, but it's important to rule out other causes. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests and a urine test. These tests will help us check for any underlying infections, vitamin deficiencies, or other medical conditions. I would also recommend an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your organs. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh… blood tests? And a… what did you call it? An ultra… sound? Will it hurt? I don’t like needles. And I don’t like being poked and prodded. My bones are a bit… fragile, you know. And I get easily flustered. Is it very long? My daughter always says I need to get tests done, but I just… don’t like them. Is it something serious, Doctor? Will I have to go to the hospital? I don’t like hospitals. It’s a silly worry, I know. But I just want to feel better. And not have to worry about everything. And… can I have my daughter with me? She’s good at… asking questions. I forget things easily. Is that alright, Doctor? I just want to feel better. And not have to worry about everything.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be anxious, Soila. It's understandable to not like needles or tests. Let me explain everything carefully. The blood test involves taking a small sample of blood from your arm. It will be a quick pinch, and it shouldn’t take long at all. The ultrasound is a painless procedure where we use sound waves to create an image of your organs. It won’t involve any needles or poking. It’s completely safe. Having your daughter with you is absolutely fine, and I encourage it! She can definitely help ask questions and provide support. Based on the initial assessment, I don’t believe this is necessarily something serious, but we need to rule out certain conditions to be sure. The tests will help us get a clearer picture and make the right decision. We will start with the tests and then go from there. I want to reassure you that going to the hospital is not our primary goal right now. Let's take things one step at a time. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… one step at a time. That sounds… good. Yes, please. Explain the tests. What are you looking for? And… will it hurt? My bones are a bit… fragile, you know. And I get easily flustered. And what if… what if it’s something bad? My daughter… she worries so much. She’s a good girl, but she worries. And I just want to feel better. And not have to worry about everything. And… can I have a glass of water? My mouth is a bit dry. Is that alright, Doctor? I just want to feel better. And not have to worry about everything. And… can my daughter be here when you do the tests? She’s good at… remembering things. I forget things easily. Is that alright, Doctor? I just want to feel better. And not have to worry about everything.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. One step at a time, exactly. And your daughter can absolutely be here during the tests. Having her with you will be very helpful. Now, let's talk about the tests. The blood test will check for things like infection, inflammation, vitamin deficiencies , and kidney and liver function. It will also help us rule out things like anemia . The ultrasound will allow us to visualize your organs, including your liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen. We will look for any abnormalities in their size, shape, or structure. The tests are not meant to scare you, but to give us more information. The blood test will involve a small pinch, and it will only take a few minutes. The ultrasound is completely painless. The technician will apply a gel to your abdomen and use a handheld device to create the images. I want to reassure you that we’re doing this to figure out what's going on and get you back to feeling better. We will discuss the results with you in detail, and then we will create a plan that’s right for you. Do you have any questions about the tests right now?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I don’t think so. Not right now. Everything sounds… a bit complicated. But… if it will help, I suppose I can… try. But please be gentle. My bones are a bit… fragile, you know. And I get easily flustered. And… can my daughter come with me when I do the tests? She’s good at… asking questions. I forget things easily. And… can you explain the results to both of us? She’s good at… remembering things. I forget things easily. And… will it hurt? My bones are a bit… fragile, you know. And… can I have a glass of water? My mouth is a bit dry. Is that alright, Doctor? I just want to feel better. And not have to worry about everything. And… is it my age? Is this just… old age? Is that what's happening? Oh… everything is just so… blurry.
DOCTOR: Yes, Soila. Absolutely. We will do everything gently. And your daughter can absolutely come with you when you do the tests, and I will explain the results to both of you. We will take all the time you need to understand everything. And yes, I will make sure we explain everything clearly, and we will address all your concerns. Regarding your question about age, it is possible that some of these symptoms are related to aging. However, it is important to rule out other potential causes to ensure we are providing you with the best possible care. Here is some water for you, Soila. Please drink as much as you need. Now, let's focus on getting you comfortable, and then we will discuss the logistics of scheduling the tests. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you. That’s… good. No, I don’t think so. Not right now. Everything sounds… complicated. But… if it will help, I suppose I can… try. But please be gentle. My bones are a bit… fragile, you know. And I get easily flustered. And… can my daughter come with me when I do the tests? She’s good at… asking questions. I forget things easily. And… will it hurt? My bones are a bit… fragile, you know. And… can I have a glass of water? My mouth is a bit dry. Is that alright, Doctor? I just want to feel better. And not have to worry about everything. And… is it my age? Is this just… old age? Is that what's happening? Oh… everything is just so… blurry. I think… I think that’s all for now. I just want to feel better. And not have to worry about everything.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Soila. We will take things at your pace. And we will make sure you feel comfortable and supported throughout the entire process. Remember, we are here to help you feel better, and we will do everything we can to figure out what's going on and get you back to feeling like yourself. I'll have the nurse schedule the tests for you and your daughter. And I will see you both again soon to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Thank you for coming in today, Soila. And please, try not to worry. We are here to help.
