DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. It's about my foot. This awful sore. It just won't go away. And frankly, I've seen better care in my time. I’m Louine, by the way. Cannington. Though I suspect you already know that, looking at your chart.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Cannington, I do have your information here. It’s good to meet you. A sore on your foot, you say?
PATIENT: Good to meet me? I’ve been coming to doctors in this town for…well, a very long time. It’s good to finally have someone who seems…thorough, I suppose. But this sore…it's on my heel, and it’s painful. Especially when I try to walk. And it’s been weeks. Weeks, I tell you! I keep it clean, but it just gets worse. Do you even see how red it is?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Let me take a look. Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. At least three weeks. Maybe four. It started as a little blister, you know, from my sandals. But then it just…opened up. And now it's this mess. Honestly, I’ve put better dressings on cuts from falling coconuts.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It is quite inflamed. And it appears…deep. Have you noticed any pus or drainage?
PATIENT: Pus? Goodness, no. I'm not a savage. I keep it very clean, like I said. Though it does…weep a little. A little bit of clear fluid. And sometimes…it smells a bit. Not terrible, but…noticeable. Though I wouldn’t expect you to notice, with all the…fragrances people wear these days. It’s probably just from the ointment I’ve been using. Some old remedy my cousin gave me.
DOCTOR: An old remedy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! From my cousin Lani. She used to be a nurse’s aide, very sensible woman. It’s made with coconut oil and…some leaves. Papaya leaves, I think. And a little bit of turmeric. She swears by it for everything. Though, admittedly, it hasn't done much for this. Perhaps it's not strong enough. Or maybe… maybe the wound is just…stubborn. Do you have any ideas? You are the doctor, after all.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Cannington, while I appreciate your cousin’s…resourcefulness, these home remedies aren’t always the most effective, and can sometimes even worsen an infection. We need to determine the cause of this wound. It could be a simple abrasion, but given the length of time and your description, we need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: An infection? Honestly. I've lived a long life, young lady. I’ve seen plenty of scrapes and bruises. I know the difference between a bit of soreness and a proper infection. And I keep everything scrupulously clean. You’re making me sound like some…careless child. I suppose you’ll want to poke and prod at it now? Get on with it, then. But I warn you, I have a low tolerance for discomfort.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Cannington. I'm going to gently examine the wound and I’ll need to ask you a few questions while I do. It will be necessary to assess the depth and extent of the tissue damage. And please, try to relax. Does this cause you any pain?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, it stings. Don’t be so rough! Honestly, you're practically digging into my bone. And what do you mean, "assess the tissue damage"? It's a sore, not a battlefield injury. I've had less painful dental work, I assure you. Now, are you going to tell me what's causing this, or just poke at it indefinitely? I haven't got all day, you know. There’s a bingo game starting at three.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I assure you, I am being as gentle as possible. We need to determine if there is any deeper tissue involvement. And while I understand your eagerness to attend your bingo game, rushing this assessment is not in your best interest. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or redness spreading from the wound itself?
PATIENT: Fever? Chills? Goodness, no. I’m a Marshallese woman. We don’t succumb to every little sniffle. And no, the redness hasn’t spread. It’s just…red. Around the sore. Like any sore would be. Honestly, you're asking the most ridiculous questions. It’s a sore on my foot! Not some exotic illness. I swear, young doctors these days… all theory and no common sense. And bingo is important. It’s a social event. A crucial part of my week.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I understand your frustration. However, it is my responsibility to rule out potential complications, even if it seems unlikely. Given the duration of the wound and your description, we should consider the possibility of a localized infection, even a mild one. To be certain, I’d like to order a simple wound culture. It will help us identify if any bacteria are present and guide appropriate treatment. It's a quick procedure. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: A culture? You want to send part of my foot off to a laboratory? Absolutely not! What if it comes back with something… dreadful? I’ve heard stories, you know. About people losing limbs. And all for a little sore. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. I came here for a simple bandage, not a scientific experiment. Just put some ointment on it and wrap it up. Like my cousin Lani would. I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself. I’ve been doing it for eighty-nine years. You’re wasting my time and, frankly, upsetting me. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I understand your apprehension. However, without a proper assessment, I cannot guarantee appropriate treatment. While I respect your experience, I am obligated to provide the best possible care, and that includes ruling out potential complications. Given your refusal of a wound culture and your expressed desire for immediate treatment without further investigation, I can apply a topical antibiotic ointment and provide a sterile bandage. However, I strongly advise you to monitor the wound closely for any signs of worsening infection – increased pain, redness, swelling, pus, or fever – and seek immediate medical attention if these develop. Do you understand these instructions?
