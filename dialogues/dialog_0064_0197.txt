DOCTOR: Good morning, San. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Smetak. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I need to get a card… a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. I drive for a few apps, you know, just part-time. I need to keep everything legal. Hopefully this is all I need.
DOCTOR: Right, a medical certification for commercial driving… yes, I understand. That's perfectly alright. It’s good you're being proactive about that. Just to be clear, and to make sure I have everything correct for the form, is this specifically for ride-sharing, like Uber or Lyft?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Uber and Lyft, mostly. Sometimes I do deliveries too, but it's the ride-sharing that needs the card, I believe. My daughter helped me look up what I needed online, and that’s what she said. I don’t really understand all the rules myself, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Uber and Lyft… that’s helpful. Your daughter sounds like a good resource! It can be a bit confusing, those regulations. To get started, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Oh, it is. She’s very good with computers. As for my health… well, I'm seventy, so things aren't perfect! I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, makes gripping things sometimes difficult. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, I wear glasses. Otherwise, I think I’m okay. No big problems, thankfully. I try to stay active, you know? Walk when I can.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you're staying active. Arthritis in the hands and some vision changes… alright. And just to be thorough, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes. I was diagnosed a few years ago, but it’s controlled with medication. I take a little pill every morning. Nothing else, I don’t think. The doctor checks it regularly. Oh, and I had a bad bout of pneumonia last winter, but I recovered fully. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all important information, thank you. The high blood pressure, even if controlled, is definitely something we need to document. And the pneumonia – good to know you recovered fully, but it's still relevant history. Could you tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have the bottle right here. It's… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams. I take one every morning with my breakfast. I haven’t missed a dose in a long time, I promise you!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 20mg daily. That's very good, consistency is important. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, San?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Nothing I’m aware of, anyway. I eat everything. I've never had a reaction to anything, not that I remember. My daughter always asks me that too, but no, I’m not allergic to anything. Unless you count dust, but that’s just a little sneezing.
DOCTOR: Dust doesn’t usually concern us medically! Alright, no known allergies. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. A long time ago, when I was still living in Japan. And… oh, I had a knee replacement about ten years ago. That was a bit rough, but it healed well. Other than those two, nothing else. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a knee replacement. That’s helpful. And thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear… my mother had diabetes, yes. She had it for many years. And my father… he had heart problems. He had a stroke, actually. And my older brother, he had cancer, but that was a long time ago. It runs in the family, unfortunately. Mostly on my mother’s side. It’s worrying, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is concerning when there’s a family history of those conditions. It’s good you’re aware of it, though. We'll keep that in mind. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I don't smoke, never have. And I only drink a little bit of sake sometimes, with dinner. Mostly water. I try to eat healthy, lots of fish and vegetables. I'm retired now, so I mostly just take care of my house and garden. I like to walk, when the weather is nice. Nothing too exciting. I'm a simple woman.
DOCTOR: That sounds very healthy, San. No smoking, minimal alcohol, good diet, and regular activity – that’s excellent. Now, just one final quick question about your medications: besides the Lisinopril, are you taking anything else, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! I take a Vitamin D supplement, the doctor said my levels were a little low. And sometimes, when my arthritis is acting up, I take ibuprofen. Just the over-the-counter kind. Nothing else. That's it, I promise. I don't like taking too many pills!
DOCTOR: Alright, Vitamin D and occasional ibuprofen. That’s good to know. Okay, San, that gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam just to make sure everything looks okay. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That's fine. Whatever you need to do. I want to make sure I’m safe to drive, you know? Just tell me what you need me to do. I’m ready when you are. Let's get this over with quickly, if that's alright. I have some groceries to get later.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Now, let's just check your reflexes quickly.
PATIENT: Okay, reflexes. I always worry about those. I’m not very good at those tests, if you don't mind. Just try your best. I hope I can pass. It's just the knees, right? I think they get a bit stiff sometimes.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry about it at all, San. It's just a quick check. We’re not grading you! We’re just making sure everything is functioning as it should. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Good. Now, let’s just take a quick look at your vision. Can you read this chart for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay, a vision test. Oh dear, this is small! …E… H… P… Uh… T… F… … V… Is that correct? It's a bit blurry. I do wear my glasses, you know. I should have put them on. This is probably terrible.
DOCTOR: It's alright, San. That’s why we’re doing the test. And it's good you mentioned your glasses. Vision is 20/30 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye without correction. Now, just one final quick thing. Could you please grip my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, I'll try. Is that alright? It’s a bit hard with the arthritis. Sometimes my hands get really stiff and it hurts to squeeze. I don’t want to hurt myself. It's probably not very strong.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, San. I can see that your arthritis is affecting your grip. Alright, San. Based on this brief exam, you appear to be in generally good health for your age. Your heart and lungs sound clear, your blood pressure is well-controlled, and your reflexes are normal. However, your vision is slightly impaired without glasses, and your grip strength is somewhat reduced due to your arthritis. These are things we need to take into account. Do you always wear your glasses when driving?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, always. I wouldn't dream of driving without them. My daughter reminds me every time I get in the car. She worries about me, you know. I listen to her. I understand the importance of clear vision when driving. I wouldn’t put anyone in danger. Is that going to be a problem? Do I need to get a special test or something?
DOCTOR: No, San, it's not going to be a problem. As long as you consistently wear your glasses when driving, your vision should be adequate. And regarding your arthritis, as long as it doesn’t significantly impact your ability to control the vehicle safely, it shouldn't be an issue. However, to be thorough, and to fulfill the requirements for the medical certification, I would recommend a brief consultation with an ophthalmologist to confirm your visual acuity with correction. And perhaps a referral to an occupational therapist for suggestions on managing your arthritis and maintaining a safe grip on the steering wheel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. An eye doctor and someone to help with my hands. I can do that. I want to be safe, and I want to be legal, you know? My daughter will be glad to hear it. Can you write down the names of someone you recommend? I'm not very good at finding these things online myself. And… will I get the card today?
DOCTOR: Certainly, San. Here are the names of a couple of excellent ophthalmologists and occupational therapists in the area. As for the medical card… unfortunately, I cannot issue the card myself. The certification process requires a specific form to be completed and submitted to the Department of Motor Vehicles. I will complete my portion of the form today, based on my examination and recommendations. You will then need to submit the completed form to the DMV yourself. It's a relatively simple process, and they have instructions available on their website. I'll also send a note to your primary care physician informing them of my findings and recommendations. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. A lot of paperwork, but good. I appreciate you writing everything down for me. And letting my doctor know. My daughter will help me with the DMV stuff, I’m sure. She’s very organized. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient. I feel much better now. Hopefully, this will all work out. I just want to keep driving. It keeps me… busy. I think that's everything? Are you sure you don't need anything else?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. I’m glad I could help. No, I think we’ve covered everything for today. Just remember to schedule appointments with the ophthalmologist and occupational therapist as soon as possible. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office. It was a pleasure meeting you, San. Drive safely, and enjoy your day.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. I will. And thank you again for everything. Goodbye.
